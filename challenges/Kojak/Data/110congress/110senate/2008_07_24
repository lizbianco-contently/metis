Mr. President, it appears that our Republican colleagues \nthink they finally found a way. They think, with Americans from coast \nto coast facing huge gas prices, up to $4.70 a gallon in some places, \nthey can score some easy political points off the energy crisis. They \nsay that all we need to do is open our coasts for oil companies to \ndrill and gas prices will go down. I should say that is what they did \nsay. Now they say that is not enough. They say the energy crisis is so \nimportant that the Senate should stay on the issue and do nothing else \nuntil this problem is solved. We all know actions speak louder than \nwords, and the Republican rhetoric has no basis in reality.\n  This is not the first time Democrats have tried to address energy. We \nhave tried on many other occasions. We have worked to try to lower gas \nprices before this latest energy crisis hit. In fact, Democrats have \nproposed plans to lower gas prices six times in the past few weeks. Six \ntimes, Republicans have blocked us, just as they are blocking us now on \nthe speculation legislation. What has happened over those weeks? Gas \nprices have broken one record after another.\n  Democrats proposed legislation to extend tax credits for innovators \nwho are researching and producing clean, renewable energy to decrease \nour consumption of oil. Republicans said no. Democrats proposed \nlegislation to roll back tax breaks on the oil companies--remember, \nlast year they made $250 billion, oil companies that are making record \nprofits while we pay record prices--and invest that money in renewable \nenergy. But the Republicans said no. Democrats proposed a cap-and-trade \nsystem that would address global warming and provide billions of \ndollars of alternative energy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. \nRepublicans said no. Democrats proposed legislation to protect \nconsumers from price gouging of already record-high prices. \nRepublicans, of course, said no, because this would have been an \nopportunity to have the oil companies pay back some of the obscene \nprofits they are making. Democrats proposed a renewable electricity \nstandard which would save consumers billions of dollars through energy \nsavings. Republicans said no. Democrats proposed legislation to go \nafter OPEC for collusion and price fixing. But the Republicans said no. \nDemocrats proposed legislation that would curb the excessive \nspeculation of Wall Street traders who artificially bid up the price we \npay at the pump. Republicans said no. Democrats proposed improvements \nto the LIHEAP program which helps senior citizens and the disabled with \nassistance to pay the cost of heating and cooling their homes. \nRepublicans said no. Democrats even offered the one thing they have \nbeen talking about: drilling. Let's vote on drilling. But the \nRepublicans said no. They didn't take our offer, yet they claim it is \nthe panacea for the problems facing America today. They said no.\n\n  The game they seem to be playing is this: Make the American people \nthink they are willing to grind the Senate to a halt to deal with gas \nprices. The American people obviously can see the record.\n  Republicans are having trouble finding out what they really want. \nYesterday, out of the blue, came a new one. After all these years, they \ndecided they wanted to drill in ANWR again, even though their \nPresidential nominee, John McCain, has said no on the drilling they \nhave said they want to do. Maybe the one reason they have been a little \nhesitant is because their Presidential nominee, John McCain, has said \nit is only psychological; it is not going to help anything.\n  The American people can see the record. We have tried. Democrats have \noffered a comprehensive set of solutions for the short- and long-term, \nand Republicans have offered nothing but talk. They have talked more \nabout drilling. What they don't say is that their drilling bill \nwouldn't put a drop of oil in the marketplace for at least 12 to 15 \nyears. Even the Republican nominee for President, John McCain, has \ncalled the Republican drilling plan purely psychological. Democrats \nbelieve in increased domestic production through responsible drilling, \nbut the American people deserve solutions a lot quicker than 12 to 15 \nyears.\n  If Republicans truly believe their drilling legislation would solve \nthe problem, why would they say no to an offer to have a vote on it? It \ndoesn't add up. Or maybe it does add up.\n  Fortunately, the American people are seeing clearly exactly what is \ngoing on. That is why a moderate columnist like David Broder today said \nthat he has never seen a worse month for a Presidential candidate than \nwhat we have seen with John McCain this past month.\n  It appears there is a lot of desperation going on here. While the \nRepublicans keep talking--we have three filibusters going on as we \nspeak--Democrats are trying to address a critical problem the American \npeople are facing every day. Republican strategists have called the \ndisingenuous Republican strategy a Hail Mary for the fall elections. \nPerhaps a 2-year Republican strategy of nonstop delay, obstruction, and \nslow-walking has put them in such electoral peril that a Hail Mary is \nall they have left. Their strategy is bad for the American people. I \nhave no doubt that the American people will see what they are trying to \ndo and, come this November, will reject it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7204-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, if you visit the U.S. Capitol through a \ncertain entrance on the first floor of the East Front, you will see a \nplaque by the door. The plaque is in honor and remembrance of Capitol \nPolice Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut and Detective John Michael Gibson, \nwhere 10 years ago today they gave their lives in defense of this \nCapitol.\n  Their deaths remind us that, just as bravery was required from our \nFounders who built the Capitol, the bravery of great men is required \ntoday to protect and keep it. The names of Chestnut and Gibson will \nforever be remembered among American patriots.\n  Officer Chestnut, or J.J. to his friends, was 58 and a father of \nfive. An 18-year veteran of the force, he was just months away from \nretirement. He was also an Air Force veteran of 20 years who had served \nin Vietnam and Taiwan, where he met his wife.\n  J.J. lovingly tended a vegetable garden in the back yard of his \nhouse, and\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\nneighbors often saw him practicing his golf swing in his front lawn.\n  John Gibson also had 18 years of service with the Capitol Police. A \nfriend of his recalls that just a few days before the shooting, John \ntold him he had never had to draw his weapon on the job. Forty-two \nyears old, he had three children, and was a native of Massachusetts.\n  Friends recall John's ardent love for his Boston sports teams--the \nBruins, the Red Sox, and U Mass basketball.\n  Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were the first Capitol Police \nofficers to die in the line of duty. As we honor them today, we also \nhonor the hundreds of brave men and women of that force who put their \nlives on the line to protect this House of democracy.\n  To the casual tourist, Capitol Police officers may just seem like \nfriendly people who stand guard at the doors. But in truth, they are an \nelite, highly trained force charged with a critical mission. In moments \nof crisis, when not just lives but our very system of government is \nthreatened, they stand ready at the front lines.\n  We saw again on September 11, 2001, how the Capitol can be a target \nfor terror. And we saw again the bravery of the Capitol Police, who \nrushed into the building to rescue others when most of us were busy \nrushing out.\n  As my friend, the majority leader, a former Capitol Police officer \nhimself; certainly know, police work is both an honorable job and a \ndangerous one.\n  In fact, in the 10 years since the loss of Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson, 24 peace officers in my home State of Kentucky have \nalso been lost in the line of duty. If there is no objection, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nKentucky Peace Officers Killed in the Line of Duty, July 24, 1998-July \n                               24, 2008.\n\n     Regina Woodward Nickles\n     Joey Tremayne Vincent\n     Jason Wayne Cammack\n     William J.

Mr. President, I rise because a son of Kentucky who \njoined the Kentucky National Guard has been lost in service to his \ncountry. SSG Delmar White of Wallins, KY, was tragically killed on \nSeptember 2, 2007, when an improvised explosive device detonated near \nhis vehicle while he was on patrol in Iraq. He was 37 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant White had been stationed in Iraq for less than a week. \nFor his valor in uniform, he received numerous medals, awards, and \ndecorations, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart.\n  For anyone who wonders how those who loved Staff Sergeant White will \nremember him, the words of his wife, Michele, leave no doubt.\n  ``He went out a hero,'' Michele says. ``He was a hero before he went \nto Iraq, in my book. . . . He was a fantastic person that everybody \nloved.''\n  Born in Illinois, Delmar--or Dale, as his friends called him--was \nraised in Wallins, a small town in Harlan County, KY, in the \nsoutheastern corner of my State. He graduated from James A. Cawood High \nSchool there. He eventually moved to Lexington, KY, heart of the \nBluegrass Country.\n  In Lexington, Dale worked as a corrections officer for the Lexington-\nFayette Urban County Government. He also worked at the University of \nKentucky, where he met Michele--the woman who would become his wife.\n  There was an instant attraction between the two. Their first date was \nto a local carnival, where Dale showed off his athletic prowess for \nMichele by winning some stuffed animals. Or maybe he had his old \ntraining to thank--Dale was a former U.S. Marine of 4 years who had \nserved in Desert Storm.\n  Dale was proud of his service, and in 1998, he chose to enlist again, \nthis time with the Kentucky National Guard. But he didn't do anything \nwithout first talking to Michele, by that time his wife. He was \nconcerned she wouldn't want him to go. He shouldn't have been.\n  ``You are military and always will be--do it,'' Michele told him in \nsupport.\n  One Labor Day weekend, Dale was in Cincinnati with the Guard, working \ncrowd control for a local event. Michele tells us that an older man \nwalked up to him and asked, ``Why would you wear that uniform?''\n  At that moment, a little boy approached Dale and stretched his hand \nup to him. The boy said, ``Mr. Soldier, can I shake your hand?''\n  After Dale shook the boy's hand, he looked the man right in the eye \nand said, ``That's why.''\n  Clearly, Dale was proud to serve his country, and confident in his \nmission. As Michele says, ``He was military 100 percent.''\n  Of course, there was a lighter side to Dale. He loved the outdoors \nand the go-cart track, where he was so aggressive he was known as ``the \nCompetitor.'' He liked a good video game, especially one that involved \nshooting at something and honing his target skills.\n  Most of all, he was a devoted father to his two children, daughter \nShelby and son Seth. He would plan special game nights for them and \nother children. Dale had previously served as a youth minister, and he \ntold Michele that was something he was interested in doing again. He \nalso hoped to serve with a fire department in the future.\n  Dale was deployed to Iraq in August of 2007 with Battery B, 2nd \nBattalion, 138th Field Artillery, based out of Carlisle, KY. He left an \nimpression on his commanding officer, CPT Robert S. Mattingly, among \nothers. This is what Captain Mattingly had to say:\n  There is a line that we are familiar with that says we will \n``cheerfully obey the orders.'' That was Delmar White for certain.\n  Captain Mattingly said: he was an excellent [non-commissioned \nofficer], who led by example and never asked anything of his soldiers \nhe wasn't willing to do himself.\n  Captain Mattingly added: Delmar White was loved by everyone in the \nbattery and will be terribly missed by all.\n  Dale talked to Michele and his children over the Internet the day \nbefore the bombing that took his life. Son Seth was so small all he \ncould do was bang on the keyboard, but Dale would always write back, \n``hey buddy,'' so Seth knew he was there.\n  During the funeral procession to Dale's burial in Camp Nelson, KY, \nMichele was overwhelmed at the people lining both sides of the street \nto pay their respects. Police cars and fire trucks stopped as police \nand firemen stood, solemnly saluting or with their hands on their \nhearts.\n  At the service, bagpipes played ``Amazing Grace,'' and there was a \n21-gun salute. Three helicopters flew overhead as the American flag \nthat had covered Dale's casket was folded and given to Michele.\n  Mr. President our thoughts are with Staff Sergeant White's family \nafter his tragic loss. We are thinking of his wife, Michele; his \ndaughter, Shelby; his son, Seth; his brothers, Robert and Doug; his \nsister, Tressa Fisher; his mother, Hazel White Blincoe; and many other \nbeloved family members and friends. Dale was predeceased by his father, \nPerry White.\n  Mr. President, this U.S. Senate rises as one today to salute Staff \nSergeant White's service, and to honor his sacrifice. The legacy he has \nleft for his family, friends, neighbors, and a little boy in \nCincinnati--who only remembers him as ``Mr. Soldier''--will live on. \nAnd that is a legacy that his loved ones can cherish forever.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7206-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7206-S7207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

They will note that these same Democrats were the ones who \ntook the majority less than 2 years ago, promising to do something \nabout gas prices that were a lot lower back then than they are today.\n  I recently received a letter from a dialysis center in Kentucky. It \nwas an urgent plea to do something about gas prices. The letter said \nsome of the rural patients who have to go to this center for treatment \nthree times a week are now foregoing their dialysis treatment because \nthey cannot afford the gas to get there. This is the kind of crisis \nhigh gas prices is for low-income and sick people.\n  After reading that, I have a simple question for our friends across \nthe aisle: If you won't act now, with dialysis patients unable to get \ninto town for treatment, when will you unlock the natural resources \nAmericans have right under their own feet? What is it going to take? \nClearly, this is a very serious problem for the American people, and we \nhave an obligation to address it, and the time to do it is now. I am \nafraid the Democrats who run the Senate want it all to somehow go away. \nThey have been going to great lengths to make sure it goes away. They \nare cancelling hearings when they are afraid the issue might come up, \nand they are muzzling their own Members, more than a dozen of whom \nfavor a balanced solution that includes more domestic production and \nincreased conservation. They are telling them the same thing they are \ntelling the American people: No, we can't.\n  The problem we face, as everyone knows, is that the demand for oil is \nrising faster than the supply, and the solution, as everyone knows, is \nto increase supply and lower demand. Yet this week, the Democratic \nleadership in Congress is saying: No, we can't. They are saying: No, we \ncan't produce a single barrel of oil at home.\n  Instead of increasing supply, they are trying to distract us with the \nsame blame game they roll out whenever the demands of some special \ninterest group conflict with the will of the people.\n  This time they have turned their attention on speculators. They say \nthe reason gas prices have nearly doubled since the Democrats took over \na year and a half ago is the speculators.\n  Well, Republicans have no problem strengthening regulation of the \nfutures markets. That is part of the bill that 44 of us are sponsoring. \nBut if Congress does not allow any new exploration, it is perfectly \nclear what the speculation about future prices will be: not good. The \nspeculators are betting on scarcity, and the majority is helping to \nprove them right.\n  So here we are. After months of frustration, Americans are hearing \nfrom the Democratic leaders that Congress is going to do one thing \nabout the single most vexing issue in America today. The Democratic \nleaders are telling the American people that the solution is to write \nup some new guidelines for energy traders, call it a day, and head \nhome. And if we do not support this very timid solution, they will go \nback to the blame game again. They will say Republicans voted against \nlowering gas prices, when the fact is not a single person in America \nwho does not sit behind a desk on the other side of the aisle thinks \nthis particular speculation provision will do anything to lower gas \nprices.\n  Let's be perfectly clear: A vote for this narrow bill alone is not a \nserious vote about high gas prices. It is an abdication of our \nresponsibilities as lawmakers. It is an insult to the American people \nwho are demanding every single day that we do something to ease their \npain at the pump.\n  This is not a theoretical problem. This is not a looming problem. It \nis an urgent problem. It is an urgent problem with families who have to \nstruggle to put food on the table or send their kids to school. It is \nan urgent problem for the dialysis patients in my State who can't get \ntreatment because they can't afford to get to town to see the doctor. \nAnd Americans are hearing the Democratic leadership's response, which \nis: No, we can't.\n  The ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my \ngood friend from New Mexico, put it this way. He said that in his 37 \nyears of service in the Senate, he has never seen a single bigger \nproblem met with a smaller solution. The Senator from New Mexico said \nhe had never seen a bigger problem met with a smaller solution.\n  I would put it this way: Americans are saying the house is on fire, \nand the Democratic leadership is showing up at the scene with squirt \nguns.\n  Let's put the scope of this bill in perspective. During last year's \nenergy debate--a year ago--on the Energy Independence and Security Act, \n331 amendments were proposed, 49 amendments were agreed to, and gas \nprices were $3.06 a gallon. Two years before that, during the debate on \nthe Energy Policy Act, 235 amendments were proposed, 57 amendments were \nagreed to, and gas was selling for $2.26 a gallon.\n\n  With gas prices in some places at more than double what they were \nthen and when Americans are clamoring for dramatic action and when it \nis clearly the No. 1 issue in the country, the Democratic majority \nwants us to tighten the leash on a few speculators and then head home \nand do nothing else until next year.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could be opening the Outer Continental \nShelf. Democratic leaders say: No, we can't. To drive down gas prices, \nwe could be lifting the ban on development of vast oil shale deposits \nin Western States that sit on three times the reserves of Saudi Arabia. \nThe Democratic leaders say: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could be approving incentives for \nbattery-powered electric cars and trucks. Democratic leaders say: No, \nwe can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could be voting to open untapped \nAmerican oil. Democratic leaders say: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could be voting for new clean nuclear \ntechnology, but Democratic leaders say: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could be approving new and promising \ncoal-to-liquid technology. Again, Democratic leaders say: No, we can't.\n  When will the Democratic leadership listen to the 77 percent of \nAmericans who want us to use our own domestic resources to drive down \nthe price of gas and say: Yes, we can. When will they listen to more \nthan a dozen of their own Members on the other side of the aisle who \nare saying: Yes, we can.\n  Americans never imagined they would be paying these prices at the \npump, but if the Democratic leadership has its way, Americans will be \npaying even more in the years to come. When that time comes and there \nis no one else to blame, they will look around and see that there is no \none else around to blame but themselves. Then Americans will know whom \nto blame, and I can tell my colleagues it will not be the speculators.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Arizona on his feet, and I am \nwondering if he wishes to ask me a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague would yield for two \nquestions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I believe at least twice \nthe majority leader has made a comment about my colleague from Arizona, \nJohn McCain, and I wanted to see if the Republican leader's \nunderstanding is the same as mine.\n  The majority leader said: ``McCain says drilling is only \npsychological and won't make a difference.''\n  I have checked the actual record of what Senator McCain said. It was \na discussion of offshore drilling, which Senator McCain strongly \nsupports on the Outer Continental Shelf, and the question was whether \nthere would be short-term relief. Here is precisely what Senator McCain \nsaid in response:\n\n       I don't see an immediate relief, but I do see that \n     exploitation of existing reserves that may exist--and in view \n     of many experts that do exist off our coasts--is also a way \n     that we need to provide relief. Even though it may take some \n     years, the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would \n     have psychological impact that I think is beneficial.\n\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\n\n  Now, I ask the leader: Is it correct, in your view, that what Senator \nMcCain was saying is that while the benefits of production would take \nsome years to achieve, there could be an immediate psychological \nbenefit simply from the decision that we were going to do this, such as \nthe $20 reduction in the price of a barrel of oil following shortly \nafter the President's announcement that he was going to lift the \nmoratorium on offshore drilling?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My understanding of Senator McCain's position is the \nsame as my good friend from Arizona. I believe he states correctly the \nposition of his senior colleague from Arizona on this important issue \nof whether it would be useful for America--the third-largest oil \nproducer in the world, sitting on vast reserves--to expand the usage of \nthose reserves, particularly on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Mr. KYL. Secondly, Mr. President, the second question. The Republican \nleader said a moment ago that speculators were betting on scarcity and \nthe majority is doing everything to prove them right.\n  With respect to a decision to begin production off our shores on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, is it the Senator's opinion that this would \nhave a beneficial effect on drawing down the price of futures in the \noil market because the decision would be seen as a commitment to \nproduce more?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Arizona, my view on that \nis probably not as significant as others. For example, the famous \noilman, T. Boone Pickens, who has been in town this week and who has \nmet with Republicans and Democrats, has made it quite clear that he \nthinks we ought to be doing all these things, both on the find-more \nside, which would certainly involve greater use of the Outer \nContinental Shelf which is currently off-limits. He thinks we ought to \nbe doing all these things. I gather that most experts understand the \nlaw of supply and demand, and if you increase supply and diminish \ndemand, you are working in tandem to get gas prices down. I think it \nmakes elementary good sense that that is the only way we will be able \nto make progress on this issue.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7207-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There was no objection to \nthe assistant leader speaking as part of the Democratic time as it is \nnow allocated; is that right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I would like to ask, if I could, the \nminority whip one brief question before he leaves the Chamber. I notice \nyou all were trying to clarify the position of our colleague from \nArizona on drilling, and this is simply a yes or no question. Does \nSenator McCain support drilling in ANWR?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to respond. I was not only \nclarifying his position but ensuring people understood what the \nmajority leader said about his position was incorrect.

Mr. President, the motto of the Republicans in the Senate \nis: Talk more, produce less. Do you know what we offered them this \nweek? We said to the Republicans: Here is the opportunity of a \nlifetime. Do you have a position on speculation? Do you think it is an \nissue? If you do, put your proposal on the floor and we will put our \nproposal on the floor. We will have an equal vote requirement, equal \ndebate time. We will go at it and we will let the Senate decide. We are \nnot going to write your version of the speculation, you would not write \nours, but you have every right to do that. The Republican response was: \nNo, we are not interested in that. We don't think speculation is a \nproblem.\n  Well, they ought to meet with the CEOs of the major airlines. They \nought to spend a minute talking to them about what they feel because \nthey are paying the jet fuel costs and they are cutting back on service \nand they are cutting back on employment. That is the reality of what \nthey face today. Speculation, manipulation is a major concern. We have \na responsible approach to it. The Republicans refuse to offer an \nalternative. OK. That is their decision.\n  Then we said to them: Why don't you present your energy bill? The \nRepublican leader came to the floor with a litany of things the \nRepublicans believe in. For over a week we have said to them: Put it in \na bill offered on the floor. They have said: No, no. We would rather \ncome to the floor and complain, rather than come to the floor and \ndebate our approach.\n  I listened to the Republican leader as he came to the floor, and it \nis very clear to me. They don't want a debate and a vote. They want \nthis issue to drag out forever and ever, amen. That is not what the \nAmerican people want. They want us to tackle this thing, offer \nalternatives on the floor, debate them up or down, go forward.\n  It troubles me when the Republican leader repeatedly says--\nincorrectly--that when it comes to energy, from the Democratic view, we \nwant to deal with speculation and, in his words, ``do nothing else.'' \nHe forgets the whole second part of this--the Energy bill we are \nproposing on the Democratic side and they are going to propose on the \nRepublican side. We offered them that. They turned us down.\n  I might also say there is no idea how many amendments the Republicans \nare going to offer. Two days ago, Senator Kyl and I were on the floor, \nand he said there were 25 amendments. Senator Specter walked up and \nsaid: I have 2, so make that 27. Then Senator Kyl said: Come to think \nof it, I have one too. We are up to 28. That was 2 days ago. This is \ngrowing similar to bacteria in a petri dish as the Republicans meet in \ntheir conference and dream up more amendments. That is good. It shows a \ncreative mind at work, and it is a great exercise, but it isn't what \nthe American people are asking for.\n  If you have a good set of ideas, offer them. You want to bring up \nmore nuclear power, Senator Domenici? Put that in your package. You \nwant to have more offshore drilling, put it in your package. You want \nto have coal to oil, put it in your package. If you believe in it, \nstand and fight for it. But they will not. They will not fight for it. \nThey want to run. Run to the press and\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\nexplain that they are not being given enough time on the floor, if they \ncould have a little more time, as days burn off the calendar as they \nstand and complain. They can't come up with a plan, and that is the \nunfortunate reality.\n\n  Then, they quote T. Boone Pickens. Mr. Pickens, I am sure, is a \ngifted man. I have never met him. I have seen him on TV. He has spent a \nlot of money to make sure we all get to see him. They have misquoted \nhim on the floor so often. I have watched that ad he is paying millions \nof dollars for America to see, and I do remember the part of the ad \nwhere he says: ``We can't drill our way out of this problem.'' Mr. T. \nBoone Pickens said that.\n  You don't hear that from the Republican side. Their idea is we can \ndrill our way out of this. They forget the reality. Of all the oil in \nthe world, if you look at the vast quantity, we have 3 percent of it \nunder our control--3 percent. We use 25 percent of the oil. You can't \ndrill your way out of it. We know we are going to need exploration and \nproduction, but we know we need a lot more, including conservation, \nrenewables, sustainable energy sources. That is the reality of what we \nface.\n  We have made this offer to them time and again. They will not accept \nit. They would rather come to the floor and complain.\n  When you go through the list, you see first drilling offshore. \nDemocrats support that. There are 34 million acres currently under \nlease to oil companies for drilling they are not using. Why don't they \nstart drilling there since they paid for this land?\n  Oil shale. That is in our bill. Even though that is 15 years away, we \nwant to take a look at oil shale as an opportunity.\n  Incentives for batteries, of course we support that. There is no \ndebate there.\n  Untapped American oil. We think there is untapped American oil in \nAlaska--23 million acres' worth that the oil companies aren't touching. \nThey should go in there and take a look, drill for it, bring it \nforward.\n  Nuclear energy. I don't understand how Senator McConnell could come \nto the floor and say we could bring gasoline prices down with more \nnuclear energy. Could you picture a car being powered by nuclear \nenergy? I can't. If he is talking about plug-in hybrids, he ought to \nclarify the example he is using.\n  There are plenty of things we can do. It should have started with a \ngood-faith offer which we made to the Republicans and, frankly, they \nshould have accepted.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He can't yield the floor to the Senator. He either uses \nit or it is there made available for the Republicans to use. He can't \nyield to someone.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator can allocate time to \nanother Senator based on the time allocated to him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no objection to her speaking. I \nunderstand that the time is allocated specifically. Who has time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3 minutes 45 seconds on \nthe majority side, 12 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I will speak as in morning business, \nso I am happy to yield now to the Senator from New Mexico. I am happy \nto do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand there is 3 minutes left for the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will use it after the Senator speaks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know where to begin. So many \nthings are being said by the other side. In particular, the Senator \nfrom Illinois spoke for 10 minutes, and it is impossible for me to \nanswer all of the falsities he indicated to the American people in his \nremarks.\n  I want to say that yesterday afternoon I got word from the floor of \nthe Senate that the American people are not going to be permitted to \nhave a vote by the Senate on an amendment that would open the offshore \nlands owned by the American people, because the majority leader has \nseen fit to use a parliamentary process--and I know the people are \nconfused and tired of us talking about parliamentary processes around \nhere, but the truth is that Senators are also getting fed up with it. \nThe majority leader comes along--and we all understand he has the right \nto be recognized--and, when he was recognized, he offered amendments, \nso that yesterday evening, as I sat preparing for today, I was told to \nchange your thoughts and your approach because you cannot offer any \namendments. That is an undeniable fact.\n  The majority leader has cloaked this bill in amendments and that is \ncalled ``filling up the tree.'' I don't know where such an interesting \nconcept came from. If it were Christmas time, filling up the tree would \nseem like a nice event. When you are here trying to get the Senate to \nvote on whether a giant asset that belongs to the American people can \nbe open for drilling, it is not a very good-sounding series of words.\n  ``Filling up the tree'' means that those who want to offer \namendments, who want to let the Senate determine the future of that 85 \npercent of the offshore lands of America, cannot do so. Those Senators, \non behalf of their people--every Senator represents people and all of \nthe people have an interest in the ownership of this land; it is a huge \npiece of land. It is very valuable in terms of crude oil and natural \ngas. Americans should probably have woken up this morning to go to \nbreakfast and to read in the paper: United States Senate permits \ndrilling in the offshores of continental America so the price of \ngasoline can come down. That is what they should have read in the \nnewspapers across the land. There is no question that more than 50 \nSenators--Democrats and Republicans--favor opening all of those lands \nto exploration; that is, drilling, and to let the Governors of the \nStates participate in that process so the States can share in the \nroyalty. That is a very simple proposition. That is the bill and that \nis the issue.\n  Now we have been told, for their own reasons, the Democrats have said \nyou cannot do that, we have filled the tree. You will come to us and \nprayerfully ask for permission to do anything on this bill. You will \nhave to seek our permission. So the Senator from Nevada can stand here \nand say you can do this or that, but the truth is, what he is saying \nis: If I want to let you do it, you can, because the rules of the \nSenate do not permit it.\n  So we are unable to get a vote. That doesn't mean we are going to \nquit. We are going to stay here on this floor. If, in fact, the \nmajority leader tries to close off debate, he will lose, because we \nbelieve the biggest issue confronting the American people, bar none, \ntoday is the price of oil. We think the biggest opportunity to lower \nthe pressure and bring down gasoline prices at the pump and cause us to \nimport less is to open the offshore of the United States to drilling, \nplain and simple.\n  The majority started this issue with a bill they put in, which is \nsupposed to have something to do with the price of oil. It has to do \nwith speculation.\n  I send to the desk to be printed the statement of several prominent \nAmericans, all of whom say the problem is not speculation; the problem \nis supply and demand. To affect supply and demand, you ought to be \nopening the offshores, which affects supply in a big way. I ask \nunanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``It's not speculation, it is supply and demand. We don't \n     have excess capacity in the world anymore, and that's what \n     you're seeing in oil prices.''--Warren Buffett, Chairman & \n     CEO, Berkshire Hathaway, 6/25/08\n       ``There is little evidence that large investment flows into \n     the futures market are causing an imbalance between supply \n     and demand, and are therefore contributing to high oil \n     prices. . . . Blaming speculation is an easy solution which \n     avoids taking the necessary steps to improve supply-side \n     access and investment or to implement measures to improve \n     energy efficiency.''--International Energy Agency, Medium-\n     Term Oil Market Report, July 2008\n       ``If financial speculation were pushing all prices above \n     the level consistent with the fundamentals of supply and \n     demand, we would expect inventories of crude oil and \n     petroleum products to increase as supply rose\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\n     and demand fell. But, in fact, available data on oil \n     inventories shows notable declines over the past year.''--Ben \n     Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 7/15/2008\n       ``There is speculation, but speculation, under most \n     circumstances, is a positive thing. It provides liquidity and \n     allows people to hedge their risks. And it provides price \n     discovery. It can help allocate oil availability over time, \n     depending on the pattern of futures prices and so on.''--Ben \n     Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 7/15/2008\n       ``The rise in oil prices can be explained by basic economic \n     factors, such as limited growth in supplies in recent years, \n     a weakening dollar, a global surge in energy demand and a \n     string of production disruptions in countries like \n     Nigeria.''--Daniel Yergin, Chairman, Cambridge Energy \n     Research Associates, 6/25/08\n       ``The truth is that increased speculation in oil futures is \n     not a cause of rising oil prices, but rather an effect of \n     those prices, which have skyrocketed due to growth in global \n     demand, geopolitical instability, and constricted supply in \n     several producing countries.''--John Chapman, Researcher at \n     the American Enterprise Institute, 7/16/2008\n       ``If Congress is literally going over the CFTC's head and \n     talking about imposing legislation or making the CFTC \n     exercise its emergency powers to limit excess speculation \n     when they don't even know what that means. I don't even know \n     what excess speculation means.''--Michael Haigh, senior \n     commodity analyst at Societe Generale Corporate and \n     Investment Banking and former associate chief economist with \n     the CFTC, 6/30/2008\n       ``There's no evidence of speculative influence. Speculators \n     are not contributing to the demand for physical oil as they \n     almost always roll positions prior to delivery.''--Craig \n     Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston, \n     member, CFTC energy markets advisory committee, 6/24/08\n       ``On any given day, expectations determine the price; but \n     the spot market also has to clear, and the way this happens \n     is that excess supply must be added to physical stocks. Even \n     with fairly inelastic supply and demand, any large \n     speculative deviation from the ``fundamental'' price should \n     show up in a noticeable increase in inventories.''--Paul \n     Krugman, New York Times columnist, 6/28/08\n       ``To date, the PWG has not found valid evidence to suggest \n     that high crude oil prices over the long term are a direct \n     result of speculation or systematic market manipulation by \n     traders. Rather, prices appear to be reflecting tight global \n     supplies and the growing world demand for oil, particularly \n     in emerging economies. As a result, Congress should proceed \n     cautiously before drastically changing the regulation of the \n     energy markets.''--President's Working Group on Financial \n     Markets, Letter to Senator Saxby Chambliss, 7/21/2008\n       ``The Task Force's preliminary assessment is that current \n     oil prices and the increase in oil prices between January \n     2003 and June 2008 are largely due to fundamental supply and \n     demand factors. During this same period, activity on the \n     crude oil futures market--as measured by the number of \n     contracts outstanding, trading activity, and the number of \n     traders--has increased significantly. While these increases \n     broadly coincided with the run-up in crude oil prices, the \n     Task Force's preliminary analysis to date does not support \n     the proposition that speculative activity has systematically \n     driven changes in oil prices.''--Interagency Task Force on \n     Commodity Markets, Interim Report on Crude Oil, 7/22/2008\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been here for 36 years. I chose \nthis year to leave. When an energy bill came forth on the floor and we \nwere going to be able to amend it, I thought we were going to be able \nto talk about all of the issues, get together with the Democrats and \nsee how many would join us in a major piece of legislation, and I was \nrather excited. I thought the American people might be pleased with us \nagain, because we were going to do something good.\n  Do you know what. This 9-percent approval rating of the Senate is not \nthere for no good cause. We are, today, adding to that negative image \nwhen the American people try to understand what is going on. We were \ntold--and we applauded when we heard it--that this great big piece of \nproperty we own--everything 3 miles out from the shoreline of America \nis owned by the people. There is oil and gas there. For some reason, we \nclosed it down 27 years ago, and every year we put that moratorium on \nagain. It is time to open that and say to the world that we don't have \na total solution, but we have a lot of oil and gas we ought to put into \nthe mix and let our companies get to work on, trying to drill and see \nhow it will affect the price of oil.\n  Some people are saying, well, there are already a lot of oil and gas \nleases on the Outer Continental Shelf; why don't we force those oil \ncompanies to do better at using it? Let me make that proposition clear. \nEighty-five percent of the offshore land is tied up in the moratorium \nand 15 percent is being used. That 15 percent that is being used is all \nsubject to leases which say that if you don't produce on time, you lose \nthe lease. We don't need any further management in that regard. It is \nalready managed by a ``use it or lose it'' clause in every lease that \nanyone has on any of the lands that are currently on lease to American \ncompanies, or a consortia of American companies and others. So that is \na joke when we talk about the fact that we will get more by rearranging \nthat. We need to open the portions that are closed. We need a thorough \ndebate on a number of amendments, and our leaders have said there are \nat least five or six of them. We don't need a long period of time, but \nwe need an open and free amendment process that we could use. We could \ngo to the other side and get some bipartisan things going. I believe \nthere are many Democrats who want to join us.\n  It serves the wishes of the majority leader to close off debate, \nbecause even Democrats cannot join in amendments to do anything now, \nbecause the tree is filled--and it is not with Christmas presents. It \nis filled with amendments so we cannot offer any more amendments. In \nother words, we are dead in the water in trying to offer what Americans \nexpected--amendments that will open the offshore to drilling.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, I have how much time, 3 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think Senators understand that this Senator from New \nMexico, as part of the last 6 years while serving on the Energy \nCommittee, has been party to producing three major energy bills that \nhave all been good for the country. They all have ended up being \nbipartisan. They all required a lot of time on the floor. I could not \ncome down here and put in an amendment and say it is done. It took some \ntime. We wanted to use this time to thoroughly debate the appropriate \noptions to opening the offshore for drilling.\n  We thought Americans, who are watching the price of crude oil come \ndown since the President lifted the Executive closures that existed, \nwould like to see the job finished. We thought they would like to see \nit opened totally, taking off all of the congressional hangups, the \ncongressional moratorium.\n  I think Americans deserve that. They deserve something positive. They \nare very worried. The economy is suffering because of the $700 billion \na year that goes to foreign countries. It is taken from us for the \ncrude oil we buy. While that foreign country grows, America dwindles. \nWe get poorer; the world gets richer. I don't know how much longer we \ncan stand it. We didn't want to stand it too much longer. We wanted to \nput in our offsets offshore and let them join in this war we are in, \ninstead of letting us die by attrition as we send our money overseas.\n  It doesn't seem anybody in America should get confused. Democrats can \nmake laundry lists of things that happened and put up a sign in the \nSenate saying we are the ones blocking this. How could we be blocking \nthis when we are not in control? The majority leader stood up and \nlocked this bill up with his amendments, so we cannot offer amendments \nwithout his approval. We don't intend to do that. That is not the way \nto do business.\n  The American people expect us to have debates and up-or-down votes on \nthis issue, with every Senator expressing his or her will on what \nhappens to this big asset. That is what we want.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico. I \nknow his service in this body is one that every American should admire. \nHe is a good Senator for his State. He has been a warm and friendly \nsenior Senator to this very junior Senator from Missouri. I appreciate \nhis friendship very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I will not use her\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\ntime, I will use mine. It has been a pleasure since I first met the \nSenator. I don't always remember all of the new names, but the Senator \nhas the same name as one of my daughters. We have become friends. I \nadmire the Senator from Missouri too, and say I do believe she is \nlearning to be a Senator very fast. I am proud to be her friend. I \nthank her for her kind words.\n\n\n                              Audit Report\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, yesterday there was an incredibly dark \ncloud that passed over Washington. I think the saddest thing about this \nvery dark cloud is the fact that there wasn't an immediate outcry from \nevery corner of this building and every office in the Pentagon. One of \nthe most frustrating things about Washington is the attention span of \nso many in Washington and the search for the headline that is the most \nsensational. So it is no wonder that news about auditing doesn't bust \nout.\n  I come to the floor to try to emphasize the crisis we are facing \nright now in terms of the Pentagon and auditing of taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me briefly explain the two agencies involved. One is the Defense \nContract Audit Agency. What is DCAA? That is part of the problem. \nNobody knows what it is. Nobody knows what it does. DCAA is the \nauditing agency in the Department of Defense that is responsible for \nauditing the contractors. Think about that for a minute: 3,500 people \nare employed by this Agency, and they are our eyes and ears into \ncontractor practices at the Department of Defense. We are talking \nserious money here. We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions--with a ``b''--of dollars.\n  One would think that if we have 3,500 people working full time to \naudit the contractors, we should all feel good about that and, frankly, \nbefore yesterday, I kind of felt good about it. As I learned about all \nof the auditors of the Department of Defense, I thought: I am glad we \nhave an agency with the responsibility to get to the bottom of the \nprices that were charged by contractors, to get to the bottom of the \nmoney that comes out of our Treasury for contractors--until yesterday.\n  The other agency involved is the GAO. I know the initials ``GAO'' are \nthrown around all the time. Let me explain what GAO is. GAO is the \nGovernment Accountability Office. They are what I would call the papa \nbear of auditors in Government. They are the auditors who look at all \nparts of Government, many times in response to a request by Congress \nbut many times in response to a hotline call they have gotten from \npeople within Government.\n  They start getting hotline calls about the practices at DCAA. This is \nenough to worry an auditing agency, that they are getting hotline calls \non an auditing agency. This is enough to get their attention. So GAO \nstarted this audit of the Defense Contract Audit Agency based on \ncomplaints to their fraud hotline.\n  Here is the allegation. Are you ready for this? Here is the \nallegation: that these audits were being changed with no factual basis \nat the direction of supervisors, without evidence to support the \nchanges, to help the contractors. This is a wildly sensational claim \nwithin the world of auditing. This is the kind of claim that, frankly, \nmost auditors would probably not take seriously because it is so \noutrageous. But because there had been so many calls to the hotline, \nGAO went to work, over 100 interviews, months and months of work, and \nyesterday they issued their report.\n  They looked at 13 different audits named in the complaints and found \nthat in every single audit, favorable findings for the contractors had \nno backup in the workpapers. What does that mean? If you are an \nauditor, your job is to find the facts. Everything you put in an audit \nhas to be backed up by what are called workpapers. That means that \nanybody at any time could go in and find the factual evidence to \nsupport every line in the audit. That is part of Government auditing \nstandards.\n  What else did GAO find? You are not going to believe this. You are \nnot going to believe how bad this is. They found that supervisors \ndropped findings and changed opinions without the evidence to support \nit. They found several instances where auditors were threatened if they \ndid not change their findings to support what the supervisors wanted \nand if they did not change their findings to favor the contractors. GAO \nfound this practice to be so pervasive at two of the three locations, \nthey called it ``a pattern of frequent management actions that served \nto intimidate auditors and create an abusive environment.'' These \nauditors were intimidated by supervisors and made to tell them what \nthey were telling GAO. So not only were the supervisors on the auditors \nto do findings favorable to the contractors, they got on them when they \nstarted talking to GAO. They intimidated them into telling them what \nthey were telling the investigators, the auditors from GAO. Their \nsupervisors made them feel their jobs were threatened.\n  At one location, auditors were sometimes given 20 days to finish an \naudit, and if it wasn't enough time to do the audit work, they said: \nJust do it; just do it with what you have.\n  Supervisors admitted to not reviewing the workpapers. That doesn't \nsound like a big deal, right? Who reviews workpapers? Let me tell you, \nin the world of auditing, it is a very big deal.\n  This is how an audit works. The field auditors gather the papers, the \nfactual information, and then it goes through a series of reviews and \nchecks. It is ultimate quality control in an audit. It is unheard of \nfor an audit to be issued without review up the line. That review is \nhow you cull the information that is incorrect and make sure everything \nin that audit is factual and objective.\n  Here is a very good example of how serious and systemic the problem \nis. DCAA actually agreed with a contractor, one of the five largest \ncontractors in the country, ahead of time what items would be reviewed \nfor the audit. It is like giving a kid the answers to the test. There \nis no point in doing an audit if you tell the auditee ahead of time: \nOK, we are going to test you on this.\n  Here is the amazing thing. Even with the inside information, the DCAA \nauditors found the process to be inadequate with the contractor. Did \nthey issue an unfavorable opinion? Oh, no, they didn't issue an \nunfavorable opinion. Instead, the auditor was removed by a supervisor. \nThe new auditor was threatened with personnel action if the audit was \nnot changed to favor the contractor.\n  In every single one, all 13 audits that were reviewed, the GAO found \nthat Government auditing standards were not followed.\n  There is a book in auditing called the Yellow Book. It is the bible \nof auditing. It is the generally accepted Government auditing \nstandards, and every Government auditor is required to follow these \nstandards. Once again, auditors have a lot of professional pride about \nthe objectivity of their work and about the standards they follow. It \nwould not be effective if you had auditors who were auditing the \ngovernment in Michigan and auditors who were auditing the government in \nSan Francisco and auditors who were auditing the Pentagon all using \ndifferent methodology to do audits. So this standard is, in fact, \nrevered within the Government auditing world.\n  Here is what is amazing. Thirteen audits were looked at. Did one of \nthem not meet standards? No. Did two of them not meet standards? No. \nEvery single audit failed Government auditing standards--13 of 13, 100 \npercent. This is mind-boggling, that we would have 3,500 people \nwatching Defense Department contractors in this country and every audit \nthat was looked at was failed by Government auditing standards. Nine of \nthe thirteen had audit opinions changed without documentation and \nwithout workpapers to support the charges. Three had evidence that \nshowed the DCAA auditor trying to perform his or her job and his \nindependence impaired by his supervisors. Nine of the thirteen audits \nhad conclusions that were not supported by the work performed by the \nauditors.\n\n  They got caught. They have gotten caught in what could be the biggest \nauditing scandal in the history of this town. And I am not \nexaggerating. I will guarantee you, as auditors around the country \nlearn about this, they are going to have disbelief and raw anger that \nthis agency has impugned the integrity of Government auditors \neverywhere by these kinds of irresponsible actions.\n  By the way, auditors are very conservative with other auditors. Every\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\nauditing agency has peer review. By the way, GAO has always passed all \nof its peer review without any problem. But I know when we were getting \npeer reviewed when I was the State auditor in Missouri, it was a very \nnervous time because auditors come into your office from all over the \ncountry and they pore through your work. They go through your \nworkpapers. They check all of your reviews. They, in fact, as an \nobjective third party, look and make sure you are doing objective \nprofessional government auditing work. They are very conservative \nbecause it is peer to peer, right? It is hard to criticize your peers. \nIt is hard to call out another auditor. That is why this is such a big \ndeal. It is damning. This audit is damning of DCAA and the job it \nshould be doing to protect Government taxpayers from the incredible \nwaste and inefficiency in the contracting of the Department of Defense.\n  So when you get an audit, another part of the audit is you respond to \nthe audit. The auditee gets an opportunity to speak in the audit. It is \na very good thing because the auditee, if they firmly believe the audit \nis not justified, has an ability to give their side of the story. It \nalso allows the opportunity to make sure you are exchanging \ninformation. So that response in the audit is also a part of Government \nauditing standards.\n  Let me tell you, when they got this audit, it was a dark day for \nthem, and they had a choice. DCAA had a choice. They could have come \nforward and said: We have a big problem here and we have to clean \nhouse, and announced they were firing people in all of these offices \nand that supervisors were being fired and that they were going to clean \nup their act. That was one choice they had, to admit they had been \ncaught in this scandal and to admit they would make it better. But what \ndid they do? What did DCAA do as a result of this incredible audit \nreport? They ``disagreed'' with the totality of the audit.\n  Here is what is so insulting about them disagreeing with the totality \nof the audit. They have no evidence to back it up. They have nothing to \nrefute. The voluminous--this is not a small audit, this is page after \npage of documentation. They dispute the facts about the contractor \nbeing given prior notice that he would be audited in the above case \neven though there is clear evidence to support this conclusion in the \nDCAA workpapers.\n  They said, believe it or not--wait until you hear this:\n\n       They are currently operating at a satisfactory level of \n     compliance with Government auditing standards.\n\n  Satisfactory? Thirteen out of thirteen failing Government standards, \nand that is satisfactory? How dare they. How dare they say that is \nsatisfactory. They flatly stated they don't believe any supervisors \nharassed or intimidated staff or willfully removed findings. The \nevidence is there. The fact they are denying the evidence is there \nshows the level of dysfunction in this auditing agency. They don't seem \nto be too concerned about zero percent of these audits meeting \nGovernment standards.\n  The Department of Defense has been on the high-risk list of this \nGovernment for more than a decade. Scandal after scandal has rolled out \nof the Department of Defense on contracting.\n\n  I took a trip to Iraq on contract oversight, and with an auditor's \neye, meeting with the people who oversee the contracts in Iraq. And I \nwill tell you conservatively--and auditors are very conservative--\nconservatively, I think we have burned up more than $150 billion in \npure contracting abuse.\n  We have had hearings where weapon system after weapon system comes in \n100 percent more expensive, 3 or 4 years off time. And all this time we \nhave been wasting hundreds and billions of dollars, the fox was in the \nchicken coop. The Defense Contracting Auditing Agency has been indicted \nin the strongest terms by their peers at GAO.\n  This situation demands hearings. And if somebody doesn't lose their \njob at DCAA before nightfall, the problem is more serious than anybody \nin this Chamber can possibly imagine. Because they think they can sweat \nit out. They think we are not going to pay attention. They think we are \ngoing to move on to the next headline, the next campaign stop. They \nthink we are so worried about all the other problems that no one is \ngoing to notice this auditing agency has been disclosed and exposed as \nbeing fundamentally corrupt in the way they issue audits.\n  It calls into question every single audit done by this agency. And if \nwe don't take it seriously, if we don't give it our attention, if we \ndon't demand that the fox get out of the chicken coop, and we start \ntaking care of taxpayer dollars, ultimately it is our national \nsecurity. All of the needs we have for our men and women who fight for \nus, all the needs of our active military, all the technology we need to \nstay secure and safe, all of it is so important to our Nation. Yet what \nwe have found out in the last 24 hours is no one is paying attention to \nthe way we are spending that money. It makes me sick to my stomach.\n  I am angry. And I will tell you, this Senator is not going away on \nthis issue. If I have to stand on this floor every day for the next 6 \nmonths, I will do it, to get someone fired at that agency and to get \nthem to clean up their act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk \nabout the fact that the Senate is going to have an opportunity to vote \non cloture to move us to an important bill that will address the issue \nmost of my constituents in the State of Washington, as well as all \nthose in the country, are facing, and that is the high price of \ngasoline today--$4.45 is what I paid last weekend when I went home to \nWashington State. This is having an impact on our families, on our \ncommunities, and on all of our businesses--on everyone.\n  It is important that we address this issue. The bill that is being \noffered, which we hope to get past cloture and filibuster from the \nother side, is not a silver bullet, but it is an attempt to get at what \nwe believe is a fundamental part of the solution, and that is the \nmanipulation of the oil marketers by a few greedy traders, thereby \nincreasing the cost you and I pay at the pump. We are not asking for a \nlarge energy bill, but we are saying it is important that we address \nthis issue in a way that will produce relief as quickly as possible in \nsome way for our consumers as we head out a week from now for our \nAugust break.\n  I have been listening to this debate, and I have to say I am fairly \nsurprised by all of those who come to the floor and say: Wait, wait, \nwait, wait, wait. Unless we get to offer amendment after amendment \nafter amendment on drilling more, and drilling more, and drilling more, \nthen we are not going to allow the Senate to deal with the issue of \nspeculation, which Members on both sides agree is critical that we \naddress. I think it is important that we step back for a minute and go \nback in history and talk about energy and this Senate's history over \nthe last 8 years and this White House's history over the last 8 years.\n  Democrats understand there are short-term solutions for the crisis \nfacing us, but we also need long-term solutions because we believe, at \nthe end of the day, that we have to decrease our dependence on oil. We \nhave to decrease our dependence on oil, otherwise this Senate body, 10 \nyears from now, will again be debating whether to open up more \ndrilling. Meanwhile, we are all supposed to ride our bikes until we \nhave more oil out there again, and then the next generation gets to \ndebate oil again. We want to break this cycle. We want to get to long-\nterm energy independence. We want to create new alternatives for \npeople. We want that new technology to be invested in so that consumers \n10 years from now, and the next generation of Senators who are here and \nconsumers out across the country, don't have to listen to this debate \nagain. We can get there, but it is not easy.\n  Eight years ago, this country elected two oilmen to the White House. \nNo surprise: Every energy debate since then has focused on how we can \ndrill more for oil. Here we are today, a week before we leave for the \nAugust recess, and those on the other side want to take us right back \nto drilling again. Let me remind our colleagues what Senators on this \nside of the aisle have been doing for some time. When we got the \nmajority a year and a half ago, we said: Okay, with the majority, we \nwant to\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\nbegin making inroads on focusing on energy independence which, by the \nway, will reduce the cost to everybody as the consumption decreases. We \nlooked at CAFE standards. We were successful, not in doing it quickly, \nbut at least beginning to make progress on setting CAFE standards so \nour cars will be using less fuel. That is part of reducing the price of \ngas in the long term and our dependence on oil.\n  We also looked at an energy tax package. In fact, we brought an \nenergy tax package to the floor of the Senate that would create \nincentives for alternative energy. It costs a lot to develop new \ntechnology for energy. We said it is time for the Government to put its \nbacking there and provide tax credits for these companies so they can \ndo the research that is necessary to get that alternative technology \nout there. What did the other side do? Filibustered. Blocked it. And \ntoday, those investors are not out there investing in new technology. \nDemocrats said we need to move this bill. It is part of our plan in the \nlong run to reduce the price of oil to create those alternatives. We \nwere blocked on the other side from doing that.\n  A few months ago, Democrats said: It is important to look at how we \ncan stop this increasing, spiraling cost as soon as possible. We put \ntogether an energy package, and one of the key components was focusing \non the oil companies, who were reporting record profits at the time--\nand by the way, still are today--and we tried to repeal some of the oil \ncompanies' tax breaks they currently get so that those costs would go \nback to consumers and reduce our prices. What happened? We brought the \nbill up, and it was blocked by the other side. Why? Because they wanted \nto focus on drilling more oil.\n  We have tried many ways on this side to focus on the larger picture \nof energy and how we can reduce consumption, how we can get to energy \nindependence, how we can focus on making sure those high gas prices \nthat my constituents and others pay today--and by the way, when this \nadministration took office 8 years ago, gas was $1.46 a gallon, but \nbecause of the energy bills that have been pushed by the other side \nthat focus on drilling, it is now $4.45 a gallon in my home State. Yet \nhere we are today, as we try to focus on speculation in the markets, \nand what does the other side say? Oh no, we need to drill for more for \noil. Well, that hasn't worked in the past. We have already, several \nyears ago, added an additional--and I see my colleague from Illinois \nhere on the floor--I believe it was an additional 8 million acres to be \nleased in this country. We added that. Did it reduce the price of gas \nat the pump?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator, through the Chair, yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not only true that we have 68 million acres of land \nwe have leased to the oil companies, which they are paying us money to \nlease in order to find oil and gas, but they are not doing anything \nwith it--some 34 million offshore, on the Outer Continental Shelf and \nsome 33 million onshore that they are now leasing?\n  The Republican side of the aisle has become a one-trick pony--keep \ndrilling, keep drilling, keep drilling. We know if we decided today to \ndrill on any acreage here, it would be 8 to 14 years before we would \nsee any oil coming from it. So this notion not only flies in the face \nof the 68 million acres they currently have, but it doesn't solve the \nproblem.\n\n  As the Senator from Washington said, it makes the problem worse \nbecause we don't face the realities of what we need to do to have a \nnational energy policy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. Every \ntime we have come out here to try to broaden the energy debate and to \nbring down the price of gasoline and get to energy independence, we \nhave heard from the other side: Oh, no, there is only one answer, and \nthat is drill more.\n  We have given them that. In fact, yes, the oil companies have 68 \nmillion acres of land today that can be drilled, but they are choosing \nnot to. Why? Because if they increase the supply, the price is going to \ndrop. So what good does it do for us to give them even more of our \nFederal lands, because their benefit is keeping the price high.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Washington will yield for another \nobservation, she noted that when we elected President Bush and Vice \nPresident Cheney we brought two people in from the oil industry, and \ncoincidentally, during this two-term administration, profits of the oil \ncompanies in America have reached historic high levels at the expense \nof our economy and families. The Republicans, the President's party, \nwant to end this administration by giving them the biggest farewell \ngift anyone could ever wish for in the oil industry--millions and \nmillions more acres so that they can, at their pace and in their time, \ndecide to drill on.\n  It would seem to me, if you are honest about the oil companies and \nwhat they have done to this economy, this is the last thing we should \nbe doing. We should be holding them accountable for the prices they \ncharge, the profits they are reporting, and what they have done to the \nAmerican economy. So I ask the Senator from Washington: The \nalternatives we have talked about over the years--fuel efficiency for \ncars, more efficiency in the appliances we use, the buildings we build, \nall of this is part of the big energy picture, is it not? It isn't just \nabout keeping oil companies happy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Well, I say to the Senator from Illinois, he is \nabsolutely correct. In fact, in the past few days, a headline from \nReuters read: ``ConocoPhillips' Earnings Rise With Record Oil Prices.''\n  The oil companies are making a lot of money, so what is the other \nside's answer to every energy debate we have? Give them more money.\n  I say to my colleague from Illinois, I know he goes to the \nPresident's State of the Union Addresses every January, as I do, and we \nsit in the House Chamber and listen to what the President is presenting \nto us. I wonder if the Senator from Illinois remembers 2\\1/2\\ years \nago, the President's third State of the Union, I believe it was--and I \nrose with excitement when I heard the President say this to us:\n\n       Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And \n     here we have a serious problem:\n\n  Now, this is the President of the United States in his State of the \nUnion speech.\n\n       America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from \n     unstable parts of the world. The best way to break an \n     addiction is through technology.\n\n  These are not my words, but those of the President of the United \nStates. Yet every time we have tried to bring a bill to the floor to \nbreak our addiction to oil, we are stopped because the other side wants \nto drill more oil.\n  So I say to my colleague from Illinois, does it feel to him as though \nwe are trying to break our addiction to oil here?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would respond to the Senator from Washington, through \nthe Chair, and say that I think America understands this. Sure, we are \ngoing to be drilling oil in America--we need to, for exploration and \nfor production--but we know we only have 3 percent of the world's \nsupply of oil--3 percent--and we use 25 percent of the oil. So we can't \ndrill our way out of this.\n  Whether it is T. Boone Pickens or some friend of mine in central \nIllinois, it is obvious: You have to look for other solutions, and \nthose solutions mean the oil companies are not going to be the answer \nto every question. Unfortunately, the Republican side of the aisle, \ntime and time and time again, all they have to suggest is drill more \noil and make more money for the oil companies.\n  That isn't the answer to America's energy problem. If it were the \nanswer, we would have seen, as the Senator said, gasoline prices coming \ndown as we made more acreage available for drilling over the last \nseveral years. It has not happened. They have gone up dramatically.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. I have \nlistened to this debate, and it is not just the debate today on \nspeculation, about whether we should do that. It is whether we should \nbring energy tax credits, whether we should repeal oil company tax \nbreaks and whether we can invest in alternative energy. Every time, the \nonly answer we get from the other side is, no, we are not going to do \nthat. We want to drill more.\n\n  I would say to my colleague that drilling for oil is a false promise \nto the\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\nAmerican people that it will bring down their prices substantially as \nwe head off to our August break. Even their own Presidential candidate \nhas said drilling oil only brings psychological benefit. We don't need \nany mental health care. We need real reductions at the pump. Even \nPresident Bush's own energy experts say drilling more oil will not \nproduce a significant decrease in the price at the pump.\n  As I truly believe and I think most people understand in this \ncountry, until we invest in long-term energy independence, all we are \ngoing to do is see the oil companies get more profits and our prices go \nup. The bill we are offering today and hope to move to will begin to \ndeal with that and that addresses the issue of speculation. I hope we \nmove to that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nextraordinary impact of rising gasoline prices, the extraordinary \nimpact it is having on all Americans, and the parliamentary games of \nthose on the other side of the aisle.\n  The airline industry, truckers, ranchers, families who must travel to \nand from work and school, families going to buy groceries, all of them \nare experiencing dramatic increases in the cost of energy. These \nsoaring gasoline prices offer a glimpse at the effect home heating \ncosts will have on the American family budget this coming winter.\n  Today's energy crisis is focused on prices at the pump. But the \nNation's energy concerns stretch well beyond the pump. In the coming \nweeks and months, rising energy prices will be seen in the monthly \nbills for home heating, natural gas, electricity, and heating oil. In \nfact, this month, in Washington, DC, right here in this Capitol \nBuilding, we are operating our own Senate offices under an electric \nbrownout advisory. This is recent evidence that our electric grid is \nstressed. When it comes to energy, we need it all.\n  We need to develop domestic supplies of oil and gas. We need to \ndevelop nuclear energy. We need to develop renewable energy, such as \nwind and solar. We need to develop America's most affordable, secure, \nand abundant energy supply, and that is coal. In fact, coal to liquid \noffers great promise in reducing America's reliance on foreign oil \nimports.\n  We must also develop concerted policies to promote increased \nefficiencies, to promote increased conservation, and to reduce waste. \nIn summary, we must find more and use less.\n  On the subject of soaring gasoline prices, I must ask my colleagues: \nWhen is enough enough? When will this body be willing to address the \nunderlying issue of both supply and demand. Many are calling for \nchange. Few are offering meaningful solutions. Here are a few examples.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle want to tax their way to lower \noil prices. Increased taxes will result in higher prices and less oil \nand gas production, not more. Taxes will stifle our economic security. \nTaxes will not encourage economic security.\n  Many on the other side of the aisle think litigation is the way to \nbring down prices at the pump. The proposals I am cosponsoring choose \ninnovation over litigation.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle claim we can regulate our way to \nlower prices at the pump. They want to do it by penalizing oil and gas \nleaseholders. This approach shows very little understanding of the \nenergy development process. This approach offers no help, no help at \nall with the bureaucratic maze and roadblocks to finding more energy.\n  Some propose restrictions on price gouging by gas station owners, but \nthose same individuals fail to show any actual evidence of price \ngouging. In fact, the margins for the gas station retailers in this \ncountry are being squeezed. Rather than increased regulation, I support \nproposals that invest in inspiration, in ingenuity, and in productivity \ngains. I support technology gains that unleash the power of the private \nsector to develop short- and long-term energy solutions.\n  Some want to impose heavy-handed Government mandates to nationalize \nthe speed limit. Some are suggesting 55 miles an hour. I bring along a \ncopy of a newspaper that hardly ever makes it to the streets of \nWyoming. It is the New York Times, and this is this morning's paper. \nWhile the people of Wyoming do not read it, reporters from that paper \nactually went to Wyoming and covered Sheridan, WY.\n  There are five wonderful colored pictures of Wyoming and there is a \nnice map and it talks about Wyoming. On the front page of today's New \nYork Times, it talks about the Kerns family, a wonderful family in the \nSheridan, WY, area. They were at a town meeting I recently had and they \nwere talking about ranching. This summarizes it. When I hear people \npropose a 55-mile-an-hour limit, talk about ranch families such as the \nKerns--conservative, self-sufficient, and wanting mostly to be left \nalone.\n  That is what it is all about in Wyoming--conservative, self-\nsufficient, and wanting to be left alone. We do not need Washington \ntelling us how to drive and how fast. We can make those decisions for \nourselves.\n  I have the belief in the ability of Americans to choose for \nthemselves. I am confident the people of America, not Washington, will \nmake the right decisions. History has proven that American's self-\nreliance is an effective tool against rising energy prices.\n  American families right now are conserving in record numbers. They \nare carpooling, they are cutting back on the miles they drive, and they \nare purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles. Statistics show that this \nyear the year-over-year gasoline use is down roughly 2 percent. It is \nthe steepest drop in demand in the last 17 years. American families are \nresponding and they are responding without being told by the Federal \nGovernment to inflate their tires. Yes, that is what I heard yesterday \nin an Energy Committee hearing from an official: It is time to inflate \nyour tires.\n  American families are conserving. They are doing so without far-\nreaching Government mandates. American families are demanding and \npurchasing more fuel-efficient cars regardless of any timeline for \nenergy efficiency standards Congress may impose.\n  In fact, American families have done much more than simply conserve \non energy in the past several months. Some have dealt with serious job \nlosses. Many have struggled with housing deflation. We are all facing \ninflation at the grocery store.\n  You say: Is that happening everywhere? Wyoming has been in the news \ntoday. First, a front-page story in the New York Times and now a large \nstory in the Wall Street Journal today; the headline: ``Want to See \nInflation's Pressures? Try Wyoming, and Its $1.14 Bagels.''\n  There is a nice picture of a friend of mine, a bakery owner, Marsha \nAsbury, in Casper, and first it talks about this city. It talks about \n``this wind-raked city on the plains.'' It tells you we are committed \nto renewable sources of energy because we have a lot of wind in \nWyoming. But they talk about gasoline prices.\n\n       Gasoline prices, too, have risen sharply as they have \n     across the country. But it is the price of--\n\n  Actually it is what Ms. Asbury puts into her bagels that is causing \nher the trouble because it is causing the inflation. It says:\n\n       Most of her ingredients are shipped in from nearby states. \n     The prices have jumped dramatically this past year, as \n     suppliers struggle to recoup the high cost of trucking items \n     to Wyoming.\n       Heavy items have increased in price the most. The canned \n     jalapenos and pumpkin that Ms. Asbury uses for her specialty \n     bagels; the canned apples, for strudel; the sugar and flour--\n     all are up 35 percent in the past year. Butter and milk are \n     up 25 percent.\n\n  All because of the cost of energy and transportation fuels.\n  As it says:\n\n       Still, the rising cost at the pump hits hard, because \n     Wyoming drivers put an awful lot of miles on their pickups \n     and sport utility vehicles as they traverse this sparsely \n     populated state.\n\n  Yes, American families have moved beyond simply conserving. Now many \nare sacrificing. Despite the resilient response of the American people, \nthere is still no meaningful action from this Congress to address the \nfundamental supply and demand for foreign oil. The Senate leadership on \nthe other side of\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\nthe aisle will not allow a debate on bills that will actually increase \nAmerican energy supplies. Each of the provisions to increase American \nenergy offered by this side would be coupled with measures to improve \nconservation, to promote energy-efficient measures.\n  To be very clear, I agree with some of the components of the \nspeculation bill before us. In fact, several of these provisions were \nincluded in legislation I have cosponsored. Yet, as a matter of \nprinciple, I believe the Senate must act on a set of solutions rather \nthan pursue a piecemeal approach. It is not simply the soaring prices, \nbut it is America's reliance, America's dependency on foreign imports. \nCongressional leadership is opposed to even debating increasing \nAmerican exploration and production. With more American supply, there \nis a more secure energy future.\n  We have seen the same old responses from the other side of the aisle. \nThey approach the current energy crisis, such as nearly every other \npolicy challenge, with more taxation, with more regulation, and with \nmore litigation. Rural States such as Wyoming are especially hit hard \nby soaring prices. Mass transit is not an option. Prices are high and \nthe hundreds and hundreds of letters I received on this issue are a \ntestament to the real pain. Wyoming does contribute greatly to \nAmerica's energy needs. We are the largest producer of coal in the \ncountry; the largest producer of uranium; the second largest source of \nonshore natural gas; and we have world-class wind resources.\n  The citizens of Wyoming get it. We have been involved in domestic \nenergy production and transmission for decades.\n  The other side of the aisle simply says no to domestic energy \nexploration; no to American energy. America faces an energy crisis and \nan economic crisis. Continuing to rely on increasing amounts of foreign \noil leverages our country's future. It is time to focus on an American \nresponse: American energy efficiencies, American conservation, and, \nyes, American energy exploration. Our country deserves better and our \nchildren deserve better.\n  The massive transfer of wealth that is happening every day, from our \ncountry to overseas, is putting our children and our grandchildren's \nfuture at risk.\n  When is enough enough? I am asking those opposing American \ndevelopment, how much transfer of wealth is enough? How many hundreds \nof billions of American dollars must we send to foreign nations to buy \ntheir oil? How much of our Nation's great wealth must we transfer \nbefore it is acceptable to develop American resources? Is it $100 \nbillion? Is it $200 billion? Is it $300 billion? Apparently not.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle do not want to allow American \nenergy production through deep sea exploration, through oil shale \ndevelopment, through streamlined permitting. Their so-called responses \nleave America more and more reliant on foreign countries to provide for \nAmerica's energy. We can do better and we can do so in an \nenvironmentally sensitive manner, as we have done for the 118 years we \nhave been a State in Wyoming.\n  There have been extraordinary technological developments in oil and \ngas exploration and development. Provisions to address excess \nspeculation must be coupled with added supply and added conservation. \nWe must find more and use less. The rhetoric from the other side is all \nabout change. I think those blocking American solutions to foreign \nenergy dependence would do well to change their minds, change their \npolicy prescriptions, and change their approach on energy policy; \notherwise, this Congress will only be leaving American families with \nchange in their pockets at the end of each month.\n  I believe Americans want meaningful solutions, not merely change.\n  There is a difference. American energy is the most important issue \nfacing the American people today. American families are sacrificing. At \na minimum, at an absolute minimum, those same families deserve real \naction from this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from Wyoming \nfor his comments. His State of Wyoming and my State of South Dakota \nshare a border. We have a lot of very similar ways of making a living. \nWe share a commonality when it comes to the people we represent, their \nvalues. And he is exactly on point when he talks about the importance \nof energy to a State like Wyoming and a State like South Dakota and its \nimpact on the economy and how families in our States are struggling and \nsacrificing with this extraordinary challenge that faces our Nation \ntoday, and that is the high cost of energy.\n  I want to speak to that subject today as well because on Tuesday, \nJuly 22, the Interagency Task Force on Commodity Markets released its \nInterim Report on Crude Oil. I think it is important and it bears on \nthe debate we are having in the Senate today because the primary \npurpose of the bill that is before us, as put forward by the Democratic \nleadership as a solution to energy, is to focus on the very narrow \nissue of speculation in the marketplace.\n  Well, the task force is chaired by the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission and includes staff members from the Departments of \nAgriculture, Energy, and the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  Although its final report is not expected until September, I think \nthe interim report provides some valuable insight on the energy markets \nand the record increase that we are seeing in oil prices. The report \nconcludes that record oil prices are caused by the simple economic laws \nof supply and demand.\n  The report states:\n\n       Current oil prices and the increase in oil prices between \n     January of 2003 and June of 2008 are largely due to \n     fundamental supply and demand factors.\n\n  The report describes that worldwide demand for petroleum has greatly \nincreased over recent years due to population growth and rising \nincomes.\n  Specifically, the report states:\n\n       World economic activity has expanded to close to 5 percent \n     per year since the year 2004, marking the strongest \n     performance in two decades. Between 2004 and 2007, global oil \n     consumption grew by 3.9 percent, driven largely by rising \n     demand in emerging markets that are both growing rapidly and \n     shifting toward oil-intensive activities.\n\n  It continues to say:\n\n       China, India, and the Middle East are among the fastest \n     growing in the world; together they have accounted for nearly \n     two-thirds of the rise in world oil consumption since 2004.\n\n  The report also states:\n\n       Since 2003, world oil consumption growth has averaged 1.8 \n     percent per year, representing an estimated 1 million barrels \n     per day in 2008.\n\n  On the supply side, on the other side of the equation, the report \nalso details how the worldwide supply of oil is inadequate. Both non-\nOPEC and OPEC supplies are failing to keep pace with increasing demand.\n  The report states:\n\n       In the past 3 years, non-OPEC production growth has slowed \n     to levels well below historical averages, and world surplus \n     capacity has fallen below historical norms. Preliminary \n     inventory data also shows that the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development (OECD) stocks have fallen below \n     1996-2002 levels.\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       World oil consumption growth has simply outpaced non-OPEC \n     production growth every year since 2003. OPEC production is \n     also falling behind.\n\n  The report describes the failure to meet what they call the ``call on \nOPEC,'' which is the difference between global demand for oil and oil \nproduced by non-OPEC countries.\n\n       Since 2003, OPEC oil production has grown by only 2.4 \n     million barrels per day while the ``call on OPEC'' has \n     increased by 4.4 million barrels per day. As a result, the \n     world oil market balance has tightened significantly.\n\n  Recently, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets \nreinforced the Interagency Task Force's conclusion. This working group \nconsists of the Secretary of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  In a recent letter to congressional leadership, the Working Group on \nFinancial Markets stated:\n\n       Prices appear to be reflecting tight global supplies and \n     the growing world demand for oil, particularly in emerging \n     economies.\n\n  The Interagency Task Force and the President's Financial Working \nGroup\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\nhave concluded what several Members of Congress and, I think, what the \nmajority of the American people have known for a long time: we have a \nsupply and demand problem. The solution to that problem is to find more \nenergy, to produce more and to use less.\n  Now, with regard to the supply solution, we have lots of solutions \nthat are out there. We have talked about the North Slope of Alaska. We \nknow there are about 10 billion barrels of oil on the North Slope of \nAlaska. We have had numerous votes since I have been in the Senate, and \nprior to that in my service in the House, on opening the North Slope of \nAlaska to more production. Every time, it gets defeated by the \nopponents.\n  In fact, in 1995, it was actually passed by Congress, and it was at \nthe time vetoed by President Clinton. If it had not been vetoed back \nthen, we would have an additional 1 million barrels of oil in the \nUnited States each and every single day.\n  Ironically, we hear the same arguments against that today that we \nheard back then: that it will take 5 to 10 years to develop it. Well, \nthat is exactly the argument that was used in the debate 10 years ago. \nIf we had acted then, now, 10 years later, we would have that extra 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day available to us, which is the equivalent \nof about what we get from Venezuela.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf is home to about 18 billion barrels of \noil, and that, too, is off-limits. Some of the Outer Continental Shelf \ndata is almost 30 years old. There are estimates that there are 86 \nbillion barrels of undiscovered reserves that exist right off our very \nown coasts.\n  Oil shale--there are estimates of 2 trillion barrels of oil shale \nthat is currently off-limits; 800 billion barrels of that, of the U.S. \noil shale, could be economically recoverable.\n  Now, Saudi Arabia has the world's largest proven reserves of oil in \nthe world; that is, 263 billion barrels. The next largest is Iran with \n133 billion barrels, followed by Iraq with 115 billion barrels. Kuwait \nand Venezuela bring up the next, with 100 billion and 77 billion \nbarrels, respectively.\n  But the point very simply is that Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado may \nhave more oil than Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Venezuela \ncombined. Right now, U.S. energy companies are ready to invest billions \nof dollars in developing this domestic research. They are not asking \nfor Government funding. They are not asking for Federal financing. They \nare not asking for environmental exemptions or any kind of special \ntreatment.\n  All they are asking for is for the U.S. Government to govern. They \nsimply want consistent regulation that will allow them to move forward \nwith their research. Unfortunately, this Congress has said no--no to \nANWR, no to the Outer Continental Shelf, no to oil shale, no to coal to \nliquid, no to nuclear, no to all of the things that could lessen our \ndependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  Meanwhile, I think the American family is asking, why? Why will \nCongress not work to lower gas prices? Why is Congress standing in the \nway of American ingenuity? Why is Congress limiting access to our \nresources while we send, Americans send, $1.6 billion each and every \nsingle day outside the United States for imported oil to petro \ndictators around the world, where we are propping up and enriching \npeople in places such as Iran and Venezuela who have nothing but \nhostile intentions toward our country?\n\n  Well, it is past time for Congress to act on a supply solution. It is \ntime for us to deal with this issue of our supply, and it is also \nimportant that we deal with the issue of demand because, as I mentioned \nearlier, when you are talking about impacting supply and demand, you \ncan do one of two things. You can affect supply by increasing domestic \nproduction or you can affect the demand side by using less energy. I \nthink the solution consists of both, but neither are getting a vote in \nthe Senate.\n  Congress must invest in advanced technology, batteries and hydrogen \nfuel cells. Those are new technologies that we have to support, and we \nneed to continue to invest in renewable fuels. There has not been a \nbigger advocate in the Senate than I am of renewable energy. It is \nalready reducing domestic demand for traditional petroleum by about \n130,000 gallons per day.\n  We also need to address America's fleet of vehicles. Last year, \nCongress raised the vehicle efficiency standards by 40 percent to 35 \nmiles per gallon for cars and light trucks. I think we can and we must \ndo more. We should extend the tax credits for fuel-efficient hybrid \nvehicles.\n  I believe Congress should create a new tax credit for next-generation \nelectric plug-in hybrid vehicles which can go 20 to 40 miles before \nusing an internal combustion engine.\n  In addition to tax credits, Congress should require the production of \nflex-fuel vehicles. This week, a tripartisan group of Senators, led by \nSenator Brownback, introduced a bill that would dramatically change our \ntransportation sector. Senators Brownback, Lieberman, Salazar, Collins, \nand I have introduced the Open Fuel Standard Act, which essentially \nrequires that starting in 2012, 50 percent of new vehicles be flex-fuel \nvehicles that are warranted to operate on gasoline, on ethanol, on \nmethanol, or on biodiesel.\n  This requirement increases 10 percent each year until 2015 when 80 \npercent of new vehicles would be required to operate on renewable fuel.\n  We will never break OPEC's monopoly over our fuel supply without \nenacting bold policies. And the one I just mentioned is an example of \nsuch a policy. That bill would give consumers a choice at the pump and \ngive all consumers the option of purchasing cheaper, homegrown fuel \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel when it comes to addressing their energy \nneeds.\n  But the fact is, as I noted in the study that I cited, we cannot \nsolve America's energy problem by simply dealing with a narrow \nsolution, a minimalist solution such as that which has been put on the \nfloor by the Democratic leadership in the Senate. What they have \nattempted to do is to block the consideration of amendments that would \naddress those other issues that I think are so important to this \ndebate. There is not anything in this bill that was put forward by the \nDemocratic leadership that reduces the dangerous dependence that we \nhave on foreign energy. Now 60 percent of our energy is coming from \noutside the United States. There is not one thing in this bill that \naffects that.\n  They can talk about lawsuits. They can talk about taxing oil \ncompanies. You can talk about regulating, further regulating the \ncommodities markets. I am all for some of the things that are being \nproposed with regard to speculation and the commodities market. I, \nfrankly, think there are things in the bill that are good.\n  But the bottom line is, it does nothing. It does nothing to affect \nthe fundamental rule of supply and demand, which, as I just noted, is \nwhat is driving energy prices higher in this country. And if we try to \ndo something in the Senate or in Congress to address energy in this \ncountry and the tremendous economic impact it is having on American \nfamilies and businesses without going at this fundamental basic issue \nof increasing our domestic supply or domestic production and reducing \nour demand, we will not have done anything meaningful for the American \npeople to address the issue that is impacting their pocketbooks more \nthan anything else today; and that is, the high price of gasoline.\n  If you are serious about getting the commodities futures market to \nreflect or to bring down the futures price for energy stocks and all \nthis trading that is going on, the way to do that is to send a clear, \nunequivocal signal to the energy markets that America is serious, that \nAmerican ingenuity and hard work and our entrepreneurship in this \ncountry--that we are serious about increasing the domestic supply of \nenergy that we have, about increasing domestic production because the \nmarket will interpret that.\n  The market looks down the road and says: OK, in the future, what is \nthe price of oil going to be based upon the current supply of oil and \nthe current demand?\n  If we are serious about increasing supply and reducing demand, the \nmarket will reflect that. We will see lower prices per barrel of oil, \nper gallon of gasoline, and some relief for hard-working American \nfamilies and small businesses taking on tremendous water in their \npersonal households and in the\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\nneeds they have to meet for families because they are spending all \ntheir money, literally, to fill their cars with gasoline and to pay for \nthe high cost of energy. It is affecting literally every sector of the \neconomy.\n  South Dakota, as my colleague from Wyoming spoke to earlier, is a \nvastly rural State and sparsely populated, heavily dependent upon \ntransportation. The energy issue impacts in a dramatic way our ability \nto grow our economy and create jobs. I hope the debate today will \ninclude more than only a narrow issue and will get to the fundamental \nissue of supply and demand, that we can have an open debate in which we \nmay offer amendments so this issue will be addressed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe our side now has the next half hour. I yield \nmyself 20 minutes and 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I request the Chair to alert me when I am halfway \nthrough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on two issues, both \npending before us, both vitally important to the economy. One is \nenergy, one is housing.\n  We all know the pain Americans experience. We all know the price of \ngasoline. In New York, people are already anticipating, with fear in \ntheir hearts, the price of home heating oil to heat their homes in \nwinter. Everywhere else the costs of energy are driving prices higher, \ncreating a middle-class squeeze.\n  We had a hearing at the Joint Economic Committee yesterday. Elizabeth \nWarren, a professor at Harvard, outlined that squeeze. The average \nmiddle-class person is hurting. They have built up a good life for \nthemselves. Now they are hurting because, on the one hand, their income \nis not going up--productivity is but income is not--and at the same \ntime their costs are going much higher than the rate of inflation. So \nthey are caught in a vise--income declining, prices increasing.\n  This Friday night, there will be millions of Americans who, after \ndinner, husband and wife, will be sitting around the table talking \nabout the things they care about, their children and their futures, \ntheir health. But probably the No. 1 topic will be, how the heck are we \ngoing to pay the bills.\n  Democrats are here to try and finally, after 7\\1/2\\ years of being \ndominated on the energy debate by oil, oil companies, oilmen in the \nWhite House, change the debate. The other side has a simple solution. \nIt gets modified every couple of years, but it is basically the same. \nDo what big oil wants. When the price is low, give them subsidies. When \nthe price is high, make sure they don't pay much in taxes. All \nthroughout, focus our energy economy on oil, because that is what the \nbig oil companies want.\n  Rex Tillerson, the head of ExxonMobil, came before the Judiciary \nCommittee a year and a half ago and said: ExxonMobil does not believe \nin alternative energy. I guess if I were ExxonMobil, I wouldn't either. \nBecause as demand goes up and supply stays relatively flat, the price \ngoes up and the profits go up. I have been asking, what do the big oil \ncompanies do with their profits. A huge percentage goes not into new \nexploration. They say they want to explore, but a majority of the \nmoney, in some cases, and a plurality, in most, goes to buying back \ntheir stock to raise the share price for themselves and their \nshareholders. This idea that oil companies are eager to explore is \nbelied when we look at their financial statements. They are buying back \ntheir stock. It doesn't create one drop of oil. For the limited number \nof people who have ExxonMobil stock, that is a godsend. For the rest of \nus, it squeezes us even more. Chevron does it. BP does it. They all do \nit, with billions and billions of dollars. I believe last year \nExxonMobil took $29 billion to buy back their stock.\n  I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they are \nso eager for exploration, why aren't they putting that $29 billion into \nexploration? But they are not. Again, we have the answer from the other \nside: Big oil today, big oil forever.\n  The American people know we are not going to drill our way out of \nthis crisis. Even if the oil companies wanted to--and statistics show \nthey do not--we don't have enough oil to prevent the price from going \nup, because demand worldwide is dramatically increasing, in China, in \nIndia, in the Middle East. The number of new cars in China and India in \na short while will exceed the total number of cars in America, in 10 \nyears, 15 years. Imagine that, new cars in China and India competing \nwith us to buy gasoline. Obviously, the price will go up.\n  When our majority leader repeats over and over that we have 3 percent \nof the reserves and 25 percent of the consumption, there is no way to \nreduce prices significantly in the long term other than to get off our \ndependency on oil. So drilling is not the answer. Yes, in certain \nplaces, it may help. We are not opposed to that. I proudly went to the \nRepublican majority, got Democrats to vote for drilling in the gulf. \nBut it is not going to solve our problem. It will ameliorate it a tiny \nlittle bit in certain places, if you drill in the gulf and places near \nrefineries.\n  The answer is to ween our dependence from foreign oil and tell OPEC \nand Chavez in Venezuela and Iran to take a hike because we don't need \nthem anymore. They can't have their hands around our necks any longer--\neconomically, politically, or geographically.\n  The good news is, we can do that. We can do that on both sides of \nsupply and demand. That is what we Democrats are attempting to do. We \nare attempting to help get an electric car. Electric cars, no gasoline, \nwill ride as smoothly and as well but much more cheaply than our \npresent cars. They are not these little golf carts you drive around. \nYou can have a big SUV with a battery that goes 250, 300 miles, same as \na tank of gasoline, and drives with the same speed and the same power \nand the same torque. We are not too many years away from that, if we \nhelp create the battery. They have the battery. It just has to be mass \nproduced. We need some research to get that done in a cheap enough way \nso that the price of cars stays the same while the price of fueling the \ncars goes down.\n  Senator Bingaman will be here shortly. He put one of my proposals in \nthe Democratic proposal for housing conservation when you build. Forty \npercent of our energy is consumed not driving cars but cooling and \nheating homes, air conditioning and heating. If we were to adapt \nconservation measures, that could dramatically drop. One State has done \nit, California. California's energy consumption is lower than just \nabout any other State, even though they are a car culture. Why? Because \nin 1978, under Governor Jerry Brown, whom many regarded as ``Governor \nMoonbeam,'' this was an excellent idea that has proven successful; they \nput conservation in building standards for homes and offices. Now, in \nterms of buildings, their per capita consumption of energy is about \nwhat Denmark's is. Why don't we do it nationwide?\n  Then there is alternative energy. There was an op-ed in the \nWashington Post by an oilman, someone I know named Jim Tisch, who said \nthat now it is profitable to do wind power, solar power and other kinds \nof power and take our dependency off oil and gas.\n  We can both increase supply and decrease demand, reduce the price, if \nwe embark now on a program of change. When we have tried to do this, \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said no. Why? The \nbig oil companies don't like it. Some of the big utilities don't like \nit. The big special interests don't like it. But they are doing great. \nIt is the average middle-class person who needs the help.\n  The equation is simple. I will put it in stark terms, but I think it \nhas to be put that way: Republicans, big oil, the past; Democrats, \nalternatives, the future. Let me repeat that. Republicans, big oil and \nthe past; Democrats, alternatives and the future. Every American knows \nwhich side we want to be on.\n\n  I am sorry they have decided not to accept Majority Leader Reid's \ngenerous offer and take their proposal and our proposal and debate \nthem. We will do that any day of the week. I am sure Senator Obama is \neager to debate Senator McCain, who is following in the big oil \nfootsteps of George Bush and Dick Cheney.\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  I am sure he is eager to have that debate. When you ask people in \npolling, should we drill, they say sure. Then when you ask, can we \ndrill our way of the problem, they know we can't. We are going to \ncontinue to push. I hope and pray we don't have to wait for the next \nPresident to do this. I would like to see it done now, because we have \nwaited 7 years. We have had bills on the floor in the past: bills to \nraise mileage standards of cars, stopped by the auto companies; bills \nfor alternative fuels, stopped by the oil companies; bills to make sure \nutilities are more efficient, stopped by the utilities. When the price \nwas low, no one paid much attention. But now we are all paying the \nawful price. Let us change once and for all. There are short-term \nsolutions, whether with the SPR or tamping down speculation. But the \nonly long-term, real answer is to reduce our dependence on oil, move to \nalternatives and conserve more, consume more efficiently. I hope my \ncolleagues will do that. I hope we will look forward to the future and \nnot delay the future any longer and not look back at the past.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  The other bill that is before us now and upon which we will vote \nshortly is the housing bill. I urge my colleagues to support it. Unlike \nthe energy issue, I think we do have broad bipartisan support. I was \ndelighted to hear yesterday that the President changed his view and \nwill now support the bill Chairman Dodd and Congressman Frank have put \ntogether. I am very glad of that. It is a good bill. I have had some \nsignificant input into it, for which I thank both of them.\n  Housing is at the nub of the recession. Housing prices go down and \npeople don't have the money to do other things. That hurts. Homes are \nforeclosed upon and neighborhoods suffer. Even if you keep your home \nand even if your housing price is flat, mortgage rates go up. Since so \nmany people have adjustable rate mortgages, that hurts us as well. But \nhousing has been the bull's-eye of the economic crisis. For too long, \nWashington has twiddled its thumbs, despite the efforts of those on our \nside who want to do something and who have smart, rational, and \ntargeted plans. But now finally, because the crisis is screaming at us, \nthe President has agreed to support our legislation, and many on the \nother side, hopefully, will vote for it, as they did last week.\n  The housing bill has many important components. It has a plan that \nwill set a floor for some home prices. It is not a panacea, but it will \nhelp reduce the decline in home prices in many places, which is \ndesperately needed, and reduce the rate of foreclosure for several \nhundred thousand homes, which is also desperately needed. I would have \nliked to have seen that part of the bill be stronger. I would have \nliked to have seen the bankruptcy provisions put in there which would \nhave been a club and made them work a little better. They are not \nthere, but this is still good.\n  We also have in the proposal CDBG money. We held a hearing of the \nJoint Economic Committee where, from the community in Slavik Village, \npeople testified how empty and vacant homes were killing their \nneighborhood. I don't know what entity Slavik Village is in, what town, \nwhether it is Cleveland or somewhere else, but no local community has \nthe ability to deal with all these foreclosed homes. The only entity \nthat can is the Federal Government.\n  The CDBG money, which, thank God, now the President has dropped his \nopposition to, will buy up those homes and prevent the market from \ngetting worse and communities from deteriorating. Because when you have \nan abandoned house and some vandals come in and pull out the plumbing \nand electricity, and then it becomes a haven for drug dealers and \ncriminals, it ruins the whole neighborhood. The person living down the \nstreet, who has paid his or her mortgage and does not even have a \nmortgage anymore, suffers as well.\n  So this CDBG money, as well as the whole program we are putting \ntogether, is not simply aimed at those who cannot pay their mortgages. \nIt is actually aimed at the millions of homeowners who are hurt because \neven though they pay their mortgages, and even though they may have \nfinished paying their entire mortgage, their home prices decline \nbecause there are foreclosures in the community.\n  Then there is the part about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I think this \nis necessary. It is unfortunate we are at this stage but necessary. \nFannie and Freddie are at the center of our housing market, and the \nhousing market is at the center of our declining economy. If you are \nsimply going to say: Well, let Fannie and Freddie fail, let's learn the \nmoral hazard, you are hurting tens of millions of innocent people along \nthe way as you teach that lesson. That is why I do not think we should \ndo it.\n  Do we need tougher regulation for Fannie and Freddie? Yes. And in the \nbill is a much strengthened regulator. I supported that from the get-\ngo. But to allow Fannie and Freddie to deteriorate, and deteriorate as \ndramatically as they might have without a possible Government backstop, \nwould do far more damage than the Government backstop itself. The odds \nare, we will never have to use it. And when you add to that the odds \nthat we will use it but it will not cost all that much, they are \noverwhelming. But the alternative, the risk of looking into the abyss \nand letting the economy roll down--because if Fannie and Freddie were \nto go under, Lord knows what would happen in this economy--is not worth \nit.\n  I have spoken at length to Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke, \nboth appointees of the President, and they believe this is desperately \nneeded. I was surprised so few of our House colleagues voted for this \nproposal. Ideologs do not usually solve problems. They have a narrow \nway of looking at things. So if you say Government is always the \nanswer, you are going to mess things up. But just as equally, if you \nsay Government is never the answer, you will mess things up as badly. \nWe have a whole lot of people, at least in the House, who said: Don't \nget the Government involved at all. Let people suffer. That is for \ntheir overall good.\n  It reminds me of the old days when the Adam Smith theory said: Well, \nlet anyone sell any medicine they want, and if it is a bad medicine, \nand you die from it, your family will learn from it and you won't buy \nit again. It is an awfully harsh view of the world, and not a view most \nAmericans agree with.\n  In a somewhat less serious but serious note, this is the same thing \nwith housing. If you let the housing market go in the tank, so much \nsuffering will occur that the risk is not worth it. So this is a good \npackage. Is it what we would have done? No. Is it what Mr. Paulson \nwould have done on his own? No. But it is a fair and workable \ncompromise, and unlike the Energy bill, it is a place where we can all \ncome together and do something for the good of the economy.\n  I also do want to mention there is more money for mortgage \ncounselors. The Senator from Washington, you, I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I have been working hard to \nget more mortgage counselors in the bill, and there is $180 million \nmore for that, as well as $10 billion in mortgage revenue bond \nauthority, which will help States and localities to develop refinancing \nprograms--very important in my State. It is something the Presiding \nOfficer has supported, and I am glad it is in the bill.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, on energy, let's look forward to the \nfuture. Let's hope some of our colleagues will join us and not cling to \nthe answer: oil today, more oil tomorrow. We do not have it, given the \nincrease in demand.\n  On housing, let us move this bill forward quickly. Both are vital to \nthe future prosperity of our country, and both ought to become law \nwithout further delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe I have 10 minutes reserved to \nspeak in relation to energy legislation.\n  The first point I want to make is that the legislation the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, brought to the Senate floor addresses one of the \nthree aspects of the problem we face with high gas prices. I think all \nof us recognize there are three main factors that are resulting in high \ngas prices.\n  One is the problem with the functioning of our oil and gas markets, \nand specifically the problem of speculation and excessive investment in \nthese commodities. That is something Senator\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nReid has proposed to deal with in the legislation he brought to the \nfloor, and we are going to have a cloture vote on that legislation, I \nbelieve, tomorrow. I hope Senators will vote for cloture.\n  I also hope we can add to it some amendments. There is one amendment \nI am filing today at noon, along with Senator Reid and other Democratic \nSenators, that tries to address the other two factors that we know and \nall recognize impact the price of gas; that is, the supply: the supply \nof oil and, of course, a reduction in demand; how do we reduce the need \nto buy so much gasoline? This amendment talks about supply and demand, \nprimarily.\n  Let me briefly summarize what this amendment will try to do.\n  First, it promotes diligent development of existing leases. As we \nhave had many debates here on the Senate floor, I think most people are \naware there is a lot of the Federal land that is currently leased. The \nquestion is, how do we get more of it in a producing state? How do we \nencourage the companies that have those leases to move ahead more \nquickly?\n  What we do is we authorize the Secretary to take several steps to \nencourage more diligent development. We authorize the Secretary to \nshorten lease terms where appropriate to increase rental fees in later \nyears where appropriate, and generally to do a better job than we fear \nhas been done in connection with encouraging rapid development of these \nleases.\n  Second, we are suggesting that areas that have not been leased but \nthat could be leased should be looked at and, where possible, leasing \nshould occur.\n  Let me put up a chart in the Chamber that makes the point. I know \nthere has been a lot of talk about how the current moratoria on \ndrilling in this country is locking up 80-some-odd percent of all of \nour opportunity for drilling. Those are not the facts, as I understand \nthem.\n  As I understand it, there is 33 percent of the Outer Continental \nShelf that is subject to a moratorium that therefore, by law, is not \navailable for leasing.\n  There is 67 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf that is available \nfor leasing. What we are saying is, in that area where we have not yet \nleased--we have leased some of that, but there are other parts of it, \nsubstantial parts that have not been leased--let's do several things to \ntry to do more leasing.\n  First, we suggest that the Secretary go ahead and reoffer portions of \nthis 181 lease sale area. The first lease sale in the 181 area occurred \nin March. There were about 300,000 acres that were not bid on by \ncompanies. We think those should be offered again sometime in the near \nfuture. That is one of the provisions in this legislation.\n  We call for a doubling of the number of lease sales in the Gulf of \nMexico. Two-thirds of the Gulf of Mexico is not subject to moratoria, \nand we think in the areas that are not subject to moratoria we ought to \nhave more frequent lease sales.\n  Third, in areas offshore Alaska, we think, again, that the Secretary \nought to look and see if additional leasing can occur.\n  Let me put up another chart in the Chamber.\n  The current schedule for leasing carries us through 2012. This is the \nschedule of the Department of the Interior. They have 16 additional \nlease sales scheduled from now until the end of 2012, some of those \noffshore Alaska, some of those in the Gulf of Mexico. What we are \nsaying is, let's look and see if there are other lease sales that we \ncould have in the Outer Continental Shelf between now and 2012 to \naccelerate this.\n  We also propose there be an annual lease sale in the National \nPetroleum Reserve-Alaska. That is not in the Outer Continental Shelf. \nThat is onshore. But there is a very substantial area there, and a very \nsubstantial resource, as best we can determine.\n  On the Roan Plateau leasing in Colorado, again we are proposing that \n55,000 acres in that area be leased. This is estimated to contain 9 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  We are also proposing that Renewable Energy Pilot Project Offices be \nestablished to help facilitate use of public lands for renewable energy \nresources. I am talking about wind farms, I am talking about solar, \nconcentrating solar powerplants that are beginning to be built in the \nSouthwest.\n  Then, on the demand reduction side, we also have a series of \nproposals in this amendment that I think are meritorious.\n  One is a provision that has been passed through the Senate several \ntimes calling for an interagency task force in the administration to \ndevelop an action plan to save 2.5 million barrels of oil by 2016, to \nsave 7 million barrels of oil by 2026, and 10 million barrels of oil by \n2030--per day in each case.\n  We are proposing to expand the effort at the Federal, State, and \nlocal levels to promote telework and telecommuting.\n  We are proposing to increase support for public transit--transport \nsystems. Many of those systems, because of the high price of fuel, have \ncut back rather than being able to expand their capacity.\n  We are proposing a fuel economy indicator device be required on all \nvehicles that are sold in the country beginning in 2012. We believe \nthat would help to focus people's minds on the fact they are using \nsubstantial amounts of fuel and encourage smart driving habits to \nreduce fuel consumption.\n  We have a proposal for an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing \nIncentive Program. This would provide help to the automobile \nmanufacturing companies, but also to component companies, including \nthose that are making batteries so they can get on with the \nconstruction of the plants needed and the modernization of the plants \nneeded in that regard.\n  As far as advanced batteries are concerned, we believe we should have \nan interagency task force that develops a roadmap for advanced battery \ndevelopment.\n  We have a proposal with regard to tire efficiency labeling, since we \nare told by experts that tire efficiency labeling is one of the areas \nthat would improve vehicle fuel efficiency.\n  We have a proposal to require more energy efficient building codes \nthroughout the country. Again, we believe that would be a step in the \nright direction.\n  And, of course, we also have some provisions that the administration \nhas asked for with regard to the management of our own royalty on \nFederal leases. They have recommended that we repeal the mandatory Deep \nWater and Deep Gas Royalty Relief Act for Outer Continental Shelf \nleases in the Gulf of Mexico. We are suggesting that should be done as \npart of this amendment, and various other royalty management reforms \nthat have also been recommended by the administration.\n  To sum up, what we are trying to do in the amendment is, we are \ntrying to add to the bill responsible provisions that would help us \naddress the other two factors, in addition to speculation and in \naddition to problems with additional investment in commodity markets \nthat we think are impacting the price of gas. Taken together--the \nproposal Senator Reid has made that is going to be voted on tomorrow \nand these provisions related to supply and related to demand \nreduction--taken together, we believe we would be taking a positive \nstep on behalf of the American people to begin to moderate the price of \ngas at the pump.\n\n  I hope the amendment receives strong support. I hope we have the \nopportunity to offer it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a summary of the \namendment I have been talking about printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Section-by-Section Summary of the Democratic Amendment to the \n                            Speculation Bill\n\n       Amends S. 3268 to add at the end of the bill the following:\n\n\n                  Title II--Oil Supply and Management\n\n     Subtitle A--Diligent Development of Federal Oil and Gas \n         Leases\n       Sec. 201.--Diligent Development of Federal Oil and Gas \n     Leases.--Clarifies the requirement of existing law that all \n     federal oil and gas leases require the lease holder to \n     diligently develop in order to ensure timely production. \n     Requires the Secretary to issue regulations that set forth \n     the requirements and benchmarks for oil and gas development \n     that will ensure diligent development and production from the \n     lease during the initial lease term (to the maximum extent \n     practicable). Lessees are required to submit a diligent \n     development plan to the Secretary.\n\n[[Page S7219]]\n\n       Sec. 202.--Diligent Development in the National Petroleum \n     Reserve-Alaska.--Provides that leases shall be for a primary \n     term of not less than 8 and not more than 10 years with a 5-\n     year extension if drilling is taking place and so long \n     thereafter as production is occurring. The Secretary must \n     seek to maximize the timely production of oil and gas in \n     setting the lease term for new leases. Repeals the provisions \n     of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that allowed lessees to \n     renew their leases for up to 30 years. Sets the royalty rate \n     at not less than $3.00 per acre and requires the Secretary to \n     increase the royalty by not less than $1.00 per acre per year \n     for new leases.\n       Sec. 203.--Length of Lease Terms.--Provides that new \n     federal onshore oil and gas leases issued pursuant to the \n     Mineral Leasing Act shall be for a primary term of not less \n     than 5 years and not more than 10 years. The Secretary must \n     seek to maximize the timely production of oil and gas in \n     setting the lease term.\n       Sec. 204.--Rentals.--Sets rentals for nonproducing Federal \n     onshore oil and gas leases issued after the date of enactment \n     at $1.50 per acre and requires the Secretary to increase the \n     rental by not less than $1.00 per acre per year. Requires the \n     Secretary to set rentals for OCS leases at a rate determined \n     by the Secretary to maximize the timely production of oil and \n     gas and to increase the rents annually. The rents may be set \n     at a rate that takes into account differences in development \n     conditions.\n     Subtitle B--Acceleration of Leasing of Offshore Areas Not \n         Subject to Moratoria\n       Sec. 211. Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing in Portion of the \n     181 Area Authorized to be Leased Under the Gulf of Mexico \n     Energy Security Act.--Provides that the Secretary should \n     offer for lease within 1 year after the date of enactment \n     that portion of the 181 Area offered for lease in March 2008 \n     pursuant to the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act but not \n     leased.\n       Sec. 212. Acceleration of Lease Sales in Western and \n     Central Gulf of Mexico.--Provides that the Secretary conduct \n     an OCS lease sale every 6 months in the Western and Central \n     Gulf of Mexico. Allows the Secretary to conduct sales less \n     frequently if the Secretary determines it is not practicable \n     to conduct the lease sale every 6 months and provides a \n     report to Congress describing the reasons for holding the \n     sales less frequently and certifying that holding the sales \n     less frequently will not adversely affect production.\n       Sec. 213. Lease Sales for Areas Offshore Alaska.--Not later \n     than 1 year after the date of enactment, the Secretary shall \n     conduct a survey of oil and gas industry interest in oil and \n     gas leasing and development in planning areas offshore Alaska \n     that are not included in the 5-Year Plan for 2007-2012. In \n     any such planning area where there is a high level of \n     interest, the Secretary shall evaluate the oil and gas \n     potential of the area, the environmental and natural values \n     of the area, and the importance of the area for subsistence \n     use. The Secretary shall provide a report to Congress within \n     2 years after the date of enactment containing the results of \n     the survey and the evaluation. If the Secretary concludes \n     that leasing should be pursued further in the planning area, \n     the report shall describe the additional steps required by \n     law and the timeframe for conducting a lease sale. The \n     Secretary shall consult with the Governor of Alaska and \n     provide an opportunity for public comment in preparing the \n     report. The section does not modify any environmental or \n     other law applicable to leasing and development on the OCS.\n     Subtitle C--Acceleration of Leasing and Development in the \n         National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.\n       Sec. 221. Acceleration of Lease Sales for National \n     Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.--Provides that the Secretary \n     accelerate environmentally responsible competitive leasing in \n     the NPR-A to the maximum extent practicable, and conduct at \n     least 1 lease sale each year. The Secretary shall comply with \n     all applicable environmental laws.\n     Subtitle D--Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n       Sec. 231. Definitions.\n       Sec. 232. Modernization of the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve.--Directs the Secretary to exchange 70 million \n     barrels of light crude oil held in the SPR for 70 million \n     barrels of heavy crude oil. The sale of light crude is to be \n     completed within 180 days of enactment. The purchase of heavy \n     oil is to begin more than 365 days after enactment, but \n     within 5 years of enactment. The net proceeds generated by \n     the exchange are to be dispersed to the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services to carry out the low-income home energy \n     assistance program established under the Low-Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Act of 1981.\n       Sec. 233. Deferrals.--Encourages the Secretary to use his \n     existing authority to grant any request to defer a scheduled \n     delivery of petroleum to the SPR, if the deferral will result \n     in a reduced cost for the oil acquisition, or increase the \n     volume of oil delivered to the SPR.\n     Subtitle E--Resource Estimates\n       Sec. 241. Resource Estimates.--Requires Secretary of the \n     Interior to collect and annually report to Congress \n     information regarding resource estimates and federal acreage \n     under oil and gas lease and available for leasing.\n     Subtitle F--Sense of Senate on Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline\n       Sec. 251. Sense of Senate on Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline.--\n     Encourages all parties to work together to allow the Alaska \n     Natural Gas Pipeline to move forward and to negotiate a \n     project labor agreement.\n     Subtitle G--Roan Plateau Oil and Gas Leasing\n       Sec. 261. Short title.\n       Sec. 262. Findings and purpose.--Calls for the balanced \n     development of energy resources on the Roan Plateau in a \n     manner that minimizes environmental impact while increasing \n     leasing revenues.\n       Sec. 263. Definitions.\n       Sec. 264. Special Protection Areas.--Designates certain \n     special protection areas and requires the Secretary of the \n     Interior to manage them in a manner that prevents irreparable \n     damage.\n       Sec. 265. Phased Mineral Leasing.--Authorizes the Secretary \n     to issue mineral leases, except for the exploration or \n     development of oil shale, within the Roan Plateau Planning \n     Area. Provides for phased development of the Planning Area by \n     prohibiting the Secretary from issuing mineral leases within \n     more than one phased development area at a time.\n       Sec. 266. Selection of Subsequent Leasing Areas.--Provides \n     for the selection of subsequent phased development areas once \n     at least 90 percent of the recoverable natural gas has been \n     recovered from previously selected areas and 99 percent of \n     the ground disturbed in each previously selected area has \n     been reclaimed.\n       Sec. 267. Federal Unitization Agreements.--Requires each \n     lessee within the Planning Area to enter into a unitization \n     agreement.\n       Sec. 268. Record of Decision.--Preserves the June 2007 and \n     March 2008 records of decision.\n       Sec. 269. Conforming Amendments.--Makes leasing of Oil \n     Shale Reserves 1 and 3 discretionary rather than mandatory \n     and provides that leasing receipts will be deposited in the \n     Treasury for use in accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act.\n     Subtitle H--Export of Refined Petroleum Products\n       Sec. 271. Export of Refined Petroleum Products.--Requires \n     the President to report to Congress if net petroleum product \n     exports to any country outside of North America exceed 1 \n     percent of the total United States consumption of refined \n     products for more than 7 days.\n\n\n                    Title III--Oil Demand Reduction\n\n     Subtitle A--Oil Savings\n       Sec. 301. Findings.--Finds that dependence on foreign oil \n     is one of the gravest threats to the national security and \n     economy, and that the United States needs to wean itself from \n     its addiction to oil.\n       Sec. 302. Policy on Reducing Oil Dependence.--Establishes \n     the policy to reduce our dependence on oil.\n       Sec. 303. Oil Savings Plan.--Establishes an interagency \n     task force to publish an action plan to reduce oil \n     consumption by--2.5 million barrels per day during 2016; 7 \n     million barrels per day during 2026; and 10 million barrels \n     per day during 2030.\n     Subtitle B--Telework\n       Part I--Sec. 306. Incentive Programs for Reducing Petroleum \n     Consumption.--Requires each federal agency to promote \n     incentive programs to encourage federal employees and \n     contractors to reduce petroleum usage through telecommuting, \n     public transit, carpooling, and bicycling.

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill.\n  We are in an energy crisis. Don't let a 10 percent drop in oil prices \nfool you. We are in for a long battle with energy costs and America \nwill need to step up if we want to keep driving our cars, flying our \njets, and fueling our economy.\n  But this bill before us today isn't about lowering prices. it is \nabout finding someone to blame so Americans don't blame the Democrats \nfor failing to act in Congress.\n  Democrats need a scapegoat because under their watch America has \nbecome more addicted to oil than ever and gas prices have more than \ndoubled. They don't want to solve your problems. They don't want to \nface the environmental lobbyists who don't care how much Americans pay \nfor energy as long as it doesn't come from oil and coal. They want to \nfind someone to blame. They have blamed oil companies, Republicans, the \nMiddle East, and the military. Today it is energy speculators.\n  I say the time for scapegoats and politics is over. Americans don't \nwant excuses or even someone to blame--Americans want solutions.\n  They want to be able to afford to drive their truck to work every \nday. They don't want to worry about turning on the air conditioner or \nhow much it is going to cost to heat their homes this winter.\n  Back home in my State of Kentucky I have seen how much these prices \nare hurting families. I know many people who moved farther out into the \nsuburbs to get a bigger yard and more for their real estate investment. \nNow those same people are stuck using $4.50 gasoline for their workday \ncommute. Another community in eastern Kentucky is fighting to keep \nlocal bus service running to their senior center.\n  Many older Americans rely on bus and shuttle services to get out of \ntheir homes and are being cut off from their community services because \nof high prices. There are even places that have gone to a four-day \nschool week to cut back on the cost of busing students.\n  These people want solutions for energy prices, not more politics.\n  The best way to address high prices is to get more fuel on the \nmarket. America has domestic energy resources that we only need to open \nup.\n  I have supported bills and amendments that would expand offshore \ndrilling, start coal-to-liquid fuel production, encourage alternative \nsources of jet fuel, expand cellulosic biomass fuels, and many other \nissues. Facing these issues is what Congress should be working on.\n  For example, I think one part of our solution should be more offshore \ndrilling. More domestic oil means less we have to buy from the Middle \nEast, lower transportation costs, a more stable supply, and therefore \nlower prices. So why have the Democrats in Congress stopped us from \nacting on this one issue?\n  If it is because of the environment, I say we will make sure any new \ndrilling is the cleanest and safest in the world. If it is because we \nare not sure what to do with the Federal revenue, I am ready to discuss \nit and develop a compromise. What is the problem with letting \nindividual States choose whether or not to drill offshore? Even if it \ntakes a decade to get to full production, we have to start somewhere.\n  Congress should at least have the debate and vote on the issue. But \nevery time we try to address even one energy production issue, we are \nstopped in our tracks and blocked from offering amendments.\n  I am tired of watching this Democrat-led Congress do nothing. The \nenergy crisis has gone on long enough. We can talk all day about who to \nblame and make up excuses, but that won't bring down energy prices.\n  Instead, we find ourselves discussing another bill that tries to \nblame someone rather than address the problems of domestic production \nand supply.\n  The other side is selling you a bill of goods when they say this \nlegislation would impact energy prices. I hear they have a great deal \nfor you on a bridge in Brooklyn too.\n  This bill will undermine legitimate hedging activities and threatens \nthe liquidity of the commodities marketplace. Futures markets make it \npossible to buy and sell things at a specific price and date in the \nfuture. These markets allow participants to offset risk of price \nchanges to those willing to take risks.\n  This legislation would also make us citizens subject to foreign rules \nand regulations related to energy trading. Understanding U.S. laws will \nnot be enough, as energy traders will be required to consult with \nforeign boards of trade and will be subject to the regulations made by \nforeign governments.\n  This bill would also encourage traders to use foreign markets that do \nnot\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\nhave as many regulations and take American jobs and business activity \nwith them. But my principal concern with this bill is that it asks a \nFederal regulator, the CFTC, to wade into the marketplace and make a \ndetermination of what is and what is not legitimate trading activity.\n  Let me explain how this works. How many Americans stock up on an item \nwhen they see a good sale at the grocery store? I know I do. Or maybe \nsome people wait to buy in bulk with buy one get one free coupons.\n  While we don't resell our groceries to someone else, this simple act \nof timing our purchases or varying how much and when we buy is similar \nto what traders do in the commodities markets.\n  Now imagine the Government used this same legislation to regulate \ngrocery shopping that has been proposed for the energy markets. It \nwould mean the Government would keep track of all your purchases and \ndetermine whether you were a legitimate or non legitimate grocery \nshopper. Do you want the government penalizing you if they feel you are \noverbuying a certain product?\n  Buy too many hot dogs in 1 month and the Government could impose \nlimits on your purchases or keep you out of grocery stores altogether.\n  While this legislation isn't going to regulate grocery stores, this \nbill is the beginning of more government regulations that will limit \nyour options. Maybe next Congress will regulate the precious metals \nmarket and determine that buying gold jewelry is a non legitimate \npurchase, penalizing Americans who want to buy jewelry. Or will the \ngovernment say that collecting shotguns is a non legitimate purchase \nthat increases the cost of shotguns, allowing it to limit sales to gun \ncollectors?\n  Allowing the Government to over regulate any market is a recipe for \ndisaster that puts Americans' freedom at risk.\n  In America, we are proud of our open markets and lack of government \ninterference. We need the already established rules to stop illegal \nactivities such as price manipulation and cornering markets, but we do \nnot need new regulations that prohibit normal market activities, such \nas buying and selling commodities as an investment or as a price hedge.\n  I will support efforts to make the markets as transparent as \npossible. Information allows traders to most efficiently allocate \nresources and make sure prices actually reflect supply and demand. But \nI find it unreasonable to on the one hand say the market needs to be \nmore transparent so it can work efficiently, and then on the other \nmandate new requirements and regulations that will clog the market and \nprevent it from working normally.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation will not bring down energy \nprices.\n  However, there is something Congress and America can do about \nprices--we can produce more of own energy. I strongly believe that \nAmerica should use every resource it has to produce energy. Our \ndependence on Middle Eastern oil is worse than simply paying too much \nat the pump; it is a threat to national security. Every gallon of fuel \nwe make from biomass, domestic oil and gas, and coal is a gallon of \nfuel we don't have to buy from the Middle East. It is just that simple.\n  We need a Manhattan Project for energy in America.\n  The greatest minds we have should be working on ways to produce \nalternative fuel, capture and use carbon emissions, produce clean \nelectricity, and improve oil and gas production.\n  We should agree to take politics out of clean energy and ensure that \ngovernment programs are technology and feedstock neutral. Too often I \nsee tax incentives and programs that pick and choose what technology or \nprocess America should use.\n  To support all these alternative technologies, we need to change the \nway government spends money.\n  I think we should pick performance-based goals--like zero emission \nalternatives to oil--and let the marketplace decide the most efficient \nway to achieve it. If you can produce an environmentally sound \ntransportation fuel, we should not care whether it comes from coal or \nswitch grass.\n  If you can produce a megawatt of clean energy, we should not care if \nit comes from waste heat on a paper mill or from underground \ngeothermal. By opening up our options, we will get more for the \nGovernment dollar and America will see results faster. \n  I believe the most important alternative fuel technology is coal-to-\nliquids. We are sitting on a huge coal reserve that we can turn into \ndiesel for our trucks and aviation fuel for our planes. And our \nmilitary can no longer rely on imported oil from the Middle East. The \nAir Force has tested this fuel, and it burns cooler and cleaner than \nconventional fuel. It has less pollution as well. And I know that with \nthe right government incentives and carbon capture technology, we can \nmake coal-to-liquid fuel with less greenhouse gases than oil-based \nfuels.\n  Kentucky coal can help bring down the price of oil, provide a secure \nfuel for our military, reduce pollution, and create jobs.\n  While new domestic production will go a long way to bring down \nprices, we should also think about conservation efforts. There are the \nsimple things like turning off lights we don't use and more important \nmeasures like the increased fuel economy standards Congress passed. But \nthere are other ways to reduce fuel use using technology. For example, \nwe have a company in Kentucky that produces retrofit kits to reduce \ndiesel fuel use while trucks are idling.\n  The answer to America's energy problems is more domestic production, \nclean technologies, and conservation. We have the resources and know-\nhow to make clean energy, but for the last few decades our government \nregulations have held us back. We should not find more ways to over \nregulate our markets--we should vote now to open up domestic production \nand pursue promising alternative fuel technologies that will actually \nbring down the prices of oil and gas at the pump for the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, no issue at the present time is \nhitting Americans any harder than the high price of gasoline at the \npump. American families are hurting.\n  For a variety of reasons, we are paying more for a gallon of gas and \nmore to heat and cool our homes than ever before. There are a number of \nfactors contributing to rising energy costs, such as a weak dollar and \nan incredible surge in demand from the developing world.\n  It is not entirely clear what the magnitude of the role is that \nspeculators might be playing in this situation. For certain, \nspeculation is not the major contributing factor for $4-a-gallon gas. \nEven so, we have a responsibility to ensure that speculators aren't \ndoing something illegal or profiting at taxpayers' expense.\n  That is why I have joined 43 of my colleagues in introducing the Gas \nPrice Reduction Act, which will put more cops on the beat at the CFTC \nto ensure there is no foul play occurring between those participating \nin the oil futures market and those investing in the oil market itself. \nThis regulatory body needs more help so they can be more effective at \ntheir job and give the American people the kind of assurance and \ntransparency they should have about the work of this trading \nenvironment.\n  This act also commissions a study to better examine and understand \nthe influence these speculators have on the cost of oil.\n  We have heard much lately concerning speculators and what they may or \nmay not be doing to influence the price of gas.\n  On July 21, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Fed Chairman Ben \nBernanke, SEC Chairman Chris Cox, and the Chairman of the CFTC stated \nin a signed letter:\n\n       To date, the President's Working Group has not found valid \n     evidence to suggest that high crude prices over the long term \n     are a direct result of the speculation or systemic \n     manipulation by traders.\n\n  That is a pretty strong statement coming from the people we trust in \noverseeing major parts of our economy--the Secretary of the Treasury, \nChairman of the Fed, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.\n  While I believe speculators are an area of concern, the bigger \nproblem\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\nstems from simple economics and the law of supply and demand. Our \nefforts should be focused on getting right to the heart of the matter \nby working to increase our Nation's energy supplies and reducing our \ndemand. It is not enough to do one or just the other; we must do both. \nAccording to the International Energy Agency, global demand is 86 \nmillion barrels of oil per day and global supply is about 85.5 million \nbarrels per day.\n  While Congress's record in increasing energy supplies has been scant \nas of late, we have made progress in recent years.\n  In 2006, I helped negotiate, with Senator Nelson, the opening of 8.3 \nmillion acres in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. This area is estimated to \ncontain 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.25 billion barrels \nof oil, and it is currently open and available for exploration. This \narea was denied until 2006. It is now open and available for \nexploration.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act honors the compromise that was reached in \n2006, protecting Florida's gulf coast, while empowering other States to \nexplore for oil and gas if it is supported by the Governors and State \nlegislature.\n  I believe increasing our Nation's domestic energy supply is perhaps \nthe most critical component to lowering gas prices, and to overlook it \nwould be grossly unwise. In addition to increasing our Nation's \ndomestic supplies, I also believe we should have access to affordable \nalternatives.\n  Currently, Americans are paying a premium on Brazilian ethanol \nbecause we have a 50-cent-a-gallon tariff on Brazilian ethanol. If we \nmean what we say about offering cleaner, renewable alternatives to \ngasoline, I propose we eliminate this tariff. I plan to introduce an \namendment that does just that.\n  The amendment I am proposing would repeal the 54-cent-a-gallon tariff \non foreign ethanol that was extended for 2 years--December 31, 2010--\nunder the recently passed 2008 farm bill.\n  The 2008 farm bill also extended the blenders credit for ethanol \nproducers for 45 cents a gallon, which creates a trade barrier of 9 \ncents per gallon. Ethanol producers can also receive a small blenders \ntax credit of 10 cents a gallon if they produce less than 60 million \ngallons of ethanol per year.\n  My amendment helps to stop these protectionist policies and offers \nalternatives to hard-working Americans who are paying too much for gas.\n  On the other side of the equation, more must be done to reduce demand \nand promote conservation.\n  This Congress took a significant step by mandating CAFE energy \nstandards in the Energy bill we passed in 2007, which was the largest \nincrease in fuel economy standards in nearly 30 years. According to the \nDepartment of Transportation, these new fuel standards will save over \n55 billion gallons of fuel and save American motorists more than $100 \nbillion over time.\n  But that is not enough. These standards will go a long way in helping \nto increase fuel economy, but more must be done to foster the market \nfor efficient energy alternatives and other breakthrough technologies.\n  One of the more promising technologies in this area is advanced \nbatteries for plug-in hybrids. The Gas Price Reduction Act contains \n$500 million in research and development for advancements in plug-in \ntechnology and $250 million in direct loans for manufacturers who \nretool factories to produce plug-in batteries. It will help to make \nbatteries in many of the current hybrids more affordable and longer \nlasting.\n  In the long term, I envision a market where renewable fuels are \nviable and available and drivers will have affordable alternatives to \nfossil fuels such as gasoline. My State of Florida has been a leader in \nhelping to make this vision a reality. The State recently created the \nFlorida Energy Systems Consortium, which brings together researchers \nand resources from State universities to develop renewable energies.\n  The University of Central Florida--a member of the consortium--\nrecently announced it is receiving $8.75 million in grants to focus on \nhow technology can make new and existing construction projects more \nenergy efficient. In addition, with the help of $20 million from the \nState of Florida, the University of Florida is currently building the \nState's first biorefinery, which could produce clean cellulosic ethanol \nto power our cars.\n  As we continue to discuss the ongoing energy crisis, I urge my \ncolleagues to consider the consequences of failing to offer viable \nsolutions to the American people as they grow increasingly worried over \ndwindling energy supplies in America. Now is not the time for the \npolitics of energy. It is not the time for us to look for one-\nupsmanship in the political game. It is time for us to act on a problem \nthat is hurting American families throughout the State of Florida and \nthroughout the United States.\n  We need to address this problem. We need to put us on a track of \nfinding more and using less--a track that, where possible, is \nenvironmentally safe, where we can produce more domestic energy, while \nat the same time turning loose the energies of this Nation, the \ntechnology, to look for future opportunities for different blends of \nfuels, different types of automobiles, and other ways we can improve \nthe efficiency of our fleet so that we can increase the opportunity for \nthe American people to live in a world that is cleaner and in which \nthey can afford to drive their kids to school and go to work. When we \nhave alternative fuels available, they may not have to be totally \ndependent upon fossil fuels or imported oil.\n  I believe this is imperative, and it is an issue of national security \nproportions. We cannot continue to transfer our wealth overseas. We are \ntransferring, year after year, $750 billion to countries that are not \nparticularly our friends. Some of them, in fact, would be considered \nhostile to us. Nonetheless, we purchase oil from them because of our \nnecessity; our need is too great.\n  The fact is, we know there is plenty of political opportunity on both \nsides of the aisle on this issue. The American people are focused on \nthis, and the American people are saying: Please do something about \nthis. Hear our cry for help.\n  I say that this is the time for bipartisan cooperation, for us to \ncome together, Republicans and Democrats, put partisan interests aside, \nput American interests first, and look for ways to cooperate, work \ntogether, and do what is doable, do what can be done.\n  On five occasions, I have voted to open ANWR to oil exploration. \nWhether that is acceptable or not, let's come together and decide. I \nwould be prepared to support that once again. If that is a deal-\nbreaker, let's not go there. Let's look for those common-ground areas \nwhere we can agree and move forward with a comprehensive energy plan.\n  Let's not say we have done our job by simply looking at speculation \nas a scapegoat. We can deal with that and add transparency to it, but \nthat is not an answer in and of itself.\n  We have to have a comprehensive approach that tackles the issue of \nsupply, that tackles the issue of demand, where we have more oil \navailable, where the supply is increased from domestic production, \nAmerican production on America's lands and shores, and where we can \nalso reduce our consumption, utilize less. That will make America a \nsafer place. Then we can go home for this August break and face our \ncitizens and let them know we did a job they sent us here to do; not to \nplay politics but to get the job done for the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I was in the House of Representatives for \n14 years and have been in the Senate for a year and a half, as has the \nPresiding Officer. During that time, all of us have noticed when there \nis a spike in oil prices, as there has been obviously intermittently \nfor decades in this country, we can always ascribe a spike in oil \nprices to one of several factors: either a major fire in a refinery or \nthere might have been an outage on a pipeline somewhere in our country. \nIt might have come from something such as Hurricane Katrina, some major \nnatural disaster in our country that\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\ncaused a disruption of oil supplies, or it may have come from an \ninternational incident where there would be, again, a disruption in oil \ngetting to our country, some major international incident. So it has \neither been a refinery fire, pipeline outage, a Katrina-type disaster \nor some interruption in foreign oil supplies coming to this country.\n  That is what it used to be. The huge increase in oil prices, the fact \nthat since George Bush and Dick Cheney came to the White House, two \noilmen in the White House, oil has gone from $30 a barrel to quadruple \nthat number, that gasoline prices have gone from roughly, I believe, no \nmore than a couple dollars a gallon--less than that back then--to about \ndouble that now, that has been for different reasons. It is pretty \nclear, because there has not been a major outage of a pipeline, a \nrefinery fire or a disruption because of a natural disaster or because \nof a foreign international incident, that something else has happened. \nThat is why Senator Reid's legislation is on the floor today because we \nknow part of the reason for prices doing what they have done is \ncertainly there has been more demand from China and India, but that \ndoes not account for the doubling and tripling of prices when, in fact, \nso much of this is about the issues of gaming the system by the oil \nindustry, whether it is price fixing in some sort of way that the \nJustice Department should go after or mostly what this bill is about, \nspeculation.\n  It is clear that kind of hanky-panky has gone on in the oil market. \nYou don't have to look very far to figure that out, that it is not just \na question of supply and demand.\n  The other factor compounding this--even though I hear my friends on \nthe Republican side of the aisle talk about we need to do more \ndrilling, and I am fine with that. But the fact is there are 68 million \nacres out there--2\\1/2\\ times the size of my State, the State of Ohio, \n2\\1/2\\ times the number of acres of the State of Ohio--there are 68 \nmillion acres on which the oil companies have leases. Yet they are not \ndrilling in most of those 68 million acres. If they are committed to \nproducing more oil to bring prices down, they would begin drilling in \nfar more of those acres than they talk about drilling in.\n  So why should we, again, in this institution, the Senate, and as I \nsaw for years in the House, buckle to the oil industry? Why should big \noil always have its way here? Why should Wall Street always have its \nway here? That is why Senator Reid's bill on speculation is so \nimportant, empowering the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \nempowering the Justice Department to go after the oil industry on price \ngouging.\n  It is clear we need a more aggressive Federal Government, a more \naggressive administration. Again, we have had two oilmen in the White \nHouse. Look what happened in these 8 years to oil prices.\n  I beseech my colleagues to support Senator Reid's speculation bill, \nand I beseech the President to be more aggressive with his Justice \nDepartment to go after the oil companies that are price gouging and to \nempower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to go after Wall \nStreet on some of this speculation. It is pretty clear that is the \nbiggest reason for these price increases, and it is important the \nFederal Government get behind efforts to do all we can to rein in the \ncost of oil for truckers, for motorists, people who are getting \nsqueezed and hurt so badly by these increasing oil prices.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to share with my \ncolleagues the good news: that we are about to pass, I believe, after \nmany weeks and months, numerous votes on countless amendments on the \nfloor of this body, as well as efforts in the other Chamber, the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.\n  I am going to share some thoughts on where this is and what is \nincluded in this bill that passed the House yesterday and is pending as \none of the matters that will be considered in the next 24 to 48 hours \nby this Chamber.\n  My first expression of gratitude goes to the majority leader, his \nstaff, and others, along with the minority leader's staff, particularly \nthose on the floor who have been very patient.\n  In the case of the majority leader, he has been far more patient but \ntremendously supportive of this effort. This has taken a long time and \nhas gone through a lot of different processes over the last number of \nmonths to get to the point where we are today: on the brink of passing \nthe most sweeping housing legislation in more than a generation, that \nwill particularly focus on trying to keep people in their homes.\n  There are literally thousands every day who face the prospect of \nforeclosure. This legislation will not protect everyone, but it will \nmake a difference in the case of thousands, as well as many of the \nprovisions which I will address in a minute or so. But I begin by \nexpressing my gratitude to those who made it possible for us to get to \nthis point.\n  Again, the majority leader and his staff played a critical role. \nSenator Shelby of Alabama, former chairman of the Banking Committee, \ntoday the ranking Republican of that committee--we would never have \nbeen able to succeed at what we achieved without him and his staff and \nthe work he has done on the committee. We were able to mark up this \nbill several weeks ago and bring it to the floor of the Senate on a \nvote of 19 to 2, and that was because of the work of Senator Shelby and \nothers, along with, of course, the wonderful staff I have as part of \nthe Democratic majority of that committee and as chairman of the \ncommittee. They worked well together. They spent countless hours. Last \nweekend alone, they were up until 2 o'clock, 3:30 in the morning trying \nto iron out details with ourselves and with the leaders in the House of \nRepresentatives. There are a lot of people who can claim credit for \nhelping us get to this point. I wish to recognize them and I will \ncontinuously over the coming days as we move beyond this legislation.\n  But it is very important to know that people who never get a chance \nto speak in this Chamber but who put in the countless hours, the staff \nwho work on these bills, work in our respective offices, work for the \ncommittees, do tremendous work on behalf of the American people. I, for \none, am very grateful to all who made such a difference in bringing us \nto the point of stepping up and doing something about this economic \ncrisis, which at its heart, of course, is the housing crisis, and \nbehind all that is the foreclosure crisis.\n\n  I wish to share some views on what the bill does and why this moment \nis important beyond the specifics of this bill.\n  In my view, we should have and could have acted months ago on this \nlegislation. Regrettably, there are still one or two Senators who are \ndoing everything and anything they can to block this bipartisan \nlegislation from going forward, delaying the kind of relief American \nhomeowners, and so many others, desperately need to get our economy \nmoving in the right direction.\n  Yesterday, the President of the United States agreed to sign this \nlegislation. That was a reversal. Only a few days earlier they \nannounced they would veto the bill. But yesterday they made the \nannouncement they are going to accept this legislation and they are \ngoing to sign it into law.\n  Let me say how grateful I am to the President of the United States. \nWe are of different political parties. We have different views on many \nissues. But I thank him. It takes a big person to recognize a mistake, \nin this case announcing a veto and then changing your mind and saying, \nin fact, this legislation deserves passage. I appreciate President \nBush's willingness to come to that point of view and to make that \nannouncement and to virtually, I hope, guarantee the adoption of this \nlegislation and to begin working to make a difference in people's \nlives.\n  As many of my colleagues know, we are in the midst of the most \nserious economic crisis to face our Nation in many years. Certainly, \nthe American people live it every day. They don't need to read the \ndata; they live the data, whether they are losing their\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\njobs, losing their homes, watching the value of their stocks, their \npensions, their 401(k)s. All are worth less today than they were even a \nfew weeks ago. So the American people do not need a tutorial on whether \nthings are tough out there. They are living it and their families are \nand they want to know whether their Government is doing anything about \nit to make a difference.\n  Income is stagnant, and for many people it is falling at precisely \nthe time Americans are experiencing increasing costs in their daily \nlives. The source of wealth creation in this country has been damaged \nbadly. Housing, which is a source of great wealth creation for many \npeople, is losing value. Stocks, we know, have lost value. Bonds are \nlosing value. These are the items upon which many Americans, through \nmutual funds and other vehicles, are able to increase their wealth, \nincrease their security, prepare for their retirement, assist their \nchildren to achieve a higher education and to lead decent lives with a \ndegree of happiness and hope that Americans ought to expect, living in \nthis great country of ours. But all these items have been badly damaged \nover the last number of weeks and compound that loss of wealth creation \nwith the fact that gasoline prices are going up, food costs are going \nup, health care costs are going up, and the cost of an education is \ngoing up. At the very time the source of wealth creation is going down, \nthe cost of living is rising.\n  Unemployment numbers are also worrisome. In the month of May, we saw \na one-half of 1 percent increase in unemployment. That is the largest \nsingle monthly increase in unemployment in 22 years in our Nation.\n  The root cause of all this--again, you don't need to know all this \nbecause you have been feeling it--the root cause of all this is the \nvirtual collapse of the housing market that, in my view, did not have \nto happen. This did not have to occur. This is not a natural disaster. \nIt is not a hurricane or a cyclone or a snowstorm. This is a problem \nthat was created because the people responsible for being the cops over \nthese institutions were not doing their job. As a result, we are in the \nmess we are in today.\n  I do not want to oversimplify it, but virtually that is what \nhappened. The collapse was caused by what the Secretary of the Treasury \nhas described as ``bad lending practices'' that were at best ignored \nand, in crucial respects, knowingly tolerated, if not encouraged, by \nGovernment officials over the last number of years. As a result, every \nsingle day in this country, Madam President, 8,000 to 9,000 of our \nfellow countrymen are entering into foreclosure. Home prices nationwide \nhave dropped by the largest and most precipitous amounts since the \nGreat Depression back in the 1930s. Tens of millions of Americans have \nwatched their retirement savings, their pension funds, and the value of \ntheir homes fall by alarming amounts.\n\n  Madam President, I want to remind my colleagues that this legislation \nhas proven time and time again to enjoy strong bipartisan support. \nAgain, without the work of my partner in all of this, Senator Shelby, \nwe wouldn't have arrived at that remarkable result. But my colleagues \nwho have been with us on all of this, those who have added their ideas \nto this legislation, who have brought thoughtful proposals and added \ncomments as well as specific ideas, deserve a great deal of credit for \nthis as well.\n  Shortly before we left for our July recess, this piece of legislation \npassed this Chamber by a vote of 79 to 16. Yesterday, in the House, the \nbill received a bipartisan vote of 272 to 152. It is time to take up \nthis bill one last time and send it to the President for his signature.\n  Let me review for my colleagues, if I may, exactly what it is we are \nworking so hard to achieve. The bill we are about to adopt, and that we \nhave worked on for weeks and months, has a number of key elements, all \nof which have been supported by the strong bipartisan votes in this \nbody. First, we have the HOPE for Homeowners Act, which we are told \nwill help somewhere between 400,000 to in excess of 500,000 Americans \nkeep their homes and avoid going into foreclosure.\n  My hope, Madam President, is that number will actually be larger than \nthat. That is a low estimate but certainly an important one. These \nfamilies were simply seeking the American dream of home ownership. \nSadly, in case after case after case, they were led astray. They were \nsteered into mortgages they couldn't afford, and the people who steered \nthem into those mortgages knew it because they were going to make their \nmoney quickly, and then they were going to sell the mortgage, move on, \nand never be accountable. In my view, these people should be going to \nprison for what they did.\n  I know people say that is a harsh conclusion, but to knowingly lure \nsomeone into a financial arrangement you know they could never afford, \nand to know full well they would end up defaulting on or falling \nbehind, to me, that behavior is reprehensible and people ought to be \nheld accountable. I am speaking of those who knowingly engaged in a \npractice that caused so much harm in our country. These are cases where \noften the mortgage brokers and loan officers pretended to be trusted \nfinancial advisers but were exactly the opposite. They had no intention \nand were doing nothing when it came to advising and providing help to \nthese borrowers at all.\n  In fact, we now know, according to the Wall Street Journal, over 60 \npercent of the people who were talked into subprime loans actually \ncould have qualified for a conventional mortgage at far lower cost to \nthem than what a subprime mortgage cost. Sixty percent of these people \nwere lured into that category by people who knew they had an \nopportunity to qualify for something that would have cost them far less \nthan they ended up paying.\n  Anyway, this part of our HOPE for Homeowners Act is a voluntary \nprogram that will help save these homes by forcing the lenders who \nchose to participate to take some losses. These are not bailouts. The \nborrowers will have to pledge at least 50 percent of all new equity and \nfuture appreciation in order to get the benefit of a new reduced \nmortgage at a fixed rate that they can afford to pay. So the lender \ntakes a haircut. They are not going to get what they thought they were \ngoing to get, but they are not going to get zero; and the borrower gets \nto stay in his or her home. They are going to end up paying that \ninsurance and also contributing a part of the equity that will increase \nover the years to compensate for this program.\n  There are many protections built into this program. Only homeowners \nwill qualify; no speculators, only homeowners. No investors or \nspeculators will be allowed to participate. Borrowers will have to show \nthey cannot afford their current mortgages, and all loans will be \nunderwritten at a level the borrower can afford to pay. New loans will \nbe at 30-year fixed rate mortgages.\n  All of this is done at no cost to the taxpayer. In fact, over the \nnext 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that the \nprogram will actually raise some $250 million for the Treasury of the \nUnited States. This provision, combined with the government-sponsored \nenterprises--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the home loan banks--regulatory \nreform of this bill, passed the Banking Committee 19 to 2, as I \nmentioned earlier.\n  Now, let me put to rest, if I can, an issue that has been raised. I \nhave just described what this will do for that borrower who is with \nthat very distressed mortgage. I can hear someone out there listening \nto these remarks and saying: Well, Senator, I live next door, and I \nhave a mortgage I would like to get reduced as well. Now, I am not at \nrisk of losing my home because I have my job and, frankly, I got a \nmortgage at a time when my broker and my banker worked out an \narrangement that I could afford to pay. But why is that neighbor of \nmine getting this deal and I am not? Is that fair?\n  That is a good question. Let me say to you, as a borrower, first of \nall, I want to keep that borrower, if I can, in a home. If you are in a \nsimilar problem, we want to do what we can to help you. But you don't \nwant that neighbor of yours to go into foreclosure. If your neighbor \ngoes into foreclosure, then the value of your home that day begins to \ndecline dramatically. The last thing any neighbors want on a block is \nforeclosed properties. So for every 8,000 or 9,000 people who go into \nforeclosure today, as they will, there are 16,000 people who live next \ndoor to that foreclosed property. And when the value of\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\nproperties go down in a neighborhood, crime rates go up, and it just \nspirals further and further down.\n  So I hear what you are saying. But if you think carefully about how \nthis actually helps you as well, by keeping that homeowner in that \nhouse, keeping up the value of your property, then everyone benefits. \nSo to those out there who wonder why everyone is not going to get a new \nmortgage at a rate they can afford, the value of this program is to try \nto put a tourniquet, if you will, on the hemorrhaging that is going on. \nThere are 1.5 million people who have lost their homes in the last \nyear. It is predicted by some--Credit Suisse being one--that one out of \nevery eight homes, if we don't act, will end up in foreclosure in the \nnext 5 years. Obviously, that is an intolerable situation in our \ncountry.\n  So this legislation is designed to provide hope not only for the \nhomeowners but hope for the neighborhoods and communities being so \nadversely affected by this present problem. We desperately need this \nlegislation. And as I have said repeatedly, every day we wait, some \n8,000 to 9,000 foreclosures are filed. In fact, the delays we have \nsuffered over the last number of days have caused an awful lot of \npeople whom we might have been able to help to find themselves without \na home.\n  Remember, these aren't just numbers. I have been citing numbers to \nyou--a million and a half, 8,000 to 9,000, and how this program would \nwork. But for every one of these numbers there is a family. Just \nimagine tonight that you had to go home and tell your husband or your \nwife or your children: We are no longer going to live here. We can't \nafford to stay here. This has been our home, but we have to find some \nother place to live. I don't know of anyone who would like to come home \ncarrying that message because someone lured them into a mortgage \nknowing full well they could never afford to pay the fully indexed \nprice.\n  These numbers don't speak about the human tragedy and the cost beyond \nthe financial implications. So the importance of this legislation goes \nto the heart of who we are as a people, that sense of optimism and \nconfidence. That fulfillment of a dream--of owning a home and raising a \nfamily, living in a quiet, safe neighborhood--for many people is no \nlonger going to be there because these foreclosures are occurring at \nsuch a rapid rate around our country.\n\n  In late June of this year, Census reported that the home ownership \nrate, after reaching an all-time high in 2005, has fallen to a little \nover 67 percent, the sharpest annual decline in 20 years. According to \nthe New York Times, minorities, who are disproportionately likely to \nget subprime loans, are suffering especially badly. That is why this \nlegislation is widely supported by community and civil rights groups, \nfinancial institutions, and others. They see a generation of wealth \nbeing lost as a result of this foreclosure crisis.\n  The Senate expressed its strong bipartisan support of the HOPE for \nHomeowners Act when it defeated an amendment that was offered to strip \nout this program entirely. To the credit of my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, we voted 69 to 21 to keep this program a part of this \nbill.\n  I want to make people understand something. There is no miracle here. \nI am not suggesting to you that this is going to work perfectly. It is \nour best judgment that this voluntary program could make a difference, \nand my hope is it will.\n  The second part of the bill, Madam President, includes the FHA \nModernization Act. This passed early in April of this year as part of \nthe Foreclosure Prevention Act by a vote of 84 to 12. The provisions in \nthe current bill are identical to that legislation that I authored \nearlier this year, with the exception that the loan limits have been \nincreased in high-cost areas to a maximum of $625,000.\n  As the administration has repeatedly said, the modernization of the \nFederal Housing Administration will put it in a better position to keep \nfuture borrowers away from abusive subprime loans.\n  Thirdly, this legislation creates a strong, effective, world-class \nregulator for the housing government-sponsored enterprises--Fannie Mae, \nFreddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. These entities have kept \nthe housing and conforming mortgage markets going while other capital \nmarkets have literally frozen. We need to make sure these crucial \nmarket players are appropriately capitalized, well regulated, and \nproperly supervised so the American people can continue to depend on \nthem to ensure that affordable mortgages will always be available. \nRecent losses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac speak to the urgency of \nthis need, and the legislation before us accomplishes that goal.\n  In addition to the government-sponsored enterprise portion of this \nbill, we have created a new permanent affordable housing fund that will \nhelp finance the construction and preservation of affordable homes and \napartments across this Nation. Again, the need for this is growing, \nespecially as the foreclosure crisis is pushing more and more families \ninto rental housing. Again, the Senate spoke forcefully in support of \nthis program when an amendment was offered by a Senator in this body to \nstrike that entire program. My colleagues, again Democrats and \nRepublicans, voted 77 to 11 to keep this permanent affordable housing \nprogram.\n  The bill also includes $3.9 billion for community development block \ngrant funds to help communities across the Nation revitalize \nneighborhoods that have been devastated by foreclosures. This provision \nhas strong support from the Nation's mayors, community groups, \nreligious organizations, housing groups, and civil rights organizations \nas well. Unfortunately, we can't stop every foreclosure, but these \nfunds will help our communities deal with the fallout of this terrible \nproblem and help stabilize and renew our hardest hit communities.\n  There are important sections of the legislation that help our \nNation's veterans find and keep housing and provide them with housing \ncounseling. We increase housing counseling money in this bill so we can \nhelp people avoid the scourge and trauma of losing their homes to \nforeclosure.\n  There are a number of important tax provisions, and I want to commend \nmy friend and colleague from Montana, Max Baucus, and Senator Grassley \nof Iowa. The Finance Committee did a terrific job with this bill. They \ngot rid of some onerous, and I think wrong, tax provisions that had \nbeen adopted earlier and included some wonderful provisions to help \nfirst-time home buyers, as well as to provide some assistance in the \narea of encouraging additional investments in our housing areas.\n  So I want to commend Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley and members of the \nFinance Committee for the additions they have added to this bill that \nare going to make a significant difference.\n  Finally, the legislation includes important standby authority, which \nwas requested by the Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson. He worked \nall weekend, two weekends ago, with various other people to do what \nthey could to figure out how not to lose the major investments in our \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, and he came up with this idea of \nstandby authority. Now, it is unprecedented the authority he is asking \nfor, but Hank Paulson impresses me as someone who has thought about \nthis. He has spent a lifetime in the private sector and knows and \nunderstands these issues pretty well. And I know for a fact that he \nreached out to a lot of other people in the country as well, not of his \nown political persuasion but people he respects, and listened to them \nas they crafted this standby authority.\n  My colleagues have raised some very good questions about it. We had a \nlong, almost 5-hour hearing on the Banking Committee last week where \nHank Paulson and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and \nChristopher Cox of the SEC, sat there for 4\\1/2\\ hours and answered \nquestions from 22 members of the Banking Committee about this proposal. \nAnd there are legitimate issues about it.\n  I see my friend from New Mexico here, the former chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and we asked questions that he would have asked in \nthat committee, and I think we answered them as well as we could.\n  But I think Hank Paulson has it about right. This authority is going \nto be critical if we are going to encourage people to stay involved in \nthis critically important area of liquidity to the\n\n[[Page S7226]]\n\nhousing market. So I know my colleagues are concerned about this 18-\nmonth proposal, and that is how long it will last, but we will watch it \ncarefully. Any authority that he would seek would be subject, of \ncourse, to the debt ceiling limit, which the Congress can impose at any \npoint to slow this down. But the idea that the authority is there will \ngive us, I think, the needed security that many global investors--and I \nwant to point out they are global investors these institutions need in \norder to stabilize them at a critical time when there are significant \njitters about whether these institutions can survive.\n  So, Madam President, this provision is one that was added by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, added by the administration, but Senator \nShelby and I believed it was worthy of inclusion in this bill, and that \nis why we included it.\n  In short, this is a good, balanced bill. In many ways it is almost \nlandmark legislation. It has taken a long time to get here and \nunfortunately it took some bad news for us to build the support this \nbill needed. But we are where we are.\n  This bill is going to make a difference almost immediately. In fact, \nwe are seeing a difference already in the markets around the country--\nand around the world, for that matter. This bill has very broad \nsupport, including from the Conference of Mayors, the League of Cities, \nthe Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the \nConsumer Federation of America, the National Association of \nHomebuilders, NAACP, ACORN, the Financial Services Roundtable, and \nnumerous other business, consumer, and civil rights organizations. In \nfact, I ask unanimous consent that a long list of these organizations \nbe printed in the Record for my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       American Financial Services Association; National Governors \n     Association; U.S. Conference of Mayors; Mayors Newsom (San \n     Fran), Menino (Boston), Daley (Chicago); National Assoc of \n     Counties; National Assoc of Local Housing Finance Agencies; \n     National Assoc for County Community and Economic Development; \n     National Community Development Association; National Council \n     of State Housing Agencies; Manufactured Housing Institute; \n     National Housing Trust Fund; Mortgage Insurance Companies of \n     America and National Assoc of Mortgage Brokers.\n       National Association of Realtors; AARP; FM Policy Focus; \n     NAACP; Mortgage Bankers Association; Conference of State Bank \n     Supervisors; ACORN; Homeownership Preservation Foundation; \n     Mission of Peace National Corp; Mon Valley Initiative; \n     National Council of La Raza; National NeighborWorks \n     Association and Council of State Community Development \n     Agencies.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I point this out because, as my colleagues \nwill tell you, oftentimes we have one group of people for something and \nnot another. But when you get the Financial Services Roundtable, the \nNAACP, the Consumer Federation of America, the League of Cities--you \nget some idea of what we have been able to put together, Senator Shelby \nand I have, with this bill.\n  Is this a bill Richard Shelby would write on his own? No. Is this one \nI would write on my own? Absolutely not. We do not do business like \nthat here. There are 100 of us here, and we try to work together to \nfashion ideas that make sense, and that is what we have done with this \ncritically important legislation.\n  I thank Senator Shelby. I thank my colleagues, my Democratic \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee--Jack Reed, Chuck Schumer, Tim \nJohnson, a long list of people who made a significant contribution to \nthis bill. I thank my Republican colleagues on the committee as well; 8 \nout of 10 of my Republican colleagues on that committee have supported \nthis effort and stayed with us through this long, arduous process, a \nprocess that did not have to last this long and should not have to last \nthis long over the next several days. We could pass this bill in the \nnext hour and send it to the President for his signature this \nafternoon. That is the kind of news I think the world is waiting for, \nboth at home and around the globe--that the American Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans, contrary to the opinion people have of us, \ncan actually sit down and work together and produce something for the \nAmerican people.\n  That is what we have done with this bill. I thank my colleagues for \nit and I urge the adoption of this legislation when the moment occurs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during \nthe 30-minute block of time for our side 5 minutes be allocated to me, \n12\\1/2\\ to Senator Vitter, and 12\\1/2\\ to Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me first ask that I be permitted \nto use 1 minute upfront that is not allocated to my 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my good friend before he leaves the floor how \ngood it is to see you in action again. I think you probably feel you \nare back being a Senator. Remember the days when we, together, passed \nthat one piece of legislation where we overrode the veto of President \nClinton, when you were the chairman of the Democratic Party and we had \na bill going here? It was the right bill; class action. Do you remember \nthat one? It started us moving where that whole process was cleaned up. \nI regret to say, with the lawyers we were fighting with in our \ncommittees, one of them ended up in jail, I noticed recently. That was \nthe fate he had. I saw that coming as he was conducting his law \npractice in the days we were investigating class action litigation.\n  I wanted to say what a pleasure it was then. I know from what you are \nsaying that you have had a lot of opportunity to debate, share ideas, \nwork with other Senators, and I think that is what makes the Senate \ngreat. I compliment you for it.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, it is obvious I just finished telling \nthe good Senator how we work together to make good laws when we have \nimportant issues. I also want to say, in the year 2005 we passed an \nEnergy Policy Act. The Senate took 19 rollcall votes on amendments and \nagreed to 57 of them. Last year on the Energy Independence and Security \nAct we took 16 rollcall votes on amendments and agreed to 49.\n  We can look back further, if you would like to, to the successful \nlegislation on the Clean Air Act of 1990. I was here. I was working on \nit. The Senate acted upon 131 amendments and took well over 3 weeks \nhere on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let me say to my fellow Senators, that is not what is happening \ntoday. Today an issue just as important, as I view it, as important as \nany of the legislation I talked about--any legislation that my good \nfriend from Connecticut talked about here on the floor, any legislation \nthat we have considered in the field of energy--is before us today \nduring a critical time, a time more critical than at any other time we \nwere considering energy legislation that I have alluded to, and a \ncouple of other times that are similar.\n  What did we do then? We had time for important legislation and we \nmust have time for this, for the one who is saying: What are you going \nto do to the offshore inventories of American oil and gas that are \nlocked up that we cannot use and have not used for 20 to 27 years and \nnow they are there, ready to help the American people? The price of \ngasoline must come down and that is one way to do it. We have to open \nthe reserves that belong to the people.\n  It is interesting the distinguished Senator from Connecticut could \ntalk about working together and how that has taken place in this \nimportant housing bill. It is important that we understand how we did \nthe previous Energy bills. But here today, let it be known that bill \nwhich the American people have been wanting us to vote on, wanting us \nto do something about--that is to open up these reserves that belong to \nthe people and see how much that might affect the price of gasoline--we \ncannot get a vote unless we do what the majority leader wants us to do. \nOne person, the majority leader, decides whether we can have an \namendment, what it will say, what it will be about.\n  It is completely different than the way we have discussed here for \nthe last\n\n[[Page S7227]]\n\n5 minutes, the way legislation takes place here in the Senate. Remember \nwhat has happened in this bill. You can throw away all the words and \nlook at where are we today.\n  There is a bill pending that the Democratic leader brought to the \nfloor on the subject matter of whether there is speculation going on \nthat affects the price of crude oil in a bad way, with bad conduct on \nthe part of those who are participating. He brought a bill down to cure \nthat. We have been told that is a small part of the problem. But the \nbig part of the problem is supply and demand. We, the Republicans--\njoined by some Democrats, I am sure, if we ever had a chance to do it--\nare addressing the issue of supply and demand. That is the big issue. \nThat is the issue that might indeed make some Americans smile instead \nof being so worried about their future because of the price of gasoline \nand what it is doing to them and to the American economy. We must have \nthe right to freely amend that bill until we come to a consensus. That \nis how we get things done. But, remember, plain and simple, no matter \nwhat is said, we cannot do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is because the majority leader has precluded us \nprocedurally from doing anything other than what he wants, what he will \nlet us do. We cannot act the way the Senate should act on important \nissues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I too rise to talk about the single most \nimportant issue, bar none, facing American families--gasoline prices, \nenergy. Again let me restate the obvious. This is the single most \nimportant issue facing all Louisiana families I represent, facing \nAmerican families across the country. In that context, for families who \nstruggle every week, particularly when they go to the gas station to \nfill up, particularly as they try to take family vacations in the \nsummers or they struggle with their basic needs of commuting to work--\nthose folks in ag, or transportation, doubly hit with diesel costs--we \nneed to act, not talk but act in a meaningful way on this issue.\n  Let me first congratulate the majority leader. He has finally allowed \na bill on the floor which at least touches on this issue. He has a bill \nbefore the Senate right now, the issue on the floor, that deals with \nspeculation in energy, particularly oil and gas. That is an issue we \nshould address head on and I applaud that.\n  But there is a big problem with how he has gone about running the \nSenate in this instance; that is, he has not allowed any meaningful \namendment to that bill so that we can have an open debate and open \namendment process about gasoline and energy.\n  Again, I am happy to look at the speculation issue and act on the \nspeculation issue. I support provisions that do that. But I do not know \na single American who thinks that is nearly enough, that it addresses \nthe bulk of the issue, that we should not move on to other crucial \nissues revolving around supply and demand.\n  Like virtually every Member of this body, I have introduced \nsignificant amendments that go to the heart of the matter, that impact \nsupply and demand, that try to make us use less, bring down demand, \nconserve more, have greater fuel efficiency standards, new technology. \nBut that would also have us find more right here at home. We have those \nresources here. Yet because of the ground rules laid down by the \ndistinguished majority leader, we are not being allowed to call up any \nof those amendments, have that open debate, consider my ideas or the \nideas of the 99 other Senators on both sides of the aisle. I urge the \nmajority leader to abandon that approach and to get back to the best \ntraditions of the Senate--open debate and an open amendment process. \nSpecifically, in that vein:\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider S. 3268 in the \nfollowing manner: that the bill be subject to energy-related amendments \nonly and that amendments be considered in an alternating manner between \nthe two sides of the aisle. I further ask unanimous consent that the \nbill remaining be the pending business to the exclusion of all other \nbusiness other than privileged matters or items agreed to jointly by \nthe two leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the first seven amendments to be offered \non the Republican side of the aisle by either the Republican leader or \nhis designee be the following: an Outer Continental Shelf amendment, \nincluding a conservation provision; an oil shale amendment, including a \nconservation provision; an Alaska energy production amendment, \nincluding a conservation provision; the Gas Price Reduction Act, which \nhas 44 cosponsors, myself included; a clean nuclear energy amendment; a \ncoal-to-liquid fuel amendment, including a conservation provision; and \na LIHEAP amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as Senator, I object.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I am obviously not surprised, but I \ncontinue to be disappointed. Gasoline prices--energy--are the single \ngreatest challenge facing every Louisiana family. I know they are the \ngreatest challenge facing Missouri families and families all across \nthis country. Yet we are not acting on what most concerns folks about \nour collective future, our economic future, the future for our \nfamilies. We must act.\n  The American people have a lot of sound common sense and they know \nthere is no single answer, there is no silver bullet, there is not one \nthing that does everything, there is not one thing that can stabilize \nand immediately lower gasoline prices.\n  They know we need to do a number of things. Most of the American \npeople, like me, are perfectly willing to look at speculation and act \non that issue. I support provisions to do that. But the American people \nalso want to look at supply and demand. They want to decrease demand \nthrough conservation, through greater efficiency, through new \ntechnology, but they also want to increase supply, including finding \nmore energy right here at home.\n  That includes a lot of oil and gas resources we have right here at \nhome that we need for the short term and medium term. We need to do a \nnumber of these different things.\n  As I mentioned, I have introduced seven specific amendments. My \namendments do a number of different things, both on the demand side and \non the supply side, because we need to act on both sides of the \nequation. But, again, the ground rules the majority leader has \nestablished shut all that out so far. I certainly hope he reconsiders \nand changes those ground rules.\n  Those ground rules are offensive, quite frankly, to the traditions of \nthe Senate. I came from the House. When I did, I heard the Senate was \nfundamentally different from the House; that the Senate was about open \ndebate and open amendments and not controlled with limited debate and \nlimited amendments such as the House.\n  Well, I found out the Senate, under this leadership, is different \nfrom the House. In the House we had a handful of amendments on every \nbill. In the Senate, we are even denied that. That is not the tradition \nof the Senate, and it is not how we have acted in the Senate on energy \nlegislation in the recent past.\n  The last two times we considered energy legislation were in 2007 and \nin 2O05. In 2007, when the price at the pump, by the way, was about $3 \na gallon, we spent 3 whole weeks on the bill, on the issue on the floor \nof the Senate, 3 weeks, nothing but that.\n  We had rollcall votes on 16 amendments. We had 22 rollcall votes \ntotal. We adopted a total of 49 amendments because several of those \namendments were accepted without a vote. There were a total of 331 \namendments proposed. That is when gas was $3 a gallon.\n  A little further back, 2005, we also considered energy. By the way, \nat that time, gas was $2.26 a gallon. We spent 2 whole weeks on the \nSenate floor, 2 entire weeks focused on nothing other than that, even \nthough the price was almost $2 per gallon less than it is now.\n  We had 19 rollcall votes on amendments; 23 total rollcall votes on \nthe bill. We adopted 57 amendments and 235 were proposed. That is \nserious legislating on a serious issue.\n  Yet has energy gotten less serious since then or more? Well, you can \ntrack that with the price at the pump. It has gone from $2.26 during \nthat first debate, to $3.06 during the second debate, to $4, at least, \nnow. The issue is more important than ever and merits our attention \nmore than ever and merits a serious response more than ever.\n\n[[Page S7228]]\n\n  That means real time on the floor and--more than time obviously--the \nability to have an open amendment process and to consider serious, \nsubstantive legislative proposals.\n  Again, I have seven amendments offered. They attack both the demand \nside, to lower demand, and also the supply side, to increase supply, \nincluding in the short and medium term.\n  We need to attack both sides of the equation. We need to do both \nthose things. But, fundamentally, we need to act. The American people \nare sick and tired of our never acting on issues that are important to \ntheir lives, never taking up what hits them in the pocketbook, what \ntheir families are concerned about, what threatens their future.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request S. 3248\n\n  So we need to act. So in that vein, I again urge us to act. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate consider S. 3248, in the following \nmanner: that the bill be subject to energy-related amendments only; \nthat amendments be considered in an alternating fair manner between the \ntwo sides of the aisle.\n  I ask further unanimous consent that the bill remain the pending \nbusiness, to the exclusion of all other business other than privileged \nmatters or items agreed to jointly by the two leaders.\n  I ask further unanimous consent that the first seven amendments to be \noffered on the Republican side of the aisle by either the Republican \nleader or his designee be the following:\n  An Outer Continental Shelf amendment, including a conservation \nprovision; an oil shale amendment, including a conservation provision; \nan Alaska energy production amendment, including a conservation \nprovision; the Gas Price Reduction Act, which has 44 cosponsors, \nincluding myself; a clean nuclear energy amendment; a coal-to-liquid \nfuel amendment, including a conservation provision; and a LIHEAP \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator, I object.\n  The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Again, I am very disappointed--not surprised, very \ndisappointed. The American people want action. The American people \ndeserve action on what is the single greatest threat and issue in their \nlives right now.\n  I urge all of us to come together, not as Democrats or Republicans \nbut as Americans, to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am disappointed to be here and to have \nto give this speech today. I am disappointed because I am, once again, \non the Senate floor discussing the fact that the majority leader has \ndecided to use the Senate parliamentary tactic to stop members from \noffering amendments and to close off debate.\n  We are going to spend until tomorrow morning or whatever time \ntomorrow we decide to have another vote on another cloture motion doing \nnothing. While we can raise issues, we cannot get any votes on any \nissues. This is all valuable time that we could be voting on issues for \nthe American people, issues that would actually solve some of the gas \nprice problems I hear about all over Wyoming and all over the country. \nIt is the No. 1 concern in this country right now.\n  The majority leader has a rain delay that has put a halt to this \nmatch, but this game will get played. We will debate alternative \nenergy, finding more oil on American soil, deep sea exploration, \nnuclear energy, oil shale. You cannot stop us forever because the \nAmerican people have told us the most important issue on their mind is \nthe issue of energy.\n  The majority leader has told the world's most deliberative body we \ncannot have a real debate about this issue. But the American people are \ntelling him something else. Hopefully, soon he will listen. It is no \nwonder Congress has an approval rating that is less than 10 percent.\n  Rather than working on the issues that are important to our \nconstituents, we continue to play ``gotcha'' politics. It is not \ngetting us anywhere. It is certainly not improving our Nation's energy \nsituation. This brand of nonlegislating that the majority continues to \npeddle is not making a gallon of gas cheaper.\n  When will the leaders let us put real proposals on the table? This \nbody will take some and this body will leave some, but we should be \ntaking action. What we have now is not action, it is acting, acting in \nthe dramatic sense. We evidently think that if we can place blame on \nspeculators and get a vote on that and be done, we can check that box \noff and say that we took care of energy for America. Americans are \nsmarter than that.\n  The majority leader is preventing a vote on an amendment that would \nincrease production on the Outer Continental Shelf. We cannot vote on \nan amendment that will allow for more production of diesel fuel from \nour Nation's most abundant energy source, coal. We cannot vote on \nextending the wind production tax credit. We cannot vote on extending \ntax credits for solar energy.\n  The majority leader has said we need to get an agreement on \namendments. Our side has agreed we need to work on energy amendments \nbecause this is an energy debate. We have been willing to put aside all \nthe other kinds of amendments. But, no, that is not enough. We want to \nbe able to read each of them and decide whether they are meritorious \nbefore they are put on the table.\n  I am not sure why that is the case. It does not match up with our \nhistorical energy debates or, for that matter, any of our debates.\n  The Senate considered the Energy Independence and Security Act last \nyear. At that time, gas was $3.06 a gallon. I talked a little bit about \nthat bill because I called it the anti-energy bill and said there was \nnot anything in that that was going to bring down the price of gas. \nObviously, I was right. The price is up another dollar from that. But \neven on that one, there were 331 amendments that were filed. Of those, \n49 amendments were agreed to, and 16 amendments received rollcall \nvotes.\n  The Senate considered the Energy Policy Act of 2005, that is the \nprevious bill to the anti-energy bill. Gas was $2.26 a gallon then. \nThere were 235 amendments that were filed and, of those, 57 amendments \nwere agreed to and 19 amendments received rollcall votes.\n  The crisis is even greater now. So there ought to be amendments being \ndebated, considered. We should not have the parliamentary tactic that \nkeeps us from doing amendments.\n  Anytime a bill comes in here, and it is a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition, this body leaves it. So if you want to get something done, \nwant to be able to check off the box, we need to be able to do some \namendments.\n  Now, not only were both those bills fully amendable but both received \nsignificant floor consideration. We spent 15 days on the floor on one \nof them and 10 days on the other. Why? Because they are serious issues \nthat deserve serious debate. We wanted to make sure ideas from both \nsides were considered.\n  As I recall, both sides lost some. But that is how it works. I have \nan amendment that relates to State mineral royalties. That amendment \nwould encourage States to allow for energy production on their land by \ngiving them their fair share of mineral royalties. We are not going to \nget to consider that. There are a number of other amendments that I \nwould support relating to energy development on the Outer Continental \nShelf in the States that want energy production and only those States \nthat want it.\n  I would support an amendment to improve our Nation's energy situation \nby accelerating the development of coal-to-liquid fuels. That could be \ncoal to diesel and coal to jet fuel. Those are the most expensive fuels \nin the United States right now. Those are the ones that have some great \npotential for decreased costs using our most abundant energy source.\n  We have more Btu's in coal--in fact, we have more Btu's in the clean \ncoal in northeastern Wyoming than Saudi Arabia has in oil. It is an old \ntechnique from World War II, from converting that to, say, diesel, and \nalso to convert it to jet fuel. Our military needs jet fuel. It can be \ndone from coal.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader has stopped me from doing so by \nusing parliamentarian tactics to cut off the debate. He has also \nstopped me from\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\nvoting against a number of bad ideas I am sure we would see. I will not \nhave a chance to vote against lowering the speed limit to 55 miles an \nhour. Why is that a bad idea? It actually led to higher traffic \nfatalities.\n  When we were talking about eliminating the 55-mile-speed limit, the \nargument was, if we do that, the number of fatalities in the United \nStates would go up. Well, we raised the speed limit. We went back to \nwhere it was before.\n  Do you know what. Traffic fatalities went down. In Wyoming, the \nreason they went down is we eliminated a lot of those single-car \naccidents from driving the huge distances across our State at very slow \nspeeds.\n  My dad traveled on the road. He said: At 55 miles an hour, you could \nwatch a flower come up, grow, bloom, and wither before you got by it. \nSo he started reading while he drove. But it kept him awake. So he did \nnot have one of those single-car accidents where you roll your car.\n  Now, believe it or not, I agree with the majority party on some steps \nwe could make to help this country be more energy independent. Wind tax \ncredits are one example. By restricting Senators' participation, \nstopping them from representing those who put them in office is not \ngoing to get us any further than an empty gas tank, and that is what \nthis bill in its current form is.\n  The bill before us blames speculators for our energy situation. It \nmight be worth taking a moment to discuss exactly what speculators do. \nWe have turned that into a cuss word. Oil speculation is two people or \ncompanies or organizations guessing what the price will be in the \nmonths to come. One of those entities thinks the price will be higher \nin the months to come, and so they buy the commodity now. Another \nentity thinks the price will be lower, so they sell the commodity now. \nThe one who is right will make money; the one who is wrong will not. \nYou can't have this kind of a transaction without two people who \nbelieve the exact opposite. Both are speculators. Both think they can \nmake money based on their knowledge of the world and the gas supply at \nthe current time.\n  What kind of entities do this? An airline might think the price of \noil will be higher in the months to come, and, to stabilize their fuel \ncosts, they will purchase oil futures for the next couple of months. If \nthe prices go up, they will have stabilized their fuel costs and saved \nmoney. If they go down, of course, it will cost them what they bid it \nat, and they will lose money compared to what they could have gotten it \nfor. But in order for them to have that market, there has to be \nsomebody willing to bet against them, willing to say: Yes, I think the \nprice is going to go down, and I am going to make that differential. \nThose are speculators. Without the speculator part of the deal, the \nairline doesn't have a deal. The airline cannot lock in a price for \nwhat they are willing to pay to make sure they will know in the future \nwhat their costs are going to be. That is speculation.\n  The market is a place where you anticipate what the cost will be in \nthe months to come so that you can have certainty for what you are \ngoing to pay. Sometimes you guess right and you are paying below market \nvalue. Sometimes your guess is wrong, and you end up paying more than \nmarket value. What is commonly ignored in the debate about oil \nspeculators is that for every dollar made, a dollar is lost by someone \nwho would be called a speculator but without whom the market doesn't \nwork.\n  Oil is not the only commodity that is traded. We speculate on the \nprice of wheat, pork bellies, gold and silver, cattle--a number of \nother things. Speculation allows producers and consumers of these \nproducts the opportunity to manage the risk they have on buying and \nselling products that don't have a set price. This helps prevent wild \nfluctuations of price each and every day. That keeps major market \nfailures from happening.\n  Earlier this week, I spoke about how the majority leader's energy \nspeculation bill could have significant unintended consequences for \ninstitutional investors accessing commodities, futures, and capital \nmarkets. Today, America's largest pension funds wrote to me stating \ntheir concern.\n  The American Benefits Council wrote:\n\n       The Council is very concerned that the serious implications \n     of S. 3268 on retirement plan participants have not been \n     sufficiently evaluated. We are concerned that legislation \n     relating to energy policy could unintentionally harm the \n     long-term security of American workers and families.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    American Benefits Council,\n\n                                                    July 24, 2008.\n     Re: Adverse Retirement Plan Implications of Energy \n         Speculation Legislation (S. 3268)\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Health, Education, \n         Labor and Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Kennedy and Baucus and Ranking Members Enzi \n     and Grassley: I am writing today on behalf of the American \n     Benefits Council to express concerns about the implications \n     of S. 3268, the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act of \n     2008, on employer-sponsored retirement plans and the tens of \n     millions of American workers and retirees who rely on these \n     plans for their retirement security. The American Benefits \n     Council (the ``Council'') is a public policy organization \n     representing principally Fortune 500 companies and other \n     organizations that assist employers of all sizes in providing \n     benefits to employees. Collectively, the Council's members \n     either sponsor directly or provide services to retirement and \n     health plans that cover more than 100 million Americans.\n       The Council is very concerned that the serious implications \n     of S. 3268 on retirement plans and retirement plan \n     participants have not been sufficiently evaluated. We are \n     concerned that legislation relating to energy policy could \n     unintentionally harm the long-term financial security of \n     American workers and families.\n       Employer-sponsored retirement plans are long-term investors \n     that invest in a wide range of asset classes in order to \n     diversify plan investments and minimize the risk of large \n     losses, both of which are central to employers' fiduciary \n     obligations to act prudently and solely in the interest of \n     plan participants. As you know, fiduciaries are subject to \n     extremely demanding legal obligations under the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) but have flexibility \n     to select the investments that will allow them to carry out \n     their mission of providing retirement benefits to employees. \n     Commodities are one of the broad range of asset classes upon \n     which fiduciaries rely. Specifically, commodities serve as a \n     modest but important element of the investments held by \n     employer-sponsored defined benefit pensions because commodity \n     returns are uncorrelated with stocks and bonds and because \n     they provide an important hedge against inflation. For the \n     same reasons, commodities are used in many of the diversified \n     ``single fund'' solutions (lifecycle funds, target retirement \n     date funds) that have been developed to simplify investing \n     for the tens of millions of Americans participating in \n     defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s. These single fund \n     solutions, which policymakers have encouraged through \n     legislation and regulation, make investing easier while \n     giving workers access to professionally managed, diversified \n     portfolios.\n       The restrictions imposed on commodities investing under S. \n     3268 would greatly restrict the ability of employer-sponsored \n     defined benefit and defined contribution plans to use this \n     important asset class. The result will be less ability to \n     diversify investments, manage investment volatility and be a \n     buffer against inflation. Unfortunately, it is the employees \n     and retirees who depend on employer retirement plans for \n     their income in retirement who will ultimately suffer. We \n     hope, with this in mind, that the implications for retirement \n     plans and plan participants will be examined more fully \n     before S. 3268 is considered further.\n       We sincerely appreciate your consideration of our views on \n     this important matter. Please let us know if we can provide \n     additional information or address any questions you may have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James A. Klein,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I also ask unanimous consent to have an article on \nstatistics on the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 24, 2008]\n\n                     The Insanity of Drive-55 Laws\n\n                           (By Stephen Moore)\n\n       It didn't seem possible that politicians could think up a \n     sillier energy proposal than Barack Obama's windfall profits \n     tax on oil companies, but Republican Sen. John Warner of \n     Virginia has done just that.\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\n       Earlier this month, Mr. Warner suggested a return to the \n     federal 55-mile-per-hour speed limit on America's highways, \n     as a way to save on national gasoline consumption. ``I drive \n     over 55 miles an hour, . . . sometimes 65,'' he said on the \n     Senate floor. ``But I am willing to give up whatever \n     advantage to me to drive at those speeds with the fervent \n     hope that modest sacrifice on my part will help those people \n     across this land . . . dealing with this financial crisis.''\n       Meanwhile, environmental groups across the country are also \n     pushing a lower national speed limit to reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions. The notion here is that if people simply lift the \n     pedal off the metal on the highways, they will help avert an \n     environmental apocalypse.\n       Mr. Warner may be willing to drive slower to save gas. The \n     vast majority of Americans surely are not. The original 55 \n     mph speed-limit law, enacted in October 1974 after the OPEC \n     oil embargo as a way to save energy, was probably the most \n     despised and universally disobeyed law in America since \n     Prohibition. In wide-open western states, driving at 70 mph \n     or even 80 mph on miles upon miles of straight, flat, \n     uncongested freeways is regarded as a God-given right. In the \n     1970s and '80s, the federal speed limit was a daily reminder \n     of the intrusiveness of nanny-state regulation.\n       States were bullied into complying. If they didn't, they \n     risked losing federal highway money--which came from the gas \n     taxes paid in part by their own residents. The law--``double \n     nickel,'' as it was called--was so hated in Montana that the \n     state legislature passed a law capping speeding tickets at \n     $5. In Wyoming, the highway patrol told speeders to hold on \n     to the tickets they issued because they were good for the \n     whole day.\n       In 1995, the newly ascendant Republican Congress repealed \n     the 55 mph limit. Most states acted quickly to allow speeds \n     of up to 65 mph or even 75 mph on their interstates, and for \n     good reason. As an energy saving policy, the double nickel \n     was a bust. The National Motorists Association reports that \n     about 95% of American drivers regularly exceeded the federal \n     speed limit. Does it make sense to resurrect a law that 19 \n     out of every 20 Americans disobeyed?\n       In the first few years when the law was strictly enforced, \n     according to the Congressional Research Service, gasoline \n     consumption was reduced by about 167,000 barrels a day. But \n     over time the law was increasingly ignored, and average \n     speeds on the highway fell by only a few miles per hour. \n     The National Research Council estimated in 1984 that \n     Americans spent one billion additional hours a year in \n     their cars because of the speed limit law.\n       Mr. Warner repeats the myth that a lower federal speed \n     limit will increase traffic safety. Back in 1995, Naderite \n     groups argued that repealing the 55 mph limit would lead to \n     ``6,400 more deaths and millions more injuries'' each year. \n     In reality, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n     data reveal that in the decade after speed limits went up \n     (1995-2005), traffic fatalities fell by 17%, injuries by 33%, \n     and crashes by 38%. That's especially significant because in \n     1995 far fewer drivers were gabbing on their cell phones or \n     text messaging while driving.\n       In a study for the Cato Institute in 1999, I compared the \n     fatality rates in states that raised their speed limits to 70 \n     mph or more (mostly in the South or West) with those that \n     didn't (mostly in the Northeast). There was little difference \n     in safety. Of the 31 states that raised their speed limits to \n     70 mph or more, only two (the Dakotas) experienced a slight \n     increase in highway deaths. The evidence is overwhelming that \n     traffic safety is based less on how fast the traffic is going \n     than on the variability in speeds that people are driving. \n     The granny who drives 20 mph below the pace of traffic on the \n     freeway is often as much a safety menace as the 20-year-old \n     hot rodder.\n       Retail gasoline stores report that Americans have already \n     reduced their gas purchases by about 5% this year--presumably \n     by driving less and buying more fuel-efficient cars. At $4.59 \n     a gallon, motorists don't need to be lectured by politicians \n     on the financial savings from cutting back. Those who want to \n     stretch their dollars can drive 55 mph on their own (though \n     they are well advised to stay in the right lane).\n       But many liberal and green do-gooders want the double \n     nickel precisely because they want to force everyone to share \n     in the sacrifice required. As an egalitarian friend once told \n     me, he loves traffic jams because they are the ultimate form \n     of democracy.\n       To the left, fairness means we all suffer equally together. \n     In light of this alleged moral imperative, it doesn't matter \n     if a lower speed limit means Americans would spend two \n     billion extra hours on the road, or that, according to the \n     Labor Department, assuming a $15 per hour average wage means \n     the speed limit could cost the economy between $20 billion \n     and $30 billion a year in lost output.\n       Calls for a 55 mph speed limit--and for that matter most \n     other government energy conservation plans, such as urging \n     people to ride a bus or a bicycle rather than driving a car--\n     reflect a mindset that oil and gasoline are more valuable \n     than human time.\n       But America is not running out of energy. We have \n     potentially hundreds of years of oil and natural gas and coal \n     supplies in America alone, if Congress would only let us \n     drill for it. What is in short supply--the only truly finite \n     resource, as the late economist Julian Simon taught us--is \n     the time each of us spends on this earth. And most of us \n     don't want to spend it sitting longer than we have to in \n     traffic.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I also have heard from other pension fund and institutional \ninvestor representatives that the provisions in the majority leader's \nbill have not been sufficiently vetted. Rather than pass a flawed bill \non energy speculation, we should wait until we read the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission's and the Interagency Task Force on \nCommodity Markets' report due out later this year. This issue is too \nimportant for us to act without all of the facts.\n  Few serious economists believe that this bill will do anything \nsubstantial to decrease energy prices. Warren Buffett, the Nation's \nwealthiest Democrat, doesn't think that it will make a difference. \nNeither does oilman T. Boone Pickens. Even the Federal Reserve \nChairman, Ben Bernanke, believes that this bill will have little impact \non the price of gasoline. And yet we are still prohibited from offering \namendments. We are still prohibited from voting on amendments that will \nhave a real impact on the price of gasoline.\n  It is unfortunate that the debate is turning out this way, because I \nagree that there should be more transparency in the market. That is why \nI am the cosponsor of a bill that allows for more oversight by the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission. But in addition to that, the \nbill does something more. The Gas Price Reduction Act includes a \nprovision to open up coastal waters in States where they want energy \nproduction. It ends the ban on the development of promising oil shale \nin Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. At the same time it encourages \nincreases in supply, it promotes the development of better technology \nso that we use less energy.\n  We should have the opportunity to vote on these proposals. We should \nhave the opportunity to have a real debate on energy. Instead, we are \ngoing wrap up this debate and begin playing the blame game. It is \ndisappointing that the Senate is working this way, and I hope we can \nstop playing politics and have a real debate in the near future. This \nissue is too important for the Senate to ignore.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Senate to pass \ncommonsense legislation to lower gas prices. This week, possibly even \ntoday, the Senate will vote on legislation that would create more \noversight on the financial markets that are helping to drive up the \ncost of oil. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to pass it. It \nis the first step toward energy independence but certainly not the \nlast.\n  In my State of Montana, folks are hurting. The average price of a \ngallon of gas is about $4.20. Diesel now costs on average $4.67 a \ngallon in the Big Sky State. My constituents need and deserve effective \naction from their national leaders to provide them with relief from \nthis energy crisis.\n  Across Montana, desperate times are producing desperate measures. \nDriving to go to work or between cities is not a choice; it is a \nnecessity. Snow is on the ground for a good part of the year. You need \nwheels to get around. Folks are paying with credit cards at the pump or \ngetting second or third jobs to get by. They are canceling vacations, \ndriving less, and buying smaller cars. But that is not enough.\n  The Senate must provide relief at the pump, and there is no silver \nbullet. It is going to take a few commonsense ideas and a lot of hard \nwork to diversify our portfolio. I support a three-pronged plan: Crack \ndown on energy speculators manipulating the marketplace for a quick \nbuck; produce more fuel by drilling for oil where it makes sense and \ninvest in renewable energy for the long term; also, encourage energy \nconservation--that is the low-hanging fruit--for long-term energy \nsustainability.\n  The Senate will soon vote on a commonsense plan to crack down on oil \nmarket speculators and hedgers who break the rules. We have seen these \nguys before with Enron and the housing bust, folks on Wall Street who \nmanipulate the market and give themselves raises while gas prices are \nchoking regular folks. It is time to put a stop to this unfair \nmanipulation.\n  Let me be clear about two points. First, not all speculation is bad. \nWell-\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\nregulated speculation can help markets set a fair price for a \ncommodity. Unfortunately, under this administration, speculation and \nhedging have gotten way out of hand, driving up the price of oil to \nrecord heights and squeezing the American consumer as never before. \nWhen the price of oil skyrocketed this summer, it was not because of a \nsudden increase in demand, nor because OPEC suddenly decided to pump \nless. It was because of trading on Wall Street by folks who never \nintended to own a barrel of oil.\n  We owe to it every family struggling to meet rising gas bills, every \nfarmer filling up his tractor, every trucker buying fuel to move \nproduct to make sure this trading is fair and on the level. Folks in \nMontana don't have a problem with anyone making a buck, but we do \nbelieve in the American dream. We will not put up with folks who game \nthe system.\n  I call on my Senate colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to \njoin together and pass the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act. This \nbill will strengthen the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to crack \ndown on Wall Street speculators in the oil market. More watchdogs, more \ntransparency will stop people from gaming the system and artificially \nand unnecessarily driving up prices at the pump. We need this bill.\n  When it comes to getting control of high gas prices, this is only the \nbeginning. Beyond speculation, we need to drill for oil in places that \nmake sense right here in America, and production of renewable fuels \nmust go hand in hand with drilling for more oil.\n  One of the places it makes sense to drill for oil is in the Bakken \nFormation in eastern Montana and North Dakota. The Bakken field is a \nplace we will hear about again and again. New technology is allowing \nsmaller producers to extract more oil. There is more than 4 billion \nbarrels of oil in the Bakken field. It is hard work, but these are good \njobs, and the salaries are good too. And they are right here at home. \nAll you need is a strong back, a cattle stand, a good work ethic, and a \nclean record, and you can find jobs that start for as much as $25 an \nhour.\n  The Bakken field isn't the only place where drilling makes sense. \nLast week, the Interior Department finally opened 2 million acres in \nthe Alaska National Petroleum Reserve, and it is about time. It is all \npart of the puzzle to free America from the grip of foreign oil and \nlower the price of gas at the pump.\n  However, anybody who tells you we can drill our way out of this \nproblem is not shooting straight. Congress has been debating whether to \nextend tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources, \nand we ought to stop extending the production tax credit on an annual \nbasis. A long-term extension of these tax credits will really make a \ndifference.\n  Over the long haul, we know we cannot simply drill our way out of \nthis problem. We must invest in conservation and sustainable energy \nsuch as biofuels. It is all part of the puzzle to free America from the \ngrip of foreign oil and lower prices of gas at the pump.\n  Earlier this summer, Congress passed the farm bill over the \nPresident's veto. That bill included hundreds of millions of dollars \nfor advanced biofuels. The farm bill also contained a provision I was \nable to offer to encourage the production of camelina. Camelina is a \ncrop that can be grown in Montana and other places and can be processed \ninto biodiesel to run tractors, combines, farm equipment, and diesel \nengines. The byproduct of camelina makes a nutritious feed for \nlivestock. Camelina truly is a win-win solution for renewable energy. \nWe need to encourage more of these commonsense answers to our energy \ncrisis.\n  Finally, conservation must play a significant role in solving our \nNation's energy crisis. If we are ever going to free America from the \ngrip of foreign oil, we must find real ways for consumers to use less \nfuel.\n  Last year, Congress increased auto fuel-efficiency standards for the \nfirst time in a generation. But it took 20 years of fighting, and \neventually a Democratic Congress got it passed. Those new standards \nwill save about 1.1 million barrels of oil a day by 2020, or about as \nmuch as produced by the State of Texas.\n  One hundred years ago, the Model T got 25 miles per gallon. Now a car \ngets 28 miles per gallon. Since that time, we have split the atom, sent \na man to the Moon, developed computers, and mapped out the human \ngenome. Yet we get the same fuel efficiency? Come on. That is not \nright. Conservation is the easiest and cheapest thing we can do to keep \nenergy costs down.\n  Part of the energy tax package will help homeowners and businesses \nmake those savings themselves. A partisan majority of the Senate \nsupports this bill, but a small minority keeps us from getting it done.\n  The State of Montana recently announced an initiative to help \ncitizens increase insulation in preparation for next winter's high \nheating bills.\n  These are all steps in the right direction, but we have more work to \ndo to reduce energy consumption. The United States is the single \nlargest consumer of energy in the world. We cannot continue on this \nunsustainable path. To do so would forfeit our national security to \ncountries such as Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. That \nwould be a tragic legacy to leave to our children. We need a \ncomprehensive approach to bring down the price of gas and address this \nenergy crisis in the long term. We need to crack down on speculation \nand greedy hedging to manipulate the oil markets. We need to increase \nproduction of fossil fuels where it makes sense and develop renewables \nfor the long haul, and we need innovative solutions to reduce our \noverall energy consumption.\n  Some people think the economic pressure on the middle class is all in \ntheir heads. We know better. Folks in Montana know this energy crisis \nis real and it is bad. The Senate must act now to pass constructive \nlegislation to bring down the price of energy at the pump. It all \nstarts with passage of the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as the Senate debates a bill \nthat will stop out-of-control speculation in the energy commodity \nmarkets, I would like to make a brief statement on this legislation and \nwhy it is essential that we act on it.\n  For weeks now, the Senate has heard testimony from experts, even oil \nexecutives, who attribute the shocking increase in oil prices to the \ninfluence of oil speculators.\n  Here are a few examples:\n\n       The [oil] fundamentals are no problem. They are the same as \n     they were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel, which is in \n     itself quite a unique phenomenon.\n\n  That was from Jeroen van der Veer, Chief Executive Officer, Royal \nDutch Shell, Washington Post Apr. 11, 2008.\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market. It has to be speculation on the futures market that \n     is fueling this.\n\n  That was from Clarence Cazalot Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Marathon \nOil, October 2007.\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50-$55 per barrel.\n\n  That is from Stephen Simon, Exxon Mobil Senior Vice President, Senate \nJudiciary Committee April 1, 2008.\n  What has happened in our markets? Clearly, we are not suffering from \na supply and demand problem. Something else is happening.\n  In 2000, about 37 percent of the oil futures market was comprised of \nspeculators who include investment companies and investment banks as \nwell as institutional investors, like pension funds. Eight years ago, \n63 percent of the oil futures market was represented by companies that \nwere hedging the price of oil because they need oil to function, for \nexample, the airlines.\n  How has the market changed in the past 8 years? Seventy-one percent \nof the oil futures market is in the hands of speculators who rarely \ntake control of the oil they are bidding on, and only 29 percent \nrepresent companies that use it for the purpose that most of us would \nagree it should be intended.\n  So we know speculation is growing when it comes to oil, and we know \nthe transactions have gone up 600 percent in the last 8 or 10 years.\n  What allowed this to happen? The infamous ``Enron Loophole,'' which \nwas slipped into must-pass legislation in late December of 2000.\n  This loophole allowed energy futures to be traded without Federal \noversight. Various investigations of the Enron collapse have pointed to \nthis loophole\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\nas crucial to Enron's manipulation of the California energy market \nwhich provoked an energy crisis in the State in 2000 and 2001.\n  Last month, with passage of the farm bill, the Congress finally \nsucceeded in bringing a measure of oversight and transparency to this \nmarket, requiring the Commodities Future Trading Commission, CFTC, to \nreview all contracts to determine which ones should be regulated as \nthough traded on a major public exchange.\n  While this was a step in the right direction, and the result of much \nthoughtful discussion and debate, the farm bill provision can be \nimproved upon and strengthened. That is why I introduced a bill to shut \ndown the unregulated oil futures markets created by the now-infamous \n``Enron loophole.'' It also removes energy from the list of exempt \ncommodities; requires energy to be traded on a regulated market; and \ncreates a new definition of what constitutes an energy commodity.\n  Senator Reid has introduced a leadership bill that reins in \nspeculation by imposing position limits ensure that legitimate \nspeculation doesn't get out of hand. It is a more complicated approach \nthat leaves the door open for unregulated trading, but if it is done \nright, the approach taken by Senator Reid can get us where we need to \nbe. And I am interested in working with Senator Reid to ensure that his \nbill gets at the problem.\n  I believe that some small but significant changes can significantly \nimprove the bill. If our approach to dealing with excessive speculation \nis to impose speculation limits, then we must ensure that those limits \nactually operate as limits, not as loopholes.\n  U.S. speculators should not be able to circumvent speculation limits \nby trading on foreign exchanges, by setting up a subsidiary that would \nnot be subject to the limits, or by trading both on and off regulated \nexchanges without aggregating the number of contracts so they count \nagainst the overall speculation limit set by the CFTC.\n  If we pass a bill that allows speculators to evade these limits, the \nbill's promise will remain unfulfilled, and we will have the worst of \nall worlds--a bill that purports to tamp down on speculation but fails \nto do so, and a bill that lets those who would dismiss the effect of \nexcessive speculation on the price of oil say ``I told you so.''\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, the editorial page of the \nWall Street Journal and Wall Street financiers, call the effort to shut \ndown excessive speculation misguided and say that the spiking price of \nthe barrel of oil is just the market telling us that demand exceeds \nsupply.\n  But ask yourself whether this makes sense. When the Saudis agreed to \nincrease production, there was no drop in the price of oil. But the \nprice of oil keeps spiraling, and while there is no evidence of \ndramatically increased demand, there is plenty of evidence that \nspeculative money is pouring into the energy futures market.\n  The airlines, which hedge against increases in the price of jet fuel \nby participating in the energy futures market, are suffering. They are \nthe legitimate hedgers who actually use the futures, and they are \ncalling on us to take action against excessive speculation.\n  Meantime, the oil companies loudly will be claiming they need to \ndrill in new areas off the coasts of Florida and California. They have \na well financed campaign that says: Drill here; drill now; pay \nless. This is cruelly misleading and deceitful. Drilling everything we \nhave in the waters below our coasts will do nothing to lower the price \nof gas.\n\n  If we open all our shores and give away billions in tourism, fishing, \nand all the economies of all the coastal States to boost oil \nproduction, the first drop of oil wouldn't be seen until the year 2017, \nand oil production would peak in the year 2030.\n  What could we get in the year 2030? We would get 200,000 barrels a \nday.\n  To put that number another way, as expressed by my colleague, Senator \nMenendez yesterday, ``the amount of gas we could get from offshore \ndrilling is equivalent to a few tablespoons per car per day.''\n  It is simply wrong to think that opening offshore drilling will lower \ngas prices.\n  Yet the public relations machine of big oil continues to churn out \nfalsehoods. They insist they are trying to find new oil that might help \nbring down gas prices, but the money they spend on exploration is \nnothing compared with what they spend on stock buybacks and dividends.\n  This is good news for shareholders but offers no help to drivers to \noffset the high cost of fuel.\n  Yesterday the Associated Press reported the 5 biggest international \noil companies plowed about 55 percent of the cash they made from their \nbusinesses into stock buybacks and dividends last year, up from 30 \npercent in 2000 and just 1 percent in 1993, according to Rice \nUniversity's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy.\n  The percentage they spend to find new deposits of fossil fuels has \nremained flat for years, in the mid-single digits.\n  In the first 3 months of this year, ExxonMobil Corp., the world's \nbiggest publicly traded oil company, shelled out $8.8 billion on stock \nbuybacks alone, compared with $5.5 billion on exploration and other \ncapital projects.\n  ConocoPhillips has already told investors that its stock buybacks for \nApril to June of this year will come to about $2.5 billion, 9 times \nwhat it spent on exploration.\n  This leads me to the conclusion of one oil expert who said, ``If \nyou're not spending your money finding and developing new oil, then \nthere's no new oil.''\n  Senator Reid has introduced a leadership bill that will rein in \nspeculation. Over and over, the Congress has heard testimony that the \nquestion of supply and demand is not what is causing oil to be up at \n$130 a barrel, as I referred to earlier, statements by oil company \nexecutives that the price of a barrel of oil would be much less, given \nthe normal vagaries of the market of supply and demand, even though \nthere is a lot of demand out there in the world market. But as Senator \nReid pointed out, in the underlying bill that is before the Senate, it \nis the speculators, unregulated after the law was changed to deregulate \nthe markets, where there are no controls on how much oil they can buy \non futures contracts or whether they have to use that oil, who continue \nto speculate and drive up the price. That is what this underlying bill \nis trying to address. They should not be able to circumvent speculation \nlimits by trading, for example, on foreign exchanges if those oil \ncontracts are for America.\n  I see my colleague from Pennsylvania is here, and I want him to have \nthe time to which he is entitled.\n  What is confronting us is an effort to get us off focusing on the \nproblem with this mindless statement that is out there, put out by the \noil companies--look at who is sponsoring the advertisements on TV and \nin the newspapers; it is the only companies--and it is that statement: \nDrill here, drill now, pay less.\n  Now, if we are going to solve this problem, we have to do a bunch of \nthings. But just drilling is not going to solve it because if you do \njust that, it is going to be years and years before the fruits of that \neffort come in. In fact, it has been said over and over, there are 68 \nmillion acres under lease that have not been drilled. There are plenty \nmore acres out in the Gulf of Mexico, without getting close to Florida, \nwithout getting over the line into the military mission area, where the \nlargest testing and training area of the U.S. military in the world is, \noff the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. There is plenty. So we \nought to drill.\n  But at the same time, let's go after what is causing these prices to \ngo through the roof. Speculation is a big part of it. If you want to \nget down to it, let's strengthen the U.S. dollar against the world's \nother currencies, by getting our fiscal house in order and starting to \nbalance the Federal budget. That would help a lot too.\n  So it is an extremely complicated issue that a simple slogan is not \ngoing to solve. That is what this debate is trying to bring into focus. \nThe American people can see through the simplified slogans of ``drill \nhere, drill now.'' We need to get to a real solution.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Pennsylvania is in the \nChamber, and I wish to yield the floor so we can hear from him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for making \nthe important points he made on the question of energy and how \ndifficult this challenge is for the country and that the sloganeering \nwill not do it. He made a very compelling argument about that, which we \nneed to hear in the Senate.\n  I wish to talk today for a few moments about the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, known by the acronym LIHEAP--L-I-H-E-A-P.\n  For those who follow the Senate and watch or listen, you know we use \na lot of acronyms. I know they can get a little tiresome. But this \nparticular acronym stands for a program that works. There is no debate \nabout that. There is no question about whether this program works. It \nhas worked for years. It has support in both parties--not enough \nsupport, I don't think, on the other side of the aisle. I will get to \nthat in a moment.\n  But when we talk about that acronym LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, we are talking about a program which this \nwinter can literally mean--and will literally mean--life or death for \nsome Americans. There is no drama and overstatement in that whatsoever \nbecause unless we do the right thing on LIHEAP this year, people are \ngoing to freeze to death. It is as simple as that.\n  I commend a lot of my colleagues: Senator Sanders has been a stalwart \non this issue, who has spoken on the floor and been a leading advocate; \nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, and so many other colleagues from \nthe Northeast-Midwest coalition who have fought for increased energy \nassistance funding every year.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill. It has a very simple title \nbut very important: Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer Act. That is what \nthe act is. The bill meets a critical and fundamental need by providing \nan additional $2.53 billion in Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram assistance for this fiscal year.\n  It raises the funding to the fully authorized level of $5.1 billion. \nFor Pennsylvania, that means that if this bill is passed, our State \nwill get an additional--an additional--$210 million. If there is ever a \ntime the people of our State will need it, it will be this winter. \nSimilar to a lot of States in the Northeast, we have long winters. We \nhave a lot of vulnerable people: the second highest population over the \nage of 65, a very large rural population that will be adversely \nimpacted if we do not get help and extra money for LIHEAP.\n  We have in our State home energy assistance grants that help \nvulnerable people, the needy. Almost 33.5 percent of the grants help \nolder citizens. Almost 30 percent of the grants help disabled \nPennsylvanians. And 18.5 percent of the grants help young children.\n  These are people who need the help the most. They are vulnerable in \nthe cold months that are just around the corner for all of America and \nfor Pennsylvania. These are the people who made up the 1,000 who died \nof hypothermia in their homes between 1999 and 2002--1,000 people dying \nof hypothermia in just about 3 to 4 years. All of those deaths--every \none of them--was preventable. LIHEAP is the cornerstone to providing \nassistance that keeps people healthy and safe.\n  LIHEAP is widely recognized as effective and successful, which is why \nthe bill we are considering, and that I am a cosponsor of, is \ncosponsored by 49 Senators in total from both sides of the aisle. We \nstill have some problems, which we will talk about later.\n  The bill is necessary because LIHEAP has been chronically \nunderfunded--historically, at a rate of less than half the amount \nauthorized.\n  For people out there who watch our discussions, we know it is easy to \nauthorize. It is harder to make sure you appropriate what you \nauthorize. This is one of those examples where the authorization looked \nreal good, but the appropriation does not meet the authorization part \nof our legislation.\n  So the need has never been greater. We have all talked a lot about \nthe struggle of working families who are forced to choose between the \nneed for heat and the need to eat. But the situation has gotten much \nworse. This is not news to people who are living through this and \nstruggling in the nightmare of foreclosure, the difficulty with \nwatching wages flatten out, even as you are working harder, and your \nfood prices are going up, your gasoline prices are going up, college \ntuition is going up, health care payments are going up. I could add \nmore to that. Families are being forced to choose between heating and \nair-conditioning, food, medicine, gasoline, and mortgage payments--all \nthose difficult choices that our families are making.\n  Today, 15.6 million American families are at least 30 days behind on \npaying their utility bills. In Pennsylvania, terminations of home \nutility services are up over 51 percent.\n  According to a USA Today article, one of our energy companies in \nPennsylvania has disconnected 168 percent more--168 percent more--homes \nthan at this time last year.\n  So we have a major challenge in our State. The good news is that in \nPennsylvania we have had over 400,000 families--households, I should \nsay, in Pennsylvania--that have received assistance from LIHEAP this \nyear. But that is less than half of the 800,000 that are eligible. \nThere are 800,000 households in our State that are eligible. So we are \nhappy LIHEAP has done such a good job of helping 400,000 households, \nbut we have a doubling of that to 800,000 that are, in fact, eligible.\n  For those receiving assistance in Pennsylvania, the average grant was \n$239, and it covered much less than a quarter of their need. So when \npeople hear these big numbers, they will say: Oh, my goodness, the \nFederal Government wants to increase the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program by $2.5 billion. That sounds like a lot of money, \ndoesn't it? Spread that out person by person. When it comes down to \nPennsylvania, we are talking about assistance, at last count--this \nnumber is a few years old, but it is not much higher than this--of \n$239. So if we increase it by several billion nationally, that means \nindividual Pennsylvanians will get some help, but they are not going to \nbe getting hundreds and hundreds of dollars more. They are going to be \ngetting more than that $239 or $250 or $260 in help. So it is not a \nlot when it comes to that person. But it means a lot to that individual \nperson and their family.\n\n  Here is the scenario: In the dark of night, in the cold of winter, I \ndo not want to have a Pennsylvanian or an American in their home \nfreezing to death because a couple people in Washington did not think \nthat $2.53 billion was the right way to spend money--when we have an \nadministration which sent a budget here for 2009 which had $51 billion \nin tax cuts for people making over $1 million and up. So for anyone \nlistening, if you are a millionaire, a multimillionaire or a \nbillionaire or beyond that, this administration sent us a budget this \nyear that gave that tiny sliver of America a $51 billion tax break.\n  Don't tell me we cannot afford a little bit of an increase for low-\nincome home energy assistance, especially when older citizens are faced \nwith the--``squeeze'' does not even begin to describe it--vice grip on \ntheir head, the nightmare of trying to pay for gasoline and food and \noil in their tank, literally, to heat their homes. So we can afford \nthis. Ten times over we can afford it.\n  I wish to conclude. When we have the situation of an older citizen or \na young child who is living in a home that is not heated, or living \nwithout adequate nutrition, that child, as well as that older citizen, \nis harmed. The rate of growth and development are jeopardized. A child \nis sicker, they miss more school, and they do not do as well in class. \nA large percentage of LIHEAP energy assistance goes to not only older \ncitizens but those with a disability. This is important because someone \nwho is frail is more likely to be impacted by exposure if they are \nunable to pay to heat or cool their home.\n  So I hope we pass this legislation before we leave in August. Why \nshould we wait? No one needs to have a crystal ball to know that in the \ncold months ahead of us, a lot of vulnerable people are going to be put \nat risk. So this is our chance to do something--not just to talk about \nit but to do something--that will provide immediate assistance to the \nmost vulnerable in our society.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support the Warm in Winter and Cool in \nSummer Act, which will help our families.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Chair: It is my \nunderstanding now that the Republicans will have 30 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Mr. President, I am going to go ahead and take \nthe first 15 minutes. Then, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, wants 5 minutes, and Senator Craig wants \n10 minutes after that. I would like to lock that in with a UC.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to draw the Senate's \nattention to an editorial in today's Wall Street Journal and \nparticularly the first sentence. It says:\n\n       Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and other liberal leaders on \n     Capitol Hill are gripped by cold-sweat terror. If they permit \n     a vote on offshore drilling, they know they will lose. . . .\n\n  The editorial goes on to point out what the Democrats' plan of action \nis for this problem: to cut off debate. We have been in session this \nweek. We have held one vote. We are considering a bill relating to \nenergy, but the Democrats are not allowing us to offer any amendments \nto find new sources of energy, when the editorial points out that at \nleast 65 percent of America's recoverable oil and 40 percent of \nAmerica's natural gas is under moratorium.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks \nthe editorial be printed in its entirety in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. What they are talking about are those areas where we have \nhuge supplies that we can access, except we cannot do it because there \nare moratoria, such as exists right now in terms of the Rocky Mountain \noil shale, with 2 trillion barrels; the Outer Continental Shelf, for \nwhich 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf is under an order that \nthe Democrats have on there, so we are not able to explore, to produce, \nto drill in those areas. You hear the argument quite often that there \nare 68 million acres that could be explored right now and they are not \ndoing it. They are not doing it for one reason, and that is because \nthere is no oil there.\n\n  Throughout this week I have heard a number of my Democratic \ncolleagues come to the floor and express their support for increased \ndrilling. Apparently, this has all been some kind of misunderstanding. \nI have taken their consistent votes against increasing domestic \nproduction as being against new drilling. If we all agreed that new \ndomestic production is part of what we need to do, then let's get on \nwith some votes and get them underway.\n  My Web site is epw.senate.gov. EPW stands for Environment and Public \nWorks. What I have done is gone back and gotten all of the votes we \nhave had that would cause us--allow us to expand our supply in America \nin areas such as this. Right now on party lines they have been killed--\nkilled by the Democratic Party. This is a problem. Somehow, the \nDemocrats are trying to convince the American people that supply and \ndemand is not alive and well in America. It is interesting that the \nother day in the newspaper, it was either an op-ed piece or it might \nhave been on the editorial page of the Washington Post, they said even \nCongress is not going to be able to repeal the law of supply and \ndemand.\n  The American people understand the need for new domestic production. \nRecent polling has shown 67 percent of the American people now support \noffshore drilling with only 18 percent opposed. Sixty-four percent \nbelieve that if offshore drilling is allowed, gas prices will go down. \nWell, that is a natural conclusion you can come to.\n  Another poll found that 81 percent of Americans support greater use \nof domestic energy sources. Both papers in my home State of Oklahoma \nhave weighed in on this issue with recent editorials. The Tulsa World \nand the Oklahoman have weighed in, pointing to how new production can \nbe done in an environmental manner. The Tulsa World wrote:\n\n       President George W. Bush made the correct decision when he \n     lifted the White House's 18-year ban on offshore drilling . . \n     . No one wants the environment damaged. This work could be \n     done safely. It could be done over the long term only if \n     Congress had the good sense to act.\n\n  The Oklahoman wrote--this is in Oklahoma City:\n\n       Democrats reacted to President Bush's lifting of an \n     executive ban on offshore drilling by vowing to keep in place \n     congressional prohibitions dating to the 1980s. The debate \n     over energy policy just keeps getting better and better. For \n     years the Democratic Party has blocked efforts to \n     significantly increase production of America's sources of \n     offshore oil and natural gas, citing potential dangers to \n     beaches in California and Florida and dismissing any new oil \n     finds as too far in the future to help U.S. energy needs. \n     Both arguments have less persuasive steam with the current \n     oil prices. Certainly, if drilling offshore had gotten \n     underway a decade ago or more--instead of being stymied--\n     Americans know it would be online now and helping to absorb \n     some of the current price increase.\n\n  This is the interesting thing about it. We know what is happening in \nPrudhoe Bay. We know what the reserves are in ANWR. We know we have a \npipeline. If we had a pipeline filled and if the President--at that \ntime Bill Clinton--had not vetoed the bill that would have allowed us \nto go into ANWR.\n  New domestic production should happen and can be done in an \nenvironmentally appropriate way. No country on Earth has exploration \ntechnology as advanced and environmentally sound as ours. I have to say \nalso that we are the only country--I can't think of another country, \nand I hope if someone has the name of a country that would be an \nexception--there is not another country in the world that doesn't \nexploit their own resources. Certainly, these resources alone are \nenough to make us totally independent of any foreign importation of oil \nand the prices would come down.\n  I have highlighted some of the amounts of domestic reserves \npreviously, but I think it is important to continue to point to the \namount of reserves in the United States. There they are, right there, \nand we have actually enumerated them for the purposes of the Record.\n  The potential energy development from the Rocky Mountain oil shale is \ntruly massive with reports estimating up to 2 trillion barrels, but \nonce again, Democrats are blocking development. The Consolidated \nAppropriations Act last year established a 1-year moratorium on the \nnecessary funding to complete the final regulations for commercial \nleasing of oil shale.\n  Look at the size of this. We are talking about not 10 billion barrels \nwe would find in ANWR, not 14 billion barrels as we see on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, but 2 trillion barrels. Without congressional \naction, a 1-year delay could end up lasting much longer and, like the \nOuter Continental Shelf appropriations moratorium, continue year after \nyear.\n  The RAND Corporation estimates that as many as 1.1 trillion barrels \nare recoverable and at prices as low as $35 to $48 a barrel within the \nfirst 12 years of commercial scale production. At current rates of \nconsumption, 1.1 trillion barrels equals more than 145 years of \ndomestic supply. This number would nearly double assuming the \nDepartment of Energy's estimate of nearly 2 trillion potentially \nrecoverable barrels. Finally, development is ongoing in the Canadian \noil sands where proven reserves are about 179 billion barrels. We need \nto continue to do that. Right now, they are in jeopardy. Congressman \nWaxman has put on a prohibition in the Department of Defense using oil \nfrom those oil sands. If anyone were tempted to try to expand that so \nthat no one else in the country could use it, that would be \ndevastating. So that effort could be underway as we speak.\n  In an effort to hide their true record of blocking access to \nAmerica's own resources, the Democrats are engaged in a campaign of \nshifting blame, claiming there are 68 million acres in America where \noil and gas companies have the right to drill but are not drilling. \nSome 44 percent of the leases that have been\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\nissued are already producing oil and gas, and energy companies are in \nthe process of exploring the remaining leases to determine the energy \npotential of those lands. Unfortunately, when you get out there and you \nexplore and you try to determine how much potential production is \nthere, there are some places in the United States and anywhere in the \nworld where there simply isn't any oil. This is the problem they have. \nWe need to open the other 85 percent that currently we are unable to \naccess to allow us to go after it. Again, we are talking about some 14 \nbillion barrels that are out there.\n  We are presently considering a bill to impose new rules on \nspeculating, claiming that speculators have been driving the price of \noil to record highs. Even if speculators are having a negative effect \non the price of fuels, I am concerned that the wrong congressional \naction could actually exacerbate the problem. Rhetoric on the impact of \nspeculators simply lays the groundwork to once again implement price \ncontrols. Looking back to the 1970s, we now know that price controls \nlead to shortages, rationing, and long lines at gas stations. Over the \nlast few days, the name of Boone Pickens has been invoked many times. \nWhen asked what he thought about the speculation, he recently said \nthat:\n\n       Speculation doesn't have anything to do with it. You have \n     85 million barrels of oil available in the world and the \n     demand is at 86.4. I don't think that guy over in China \n     paying $140 for oil is blaming Wall Street speculators for \n     what is happening to him. Everybody tries to place the blame. \n     And the blame is our own lack of leadership over the last 40 \n     years on energy.\n\n  Now, I have a list of quotes I am going to actually, if there is a \nlittle bit of time--I don't have time to read them, but a list of \nquotes from people who are the knowledgeable people in this country \nsuch as Walter Williams, the economist for George Mason University:\n\n       Congressional attacks on speculation do not alter the oil \n     market's fundamental demand and supply conditions. What would \n     lower the long-term price of oil is for Congress to permit \n     exploration for the estimated billions upon billions of \n     barrels.\n\n  The International Energy Agency says that:\n\n       Blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking \n     the necessary steps to improve supply-side access and \n     investment.\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent that this list of economists be listed, \nalong with their statements concerning speculation, at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Republicans have consistently tried to do something about \nthe high prices. One of the things that people don't think about is if \nwe had all of the production, all of the crude oil, we would still have \nto refine it to use it. We have a real refinery crisis in this country. \nRight now we are looking at a situation where we would not be able to \nrefine it with the refining capability we have.\n  I introduced 3 years ago the Gas Price Act which is something that \nwould work very well. It actually took these closed military \ninstallations that were BRAC closed--Base Realignment and Closing \nCommission-closed installations--and allowed the surrounding \ncommunities to apply for EDA grants so they would be able to attract \nrefineries. This would be a good idea because for one thing, those \nclosed bases, you would not have to actually have a cleanup to \nplayground standards, so the Federal Government has saved a lot of \nmoney by doing this. I don't think there is any justification in the \nworld for people to oppose such an effort.\n  I have also introduced my Drive America On Natural Gas Act. This is \nsomething that is very significant, because this is something that is \npart of T. Boone Pickens' ideas. Let's keep in mind Boone Pickens said \nwe need to drill everywhere. We have to drill and we have to keep on \ndrilling, but we also need to explore all kinds of renewables. His idea \nis to release some of the natural gas so we can use it for compressed \nnatural gas. The price today in my State of Oklahoma for compressed \nnatural gas is 90 cents a gallon. Ninety cents a gallon. In some places \nit is as high as $2. Nonetheless, it does show that it is out there.\n  There are certain obstacles to being able to do what needs to be done \nin allowing the conversions. One is we have to effect the regulations \nof the EPA and the other one is we have to give the same benefit to \nnatural gas as we do to other renewables. If we were able to do that, \nit would open it up very rapidly. In fact, yesterday, the Republican \nleader offered a unanimous consent request that seven Republican energy \namendments be considered in order for consideration in this \nlegislation, and this was one of those.\n  I don't want to take up more time right now because I want to yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Georgia, but I will only say this: You can \nstand on the floor and say over and over and over to the American \npeople that supply and demand doesn't work; you can say that Democrats \nare not opposed to increasing the supply. Yet if you go to the Web site \nI suggested--epw.senate.gov--we have looked at every vote that has \ntaken place since the middle 1990s, and in every case, every time we \ntried to increase the supply of petroleum products for America, whether \nit is drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, ANWR, Rocky Mountain oil \nshales, or preserving Canadian oil sands, the Democrats, to the very \nlast one, have voted against it.\n  We have to increase supply. We have to keep saying it. People \nunderstand it. Even some people with basic educations know that supply \nand demand is alive and well in America. It is just that we have too \nmuch demand and not enough supply. We have to open it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 24, 2008]\n\n                       Democrats Against Drilling\n\n       Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and other liberal leaders on \n     Capitol Hill are gripped by cold-sweat terror. If they permit \n     a vote on offshore drilling, they know they will lose when \n     Blue Dogs and oil-patch Democrats defect to the GOP position \n     of increasing domestic energy production. So the last \n     failsafe is to shut down Congress.\n       Majority Leader Reid has decided that deliberation is too \n     taxing for ``the world's greatest deliberative body.'' This \n     week he cut off serious energy amendments to his \n     antispeculation bill. Then Senate Appropriations baron Robert \n     Byrd abruptly canceled a bill markup planned for today where \n     Republicans intended to press the issue. Mr. Byrd's \n     counterpart in the House, David Obey, is enforcing a similar \n     lockdown. Speaker Pelosi says she won't allow even a debate \n     before Congress's August recess begins in eight days.\n       She and Mr. Reid are cornered by substance. The upward \n     pressure on oil prices is caused by rising world-wide \n     consumption and limited growth in supplies. Yet at least 65% \n     of America's undiscovered, recoverable oil, and 40% of its \n     natural gas, is hostage to the Congressional drilling \n     moratorium.\n       The Democratic leadership is trying to smother any \n     awareness of their responsibility for high prices. They are \n     also trying to quash a revolt among Democrats who realize \n     that the country is still dependent on fossil fuels, no \n     matter how loudly quasimystical environmentalists like Al \n     Gore claim otherwise.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         Dems Cite Speculation Stats That Don't Match the Facts\n\n       Sen.

But \n     calling it speculation is way too simplistic.'' (Daniel \n     Yergin, Chairman, Cambridge Energy Research Associates)\n       John Chapman, American Enterprise Institute: ``The truth is \n     that increased speculation in oil futures is not a cause of \n     rising oil prices, but rather an effect of those prices, \n     which have skyrocketed due to growth in global demand, \n     geopolitical instability, and constricted supply in several \n     producing countries. (John Chapman, Researcher at the \n     American Enterprise Institute, 7/16/08)\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for \nyielding me part of his time. He certainly makes a very convincing \ncase.\n  I rise to discuss the actions taken today by the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission to combat manipulation in the futures market \nspecifically relating to energy activity. At 11 o'clock this morning, \nthe Acting Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at a \nnews conference announced that it was bringing an action against a \nhedge fund for manipulating and attempting to manipulate the crude oil, \nheating oil, and gasoline markets.\n  This proves that the CFTC is policing the market for suspicious \nactivity. They are not sitting back and allowing traders to run wild, \nas some in Congress have suggested.\n  While this particular case is specific to manipulation, it only makes \nsense that the surveillance efforts used to identify this activity are \nalso providing much needed additional data to the Commissioners for \nongoing monitoring efforts to detect excessive speculation--the subject \nof much debate on the Senate floor. Unfortunately, some have even \nconfused these two terms. I want to clarify this. Manipulation is \nillegal, while speculation is a normal occurrence in all of our futures \nmarkets. That said, the Commission has recognized that more information \nis necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive. I \nhappen to agree with them. We do need more information in order to make \nan accurate assessment of the situation.\n  There have been many assertions made in the Senate not based on \nfactual information. It is never a good idea to propose a solution for \nmarket conditions without carefully analyzing all of the facts. An \nuninformed solution, no matter how well-intentioned it is, can easily \nresult in unintended counterproductive outcomes.\n  Many in this body have accused CFTC of timidly utilizing their \nregulatory enforcement authorities or only utilizing these authorities \nafter extreme prompting from Congress. To the contrary, this particular \ncivil enforcement action that was filed today in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York was uncovered as part of an \ninvestigation initiated by the CFTC for offenses that took place in \nMarch 2007--long before some began blaming CFTC for the $4 gasoline.\n  Working proactively with the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, \nthe CFTC was able to uncover wrongdoing and ensure that violators of \nthe Commodity Exchange Act are identified and brought to justice.\n  This particular case took place over an 11-day period. The New York \nMercantile Exchange--as they have the authority to do and the \ninformation to carry out that authority--saw exactly what was happening \nin the early part of what was happening, and they followed it and \nimmediately shut this hedge fund operator down. So this 11-day period \nin March 2007 occurred over a year ago. The ongoing investigation has \ntaken a year to get it to where it is ready for prosecution.\n  Fortunately, the CFTC has been able to fulfill its regulatory \noversight responsibilities in spite of being horribly underfunded. \nToday's announcement affirms the dedication and hard work exhibited by \nthe CFTC.\n  Furthermore, we should not continue to hold up the confirmation of \nthose--both Democrat and Republican--whom the President has nominated \nto carry out this very important regulatory task. The American people \nwould be much better served with a fully seated Commission, a Senate-\nconfirmed Chairman, and more regulatory oversight staff than by the \nbaseless allegations made by some. If we are truly interested in a \nfully functioning regulatory body, let's provide the agency with these \ntools rather than wrongly condemning them for lack of enforcement.\n  I will close by simply saying that during the process of the passage \nof the recent farm bill, which passed overwhelmingly in this body, we \ntook action relative to market regulation by closing the so-called \nEnron loophole, which allowed for some sales on the market to take \nplace without the ability on the part of the regulators to get all of \nthe information relative to those particular trades. In addition to \nallowing the market regulators to get the information, we also \nincreased the penalty for a manipulation--just like the CFTC has filed \nthis suit on today--from $100,000 per incident to $1 million per \nincident.\n  So we are in the process of giving the CFTC the tools it needs. We \nneed to continue down that road. Let's don't destroy the markets. Here \nwe are seeing a good example of how the tools in the hands of the \nregulators are being used in the appropriate way. When someone tries to \ntake advantage of a system, the CFTC, as well as NYMEX, CME--all of the \nboards of trade--has the ability to stop this type of manipulation and \nprosecute wrongdoing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the last 36 hours now, we in the Senate \nhave been attempting to move forward on substantive policy that would \nproduce more oil and bring it into our systems to offset and, \nhopefully, lower the price our consumers are paying at the pump. But \nnothing has happened. It is interesting, the majority leader says we \ndon't have time to do it, and yet we have been here 36 hours doing \nnothing but talking when amendments could have been offered that might \nhave been substantive as it relates to taking down the Federal \nmoratorium that exists over many of these properties where we know \nthere are known oil reserves.\n  I find it fascinating that this morning in the Wall Street Journal, \nan editorial speaks about Speaker Pelosi of the House and Harry Reid, \nour majority leader, and other liberal leaders on Capitol Hill being \n``gripped by cold-sweat terror. If they permit a vote on offshore \ndrilling, they know they will lose when Blue Dogs [Democrats that are \nmore conservative over in the House] and oil-patch Democrats defect to \nthe [Republican] position of increasing domestic energy production.''\n  What would be wrong with that? It would be an admission on the part \nof Democratic leaders that their position of the last 20 years to deny \nincreased production, all in the name of environment and conservation, \nhasn't worked. They simply cannot let that dirty little secret out. \nExcept there is one real problem: The American people are beginning to \nfigure out that it didn't work. Why have we gone from 30 percent \ndependency in 1980 to 70 percent dependency today on someone other than \na U.S. producer, something other than a U.S. reserve? The reason is \nbecause we quit producing.\n  The debate today, while it is embodied in S. 3268, called a \nspeculation bill, is really about production. Republicans have simply \nsaid: Allow us to\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\namend that. Allow us to bring to the floor amendments that would, by \npotential of opportunity, produce increased production.\n  I wish to talk about one of those amendments that deal with offshore \ndrilling.\n  Several years ago, I introduced a term that is now being used by \nmany, called the ``no zone.'' By that, I simply meant that of these \nareas around the coast, shown on this map here of the United States, \nwhere we have geographical authority--meaning our territorial water--in \nwhich we are denied the right to go and explore because of a political \ndecision, because of policy made out of politics, not substance, we \nbelieve that within those areas there are literally billions of barrels \nof oil. We don't know that for sure. We only know that, based on old \ngeological surveys, there is a great potential. We do know that where \nwe were allowed to drill down in the gulf, that is where a majority of \nour current oil supplies are coming from, even in the deep water. But \non the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington, and off the coast \nof Florida, the Carolinas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia, it \nis: No, heck no. The politics won't let us go there. So we would like \nto offer a few of those amendments. We would like to change the \ncharacter of the ``no zone.''\n  Let me tell you about an amendment I would offer if I were given the \nchance to come to the floor on this bill and offer an amendment for \nfull debate. We think it is a constructive amendment. It is an \namendment we would call the Domestic Offshore Energy Security Act of \n2008. It would take all of this yellow area on the map and allow it to \ngo out to bid for the purpose of production.\n  Just a year and a half ago, the Congress--when gas was at $2-plus a \ngallon--decided we would let this little piece go into exploration and \ndevelopment. It was called lease sale 181. We debated it for weeks, \nnegotiated for weeks. Finally, we brought all of us together to agree. \nWell, we believe there is a substantial amount of product out there. We \ndon't know for sure, but the leases are going forward. It is believed \nthat there are 1.2 trillion cubic feet of gas and maybe between 185 \nmillion and 200 million barrels of oil. The advantage of this sale is \nthat it is very close to all of the known refineries and the \ninfrastructure that can bring it to the market very quickly.\n  My amendment would bring this whole area into play, where there \nliterally could be billions of barrels of oil and multitrillions of \ncubic feet of gas. But the answer is no. The Democrat leader says: No, \ncan't do that, won't do that; politically, we are not going to go \nthere. The American consumer is asking: Why? In fact, I am told that \nthe polls in Florida, by a majority, are saying: Drill it. Do it right, \ndo it responsibly, do it cleanly, but drill it. We want the royalties \nthat would come to the State of Florida that would pay for our \neducation, but more importantly, we want to bring down the price of gas \nbecause it is really breaking the family budget.\n  What happened when the President announced a few weeks ago he would \nlift an Executive order on a moratorium, when the market began to show \nthat this year the American consumer was consuming less than last year \nbecause of prices? Oil prices began to fall, from the high of $140 a \nbarrel down to, today, about $122 or $123 a barrel--nearly a $20 drop \nper barrel--on the reality that the marketplace was working, demand was \ngoing down.\n  If you keep allowing demand to slide but you work on bringing up \nproduction, you bring the price down. You save the American family's \nbudget. But here on the floor of the Senate, it is: Oh, no, we can't go \nthere. The leader of the majority party will not admit that his \npolicy--their policy over the last 20 years of denying production has \nnow brought this crisis on. That is exactly what the editorial of the \nWall Street Journal basically said.\n  Why not let the debate go forward? Why not allow amendments to be \noffered by anyone, for that matter? Why not allow those debates to go \nforward?\n  There is another interesting article from this morning. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the Wall Street Journal editorial and this \nU.S. Geological Survey Report printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Democrats Against Drilling\n\n       Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and other liberal leaders on \n     Capitol Hill are gripped by cold-sweat terror. If they permit \n     a vote on offshore drilling, they know they will lose when \n     Blue Dogs and oil-patch Democrats defect to the GOP position \n     of increasing domestic energy production. So the last \n     failsafe is to shut down Congress.\n       Majority Leader Reid has decided that deliberation is too \n     taxing for ``the world's greatest deliberative body.'' This \n     week he cut off serious energy amendments to his anti-\n     speculation bill. Then Senate Appropriations baron Robert \n     Byrd abruptly canceled a bill markup planned for today where \n     Republicans intended to press the issue. Mr. Byrd's \n     counterpart in the House, David Obey, is enforcing a similar \n     lockdown. Speaker Pelosi says she won't allow even a debate \n     before Congress's August recess begins in eight days.\n       She and Mr. Reid are cornered by substance. The upward \n     pressure on oil prices is caused by rising world-wide \n     consumption and limited growth in supplies. Yet at least 65% \n     of America's undiscovered, recoverable oil, and 40% of its \n     natural gas, is hostage to the Congressional drilling \n     moratorium.\n       The Democratic leadership is trying to smother any \n     awareness of their responsibility for high prices. They are \n     also trying to quash a revolt among Democrats who realize \n     that the country is still dependent on fossil fuels, no \n     matter how loudly quasi-mystical environmentalists like Al \n     Gore claim otherwise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n90 Billion Barrels of Oil and 1,670 Trillion Cubic Feet of Natural Gas \n                         Assessed in the Arctic\n\n       The area north of the Arctic Circle has an estimated 90 \n     billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil, \n     1,670 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural \n     gas, and 44 billion barrels of technically recoverable \n     natural gas liquids in 25 geologically defined areas thought \n     to have potential for petroleum.\n       The U.S. Geological Survey assessment released today is the \n     first publicly available petroleum resource estimate of the \n     entire area north of the Arctic Circle.\n       These resources account for about 22 percent of the \n     undiscovered, technically recoverable resources in the world. \n     The Arctic accounts for about 13 percent of the undiscovered \n     oil, 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas, and 20 \n     percent of the undiscovered natural gas liquids in the world. \n     About 84 percent of the estimated resources are expected to \n     occur offshore.\n       ``Before we can make decisions about our future use of oil \n     and gas and related decisions about protecting endangered \n     species, native communities and the health of our planet, we \n     need to know what's out there,'' said USGS Director Mark \n     Myers. ``With this assessment, we're providing the same \n     information to everyone in the world so that the global \n     community can make those difficult decisions.''\n       Of the estimated totals, more than half of the undiscovered \n     oil resources are estimated to occur in just three geologic \n     provinces--Arctic Alaska, the Amerasia Basin, and the East \n     Greenland Rift Basins. On an oil-equivalency basis, \n     undiscovered natural gas is estimated to be three times more \n     abundant than oil in the Arctic. More than 70 percent of the \n     undiscovered natural gas is estimated to occur in three \n     provinces--the West Siberian Basin, the East Barents Basins, \n     and Arctic Alaska.\n       The USGS Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal is part of a \n     project to assess the global petroleum basins using \n     standardized and consistent methodology and protocol. This \n     approach allows for an area's petroleum potential to be \n     compared to other petroleum basins in the world. The USGS \n     worked with a number of international organizations to \n     conduct the geologic analyses of these Artic provinces.\n       Technically recoverable resources are those producible \n     using currently available technology and industry practices. \n     For the purposes of this study, the USGS did not consider \n     economic factors such as the effects of permanent sea ice or \n     oceanic water depth in its assessment of undiscovered oil and \n     gas resources. The USGS is the only provider of publicly \n     available estimates of undiscovered, technically recoverable \n     oil and gas resources.\n       Exploration for petroleum has already resulted in the \n     discovery of more than 400 oil and gas fields north of the \n     Arctic Circle. These fields account for approximately 40 \n     billion barrels of oil, more than 1,100 trillion cubic feet \n     of gas, and 8.5 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. \n     Nevertheless, the Arctic, especially offshore, is essentially \n     unexplored with respect to petroleum.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Here is the headline: ``90 Billion Barrels of Oil and \n1,670 Trillion Cubic Feet of Natural Gas Accessed in the Arctic.'' That \nis called ANWR, folks, and other areas in the Arctic. Once again, it is \npolitically off limits. The oil is there, but the law says you cannot \ngo there.\n  It is really quite that simple. Who are lawmakers? We are. We are the \npolicymakers. Why aren't we on the floor today debating the amendments? \nWhy aren't we offering those amendments in a responsible fashion? Why \ndon't we deal with what the American public\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\nneeds at this moment; that is, to see their Congress being responsive \nto their greatest problem, the single greatest problem at this time, \nwhich is the price of oil and the price of gas at the pump. It will \ncreate greater problems if we don't deal with it quickly. It is \npermeating the economy and shoving up the price of nearly everything we \ntouch. Energy is the underlying force of this economy. If energy prices \ncontinue to go higher, the economy itself is weakened. Why isn't the \nCongress and the leadership of the Senate moving forward? Why are we \nstalled out and wringing our hands and saying there is no time? There \nis no time to fix the American family's budget. There is only time to \ndivert our attention to terms like ``speculation.''\n  Let me tell you, here is the bill. Here is S. 1368. There is not one \ndrop of oil in it. See that. Not one drop of oil is in this \nlegislation. But in the amendment I would offer, there could be \nmillions, if not billions, of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic \nfeet of gas. That is the reality of what we are talking about.\n  Why, why, why, Mr. Leader, are you denying the Senate, the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, the right to offer these amendments and \nvote on them? We are stalled out because of the leadership. We are \nstalled out and told we cannot go there. I don't think the American \npublic in any way understands the politics of this one.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Politics is quite simple: If you for 20 years were wrong \nand the market now shows it, how can you admit you were wrong? That is \nthe issue at hand.\n  Mr. Leader, it is time you admitted it and we got on with the \nbusiness of becoming once again a great and productive nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened for the past 20 minutes or \nso to the narrative on the floor of the Senate. My colleague from Idaho \nand I have introduced legislation last year dealing with expanding \nproduction in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and in Cuban waters. We do not \ndisagree on the issue of whether we should expand production in this \nregion. In fact, we agree on that issue. But I have heard several of my \ncolleagues come to the floor to create false choices this afternoon, \nand I want to talk about those false choices.\n  We are witnessing a time when it is very hard for people to figure \nout how to scrape enough money together to put $70 worth of gas in \ntheir tank when it is near ``e'' on the gauge. It is fascinating and \nvery disappointing to me how it's possible to fill your farm tank in \norder to harvest your crop, how an airliner is going to be able to \nafford fuel, or how is a family going to be able to afford enough money \nto put gas in their tank to go to work. These decisions are being made \nat a time when we face oil prices bouncing between $120 and $140 a \nbarrel and gasoline at $4, $4.50 a gallon. When that ought to invoke \nand spark cooperation on the floor of the Senate, there is none.\n  My colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and say: Let's open up \nthe entire Outer Continental Shelf. The Energy Information \nAdministration carried out an assessment that shows what production \nwould look like without lifting the moratorium and with lifting the \nmoratorium. What it shows is that we get some extra production in the \nyear 2020. I understand talking about next week, next decade. What is \nthe impact going to be to families, to truckers, to farmers, to \nairlines, and others if someone comes out here and says: You know what, \nwe have a real serious problem right now, but here is a solution for \n2020.\n  Sign me up for the solution in the long term, although I might have a \ndifferent approach to it. I hope by 2020 we are not quite as addicted \nto oil, particularly foreign oil from the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, Iraqis, \nor Venezuelans. Maybe we can shed the some of that addiction in 10 \nyears. Maybe that ought to be our strategy. Maybe we ought to do game \nchanging. The way to do away with our addiction is not to do more of \nthe same so that we are still addicted. That makes precious little \nsense to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from North Dakota to \nyield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask him a question because he has been a leader \nin the Senate on the question of speculation. I want to say that many \nof our Republican colleagues have come to the floor over the last \nseveral days saying virtually speculation is not the problem, not \nspeculation. I know the Senator from North Dakota has ample evidence \nand many experts behind his position. He and I have joined with the \nleadership in coming up with an approach which will try to dampen the \nfires of speculation which may be driving up oil prices and creating \nvolatility not reflected in the market.\n  I want to make sure the Senator from North Dakota is aware of what \nhappened today with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They have \ncharged an oil trading firm with manipulating oil prices, the first \ncomplaint to be announced since regulators began a new investigation \ninto wrongdoing.\n  The CFTC accused Optiver Holding, two of its subsidiaries, and three \nemployees with manipulation and attempted manipulation of crude oil, \nheating oil, and gasoline futures of the New York Mercantile Exchange, \nwhich is a regulated exchange, I might add.\n\n       ``Optiver traders amassed large trading positions, then \n     conducted trades in such a way to bully and hammer the \n     markets,'' CFTC Acting Chairman Walter Lukken said at a press \n     conference. ``These charges go to the heart of the CFTC's \n     core mission of detecting and rooting out illegal \n     manipulation of the markets.''\n\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota that his leadership on this \nissue and coming to the floor repeatedly to tell us about the \npossibility this was occurring I think has sparked this commission to \ncome to life, at least today in terms of making these charges.\n  I am going to leave this story with the Senator because I want him to \nbe able to put it in the Record every time our Republican colleagues \ncome to the floor and say speculation is not an issue. It is enough of \nan issue that there was a civil action filed today against a company \nfor hammering and bullying the market.\n  I know this is not in the nature of a question, but I wish to ask the \nSenator if he feels this action by the CFTC is an indication of what he \nhas been saying over the last several months.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it appears a Federal agency has arisen \nfrom the dead. Good for the CFTC. I have been talking a long while \nabout the CFTC being dead from the neck up. This is, after all, the \nregulatory agency that is supposed to wear the striped shirts, blow the \nwhistle, and call the fouls.\n  This apparently is manipulation of the market. We are talking about \nmanipulation. Good for them, if they have risen from the dead, if they \nare taking action against someone manipulating the marketplace.\n  The acting CFTC Chairman, whom the Senator from Illinois described, \nspent the last seven months saying there is no problem with the \nmarketplace, it is working fine. The doubling of the price of oil and \ngas in the past 12 to 14 months has been because of supply and demand, \nhe says. About a month ago, the acting Chairman had an epiphany. He \nmust have had a good night's sleep, woke up from his dream saying: OK, \nI have been saying supply and demand justifies the doubling in price, \nbut, in fact, we have been doing an investigation for seven months.\n\n  So which is it? Here is what it is. In the year 2000, 37 percent of \nthe trades in the oil futures market were speculation trades, having \nnothing to do with hedging a physical product between consumers and \nproducers; 37 percent of the trades by speculators. Today 71 percent of \nthe trades are by speculators. They don't have any interest in buying \noil, taking delivery of oil, carrying a 5-gallon can of oil, or putting \na quart of oil in their car. They don't have the foggiest interest in \noil. They have interest in buying and selling contracts and making big \nprofits. They have taken over this marketplace and broken the market.\n  The proposition on the floor of the Senate is to try to wring out \nthis excessive, relentless speculation in this market. My colleagues \ncome to the floor of the Senate, and they have developed another \nnarrative of more\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\ndrilling because they don't want to tackle this issue of speculation. I \nsaid before, 47 Members of the Senate in the minority have all \nindicated, in one form or another, that speculation is a problem. If \nyou believe that, help us get this bill to the President. Yet, they \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say we need more drilling.\n  As I described in the year 2020, we will have more to bring on more \nsupply. I don't disagree with that point. Let's talk about it; offer \nsome amendments. In fact, the majority leader has offered to the \nminority to bring your amendment to the floor. We will have a vote on \nit.\n  But what about next month? What about 6 months from now? How about \nlet's do some things that are game changing in this country? How about \nthe next decade? Between now and then, let's work to change the game.\n  I said two days ago that, in the 1960s, John F. Kennedy did not say: \nI would like to have us try to go to the Moon. I think we should think \nabout going to the Moon. I think we should make an effort to go to the \nMoon. He didn't say that. He said by the end of the decade, we are \ngoing to put a man on the Moon, and we did just that.\n  The plan of all of those who have come to the floor of the Senate \ndiminishing this legislation, degrading this legislation, saying we \nshouldn't deal with speculation and getting this market right. We \nshouldn't spend time on that. Let's instead focus on drilling. If that \nis the only thing they focus on, then that is what I call a yesterday \nforever strategy. If you want to wake up 10 years from now and keep the \nsame position, good for you. I don't.\n  I think what we ought to do is this: Let's at least address something \nthat has broken the marketplace and has doubled the price of oil and \ngas in the last year, something that experts have come to the Congress \nto testify about and some have said up to 40 percent of the current \nprice of oil is not and cannot be justified by the fundamentals of \nsupply and demand. It is because speculators have taken over this \nmarketplace.\n  Don't take it from me. Take it from the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell. \nHere is what he said in April:\n\n       The [oil] fundamentals are no problem. They are the same as \n     they were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel.\n\n  If that is the case, what is the problem? The problem is, as I \ndescribed in the chart, this market has been taken over by the \nspeculators.\n  My colleague comes and says: NYMEX and ICE, describes all that is \ngoing on, what an aggressive regulator we have. You know what, this \nregulator has been sending out no action letters. Isn't that a \nwonderful thing to perfectly describe a regulatory agency that wants to \ntake no action for anything? It said: Let me be willfully blind and not \nsee what is happening. By the way, because of these no action letters, \nI can't see what is happening in the over-the-counter market, the \nintercontinental exchange, and all of the unregulated trades because I \nhave decided I don't want to see it. Then let me go to the Congress and \ntestify, and with a straight face--I am sure suppressing a grin--at \nleast with a straight face say, I don't see anything that represents \nanything other than supply and demand.\n  My question to them was: I understand you don't see that. Is it the \ncase you see very little because you have chosen, through no action \nletters and other limitations, to decide you don't want to see it all?\n  We brought a bill to the floor of the Senate that says we have a lot \nof problems. First and foremost, let's set this market straight, \nputting pressure downward and preserving the oil futures market for \nthat which was intended in 1936. It was for the hedging of a physical \nproduct between consumers and producers. That is what it was for. It \nhas now been taken over by the carnival of greed. Speculators control \nthese markets, have driven up the price despite the fact there has been \nno change in the fundamentals.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say drill. I have had a \nbill in for a year and a half to say drill more in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico and allow U.S. companies to produce in Cuban waters. I am also \none of the four Senators who opened up lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico \nfor drilling. I support that. I am fine with drilling. But if drilling \nis your only answer, boy, that, in my judgment, is a pretty pathetic \nfuture. Here is what Boone Pickens says. Boone Pickens and I have \ndisagreed on a lot of things, but he came to Congress this week:\n\n       I've been an oil man all my life, but this is one emergency \n     we can't drill our way out of. But if we can create a new \n     renewable energy network, we can break our addiction to \n     foreign oil.\n\n  Think of this. What if between now and 2020, if we start now we can \nactually have a new barrel of oil by 2020, and you say to somebody down \nthe block: Cheer up, things are going to be better in 12 years--that is \none position to take, I guess.\n  What if the other position is as Mr. Pickens suggests? What if we did \nthis: We are going to produce oil. We want to be less dependent, \nhowever, on the Saudis, Kuwaitis, Venezuela, and so on, because if we \ndidn't get their oil for some reason, we would be flat on our back as \nan economy. This makes our country vulnerable. We have to be less \ndependent on them. We are going to use oil we produce.\n  How about if we decide to do something dramatically different? How \nabout in the wind belt from Texas to North Dakota where we produce a \nmassive quantity of wind and have the capability of taking the energy \nfrom the wind and producing electricity? And how about in the Sun Belt \nwhere we move dramatically to solar energy and create a superhighway of \ntransmission lines to be able to move that energy all around this \ncountry? How about if we do that for a decade and then say: You know \nwhat, all that natural gas we are using for coal-fired generating \nplants, we can displace a fair amount of that with wind and solar and a \nsuperhighway of transmission lines, and we can dramatically change \nAmerica's energy future.\n  We need more conservation and energy efficiency and dramatic \nincreases in renewables. There are so many exciting things we can do to \nchange America's future. Yet, my colleagues come to the floor of the \nSenate for a different pursue. They plant their flag, and say: We want \nour future to be the same as our past, and every 10 or 15 years, they \nwill be content to come here and say: Yes, we have an urgent problem \nand what we ought to do is more of the same. That is not a future that \nmakes much sense to us.\n  Again, coming back to this issue, we are saying with this legislation \non the floor of the Senate requires that we do first things first. We \nshould do a lot of things, we agree with that. Senator Bingaman is \nintroducing a bill I fully support as a cosponsor. It deals with a \nwhole range of other issues with which we have to deal. First things \nfirst. At least let's address this issue of excess speculation that has \nbroken the commodity futures market for oil.\n  To my colleagues who say, you know what, this is all about drilling, \nI say to them: Come to the floor of the Senate and tell me what has \nhappened in the last year, what has happened in supply and demand that \njustifies a doubling of the price of oil. They will not come and cannot \ncome because they don't have an answer to that.\n  I can give them a partial answer. If anything would have been \nexpected to happen to the price of oil and gas, it should have gone \ndown because we have driven nearly 6 billion fewer miles in America \nthan we did in the previous 6 months. So we are using less energy and \nless gasoline. So one would expect, if you are using less, you would \nput some downward pressure on prices. But that is not the case. Prices \ngo up like a Roman candle, double in a year.\n\n  The only conceivable reason given us is by the experts who don't have \na vested interest in this issue of the oil futures markets, and they \nsay that the market is now broken. Fidel Gheit has been an Oppenheimer \nanalyst for 30, 35 years--the top energy analyst for Oppenheimer--and \nhe says: Look, this is like a casino, open 24/7, like a highway with no \nspeed limit, he said, and no cops, and everybody is going 120 miles an \nhour.\n  Is that really what we are willing to allow an oil futures market to \nbe, if it drives up the cost of oil and gas, doubles it in a year, and \nimposes this kind of burden and financial penalty on every American \nfamily and every American business; imposes this kind of burden on some \nof our major industries, such as airlines and trucking\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\ncompanies and farmers and others? That is a back breaker. Are we really \nwilling to stand on the floor of the Senate and say: Yeah, that is OK. \nIt is OK. Let's do something that will increase the production of a \nbarrel of oil in 2020.\n  That seems to me to be a false choice that we are being offered. I \nthink it was Will Rogers who once said:\n\n       It is not what he knows that bothers me, it's what he says \n     he knows for sure that just ain't so.\n\n  I think about that as I hear this debate on the floor of the Senate; \nall this assertiveness about one answer. Do something now so we have \nmore oil in 2020. What about tomorrow, next week, or next month? What \ndo you want to do about that? What about a market that is broken; do \nyou ever care about fixing it? What about the fact that investment \nbanks and hedge funds have marched right directly into the oil futures \nmarket?\n  The Wall Street Journal writes about investment banks that are \nactually purchasing oil storage so they can purchase oil and keep it \noff the market. Pension funds--CalPERS and others--are moving money \ninto the oil futures market as if it is just another share of stock. \nThat is just pure speculation. That massive quantity of money flooding \ninto this market has dramatically changed the market.\n  Now, I have had a lot of people come and see me about these issues \nbecause some are very upset with what we are trying to do. They like \nthe speculation in the marketplace because a lot of people made a lot \nof money by speculating in this marketplace. I think this marketplace \nneeds to exist. You have to have a market that represents a place for \nlegitimate hedging of a physical product. But when the market is \nbroken, you also have to have a regulator with the strength, the \ncapability, and the willingness to stand up and do what is necessary to \nfix it.\n  The current regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has \nnot done that, has not demonstrated a willingness to do that, and it \nseems to me Congress must. Our legislation does a couple of things. It \nsays to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: You determine who is \ntrading out there and distinguish between them. Those who are engaged \nin legitimate hedging of a physical product between consumers and \nproducers, that is fine. That is what the market was created for. All \nothers are pure speculators, and we establish strong position limits on \nthose speculators to try to shut down that speculation, that excess \nspeculation in the marketplace. Relatively simple. But it does cause a \nfirestorm of protest by those who are making a lot of money having \nbroken this marketplace.\n  I suppose there is room--I shouldn't say I suppose. There is room for \ndisagreement. I respect those who disagree. But it seems to me that \nthis country will pay a very high price if we don't understand the need \nto cooperate. There is no Republican or Democrat label on the fuel \ngauge on a car. There is just ``full'' and ``empty.'' And all too often \nthese days it is empty because of what has happened to prices. I think \nthe American people expect and demand we do something that addresses \nthese issues.\n  The first step--the first step and most important step, in my \njudgment--is to set this market straight and to distinguish between \nexcess speculation and legitimate hedging and establish position limits \nin order to put downward pressure on gas and oil prices. We are told by \nsome very distinguished people who have testified before our committees \nthat we could see as much as a 40-percent decrease in the price of oil \nand gas just by wringing the oil speculators out of the futures market.\n  If we did that, it would be a good thing, a good thing for our \ncountry. Then, yes, we have much yet to do. I don't disagree at all \nwith that, and some of it is drilling. But as I said before, if our \nfuture is just to continue down that road, without understanding the \nneed for a game-changing, moon-shot plan to make us less dependent on \nthe Saudis, less dependent on foreign oil, this country will have \nmissed an enormous opportunity and put its future in jeopardy.\n  I remain hopeful. It is now Thursday, and we have been largely at \nparade rest most of the week. The minority has required us, in effect, \nto spend 30 hours postcloture--30 hours postcloture--doing nothing, \nwhich makes precious little sense. I think the country senses some \nemergency here, but some of my colleagues in Congress sense no such \nemergency. So we spend 30 hours largely doing nothing, and then we will \ncome to a cloture vote to shut off debate to see if we can perhaps get \nto a vote to end this relentless speculation.\n  My hope is we will have sufficient votes to do that.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 21 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe a couple of my colleagues are \ncoming, so I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfor Senator Durbin a story that he described on the floor titled \n``Traders Manipulated Oil Prices.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Traders Manipulated Oil Prices--U.S.\n\n                         (By Steve Hargreaves)\n\n       New York (CNNMoney.com)--The government charged an oil \n     trading firm Thursday with manipulating oil prices in the \n     first complaint to be announced since the regulators began a \n     new investigation into wrongdoings in the energy markets.\n       The Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused Optiver \n     Holding, two of its subsidiaries and three employees with \n     manipulation and attempted manipulation of crude oil, heating \n     oil and gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n       ``Optiver traders amassed large trading positions, then \n     conducted trades in such a way to bully and hammer the \n     markets,'' CFTC Acting Chairman Walt Lukken said at a press \n     conference. ``These charges go to the heart of the CFTC's \n     core mission of detecting and rooting out illegal \n     manipulation of the markets.''\n       In May, under the backdrop of record oil prices and calls \n     from legislators to crack down on speculative oil trading and \n     market manipulation, the CFTC announced a wide-ranging probe \n     into oil price manipulation. The agency says it has dozens of \n     investigations ongoing.\n       The complaint filed Thursday names Bastiaan van Kempen, \n     chief executive; Christopher Dowson, a head trader; and \n     Randal Meijer, head of trading at an Optiver subsidiary.\n       The CFTC said the firm attempted to ``bang the close'' by \n     amassing large positions just before markets closed--forcing \n     prices up--then selling them quickly to drive prices down and \n     pocketing the difference.\n       The alleged manipulation was attempted 19 times on 11 days \n     in March 2007, the agency said. In at least five of those 19 \n     times, traders succeeded in driving prices higher twice and \n     lower three times, according to the CFTC.\n       Calls to Optiver seeking comment were not answered, and an \n     email was not immediately returned.\n       CFTC stressed that the price changes were small and the \n     manipulation was isolated, and that the investigation has \n     nothing to do with the recent heat the agency has taken on \n     Capitol Hill over rising oil prices.\n\n\n                        Traders in the spotlight\n\n       CFTC has repeatedly said that speculators are not to blame \n     for rising oil prices, and any cases of price manipulation--\n     such as the one brought Thursday--have only a small, if any, \n     effect on oil prices.\n       The CFTC is the government's main regulator of commodity \n     markets. Its officials have been hauled before Congress and \n     asked repeatedly whether manipulation or excessive \n     speculation is playing a role in record oil prices.\n       Repeatedly, CFTC experts have said they have found no \n     evidence that speculators--investors who do not ultimately \n     use crude oil--are to blame for the rising prices. They say \n     trading information shows no correlation between investment \n     activity and price swings.\n       Others, such as the International Energy Agency, have also \n     said speculators are not to blame. They've pointed to other \n     non-traded commodities that have risen in price even faster \n     than oil, and to the fact that there is no evidence of a \n     bubble, such as excess oil sitting around in storage.\n       Still, the correlation of a four-fold increase of \n     investment money into oil futures and a four-fold increase in \n     oil prices since 2004 has not gone unnoticed. Many lawmakers, \n     consumer rights advocates and even some oil industry analysts \n     say speculation is at least partly to blame.\n       Against that backdrop, the CFTC has been ordered to \n     investigate the matter more thoroughly and dozens of \n     investigations are underway. The agency may soon be given a \n     bigger staff and wider powers under bills being debated in \n     Congress.\n       Over the years, the CFTC has found isolated incidents of \n     price manipulation--when an oil producer controls products to \n     influence prices--or other cases of wrongdoing. Since 2002, \n     the agency has charged 66 defendants with energy market \n     violations.\n       In a recent case, BP settled a suit that alleged the \n     company tried to corner the propane market to inflate prices \n     in 2003 and 2004. BP agreed to pay a $303 million settlement.\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\n       But overall, most experts say the incidents are so \n     scattered, and the energy market so large, that it's unlikely \n     a single trader or group of traders can have substantial sway \n     over prices.\n       Correction: An earlier version of the story said \n     indictments have been brought against the company and some of \n     its employees. The charges are civil, not criminal.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   U.S. Troops Dying of Electrocution\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe the majority leader is coming \nover, but I would like to speak until he arrives, at which point I will \ncontinue later.\n  Mr. President, we had a hearing yesterday before the Senate \nAppropriations Committee that I had requested. That followed a hearing \nthat I had conducted on the Democratic policy committee, the 17th \nhearing I have conducted and chaired, looking into the issue of \ncontractor irregularities and waste, fraud, and abuse involving \ncontractors with respect to the war in Iraq.\n  I want to talk just for a moment about what is happening with respect \nto these contractors.\n  We are shoveling money out the door. Three-quarters of $1 trillion \nhas been spent, and much of it ends up in the pockets of contractors, \nand much of the work by contractors not only fleeces the American \ntaxpayer, but it represents, I think, the greatest waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the history of this country. I think it is also the case that \nit endangers the lives of American soldiers.\n  So what I would like to do for a moment is to describe the hearing \nthat I held recently and show a photograph of Cheryl Harris and her \nson, SSG Ryan Maseth.\n  Ryan Maseth was an Army Ranger and a Green Beret. He was killed in \nIraq. He wasn't killed by an insurgent or killed by enemy fire. He was \nkilled because he was electrocuted while he was taking a shower at the \nArmy base. He was electrocuted while taking a shower.\n  It turns out the contractor that wired that particular area didn't \nknow how to wire and didn't properly attach ground wires. So when this \nArmy Ranger reached up and touched a pipe, he was electrocuted and \ndied.\n  The Army initially told Cheryl they thought perhaps her son had taken \nan electrical appliance into the shower and, therefore, was \nelectrocuted. Not true. It is not true. Halliburton--or Kellogg, Brown \n& Root, its former subsidiary--had been given the contract for wiring \nthese facilities at Army bases and were hiring, among others, third-\ncountry nationals who had very little electrical experience. Two people \nwho were electricians and working there in Iraq and Afghanistan for \nKellogg, Brown & Root came and testified and said the work done by KBR \nwas the most shoddy, unbelievably sloppy work.\n  Thirteen people have been electrocuted in Iraq as a result of these \nkinds of things. So I don't understand the recent order by the Defense \nContract Management Agency, and announced by General Petraeus, that the \nPentagon is going to have the same contractor that caused some of these \nproblems--the contractor that has in a number of instances failed to \nfix faulty wiring--do a comprehensive review of these problems \nthroughout U.S. military installations in Iraq. It makes precious \nlittle sense to me that would be the case.\n  This is Larraine McGee. Her son was killed as well. Larraine McGee's \nson was killed while power washing a humvee. He was killed not by an \nenemy combatant but power washing a humvee vehicle. Again, improper \nwiring and grounding meant this soldier was electrocuted.\n  How do these things go unfixed? What kind of work is done by \ncontractors, and who cares about all this? We had testimony from Debbie \nCrawford, who was an electrician who worked for the contractor in Iraq. \nShe described work by people who were not qualified. She described KBR \nsupervisors who said: Well, this is not the United States. There is no \nOSHA here.\n  Mr. Jeffrey Bliss, an electrician for KBR, said there was pervasive \ncarelessness and disregard for quality electrical work at Kellogg, \nBrown & Root.\n  Again, I say to you that we are told, with the news of all of these \nproblems, with 13 people, 11 of them soldiers, being electrocuted in \nIraq because of shoddy wiring by contractors, the Pentagon has asked \nthe same contractor to go out and review the work. It is nearly \nunbelievable to me.\n  Mr. President, there are so many problems in Iraq contracting that I \nam going to try to come tomorrow and talk about the 17 hearings I have \nheld and how much money the American taxpayers have been charged for \nsuch shoddy work. It is not just fleecing the American taxpayers, it is \nalso injuring American soldiers when we have contractors not doing the \njob for which they were contracted to do.\n  Again, this is a photograph of Larraine McGee, who is Sergeant \nEverett's mother, and Sergeant Everett, as I indicated, was \nelectrocuted as a result of improper grounding. Ms. McGee learned from \na newspaper that 10 other soldiers were electrocuted in Iraq due to \nfaulty electrical grounding and faulty wiring. So she came to Congress \npleading for help, pleading that somebody do something. She said:\n\n       Anger has now taken over my grief. I plead with you to do \n     something to bring an end to this unnecessary cause of death \n     to our soldiers. They should not have to worry about stepping \n     into a shower or using a power washer in the safety of an \n     established base.\n\n  As I indicated, the Pentagon ordered there be a comprehensive \ninspection of electrical installations at the Army bases in Iraq, but \nit hired the same company to do the inspections, the same company who \nhad hired two electricians who came to this Congress to say the \nelectrical work was unbelievably shoddy and done, in some cases, by \npeople who didn't have the foggiest idea what they were doing.\n  I sent a letter to General Petraeus last Friday, signed by Senators \nCasey, Cantwell, Klobuchar, and Whitehouse, urging him to replace KBR \nin these inspections. The inspections should be done by objective, \nqualified electricians. KBR has shown itself to be incapable of fixing \nelectrical hazards that had been known for years. It is an insult to \nthe memory of these soldiers that KBR has now been assigned to conduct \nthe inspections.\n  There is more to this story. I will, tomorrow, visit about a wider \nrange of these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 3333 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into \na colloquy with my Republican colleagues for the remaining 30 minutes \nof our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if you have been watching television \nlately, you have seen Boone Pickens. In the Democratic caucus, you have \nseen Boone Pickens. In the Republican caucus, you have seen Boone \nPickens. Boone Pickens has said a lot of things, but the thing he says \nthat I think most of us agree with here is that we are in the midst of \nthe greatest transfer of wealth in our country's history as we pay for \nforeign oil and that we do not need talk, we need action.\n  In these next few minutes, what we hope to do on the Republican side \nof the aisle is make absolutely clear what we are trying to achieve \nover the weekend and during this week.\n  What we see is that $4 gasoline prices are the single biggest problem \nfacing our country. What we know is that what the people of this \ncountry want us to do is to take up this issue, give it our best ideas, \nvote on it, and come up with a substantial result that increases the \nsupply of new energy and reduces the demand for energy, which is the \nway you change the price of energy. That should be simple enough to do, \nbut the fact is that the Democratic\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\nleader has had us all tied up in parliamentary knots since last Friday. \nWe could have been doing this every single day since last Friday.\n  Just to give an idea of what we have in mind, we have a real solution \nin mind: conservation; deep-sea exploration; removing the moratorium on \noil shale so that, in an environmentally safe way, we can proceed with \nthat; Alaskan energy production; clean nuclear power; military coal-to-\nliquid transportation fuels; home heating oil assistance. That is just \nthe beginning of the kind of debate we ought to be having. We could \nhave been having it since Friday.\n  I see my friend from Georgia in the Chamber. He has been a leader in \nnuclear power. I ask the Senator from Georgia, isn't clean nuclear \npower essential to any supply of new American energy?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. It absolutely is \nessential. The Senator and I share a common border between the States \nof Georgia and Tennessee, and along that border, Tennessee Valley \noperates. They are a big producer of efficient, inexpensive, reliable \nelectric energy produced by nuclear power.\n  In the United States of America today, 19 percent of our electricity \nis generated by nuclear, 81 percent by coal, gas, and a sliver by \nhydro. That 19 percent that is nuclear does two things: No. 1, it is \nreliable, and No. 2, it emits zero carbon. Carbon reduction is in the \nbest interests of our climate. It is also in the best interests \ngeopolitically of the United States of America, by reducing our \ndependence on foreign imported oil.\n  I have offered an amendment to this bill, which has been filed, which \nis a new nuclear title, which reenergizes the nuclear energy business \nin the United States, which has basically been dormant since the mid-\n1970s while other countries around the world have embraced nuclear \nenergy as the solution to their fossil fuel problem in terms of energy \nproduction and electric production. Look at the nation of France. \nEighty-seven percent of their electricity is generated by nuclear. They \nhave developed a reprocessing MOX facility that reduces their waste by \n90 percent. So they have almost eliminated the waste problem, and they \nalmost have total reliability on nuclear energy.\n  There is no silver bullet in this challenge of reducing gas prices \nand reducing our dependence on foreign oil, but there are a lot of \nbullets we have in our arsenal if we are only willing to put them in \nthe chamber. Nuclear is one of them.\n  One of the great things Senator Alexander advocated so much is the \nplug-in car that we know is coming. You can plug it in at night, \nrecharge it, and the next day drive it and use it. At night, we are \ngenerating a lot of electric power that goes to waste because everybody \nis asleep and activity is slow. If you plug your car in at night, you \nare making good, efficient use of the electricity you are generating \nand wasting, and you are reducing totally, because you use electricity, \ndependence on oil.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, nuclear energy is \na piece of the puzzle--and this is a puzzle. I happen to know the \nanswer to the puzzle. It is all the resources the United States has at \nits disposal to reduce its importing of foreign oil, increase our \nconservation, and incentivize production of the energy we know we have \nwithin our own capacity and within our own boundaries. I thank the \nSenator for recognizing nuclear.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership on \nnuclear power. If we care about global warming in any respect, there is \nno way to deal with that in a generation without nuclear power, which \nis free of carbon, free of mercury, free of nitrogen, and free of \nsulfur. It is the best way we have to move ahead with that, and we \nshould, in this debate, be thinking of ways to make it possible for \nthis country to be building five or six new nuclear plants a year, \nproducing more American energy.\n  The Senator from Georgia spoke about a plug-in electric car. I know \nwhen I first started speaking of that, some of my friends in Tennessee \nthought I had been out in the Sun too long. But I found out the Senator \nfrom Utah was way ahead of me. In fact, an important part of the \nRepublican proposal--and I know on the Democratic side there are many \nwho agree with this--is to make it commonplace in America for us to \nreduce the amount of oil we use by using electric cars and trucks that \nplug in.\n  As I move to the Senator from Utah, I hasten to add--I sat here last \nnight listening to the Democratic leader characterize the Republican \nproposal as only drilling. I know the Democratic leader has a lot of \nresponsibilities, and he may not have had time to read our proposal \ncarefully. An important part of our proposal is to make it commonplace \nfor Americans to drive plug-in cars and trucks, thereby reducing the \namount of oil we use. That is the demand side of the equation. The \ndifference between us and the Democratic leader is we understand that \nthe law of supply and demand has both supply and demand.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Utah does not believe that plug-in \nelectric cars and trucks are an important way to reduce our use of oil?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague and thank him for his leadership in \nthis matter.\n  Back to the nuclear thing, I drove a hydrogen vehicle not too long \nago. If we had these nuclear powerplants, we would have enough \nhydrogen. We could do it. The problem is we only have 9 million tons \nand we need 150 million tons just to start it.\n  But having raised the hybrid and plug-in hybrid issue, let me \nsay Americans are looking to Congress to address our current energy \ncrisis, and we should be pursuing every reasonable option to reducing \nour addiction to foreign oil.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Tennessee may be aware that I was the \nsponsor of the CLEAR Act, which was signed into law as part of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 and as part of the transportation bill which \npassed the same year.\n  The CLEAR Act has been providing tax credits to consumers who \npurchase alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, including \nbattery electric and hybrid cars. It has also been providing incentives \nfor new alternative fuel stations and for the use of alternative fuels \nin vehicles.\n  Our transportation sector is 97 percent dependent on oil. I am all \nfor oil. We certainly need more of it, but we also must find ways to \ndiversify our transportation fuels.\n  I have heard some argue we must promote solar, wind, and geothermal \nas an answer to high gas prices. Well, obviously, cars and trucks don't \nrun on electricity. It is going to take us a little while to get there.\n  But what if we changed that?\n  Why not use plug-ins to apply hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal, \nand nuclear to our transportation sector? Talk about adding diversity \nto our transportation fuels.\n  Immediately after the CLEAR Act was signed into law, I began working \non legislation to promote plug-in hybrid vehicles. It was a bipartisan \neffort, and I received strong and early assistance from Senators Maria \nCantwell and Barack Obama, of all persons. We introduced S. 1617, the \nFREEDOM Act, which would provide four strong tax incentives promoting \nplug-in hybrid vehicle purchases, and also the U.S. manufacture of \nthese vehicles and their technologies.\n  I am pleased that the plug-in hybrid idea has remained bipartisan. I \nknow that portions of the FREEDOM Act have been included in both the \nRepublican and Democrat energy extenders bills.\n  I believe we will see the day when the electric grid becomes a \nsignificant new alternative transportation fuel. We should keep in mind \nthat our electric grid is a domestic resource. You won't see our \nPresident flying to the Middle East begging the Saudis to send us more \nelectrons. We can do it right here.\n  Electrons are not only domestic, but they are much cheaper and much \ncleaner than gasoline.\n  Best of all, the United States is well positioned to be the world \nleader in the development of plug-in hybrid vehicles. We have already \nseen the California-based Tesla Motors plug-in electric vehicle. Raser \nTechnologies based in Utah, has developed a very powerful and efficient \nAC induction motor, and A123 Systems, based in Massachusetts, has \ndeveloped a very advanced lithium\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nion battery that has been configured specifically for electric-drive \nvehicles.\n  Also, General Motors will soon offer a plug-in hybrid Saturn vehicle, \nand that will be followed by the plug-in hybrid Volt. The Volt will be \none of the most exciting vehicle innovations of our lifetimes. It will \nallow the average commuter to drive to work and back without using one \ndrop of oil. Our friends on the other side will be delighted. The \nproblem is we cannot do it right now. We have to have something to \npower our trucks, planes, trains, and cars. The volt will run entirely \non electricity for up to 40 miles. For longer trips that exceed the \nrange of the battery, the vehicle will switch into a very efficient \nhybrid vehicle. The U.S. is truly on the cutting-edge of technology in \ndeveloping commercial, electron powered vehicles.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that my good friend Senator Alexander has \nalso shown a great deal of leadership in promoting plug-in hybrids. And \nI would ask him if it isn't true that our Nation is in position to lead \nthe world on the potential of shifting some of our transportation needs \nover to the electric grid? Perhaps we are not quite willing to lead it \nbecause it takes time to get that accomplished?\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership. \nBefore I answer his question, I wish to emphasize our point here. What \nwe are hoping to do is to show that, on the Republican side--and we \nbelieve there are many Democrats who feel this way too--we believe the \nsolution to high gasoline prices is finding more American energy and \nusing less. We are willing to do both. The Democratic leader is not \nwilling to find more, for some reason.\n  But on Senator Hatch's point, the most promising opportunity I \nbelieve for using less oil in the near term is the plug-in hybrid car \nand truck by a confluence of two things: One is all the car companies \nyou talked about who are about to produce the car. I can add to that \nNissan, at the dedication of its new North American headquarters in \nNashville this week, announced it intends to market a plug-in pure \nelectric vehicle that will go 100 miles with a charge in 2010 for \nfleets and for individuals in 2012.\n\n  One may say: Well, where are you going to get all this electricity? \nWe have plenty of electricity at night. In our region in Tennessee, the \nTennessee Valley Authority has the equivalent of seven or eight nuclear \npowerplants of unused electricity at night, which could be used for \nplug-in cars and trucks.\n  So I think there will be a great many people in Tennessee and in Utah \nand across this country who very quickly will be plugging in at night \nin a wall socket and filling up, so to speak, for a dollar or two, \ninstead of filing up for $80 at the gasoline pump.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I mention to my colleague this little company, Raser \nTechnologies in Utah, now has developed an electric motor, not very \nlarge, that has more thrust, more--I do not know what to call it, but \nmore actual energy than the gas combustion engines.\n  They are about to put one of those motors on a pickup truck that will \nget, according to them, around 120 miles per gallon of gas. We can get \nthere, but it is going to take us a number of years to get there.\n  In the immediate future, we have to find more oil so we quit sending \n$700 billion or more every year--and that is going to go up every \nyear--overseas that does not do us very much good. Because that is all \ngone once it is gone. We should keep that money here so we can do all \nthe things we need to do for the American people.\n  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why the other side will not \nget together with us and help us to put all these elements together and \nrecognize it is going to take oil to get us over the next few years to \nwhere these wonderful things can explode. They are doable. We can do \nthem now, except we cannot manufacture them fast enough or get the \nmanufacturing lines up in a short period of time.\n  But if we can, it will be amazing. I remember when I got into the \nhybrid car business in the CLEAR Act. We found that hybrid cars could \nbe driven on HOV-2 lanes during the rush hour. Automatically, they sold \nout. We knew just on that one little incentive, so we put incentives in \nto develop hybrid cars in the CLEAR Act, we have them in the Freedom \nAct as well, plus incentives for all kinds of other things. Frankly, \nthey have worked amazingly well. But in the interim time, we are going \nto have to have oil. I hope we can find more and use less through these \nother mechanisms.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the majority leader, who I think has some \nremarks to make. We would be glad to suspend the colloquy if he would \nlike to do that now.\n\n\n         Capitol Police Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, some may know that when I attended George \nWashington Law School many years ago, I worked full time on the swing--\nor night shift--as a Capitol police officer.\n  My service as a Capitol policeman was not one where I did anything \ncourageous or notable.\n  But even then, before the heightened awareness to threat we have \ntoday, we police officers knew if the call came to sacrifice to protect \nthis U.S. Capitol, our jobs meant answering the call.\n  Ten years ago, two officers did just that.\n  Special Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were stationed \nnear the east entrance on the House side, mere steps from where we \nstand.\n  When a gunman attempted to bypass metal detectors, Officer Chestnut \nanswered the call of duty and blocked his path.\n  The gunman shot Officer Chestnut point blank.\n  Hearing shots, Special Agent Gibson also answered the call of duty.\n  He warned nearby staffers to seek cover and confronted the attacker. \nThey exchanged fire.\n  Despite valiant efforts to keep both heroes alive, including efforts \nby my predecessor, Senator Frist, Special Agent Gibson and Officer \nChestnut died from their wounds.\n  I knew Agent Gibson. During a congressional retreat to Virginia, he \ncame to care for my wife when she became ill during the night. I \nremember how he ran to her side. I will never forget how kind and \ngentle he was with her.\n  I knew Officer Chestnut only by face and in shared greetings whenever \nwe passed each other.\n  But I do know he was a veteran of the Vietnam war, had given 18 years \nof service to the Capitol Police, and heartbreakingly, was just months \naway from a hard-earned retirement.\n  We are honored to have Agent Gibson's wife Lyn and their children, \nKristen, Jack, and Danny; Officer Chestnut's wife Wen-Ling and their \nchildren, Will and Karen; and their many cherished friends and family.\n  We hope that it has been some comfort to you--the ones they loved \nmost--to know that in the 10 years since that terrible day, some \nmeasure of you burden has come to rest upon all of our shoulders.\n  So today we plant a tree in the name and memory of John Gibson and \nJacob Chestnut.\n  The tree is small now, but every day it will grow taller, stronger, \nand broader. Its roots will grasp ever deeper for the American soil \nthat lies below, the American soil that both men defended so \nheroically.\n  As this tree takes root and grows and flourishes, it will remind us \nalways of these two brave men.\n  And though it will shed its leaves in the fall, it will always bloom \nwhen spring arrives again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for his \ncomments. The Republican Leader would want me to say, he speaks for all \nof us in expressing the respect for the families of the two fallen men \nand our appreciation to the service of all the Capitol police officers \ntoday. We will have an opportunity, within a few minutes, to honor the \nfallen men.\n  Mr. Hatch was saying, the Senator from Utah, we have impressive ways \nto use less oil. But we also have important ways to find more oil. One \nof those ways would be to use technology to turn coal into aviation \nfuel; a proven technology which is available, which in the past has had \nsome challenges, but there are some new techniques. One of the Senators \nwho is a leading advocate of coal-to-liquid technology understands it \nwell, the Senator from Wyoming. I ask the Senator from\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\nWyoming: Would it not be important for our national security to at \nleast take steps toward turning coal into liquid aviation fuel?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Most certainly it would be very important to turn that \ncoal into liquid fuel for aviation. If you take a look at this \nmorning's Politico, an issue of the Pentagon, the Department of Defense \nis the Nation's biggest oil consumer, burning 395,000 barrels per day, \nabout as much as the country of Greece.\n  The Air Force's thirsty planes burn more than half the fuel supplied \nfor the entire U.S. military. It did receive $1.5 billion in new relief \nfrom Congress for fuel and still has $400 million left to go.\n  When you look at that and say: What else could we do to help lower \nthat cost, not just for the consumer who fills their tank at home but \nalso for your military, it is converting coal to liquid. The technology \nis there. People ask: Is there enough coal and how would you do it?\n  There is an incredibly abundant supply of coal in this Nation. To me, \ncoal is the most available, affordable, reliable, and secure source of \nenergy we have in this Nation. Wyoming is the No. 1 coal producer in \nthe United States. There is enough coal in Wyoming alone to help our \nNation for centuries, for hundreds of years. Coal is there and the \ntechnology is there.\n  Right now under the law, the military is not allowed to make a \ncontract long term to put that coal into liquid. But the technology is \nthere. We have an exciting company in Wyoming, near Medicine Bow, \nbuilding a plant to do this, to convert the coal to liquid. But it is \nnot only Wyoming\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, and the Senator from Tennessee knows, \nthere is coal all around the United States--coal in West Virginia, coal \nin Kentucky, coal in Pennsylvania, coal in Illinois, coal in Wyoming, \ncoal in Montana. Everyplace we need energy we have coal.\n  Some folks are saying: What about the carbon dioxide? But the \ntechnology is there to get the carbon dioxide, to sequester it, and \nactually to use it for more oil development.\n  You take an old burned-out oil well where there is not a lot of oil \ncoming out. There is a way to inject the carbon dioxide and get out \nmore oil. So it is not only good because you can use the coal for the \nliquids, you can also use this carbon dioxide to get even more oil. By \nthat, you are certainly finding more, with something we have here.\n  To me, this is so much about becoming, as a nation, energy self-\nsufficient. The only way we can do that is to rely on American sources \nof energy. We are sending hundreds of millions of dollars overseas to \npeople who are not our friends--hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  This is America's treasure going overseas. Why? Because we are not \nenergy self-sufficient. But with all the coal resources we have all \nacross this country, and the technology, we can today start converting \nthe coal to liquids to be used for aviation, to be used for our \nmilitary. The No. 1 user is our military in terms of the largest user \nof our energy.\n  It seems to me, to the Senator from Tennessee, that when we have this \ndiscussion--and I hear Senator Isakson talking about nuclear, finding \nmore energy that way, I hear Senator Hatch talking about the cars and \nusing less energy that way--this is one more way in this whole \nportfolio of different ways to use energy as we find more and use less.\n  Because the American people are going to continue to use all the \nenergy, we need all the sources of energy. That is the way we can keep \ndown the price at the pump for people all across our country.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his leadership. \nAs he speaks, it reminds me of how much I wish, instead of our being in \na parliamentary position where all we can do is talk, the Democratic \nleader would put us in a parliamentary position where we can act. I \nmean, we are prepared to act. We have offered an amendment that has a \nseries of suggestions about how to find more American energy and use \nless.\n  We may not be right in every case. But I believe the American people \nexpect us, expect us to take up these issues and debate them and use \nthem, whether it is plug-in electric cars, to use less oil, or, for \nexample, I see the Senator from Alaska is here, whether it is using \nmore of Alaskan energy.\n  Every time we talk about more American energy, we must think about \nAlaska because so much energy is there. I wonder if the Senator would \nnot agree, that there is not one way, but a whole series of ways we \nmight change the law to improve our country's security, improve our \nsupply of oil and gas by using Alaskan energy?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to respond to the \nquestion from the senior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Alaska is blessed in its abundance of resources, whether it be oil or \nnatural gas, coal, to the timber, to the fisheries, we are absolutely \nblessed. When it comes to those fossilized fuels, the abundance is \nextraordinary.\n  Oftentimes people think we are making up the numbers because they are \nas substantial as they are. We have the potential in the State of \nAlaska right now, between our onshore assets and our known offshore \nreserves, when it comes to oil, of an additional 65 billion barrels of \noil coming from the State of Alaska.\n  There is 390 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from the onshore \nreserves and, from what we know, from the offshore. Yesterday there \nwere new numbers released from the USGS on the potential for oil and \ngas in the Arctic region. This was a survey of the entire Arctic, not \nonly Alaska's resources. Of those resources, they indicated, in terms \nof oil, it is about 90 billion barrels coming out of the Arctic. Of \nthat 90, a full third would be in the area in the waters off of the \nState of Alaska, so about 30 billion barrels of oil in terms of \nresource there. What we are talking about, in terms of the potential \nfor Alaska to contribute in a meaningful manner with increased \nproduction, is nothing short of dramatic. When we talk about ANWR \nspecifically--and there has been great debate about whether we should \nopen ANWR--keep in mind, we are not allowed to explore.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may let the Senator know, we have about 3 minutes \nremaining and I need 1 of those to make a unanimous consent request.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I could go on all day talking about Alaska's \nresources. What I wish to leave Members with is the knowledge that as a \nmean estimate, we are looking at 10.6 billion barrels of oil out of \nANWR. This is not insignificant. We have been providing about close to \n20 percent of the Nation's oil for the past 30 years from Prudhoe Bay. \nWe would like the opportunity to continue. We know we have the \nresource. We have the opportunity. We have the technology, the smarts, \nthe know-how to make it happen and do it right while protecting the \nenvironment.\n  I thank the Senator for his questions and recognizing that Alaska has \na great deal to offer us as a nation when it comes to energy \nindependence.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, our hope today is to show the Senate \nthat we are ready for full debate on finding more American energy and \nusing less. That is what we should be doing. We have our proposals and \nwould welcome debate and amendment on others.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the pending \nenergy speculation measure in the following manner: that the bill be \nsubject to energy-related amendments only; provided further, that the \namendments be considered in an alternating manner between the two sides \nof the aisle; I further ask consent that the bill remain the pending \nbusiness to the exclusion of all other business, other than privileged \nmatters or items that are agreed to jointly by the two leaders; I \nfurther ask consent that the first seven amendments to be offered on \nthis side of the aisle by the Republican leader or his designee be the \nfollowing: Outer Continental Shelf exploration plus conservation; oil \nshale plus conservation; Alaska energy production plus conservation; \nthe Gas Price Reduction Act, which includes plug-in electric cars and \ntrucks; clean nuclear energy; coal-to-liquid fuel plus conservation; \nand an amendment involving LIHEAP.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, is there time remaining?\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no remaining time.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, yesterday the minority leader suggested \nan analysis of the staff of my Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nran counter to the legislation which has been offered by the majority \nleader, the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act. In particular, the \nminority leader cited a statement in the staff analysis that ``there is \nno credible evidence that simply amending the [Commodity Exchange Act] \nto regulate energy commodities as if they were agricultural commodities \nwill lead to lower energy prices.''\n  The minority leader was in error. The energy speculation act offered \nby the majority leader does not ``regulate energy commodities as if \nthey were agricultural commodities.'' The proposal to do that was \noffered by a law professor at the University of Maryland but is not \ncontained in the majority leader's bill. Rather, the energy speculation \nact, which the majority leader did introduce and which is before us, \ncontains a number of other broader measures aimed at controlling and \nlimiting excessive speculation in the energy markets.\n  First, the energy speculation act would close the London loophole so \nthat traders in the United States would no longer be able to avoid \nlimits on speculation that apply to trading on U.S. exchanges by \nrouting their trades on to foreign exchanges through a U.S.-located \ntrading terminal or computer. The energy speculation act would also \nclose what is often called the ``swaps loophole'' so that traders in \nthe United States would not be able to avoid oversight and Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission authority by trading in over-the-counter \nmarkets because it would require the CFTC to be provided with the \ninformation about large trades, and it authorizes the CFTC, if \nappropriate, to order traders to reduce their holdings in the over-the-\ncounter market in order to prevent excessive speculation or price \nmanipulation.\n  The bill would also give the CFTC more resources to oversee the \nenergy markets in that it would require the CFTC to obtain and publish \nbetter data on speculative trading in the futures markets.\n  Finally, the findings and recommendations of the subcommittee staff \nreports on energy prices give strong support to the core premise of the \nenergy speculation act, that speculation has played a significant role \nin high energy prices.\n  In June 2006, the PSI issued a report, ``The Role of Market \nSpeculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put a Cop on the \nBeat,'' finding that the traditional forces of supply and demand didn't \naccount for sustained price increases and price volatility in the oil \nand gasoline markets. The report concluded that in 2006, a growing \nnumber of trades of contracts for future delivery of oil occurred \nwithout regulatory oversight and found that market speculation had \ncontributed to rising oil and gasoline prices, perhaps accounting for \n$20 out of a then-priced $70 barrel of oil, in other words; speculation \ncontributed from 25 percent to 30 percent of the prices.\n  So the work and reports of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations provides solid support for the legislation offered by \nthe majority leader. The subcommittee's work demonstrates the \nsignificant role played by speculation in high energy prices and the \nneed to adopt measures to control that speculation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7245-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7245-S7246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MOMENT OF SILENCE TO HONOR OFFICER CHESTNUT AND DETECTIVE GIBSON\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will now observe a moment of \nsilence in memory of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut \nwho lost their lives on July 24, 1998.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, July 24 always brings a sense of sadness \nto the Capitol and a sense of gratitude. We feel sadness over the loss \nof Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson who died 10 years \nago today on their posts doing jobs they loved in this great American \nbuilding. We also feel a deep sense of gratitude to Officer Chestnut \nand Detective Gibson for their service and sacrifice and to the men and \nwomen of the U.S. Capitol Police Department who continue to stand guard \nevery day to protect this Capitol and all who work and visit here. \nBecause of their dedication and professionalism, the doors of the \npeople's House have remained open, as they should be, and our Nation \nowes them a debt of gratitude.\n  Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut--``J.J.'' to all his friends--and \nDetective John Michael Gibson were good men, good police officers, \nhusbands and fathers, who both gave 18 years of distinguished service \nto the U.S. Capitol Police department.\n  For J.J. Chestnut, this was a second career, after 20 years in the \nAir Force, including two tours in Vietnam.\n  He greeted everyone--Congress Members and visitors--with the same \nwarm smile. He treated everyone with dignity. After he died, we learned \nthat he used to take clothes to a political activist, whom many called \n``homeless,'' who kept a daily vigil near the door where Officer \nChestnut was posted--just feet from where he died. He loved his work, \nhis friends, his vegetable garden--and most of all, his family.\n  John Gibson was a transplanted New Englander who loved hockey, the \nBoston Bruins, the Red Sox and, most of all, his wife and their three \nteenage children.\n  They died at their posts in the Capitol, at the hands of a deranged \nman with a gun and a history of serious mental illness.\n  They lie today with other American heroes in Arlington National \nCemetery.\n  Their deaths have left an indelible mark on those of us who work in \nthis great symbol of our democracy.\n  Just now, as we observed a moment of silence in this chamber, the \nSpeaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders of both the \nHouse and Senate--Democrats and Republicans--observed a moment of \nsilence at the Memorial Door of the Capitol.\n  The leaders will lay a wreath at the bronze plaque that bears the \nnames and likenesses of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.\n  Then, together, they will walk outside and help plant a tree on the \ngrounds of the U.S. Capitol to honor these two fallen heroes. It is a \nValley Forge American Elm--a strong, sturdy, quintessentially American \ntree. In the years to come, it will grow tall and shelter visitors from \nthe sun, just as J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson sheltered visitors from \nharm.\n  In addition to their plaque and their new tree, there are other, more \npersonal reminders of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson in this \nCapitol.\n  When John Gibson died, a woman who had taught both of his son's in \ngrade school wrote the boys a letter in which she said their father had \ndied a brave man and his legacy would always be a part of them. Jack \nand Danny were teenagers then.\n  Today, Danny Gibson works for the Senate Sergeant at Arms.\n  Officer Jack Gibson is 2-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police \nDepartment.\n  Officer Chestnut's son-in-law, Officer Jason Culpepper, is also a \nU.S. Capitol Police officer.\n  That says a great deal about the dedication of these two families to \npublic service and safety.\n  To these fine men--to Wendy Chestnut and Lyn Gibson, and all of the \nChestnut and Gibson children and family members, and to their friends \nand colleagues--we offer our condolences\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\nand respect on this sad 10-year milestone.\n  Madam President, so Members may join in the planting of the tree on \nthe Capitol grounds, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, all of us recognize there are very \nstrong differences of opinion in Congress about how to resolve the \nmajor energy crisis facing working families throughout our country. I \nhave my views on this issue, and other Members have different points of \nview, and that is the way it is.\n  I am happy to report, however, that there is an increasing unanimity \nof understanding around one very important fact regarding this energy \ncrisis; that is, if we do not dramatically increase funding for the \nhighly successful Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, usually \nknown as LIHEAP, senior citizens on fixed incomes, the disabled, and \nworking families with children are in serious danger of either freezing \nto death this coming winter or perhaps dying of heat stroke this summer \nbecause they are unable to pay their home energy bills. We cannot allow \nthat to happen.\n  I am happy to announce, in a tripartisan effort, that more and more \nSenators understand that reality and are prepared to work together to \nprotect our citizens. S. 3186, the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer \nAct, the LIHEAP legislation that I recently introduced, now has 53 \ncosponsors--53 cosponsors--38 Democrats, 13 Republicans, and 2 \nIndependents. I thank all of those cosponsors for their support. I am \nabsolutely confident that as soon as this bill gets on the Senate \nfloor, not only do we have the 50 votes, I am quite confident we are \ngoing to have 60 votes and perhaps more.\n  I also thank majority leader Harry Reid for filing a cloture motion \nlast night on the motion to proceed to this very important legislation. \nSenator Reid understands, as I think most of us do, that it is \nabsolutely essential for the health and well-being of millions of our \ncitizens that this bill be passed, and passed as soon as possible. My \nhope is that after passage in the Senate, we can get it over to the \nHouse before the August break and see it pass in that body as well. \nThat may be overly optimistic, but that is what I would like to see.\n  Let me say a few words about why this bill needs to be passed.\n  At a time when home energy bills are soaring, this legislation would \nnearly double the funding for LIHEAP in fiscal year 2008, taking it \nfrom a little more than $2.5 billion to $5.1 billion--a total increase \nof $2.53 billion. This is, in fact, what Congress has authorized for \nLIHEAP.\n  Let me say a few words about why we need to significantly increase \nfunding for LIHEAP.\n  In 2007, 5.8 million Americans--primarily senior citizens, working \nfamilies with kids, and people with disabilities--utilized this \nprogram. These are the most vulnerable people in our country. \nUnfortunately, these 5.8 million Americans are only 16 percent--16 \npercent--of the people who are eligible for the program. The vast \nmajority of the people who are eligible cannot get into the program \nbecause we lack the funds to help them. Madam President, 94 percent of \nthe participants in the LIHEAP program were elderly, disabled, or had a \nchild in the family under 18.\n  From fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2008, the cost of the average \nheating oil bill has increased by over 93 percent--almost doubled. The \nestimated increase in an average natural gas bill during that same \nperiod has gone up by about 50 percent. Unfortunately, LIHEAP funding \nhas lagged far behind these outrageously high increases in energy \ncosts. In fact, we are spending 23 percent less on LIHEAP today than we \ndid 2 years ago, and after adjusting for inflation, we spent more on \nLIHEAP 20 years ago than we are spending right now.\n  Let's be very clear. What we are talking about now is a life-and-\ndeath situation. Many people do not understand this, but more people \nhave died in our country from the extreme heat and extreme cold since \n1998 than all natural disasters in this country combined, including \nfloods, fires, hurricanes, and tornadoes.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, over 1,000 Americans \nfrom across the country died from hypothermia in their own homes just \nbetween 1999 and 2002. Those are the latest figures we have available. \nIn other words, they froze to death because they could not afford to \nadequately heat their homes. How many of these deaths were preventable? \nAll of them were, according to the CDC. We will probably not know for \nseveral years how many Americans died last winter because they could \nnot afford to heat their homes, but clearly one death is too many.\n  I understand this country is struggling with an emergency situation \nin terms of flooding in the Midwest and wildfires in California, but \nthere is another emergency which must be dealt with now while we also \ndeal with those emergencies.\n  At a time when the costs of home heating fuels and electricity are \nsoaring and when the economy is in decline, millions of Americans are \nfinding it harder and harder to stay warm in the winter or stay cool in \nthe summer.\n  In my State of Vermont and throughout New England and the Northeast, \npeople are extremely worried that they will not have enough money to \nafford the price of heating oil next winter. A newspaper in my State, \nthe Stowe Reporter, recently editorialized that the lack of affordable \nheating oil could turn into New England's version of Hurricane Katrina \nnext winter. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  I want all of my colleagues to understand that the home energy crisis \nthat is being faced throughout the northern part of our country is \nsomething that is very imminent and is something that people are very \nconcerned about. But this program, LIHEAP, is not just a program for \ncold-weather States; it is also a program for hot-weather States so \nthat the elderly, the sick, and the frail in hot-weather States can \nafford to pay soaring electric bills to provide the air-conditioning \nthey need. In other words, this program is not just a life-and-death \nprogram for the northern tier of our country; it is vitally important \nfor the South and Southwest and for people who are struggling to pay \nfor the skyrocketing price of electricity which has tripled in some \nparts of the country. What we are concerned about there is that if you \nare 90 years of age and you are sick and you cannot afford skyrocketing \nelectric bills and your electricity gets turned off, you are in serious \ntrouble.\n  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, a \nrecordbreaking 15.6 million American families, or nearly 15 percent of \nall households, are at least 30 days overdue in paying their utility \nbills. This is a crisis situation and a situation in which LIHEAP can \nbe of significant help.\n  To demonstrate how important LIHEAP is right now for Southern States \ndealing with a major heat wave, let me give you a few examples of what \nI am referring to. This is hard to believe, but it is true. Over the \npast decade, the last 10 years, more than 400 people have died of heat \nexposure in the State of Arizona, including 31 in July of 2005 alone. \nAll of these deaths could have been prevented if the people affected \nhad air-conditioning. Without increased support from the Federal \nGovernment, Arizona will be out of LIHEAP funding before the end of \nthis month.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received on July 15--last week--from \nPhil Gordon, the mayor of Phoenix, AZ. This is what he writes:\n\n       I am writing to express my support for the Warm in Winter \n     and Cool in Summer Act. Currently Arizona can only provide \n     assistance to 6 percent--\n\n  Six percent--\n\n     of eligible LIHEAP households. . . . To make matters worse, \n     Phoenix continues to experience extreme heat. In the past \n     month alone, we have had 15 days with temperatures at or\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\n     above 110 degrees. This extreme heat is especially hard on \n     the very young, the elderly and disabled who are on fixed \n     incomes and can no longer afford to cool their homes. . . \n     . Arizona Public Service--\n\n  That is the electric company there--\n\n     reported that there was a 36% increase in the number of \n     households having difficulty in paying utility bills and an \n     increase of 11,000 families being disconnected compared to a \n     year ago.\n\n  Imagine not having electricity, and day after day the temperature is \n110 degrees. And imagine if you are 90 years of age. Imagine if you are \nsick.\n\n       Rising energy and housing costs are placing enormous \n     strains on low-income households across Arizona.\n\n  So writes Mayor Phil Gordon of Phoenix, AZ.\n  Madam President, it is not just Arizona. Due to a lack of LIHEAP \nfunding, the State of Texas only provides air-conditioning assistance \nto about 4 percent of those who qualify.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received on July 15 from Shawnee Bayer \nfrom the Community Action Committee in Victoria, TX. She writes:\n\n       The temperatures in our area have been 100 to 110 degrees \n     for 16 consecutive days. I fear it is going to be very tragic \n     at the current pace we are going with so little LIHEAP \n     funding available. . . . There are so many who need our \n     assistance, like the elderly lady in her 80's who recently \n     almost died due to kidney failure; now she doesn't want to \n     use her air conditioner because she is afraid she won't be \n     able to pay the bill. . . .\n\n  That should not be taking place here in the United States of America. \nThis is in Victoria, TX.\n  I received an e-mail from DeAndra Baker from the Community Action \nAgency in Giddings, TX, who writes:\n\n       We have a gentleman who is 78 years old and on a fixed \n     income of $770.00 a month. . . . Due to the extremely high \n     temperatures he is unable to afford to keep his home cool. \n     His doctor provided a statement that he must have his air \n     conditioner turned on at a minimum of 80 degrees to avoid \n     congestive heart failure and he is not even able to afford \n     that much. Sadly, he will not continue to run his A/C or fans \n     and will be at serious risk unless LIHEAP funding is \n     increased soon.\n\n  That is what is going on in the State of Texas.\n  Without additional support from the Federal Government, the State of \nGeorgia will not be able to offer any LIHEAP assistance whatsoever to \nits residents this summer. Currently, Georgia has a waiting list of \n28,000 people hoping to receive some relief from the hot weather this \nsummer.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received from the executive director of \nthe Community Action Agency in Gainesville, GA, Janice Riley. She \nwrites:\n\n       One family that came in after we ran out of LIHEAP funds \n     was the Jones family. . . . Mr. Jones, came to our office \n     requesting assistance with his electric bill. He has a wife \n     and five children. . . . They got behind with all their bills \n     when he was injured on the job six months ago. . . . Their \n     daughter is paralyzed from the neck down from a fall she had \n     at six months of age. I wish we could help them. Another \n     participant that did not receive LIHEAP funds and is now \n     facing disconnection or homelessness is Ms. O'Brien, a 33 \n     year old, single parent with 5 children between the ages of \n     7-16, and a newborn grandchild which she has taken in. . . . \n     Her power was turned off last week because she was unable to \n     pay it. . . . Her need for assistance is based on the high \n     costs of living, not from her lack of work ethic and heroic \n     efforts to maintain her household.\n\n  In addition, unless this legislation is signed into law soon, the \nState of Kentucky will not be able to keep any of its residents cool \nthis summer through the LIHEAP program.\n  According to the executive director of the Community Action Agency in \nKentucky, Kip Bowmar:\n\n       February of 2008 marked the first time in the program's \n     history that all 120 Counties in Kentucky ran out of LIHEAP \n     funds forcing us to close our doors as fuel prices were \n     soaring and people needed help.\n  In Florida, Hilda Frazier, the State director of the LIHEAP program, \nhas estimated they will serve 26,000 fewer households this year because \nof the reduction of available LIHEAP funding and the rising cost of \nenergy.\n  Moving on to California, Joan Graham, the deputy director of the \nCommunity Action Agency in Sacramento, CA, recently wrote that:\n\n       Every day we are turning away at least 50 families who \n     qualify for LIHEAP because we lack resources. Energy bills \n     have increased 30 percent over last year, yet our funding has \n     not increased. In 2006, there were 29 heat-related deaths in \n     Sacramento County. One senior who passed away due to extreme \n     heat was afraid to turn on his air-conditioner because he \n     knew he would be unable to pay the electric bill. We know \n     there are more like him out there at present.\n\n  Why is LIHEAP so important in the South in the summertime? From 1999 \nto 2003, over 3,400 deaths in this country were due to excessive heat. \nAll of these deaths were preventable, and air-conditioning is the best \nway to prevent those deaths, according to CDC.\n  I relate the problems associated with high heat and lack of LIHEAP \nfunding not because that is necessarily an issue in my State. In our \nState of Vermont, in the northern tier of this country, the fear \nobviously is that when winter comes and weather becomes 20 below zero, \nwe are going to have many families who are going to go cold. Some may \nfreeze, some may be forced to vacate their homes and move in with other \nrelatives and friends. That is what our fear is. Again, this is not \njust a fear of northern States, this is a concern that impacts every \nState in this country, whether you are in the North or whether you are \nin the South. It is imperative that we move on this issue and it is \nimperative that we move as quickly as possible.\n  So once again, I am delighted that in the midst of all of the \ndifferences of opinion we are hearing on energy policy in general, \nthere has been a coming together around the issue of LIHEAP. We now \nhave 52 cosponsors, including 13 Republicans. When this bill comes to \nthe floor--and it will come to the floor soon; we are going to pass \nit--I am quite confident we are going to get at least 60 votes, if we \nneed that, and maybe a lot more than that. My hope is that we move it \non to the House to get it passed there as soon as possible and we get \nthis desperately needed funding out into the States. This is an issue \nwe are making some progress on and I look forward to the support of all \nof my colleagues.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to pick up on what the Senator \nfrom Vermont is saying because I feel very strongly that we do need to \nmove forward with additional funding for LIHEAP, the Low-Income Energy \nAssistance Program. In fact, I have offered an amendment to this--or I \nhave filed it. I haven't offered it, because no amendments have been \nallowed by the majority party, but I have filed an amendment to the \nEnergy bill, which is the logical place that we should put the LIHEAP \nlanguage, which would do three things. It would double the amount of \nfunding for low-income energy assistance, increasing it by $2.5 \nbillion, which is the essence of the bill of the Senator from Vermont, \nwhich is exactly what we need to take care of the increased prices for \nenergy according to the Energy Office in New Hampshire.\n  Secondly, it would add $25 million to the weatherization program. I \nthink weatherization makes a lot of sense because it takes homes which \nlose a lot of their energy through lack of adequate windows or adequate \ninsulation and helps those homes, especially low-income individuals. \nFurther, it does something else which is important. LIHEAP is directed \nto low-income people, but middle-income families today, with the cost \nof energy doubling and tripling, have a serious problem. Folks who are \nworking for a living but are still on a fairly tight budget or a fixed \nincome are going to get hit hard this winter when their energy bills \ndouble and triple. So this bill sets up a tax credit dealing with the \nfirst $1,000 for an individual who is purchasing energy at fairly \nmoderate income levels, so it doesn't benefit high-income individuals, \nand allows people, to the extent they buy oil to heat their home, to \ntake that tax credit to assist them in the effort of reducing the cost \nof that oil.\n  All of this is paid for. My bill is entirely paid for. I think that \nis also a critical element because what we are talking about here is \nbuying a consumable product for today--oil to heat your home--and then, \nunfortunately, if you don't pay for it, you are passing the bill for \nthat oil on to our children and our grandchildren by adding to the debt \nof the United States, and that is not fair. Our children and our \ngrandchildren are going to have their own tough time heating their \nhomes; they don't need to have the debt that is included in paying for \nthat program.\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\n  So my bill is entirely paid for by eliminating a tax--what I consider \nto be an inappropriate tax break for basically large, integrated oil \ncompanies known as section 199. This tax break was not directed at \nthose companies originally when it was passed--and it should be--but it \nis being taken advantage of, and it is certainly not needed when oil is \nselling at $120 or $130 a barrel, and the incentives to produce oil are \nsignificant enough by the cost of the marketplace.\n  I feel very strongly--and I think this is an important point to \nmake--that we need to have a comprehensive approach relative to people \nwho are going to be impacted this winter, and it needs to be a paid-for \napproach, and that is why I made this suggestion.\n  I also feel strongly that if the majority leader calls up the bill \nwhich he filed, which is the bill from Senator Sanders, in an attempt \nbasically to take down the Energy bill so that we are not going to \ndebate it any longer, that is not the right approach. Because the real \nway you get to the issue of energy and the cost of energy for low-\nincome people in New Hampshire this winter--or for moderate income \npeople in New Hampshire this winter--is to reduce the overall cost of \nenergy, to bring the price of energy down. How do you do that? You \nproduce more and you consume less.\n  We on our side of the aisle have a series of ideas as to how you \nshould produce more. Use the oil that is in the Outer Continental \nShelf, drill in the Outer Continental Shelf. Use shale oil. We have 2 \ntrillion barrels of shale oil sitting there--more reserves than in all \nof Saudi Arabia and many of the Middle Eastern countries combined. Use \nthose resources. Bring them on the market. Take away the impediments \nwhich we as a Congress--the Democratic Congress specifically--have put \nin the way of using Outer Continental Shelf oil.\n  There is language which has passed this Congress which was put in by \nthe Democratic Congress that says you can't drill in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. There is language which says you can't use oil shale \nfrom Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah--this huge reserve of energy. That \nlanguage should be removed so that those sources of oil can be used.\n  Once you show the world we are willing to bring on line as a nation \nadditional production from our resources, that will reduce the price of \nenergy, because these prices which we are seeing today are speculative \nprices based on what they expect to occur in the future, and they \nexpect demand to go up, but supply to stay stable--to not go up. \nWell, if we prove we are willing to bring more supply on line, and we \nare willing to use other sources such as nuclear power to reduce our \nreliance on oil, that will cause these prices to come down. That is the \nmost significant thing we can do. If we could bring the price of a \nbarrel of oil down to $100, even, that would dramatically take pressure \noff of people buying home heating oil this winter in New Hampshire.\n\n  So this bill we are debating right now, this energy bill, has to be \ncompleted before we move on to Senator Sanders' bill. In the debate of \nthis bill, we should take up the LIHEAP amendment which will be \noffered, I suspect, from our side of the aisle--probably by Senator \nSununu or myself. At the same time, we should take up these other ideas \nof expanding the use of our reserves as a nation on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, in the shale oil reserves, using nuclear power.\n  We should be expanding these reserves. Why? Because that will cause \nthe price of oil to come down. In addition, the secondary benefit of \nthis, of course, is that we won't be buying energy from people who \ndon't like us. We won't be buying as much energy from Venezuela if we \nare producing American oil. We won't be buying energy from Iran if we \nare producing more American oil.\n  So clearly this is what we should do. We should produce more and we \nshould consume less. At the same time, we should be promoting--and \nthere will be an amendment from our side of the aisle on this bill--\npromoting the use of electric cars and development of electric \nbatteries, promoting more conservation ideas, promoting more renewable \nideas. These are initiatives which need to be pursued. More \nimportantly, they need to be discussed and a genuine bill needs to come \nout of this Congress. A bill such as the majority leader has \npresented--or the Democratic side has presented--which deals only with \none small sliver of the problem, which is the potential for \nspeculation, does nothing to increase supply and it does nothing to \nincrease conservation, the two things we need to do in order to get the \nprice of oil down.\n  The simple fact is this bill should be available and open to \namendment. In an attempt by the majority leader to basically sidetrack \nthis bill, to throw it in the ditch, so we can't go forward with \namendments which deal with addressing drilling on the Outer Continental \nShelf, which deal with bringing on more shale oil, which deal with \nnuclear power, which deal with more conservation--I am not going to \nvote for something that tries to accomplish that. I am going to vote to \ntry to make sure we come out of this debate with a comprehensive \npolicy, something that drives this country toward creating more supply \nthat is American-created while at the same time using less.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 8 minutes and there is 22 \nminutes left.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe I have 10 minutes. If the Chair would advise me \nwhen I have completed 10 minutes, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I will do that.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  Mr. GREGG. On another topic, we are going to take up tomorrow \nhopefully the housing bill. This is an extraordinarily important piece \nof legislation. It is a big leap for those of us who are fiscal \nconservatives to say the Government should step into this arena as \naggressively as this bill suggests we do but, unfortunately, it is a \nnecessary step. It accomplishes two things which are absolutely \ncritical in the present context of our economy.\n  Today there are a lot of people losing their homes through \nforeclosure as a result of taking part in what was known as the \nsubprime lending process and having their ARMs reset, their mortgage \nrates reset. This bill sets up a process where people who live in their \nprimary residence who have the wherewithal, the ability, to pay a \nreasonable mortgage can restructure that mortgage so they can afford it \nand so they don't lose their home, and so there isn't a foreclosure. \nThat is very important. It is important not only to those individuals, \nbut it is important to the marketplace to start some activity in the \nmarketplace in the area of mortgage lending and home sales.\n  Secondly, and equally important, this bill addresses the fundamental \nstrength of our financial institutions. We have some financial \ninstitutions in this country which are a bit unstable--unstable. We \nneed to make sure they are stable. Why? Because these institutions, \nsuch as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, are essentially at the center of \nthe strength, whether we like it or not, of our banking industry. We \nneed to set up a process so the marketplace knows these institutions, \nspecifically Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, are going to survive and are \ngoing to be stable and are going to be able to have the capital and the \nwherewithal to continue to lend and to continue to have the market, to \nturn over mortgages so you can have liquidity in the lending markets. \nThis is critical.\n  Some will argue it may be expensive. My argument is if we don't take \nthis step, we know it will be expensive. We know from the FDIC----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Insurance that we will incur--as a result of bank failures \nthat we will be paying a massive price. So although I don't like the \nidea from a concept as a matter of practice, this is something we are \nsimply going to have to do in order to assure the fiscal solvency and \nresilience of our credit markets.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Gregg for his insights \non housing and other matters. With regard to the potential LIHEAP \nlegislation, I respect the fact that he desires it to be paid for and \nfor it not to be one\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nmore addition to the public debt. However, as a Senator who has \nbelieved for the last 12 years I have been here that this Nation needed \nto produce more oil and gas at home, I have been frustrated so often by \nmy colleagues--frequently from the Northeast, I have to say--who have \nopposed oil production offshore, have opposed oil production in Alaska, \nhave opposed coal to liquid, have opposed shale oil production and \nother avenues of production. The junior Senator from Vermont, my \ncolleague on the Energy Committee, declared that we needed more \ngeothermal, we needed more wind and solar, we needed renewable energy \nforms, which I certainly support in every way possible.\n  Yet it is odd to me that those very same persons now walk blithely \ninto the Senate and want the taxpayers of America to subsidize the \nNortheast so they can buy more dirty fuel oil to heat their homes \nwith--the people who objected to the production of oil and gas year \nafter year. I have to say that. I know people in the Northeast are \nhurting. People all over the country are hurting. The little county \nwhere I grew up in Alabama, according to the New York Times and a \nnational survey, found that they spend a larger percentage of their \nincome on gasoline than any other county in America because incomes are \nlow in the rural areas and they have to drive a long distance to work. \nThose were the primary factors cited. That makes sense to me. Are we \ngoing to subsidize people in Wilcox County? Who gets subsidized?\n  What we need, without any doubt, colleagues, is an energy policy that \nwill bring down these prices. We need an energy policy that makes \nsense--not subsidizing the dirtiest oil of all, burning heating oil in \nindividual homes. We ought to be thinking about things that could \nactually work, such as cleaner natural gas, making those pipelines \navailable throughout the country, instead of blocking every attempt to \nexpand a pipeline. Or maybe we could expand nuclear power in the \nNortheast and other places in the country so more of our homes could be \nconverted to clean electricity, produced by nuclear power, which \nproduces not one drop of global warming gases or atmospheric pollution.\n  I have to say I am disappointed that the majority leader has decided \nhe did not have time--I believe those were his words--to deal with \nenergy. Therefore, he filled the tree, using a parliamentary procedure \nthat means we would go home a week earlier than we expected to go home \nand not stay in session next week and talk about energy and the things \nthe American people care about. They care about energy and the economy. \nThe economy is adversely affected by high energy costs. That is what we \nneed to be doing right now.\n  I think this idea, that the majority leader can fill the tree and \ncontrol the amendments so we are not able to enter into a debate about \nhow to confront the energy crisis this Nation is experiencing, is a \nvery extraordinary departure from our classical history.\n  In 2005 and 2006, we had an energy debate and passed an important \nenergy bill. The Republicans had the majority at that time. I believe \nthere were 15 days of debate, 20 or 30 amendments were offered, and \nmany more were accepted without a full vote.\n  Then, last year, the Democratic majority allowed an energy debate \nthat improved our CAFE standards, and it passed overwhelmingly. I voted \nfor that. I think it was 10 full days of debate and many votes were \ncast on amendments. At this time, quite a number of amendments were \naccepted.\n  Why would we not do that now when we are facing an even more severe \ncrisis? That is my question. So I note to my colleagues that energy \nprices are having a very real impact on the lives of our constituents.\n  According to AAA, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline was \n$4.03 this morning. As a result, the typical American family, with two \ncars, is paying approximately--we have calculated this out, according \nto average miles driven--paying $1,260 more this year for the same \nnumber of gallons of gasoline they were purchasing last year. That \namounts to a $105-per-month increase in expenditures for each family. \nRemember, people have paid taxes, they have had Social Security \nwithheld, they have paid their insurance, their house payment, and all \ntheir basic expenses. You only have a certain amount of money. The \nAmerican people are unhappy because they are paying an extra $105 per \nmonth for the same amount of gasoline they were purchasing before. When \nthey realize that a big reason for that is because of a systematic \naction by Congress to block production of clean American energy, I \nthink they are going to be unhappy with us. In fact, they are already \nunhappy with us. The popularity of Congress is at an alltime low. I \nthink, on this energy question, we deserve the criticism. I have to say \nI have promoted more production for years. I have warned against this \nproblem.\n  As a result of our policies, we are now importing over 60 percent of \nour fuel. That amounts to $500 billion to $700 billion in American \nwealth which has been transferred out of this country to foreign \nnations. They are using it like Venezuela is right now, with Chavez in \nRussia closing a $2 billion arms deal. He is basically doing that with \nour money, with the high price of oil. He is off shopping to buy \nweapons and--hopefully, he will not--possibly use them to destabilize \nSouth America, since he sees himself as following in the steps of Fidel \nCastro, his hero. That is not a good thing.\n  I have offered legislation that would open an area in the Gulf of \nMexico on Alabama's side of the Alabama-Florida line, called the \nstovepipe, that has large amounts of oil and gas in it. It is in \nshallower water, so the wells can be drilled in a fashion that they can \nsit on the bottom. With the deep drilling we are doing today, you have \nto have a ship. The waters are so deep, they cannot anchor the ship. It \nhas to sit in place by GPS and have propellers all around it to hold it \nsteady, so it doesn't move, and the drilling can go on. This would be \nmuch cheaper and much quicker to bring onboard.\n  I have offered legislation that would require the Department of \nEnergy to examine the subsidies and incentives we have created and to \nsee which ones are working. This legislation would also have the \nDepartment of Energy work on a recommendation of how to utilize our \nsubsidies, incentives, and prohibitions in a way that effectively \nmaximizes our energy capacity in this country, making us less dependent \nupon foreign oil.\n  I believe strongly we need more efficiency. We need to use less \nenergy. We need to have a breakthrough. I believe we will. In my home \nState, I believe we are going to see, within the next few months, a \nbreakthrough on the conversion of cellulose to biodiesel or ethanol, \nand that could be a big help to us. It will certainly be more \nproductive than that ethanol we are getting from corn today.\n  I see my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I wish to \nsay more, but I will conclude by saying that I believe we need to act. \nOur soldiers in Iraq work 7 days a week, 12- to 15-hour days. Their \nlives are at risk. The majority leader said we don't have time, that we \nneed to recess a week earlier than we projected, and we cannot possibly \nspend more time during August--we need to be home on recess--dealing \nwith the No. 1 issue facing the American people in this country.\n  I believe that is the wrong policy. I think we need to say so. I \nbelieve there are large numbers of Democratic Members of this Congress \nwho will support more production that is safe and carefully done, that \nwill help us deal with the crisis we are facing, but we cannot make \nprogress, unless we are able to vote and debate. That is being denied \nat this time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks of my \ncolleague from Alabama a moment ago. I will speak to the reliance of \nthe United States on other countries around the world for too much of \nour petroleum and natural gas supplies and what that does to the United \nStates to make us dependent, to cost us more money, to reduce our \nflexibility and actions around the world, and also the point that every \ntime they want to rattle their sabers to create instability in the \nworld, what that does to the markets is to reflect that instability in \nhigher prices. So these very countries that we would like not to make \nso much money off their oil supplies, if they want to make more, all \nthey have\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\nto do is create a little trouble in the world, and it raises the price \nbecause the markets go higher for a while. I will talk about that in a \nmoment.\n  I have reflected on a comment a friend of mine made some time ago. I \ndon't mean disrespect to my friends on the other side. But he said: You \nknow, Democrats have three approaches to every problem: Taxation, \nlitigation, and regulation.\n  Sometimes we like to laugh about that because it is, unfortunately, \ntoo true. But I thought how does this apply to energy. Sure enough, it \ndoes. They, of course, tried taxation and failed, trying to raise taxes \non oil companies, under the notion it would never be reflected in \nconsumer prices we pay. But that is exactly what would happen. They \ntried litigation against OPEC. There is no way you can sue the OPEC \ncountries. We ought to produce more of what we have, not tell them they \nhave to produce more. They are pretty strained, in terms of where they \nare in production right now, in any event, and we are not, as the King \nof Saudi Arabia reminded President Bush not too long ago.\n  Then, the third thing has to do with regulation. It is the bill that \nis pending before us right now. This is the Democratic approach: Let's \nregulate the people who buy and sell the contracts for oil and natural \ngas and the like. Of course, we already have regulators--it is called \nthe CFTC--and today we have some news that demonstrates that this body \nis doing its job and can do its job. To the extent that there is \nillegal manipulation in the market, the CFTC can stop it. They \nannounced that, after a year of investigation, they had stopped a \ncompany that was allegedly illegally manipulating the market, and they \nare going to take legal action against them. The Department of Justice \nmay be looking at it from a criminal aspect, as well.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans have agreed that one of the things we \nneed to do is ensure that the CFTC has all the money it needs and the \npersonnel it needs to continue to do the job we have given it to do, to \nmake sure people are not abusing the process. That is the good part of \nregulation. The bad part would be to begin defining--as the Democratic \nlegislation does--who good traders are and who bad traders are and not \nlet the bad traders trade--something that was debunked yesterday in an \ninteragency study concluded by the CFTC, which concluded that \nspeculation wasn't the problem; that the reason for the price increases \nat the pump is the law of supply and demand--not enough supply for the \ndemand that exists out there.\n  Today, another diversion was created. I wish to reiterate this. It \ninvolves a friend of mine, my colleague, John McCain. He was grossly \nmisquoted this morning by Senator Reid and others, who have tried to \nsuggest he is not for offshore drilling. I think everybody knows John \nMcCain supports more offshore drilling. As a matter of fact, on this \nchart, I will quote one of many things I could refer to from his Web \nsite. I have a great deal of information in which he makes it clear he \nis for more offshore production.\n  Among other things, in June, he said this:\n\n       Opponents of domestic production cling to their position, \n     even as the price of foreign oil has doubled, and doubled \n     again . . . every year, we are sending hundreds of billions \n     of dollars out of the country for oil imports, much of it \n     from OPEC, while trillions of dollars of oil reserves in \n     America go unused.\n\n  He has also said the current Federal moratorium on drilling on the \nOuter Continental Shelf stands in the way of energy exploration and \nproduction. John McCain believes it is time for the Federal Government \nto lift these restrictions and put our own reserves to use, and on and \non.\n  He obviously supports offshore production. So why did some of my \ncolleagues take a quotation of his, leave part of it out, and try to \ncreate the impression that he did not support it and he did not think \nit would do any good? He was responding to a question earlier about \nwhether more of this offshore production would produce immediate \nresults. All he did was to tell the truth. Here is what he said:\n\n       I don't see an immediate relief, but I do see that \n     exploitation of existing reserves, that may exist, and that--\n     in view of many experts--that do exist off our coasts, is \n     also a way that we need to provide relief, even though it may \n     take some years. The fact that we are exploiting those \n     reserves would have a psychological impact that I think is \n     beneficial.\n\n  I totally agree with him. My colleagues read this to suggest that he \nbelieves offshore production would have no benefit except a \npsychological benefit. As we can see, that is not what he said. But his \npoint is also valid--``is also a way we need to provide relief,'' it \nwill provide a psychological boost to the markets just as, in fact, \nPresident Bush's lifting of the moratorium a week or so ago on some \noffshore drilling caused prices to drop. Many analysts believe the drop \nof about $25 per barrel was much because of the President's \nannouncement and the fact that Congress was taking up this subject with \nthe idea that perhaps we would actually get something done.\n  What the speculators are doing is simply placing a bet into the \nfuture that there is either going to be enough oil to meet demand or \nthere is not. If there is not, then they are betting the price will go \nup.\n  What Senator McCain is saying is the mere fact we would pass \nlegislation saying we are going to produce more oil offshore would \nimmediately have the impact on the markets to bring the prices down \nbecause they would know in the future we would have enough supply to \nmeet our demands. John McCain was exactly correct on this, and I think \nit serves no purpose to misquote him and suggest otherwise.\n  I also note that in the House of Representatives today, legislation \nwas defeated, as it was last week, by the Democratic majority there \nthat is very similar to, if not identical to, legislation that was \nintroduced by Democrats in the Senate.\n  For example, last week the House of Representatives defeated a \nprovision that says where leases have been let to oil producers, if \nthey do not drill on those leases after a period of time, then the \nleases come back to the Federal Government.\n  As you probably know, that is already the law. The bottom line is you \nget primarily 10-year leases. Some are shorter. You cannot obviously \nimmediately go out and drill on every one of several hundred thousand \nacres, but what you do is try to figure out where it is most likely you \nare going to get oil and you start drilling there first and keep going \nuntil you drill in all the areas where you think there is potential. It \nis obviously not going to be on every acre. Whatever you haven't done \nin 10 years goes back to the Government. That bill failed because it is \nalready law.\n  Today another bill failed that is to drain the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. This is our national security reserve of oil, in case of an \nemergency, for our military primarily. We need reserve so the tanks can \ndrive, planes can fly, and the ships can sail. You don't want to reduce \nthat to affect very briefly the price of gas in the country. They would \nreduce it by 10 percent. What would that do in terms of the oil supply \nin the country? It would reduce the oil supply by 3\\1/2\\ days--3\\1/2\\ \ndays. If it drove the prices down at all, which I doubt would happen, \nit would be very temporary because everybody would know it is not a \npermanent solution. So it is no wonder that failed in the House. Again, \nto the extent that is part of the Democratic bill, it is obviously not \na solution to the problem.\n  I mentioned I would talk briefly about what Senator Sessions was \ntalking about, and that is the unintended consequences of not producing \nour own energy, even though we have it in our country, and relying on \nother countries to do it instead.\n  More than 60 percent of every dollar spent at the pump--I filled up \nmy tank last week, and it cost me over $70, and my tank wasn't even \nempty when I filled it. More than 60 cents out of every dollar I paid \nwent to a foreign country. We could keep that money in the United \nStates if we produced our own energy.\n  I conclude by saying we can do ourselves a whole lot of good to take \nadvantage of the resources that exist right here in the United States \nof America, reduce the cost of gasoline at the pump, and ensure our \nfuture energy security.\n  I hope during the course of the next several days we will have an \nopportunity to do that as we debate this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I came to the floor yesterday to talk \nabout how our Nation must move forward on a new energy future and \nexplain how even if we drilled off all our coastlines it would still \nmeet only 1 percent of our future oil needs. Instead we should be \nmoving toward a renewable energy future and new energy technologies \nthat could actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil by over half.\n  But today I come to the floor to talk about the proper policing of \noil markets because we are in a crisis that is literally bankrupting \nfamilies and businesses and even threatening entire industries.\n  Now, I don't often agree with President George Bush, but I have to \nsay in his latest economic analysis, I actually agree with him, because \nI think it explains part of the reason why we are in a crisis today.\n  That is right, the President said that ``Wall Street got drunk.'' \nThat is right, the President acknowledged that something was wrong with \nWall Street and that ``Wall Street got drunk.''\n  Now, I don't know if the President meant to say that publically, but \nit got captured on the Internet. I don't know if he plans to keep \nsaying that or all the intentions he has about trying to sober up Wall \nStreet. But I know elaborating on the President's point, White House \npress secretary Dana Perino explained:\n\n       Well, you know, I actually haven't spoken to him about \n     this, but I imagine what he meant, as I have heard him \n     describe it before in both public and private, was that Wall \n     Street let themselves get carried away and that they did not \n     understand the risks that the newfangled financial \n     instruments would pose to markets.\n\n  That is what she said.\n  I don't know why the Bush administration and the regulatory team that \nthey put in place wasn't doing something about this situation. We do \nknow the administration supported deregulation of the financial \nmarkets.\n\n  And to me, the issue is that while Wall Street was getting drunk, \nit's really America and the American middle class that is feeling the \nhangover.\n  Today the Federal Reserve is struggling to contain what is almost one \nof the most severe credit crises since the Great Depression, and \nAmerican families and businesses are paying dearly for the poor \ndecisions and inactions of this administration.\n  During the past decade, the financial economy seems to have repeated \nsome of the excesses our country has gone through before. So I wonder \nwhen we are going to learn the lessons of history and make sure that we \nin Congress do our job and that regulatory agencies do theirs.\n  In many ways, today's situation is a repeat of the 1920s when too \nmuch borrowing to underwrite too many speculative bets using too much \nof other people's money set up an the entire economy up for a crash.\n  Well, in 1999, Congress repealed key parts of the Glass-Steagall Act \nof 1933. It allowed banks to operate any kind of financial businesses \nthey desired. And it set up a situation where they had multiple \nconflicts of interest. And several economists and analysts have cited \nthe repeal of this Act as contributing to the 2007 subprime mortgage \ncrisis. In fact, Robert Kuttner, cofounder and co-editor of the \nAmerican Prospect magazine wrote in September 2007:\n\n       Hedge funds, private equity companies, and the subprime \n     mortgage industries have two big things in common. First, \n     each represents financial middlemen unproductively extracting \n     wealth from the real economy. Second, each exploits loopholes \n     in what remains a financial regulation.\n\n  Then, in 2000 we also deregulated a new and volatile financial \nderivative that is at the heart of today's housing credit crisis--\ncredit default swaps. As White House press secretary Dana Perino would \ndescribe it, these newfangled financial instruments that posed a risk \nto the market actually grew into a $62 trillion industry.\n  And Warren Buffett has called these credit-swaps financial weapons of \nmass destruction. So the proliferation of these newfangled financial \ninstruments has resulted in huge profits and losses without any \nphysical goods changing hands.\n  So now, I come to the floor asking my colleagues when are we going to \nlearn the lessons of the past? When are we going to realize that the \nthe 1929 stock market crash has the same root cause as the recent \nhousing bubble? Both were financed by dangerously, highly leveraged \nborrowing, and after the crash many banks failed causing a ripple \neffect that devastated our Nation's economy. Well, after the 1929 \ncrash, Congress stepped up and changed the banking laws to eliminate \nsome of the abuses that had led to the crash.\n  That is right, only after the crisis did Congress act. What I want to \nknow is whether we are going to learn that vital lesson and legislate \nconsumer protections in advance, or only after a bubble bursts.\n  The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s when 747 savings \nand loan associations went under provides a similar lesson. Like \nbefore, much of the mess can be traced back to deregulation of the \nsavings and loans which gave them many of the capabilities of banks, \nbut failed to bring them under the same regulations as banks. Congress \neliminated regulations designed to prevent lending excesses and \nminimize failures.\n  Deregulation allowed lending in a distant loan markets on the promise \nof higher returns, and it also allowed associations to participate in \nspeculative construction activities with builders and developers who \nhad little or no financial stake in the projects.\n  The ultimate cost of this crisis is estimated to have totaled around \n$160 billion, with U.S. taxpayers bailing out the institutions to the \ntune of $125 billion. This, of course, added to our deficit of the \nearly 1990s.\n  So I ask my colleagues: When are we going to learn this lesson?\n  As George Soros wrote in his book documenting the credit crisis:\n\n       At the end of World War II, the financial industry--banks, \n     brokers, other financial institutions--played a very \n     different role in the economy than they do today. Banks and \n     markets were strictly regulated . . .\n\n  Unfortunately, today's banking and credit crisis teaches us we have \nfailed again to learn the hard lessons. We have failed to see that \noversight and transparency are always critical, and when Congress makes \nreforms, they cannot disregard these important fundamentals.\n  The only encouraging news I have seen lately is that Treasury \nSecretary Paulson is now working to increase regulation over investment \nbanks, hedge funds, and other financial institutions.\n  I could go on and on for my colleagues on my own personal experience \nwith the western energy crisis that happened in electricity in 2000 and \n2001. We saw that during the electricity deregulation experience which \nstarted in the mid 1990s, people argued that electricity was just \nanother commodity. But it is really a very vital element to our \neconomy. Many experts cautioned that electricity was too vital a part \nof our economy and way of life to let these markets go without the \ntransparency and oversight that is essential.\n  We all know the rest of the story. We saw that deregulation set the \ntable for some of Enron's spectacular manipulation schemes of 2000 and \n2001 among other bad actors, which all told caused more than $35 \nbillion in economic loss and over 589,000 jobs were lost because of \nthis crisis.\n  Again, only after the crisis was over, Congress stepped in and gave \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and now the FTC more \nregulatory authority on energy markets. But again, Congress is doing \nits job after the fact.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues: When are we going to learn? When are we going \nto quit deregulating these critical markets without much thought to the \ntransparency and oversight that is critical for markets to operate and \nfunction correctly? When are we going to learn that when we give Wall \nStreet an inch, as the President says, Wall Street gets drunk?\n  We are here today. We are here today to talk about the oil futures \nmarket and hopefully enact some meaningful legislation. But the real \nreason we are here is that we deregulated the energy futures market in \n2000, which helped spark today's price bubble that is driving our \nmarkets to no longer be based on supply-and-demand fundamentals. In one \nfell swoop, this deregulation did a number of things that enabled \ntoday's perfect storm to brew.\n  We let newfangled financial instruments--called credit default \nswaps--go\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\nunregulated and made it too easy to use bad debt to finance home \nmortgages. We also let newfangled crude oil trading--called energy \nswaps--go unregulated and essentially allow Wall Street to trade \nwithout any transparency. And we allowed electronic trading of energy \ncommodities to emerge as a new form of trading. In a nutshell, we let \nWall Street rewrite the rule book for all the traditional exchanges, \nlike as NYMEX and the Chicago Merc, which were previously subject to \nconsiderable CFTC oversight.\n  The consequences of allowing these energy speculators to move into \nthis market, as my colleagues on the floor have said, in spades, shows \nit is similar to a casino game, instead of playing in the legitimate \ntrading market. And the consequences are the American people paying \nhand over fist for our lack of regulatory oversight.\n  Why are we talking about the futures market? Because it should be a \nkey price discovery method to establish the true price based on supply \nand demand. As the Government Accountability Office has said:\n\n       The prices for energy commodities in the futures and in the \n     spot or physical markets are closely linked because they are \n     influenced by the same market fundamentals in the long run.\n\n  That is right, the prices for the energy commodities in the futures \nand in the spot or physical markets are closely linked because they are \ninfluenced by the same market fundamentals in the long run. So why is \nthat so important? Well, it is important because the facts are clear: \nSpeculation, and excessive speculation, have driven up oil prices over \n100 percent in a year, and energy market experts are telling us the \nprice should be more like $60 a barrel.\n  So people are questioning why the futures market is so high, driving \nthe price people pay at the pump today. Well, as Ed Wallace, with the \nDallas Star Telegram, said:\n\n       Record high prices without record low oil inventories, \n     analysts saying that so much money flows into the oil \n     commodities that it gives the impression of shortages, when \n     in fact no shortage exists.\n\n  So that is to say that when you have record-high prices without the \nrecord-low inventories, and I note we haven't had a supply disruption, \nso much money flows into the oil commodities it gives the impression of \na shortage when, in fact, a shortage doesn't actually exist.\n  Now, I learned this phenomenon the hard way because that's how Enron \nmanipulated the electricity markets coming up with various names for \nthese various schemes--Darth Vader, Get Shorty--where Enron created the \nperception in the futures market that there was somehow not enough \nsupply and then went in the physical market and signed people up for \ncontracts at exorbitant rates. Thank God, through the hard work of \npeople in my office, a little utility in Washington state actually \nrecovered a tape of a trader talking to one of the individuals from \nEnron doing a contract and actually saying on the phone: No, this isn't \ntrue about the future price, but go ahead and tell your buyer it is so \nthey will sign this contract.\n  So now we are seeing the same thing happening again. To quote again \nfrom the Dallas Star Telegram, in an article called ``ICE ICE BABY'':\n\n       Investors know that if they invest huge amounts in the \n     commodities futures, they can create a shortage on paper, \n     driving prices up just like an actual shortage.\n\n  That is right, investors know they can invest huge amounts in \ncommodities futures and they can create a shortage on paper and drive \nup the price just like an actual shortage. So, yes, we are concerned.\n  In fact, that article goes on further, speaking about the \nIntercontinental Exchange, better known as ICE--that this ICE platform \nhas been a big problem because we have allowed it to operate in the \ndark without the same regulator oversight as other exchanges. Ed \nWallace is also quoted in that article as saying:\n\n       What kept traders from cornering the market in the past \n     where the government's anti-manipulation rules.\n\n  He is talking about what kept bad actors in check in the past, but \nonce we deregulated in 2000, they didn't have the same tools in place \nto keep the manipulation from happening. So we are here today, on the \nfloor now, talking about whether we are going to move ahead on a \nspeculation bill to deal with this problem.\n  Compounding this problem is that we have a CFTC and an administration \nthat is watching out more for Wall Street than for Main Street. It is \nup to us to make sure we are going to pass legislation that puts \ntransparency and tough rules in place to make sure the markets work for \nconsumers and that both the future price and physical price of oil \ntoday are truly based on supply and demand.\n  Americans may be surprised to learn that our oil futures markets were \nfurther deregulated--besides this 2000 Act. I am talking about a CFTC \ndecision made by staff behind closed doors who decided to take no \naction against a London-based trading exchange that actually trades \nU.S. oil products. As my colleague from Maryland likes to call it, the \nLondon loophole. It is like driving on a U.S. highway but only applying \nthe same speed limits as the German Autobahn.\n  It is abundantly clear to me that the CFTC is doing everything it can \nto continue to operate this way without thinking about its job, which \nis to protect the American consumers from oil price manipulation. So \nthat's why I am making no secret of the fact that I am holding up the \nrenomination of CFTC commissioners. And I am holding up new \nappointments to the CFTC until Congress gets to the bottom of this and \nwe can get Commissioners who are going to enforce the law on the books.\n  Hardworking Americans are counting on us and are suffering in this \ncrisis. Congress is their last resort as an oversight agency to make \nsure there are functioning markets and not the manipulation of supply \nbased on the fact that we have created dark markets without proper \noversight. But don't just listen to me on this subject about the CFTC. \nListen to what other people have said about our CFTC, our Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. Others have been critical as well. In fact, \nWilliam Engdahl, who is an expert and an author on oil markets, wrote \nin May of this year:\n\n       The CFTC seems to have deliberately walked away from their \n     mandated oversight responsibilities in the world's most \n     important traded commodity--oil.\n\n  So there is one expert who doesn't think the CFTC is doing its job. \nAnother expert, Steven Briese, who is a futures market analyst and \nauthor of the ``Commitments of Traders Bible,'' which is a futures \nmarket trade publication, wrote in May of this year as well:\n\n       Congress has provided the CFTC the power to control this \n     unlimited speculation--the law is very specific about \n     establishing position limits. The problem is they have \n     abdicated this role.\n\n  He is talking about the ``behind the closed door'' situation where \nthe CFTC said: We are not going to enforce the laws we have on the \nbooks.\n  We have heard from other people, Mark Cooper, of the Consumer \nFederation of America, recently testifying before Congress, because the \nConsumer Federation of America focuses on protecting consumers. He had \nsomething to say about the CFTC's poor performance. In fact, he said \nthe CFTC's poor performance is ``the regulatory equivalent to FEMA's \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina.''\n  What he is basically saying is they dropped the ball, at least at the \nbeginning of this crisis, and have not responded.\n  So there are other people who have said things, like the trucking \nindustry. They have a big stake in making sure the markets function \nproperly. They say: ``There's oversight that's lacking or not taking \nplace--so the private market is taking advantage of that.''\n  So, Madam President, I am not the only person. I know The Washington \nPost has also talked about this. They said, in an article: ``The CFTC \nhas exempted these firms from rules that limit speculative buying, a \nprerogative traditionally reserved for airlines and trucking companies \nthat needed to lock in future fuel costs.''\n  So it is clear the CFTC has abdicated its authority and \nresponsibility. It has abdicated its authority and responsibility, and \nwe have been trying to clean this up and to push forward on important \nefforts in this regard.\n  Madam President, I would like at this time to reference for the \nrecord a document prepared by Professor Michael Greenberger that \nresponds to information from the Senate Permanent\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\nSubcommittee on Investigations. I know the SPI staff analysis of \nProfessor Greenberger's recent testimony before Congress on this topic \nhas been discussed on the floor, and I would like to make my colleagues \naware of his rebuttal to that PSI staff report.\n  Now, I am sure many of my colleagues probably didn't realize I was \ngoing to come and talk so much about the history of Congress \nderegulating markets, the crises that have ensued--billions of dollars \npaid by taxpayers--and Congress finally coming in and doing its job and \nmaking sure oversight agencies are performing their proper role and \nresponsibility. But I thought it was important context so that we do \nnot repeat the same mistakes.\n  Some of my colleagues today talked about the CFTC's recent \ninvestigation that uncovered oil market manipulation, which underscores \nthe point. The CFTC could only take action against traders that are \nusing exchanges regulated under their purview. What we need to ask is: \nwhat are we going to do about the dark markets, the markets that \noperate within the United States with U.S.-traded products that have \nbeen given an exemption and loophole in oil futures that we are not \nregulating and are probably also causing the problem? We want to know \nwhat they are doing about that.\n  So what is the American consumer saying about this? I know my \ncolleagues have been saying a lot about Americans and what their \npreferences are. But it is clear to me that the American public wants \nus to act. In fact, 80 percent of the American public believes that oil \ncommodities speculation and manipulation of the oil markets are taking \nplace. That is right. They want Congress to act. Eighty percent of \nAmericans polled said they believe oil commodities speculators are \nmanipulating the price of oil. So Americans are very concerned.\n  Two-thirds of Americans believe we should pass legislation that \ncreates new regulations governing all oil speculators. They want us to \nput back in place the rules we had before we threw them out in 2000. So \ntwo-thirds of Americans polled believe we should pass legislation that \ncreates the necessary regulations, and that is what we need to be doing \ntoday.\n  I wish to make sure I am clear to my colleagues. We have done a great \nservice by having an open debate on these issues. And just this week, \nexperts said the Senate action is one of the reasons prices have fallen \n$20 below where they were, because we have had this discussion what a \nmore regulated marketplace should look like. But I want to make sure my \ncolleagues are clear that we need to pass legislation that really will \ncrack down on excessive speculation. We cannot have a study bill, we \ncannot punt this to the future. We have to pass a bill that really \naddresses all areas of potential for excessive speculation. We need a \nbill that has aggregate speculation limits across all exchanges. It has \nto be transparent, and it has to be enforced on all markets.\n\n  We cannot have a bill on the Senate floor that has all the right \nwords in it but none of the important words in the proper places. That \nis what I am going to continue to fight for. I am going to continue to \nfight to make sure we put real teeth back into the law, to make sure \nthe American consumer is protected from the manipulation of oil markets \nin the future.\n  We can give the CFTC the tools it needs, and we must insist that it \nuse them, but we will have to do our job here and pass this important \nlegislation. Wall Street may be drunk, but it is America that is \nsuffering the hangover, and we must help them recover. We need a new, \ntough law on the books, and it is imperative that we learn from the \npast mistakes of Congress in their attempt to lighten the load on some \nof these financial institutions with tools, only to find it wreaking \nhavoc with housing oil speculation bubbles that is causing our country \ngreat distress. I hope we get this right in the next couple of days, \nand I am going to continue to fight until we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Fiscal Policy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in a little over 3 months, Americans \nwill make a very important choice on the future direction of the \ncountry. We will go to the polls, we will select a new President. \nAmericans will also vote on roughly one-third of the Senate and all the \nMembers of the House of Representatives.\n  According to public opinion polls, economic issues will be among the \nmost important matters voters will consider when they go to the voting \nbooth in November.\n  Everybody knows that the Federal Government affects economic issues, \nand we do it through Federal fiscal policy. How we deal with Federal \nfiscal policy can be viewed as two sides of a ledger: On one side is \ntax policy, and on the other side is spending policy. The choices about \nhow we as a nation want to balance each side of the ledger will have \nvery important consequences and implications on our economic future.\n  Most economists agree that high taxes dampen economic growth. Too \nmuch spending, just like too much taxation, can also dampen economic \ngrowth. As elected representatives of the American people, we have an \nobligation, as the Constitution directs us, to spend those tax dollars \nfor the common defense and also for the general welfare of the Nation. \nWe all have a stake in a growing economy, and we will all suffer from a \nshrinking economy.\n  As ranking Republican on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, I \nbelieve it is my obligation to explain the choices and the consequences \nof those fiscal policy choices; therefore, I wish to focus on tax \npolicy as it relates to the choices Americans will face this fall.\n  In all of the discussion about vague notions of change and vague \nnotions of hope, there are some substantive issues Americans will be \nfacing in the fall. The big question will be how much is the Federal \nGovernment going to take out of the American taxpayers' pocketbooks. We \nwill need to evaluate before the election what we are being told on the \ncampaign trail--not just what we are told, compare it with what is \nlikely to occur starting at high noon, January 20, 2009.\n  I think from history we have some pretty good indicators that tell us \nwhat will happen based upon the choices of the American people in the \nnext election. To do that, we must look at our current tax burden. Then \nwe need to take a look at what Senators McCain and Obama are telling us \nabout how they will change the tax burden. Finally, we have to consider \nthe ability of each candidate to deliver on promises. Each taxpayer is \ngoing to have to make choices, choices about what these candidates will \ndo on tax issues once they get into that position of power. Every \nAmerican taxpayer and every American family budget will be impacted by \nthe new President and the agenda of the Congress. Elections have \nconsequences.\n  Today, I wish to consider future tax policy and do it in the context \nof the Congressional Record over the last 3 decades.\n  First, I want to compare the actions of Congress on tax hikes and tax \ncuts in relation to each party's hold on the White House and do it from \nthe congressional as well as the White House basis. As a baseline, I \nwill show a scorecard of tax hikes and tax cuts for each 4-year \nPresidential term since 1981.\n  I have a chart here. The chart shows three things. They start, as I \nsaid, with the year 1981. As you will note, the years are divided into \nPresidential terms, so we start with President Reagan's first term and \nwork our way through to the present, which is the last year of \nPresident George W. Bush's second term. You see the bottom lines across \nthere, the ones that have red and blue, and the years there for the \nPresidential terms.\n  Right above the line for the Presidential terms, we have a thick \nline. It is a three-part line. The line shows relative power of \nDemocrats and Republicans. The top third of the line, if red, shows \nRepublicans holding the White House. The middle third of the line shows \nwho held the Senate majority for a certain period. If red, then \nRepublicans held the Senate; if blue, the Democrats held the Senate. \nThen the bottom line, that is in regard to the House majority. Like the \nother two lines, if red, it means the Republicans held the majority; if \nblue, it means Democrats were in charge of the other body.\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\n  If you move up the chart, there is a running total of how much on a \nyearly average that particular Congress and President agreed to raise \nor reduce taxes. The lines going up or down are in regard to the tax \nraises or tax decreases. This data is not mine; it was drawn from the \nTreasury Office of Tax Analysis report that was released--the most \nrecent one in 2006. The amounts are derived from the nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation revenue estimates of each of the enacted bills \nCongress passed during that 26-year period of time.\n  Let's take a further look at the chart so you get some specifics.\n  President Reagan made tax relief a cornerstone of his successful 1980 \ncampaign. His election helped Republicans attain a narrow majority for \nthe first time in over a generation. The House, of course, remained in \nDemocratic hands.\n  In 1981, President Reagan proposed and Congress agreed to a large tax \ncut. So you have it. The first green line goes there. On average, if \nfully implemented, it meant that you would have a tax cut of almost \n$111 billion per year. Over time, the Democratic House pushed for and \nPresident Reagan reluctantly agreed to some smaller tax increases, and \nthey are the second line where the tax increases come down toward the \nzero line there.\n  For the 1984 campaign, President Reagan made revenue-neutral tax \nreform a central part of his campaign for reelection. Republicans held \na majority in the Senate for that election, and President Reagan had \nbuilt a case for reform. Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the \nHouse agreed, and the chart reveals tax reform for 1986 of a small \namount, as you can see there, but still tax reform. It is significant, \nI would say.\n  But in 1986, Republicans lost control of the Senate. I happen to \nremember that because I was on the Finance Committee for my first 6 \nyears in the Senate. We didn't have enough Republican seats after that, \nI didn't have enough seniority, and so I lost my seat on the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Congressional Democrats insisted on and obtained, after their success \nin that election, a tax increase in 1987. You can see that tax increase \nthere for 1987.\n  In 1988, as you recall, President Bush's father, George H.W. Bush \ncampaigned, in 1988, and included a pledge not to raise taxes. \nPresident George H.W. Bush won that election, but congressional \nDemocrats solidified their majorities, and, as a part of a deficit-\nreduction package, President George H.W. Bush forgot about his campaign \npromise and agreed to a tax increase. And here it is. You can see the \nbig tax increase--in 1989-1990, it was. Shortly after that tax increase \nwent into effect--there are consequences of policy made here in \nCongress--the American economy went into recession that year.\n  Then you get to the 1992 campaign. Bill Clinton, in response to the \nrecession, campaigned on a middle-income tax cut and tax increases on \nhigher income taxpayers. President Clinton was elected, and Congress \nDemocrats retained a very comfortable majority in the House and Senate, \nas you can see by the blue lines there, during those years.\n  In 1993, less than a year later, on the force of the Democratic votes \nalone, the largest tax increase of modern era was enacted. There you \ncan see it very definitely, a big tax increase at that period of time. \nYou will note it is at the highest point on the tax increase part of \nthe chart.\n  Republicans claimed majorities in the House and Senate in the 1994 \nelection.\n  President Clinton agreed to a revenue-neutral small business tax \nrelief package in 1996. During that campaign, President Clinton \ncampaigned once again on middle-income tax relief. President Clinton \nwas reelected, Republicans increased their majority in the Senate, and \nwe retained a majority in the House.\n  In 1997, congressional Republicans and President Clinton agreed to a \nsignificant tax relief package. It was the first tax relief law since \nthe President Reagan administration, and it averaged about $13 billion \na year. There you can see it in the year of 1997.\n  George W. Bush campaigned on a broad-based tax relief plan for 2000, \nor in the 2000 campaign. He was elected then, obviously. The parties \nsplit the Senate 50-50, with Republicans in control because of Vice \nPresident Cheney's tie-breaking vote for organization. Republicans held \ntheir House majority.\n  In 2001, President Bush and Congress agreed on the largest \ncomprehensive tax relief package since President Reagan. Here it is, as \nyou can see, the big tax reduction of 2001, averaging about $82 billion \nper year.\n  As things happen around here, I was chairman of that committee for \nonly about 5 months because Senator Jeffords switched from being a \nRepublican to a Democrat, and in the wake of 9/11, corporate scandals, \nand other events, President Bush, a Republican House, and a Democratic \nSenate agreed on an economic stimulus package that averaged about $12 \nbillion a year.\n  Republicans regained the Senate majority in 2002. So in 2003, \nPresident Bush and the Republican Congress continued to significantly \nreduce the overall tax burden.\n  So here you can see in the 2003 and 2004 tax bills a combined about \nanother $82 billion a year reduction in taxes. If you look at President \nGeorge W. Bush's first term, enacted legislation totaled roughly $174 \nbillion per year, on average. Republicans held the House for all of \nthat term. Republicans held the Senate for most but not all of that \nterm.\n  In 2004, President Bush campaigned for reelection by emphasizing the \npermanence of the lower tax burdens secured during his first term. \nRepublicans increased their House and Senate majorities.\n  So in 2006, President Bush and the Republican Congress extended the \ntax relief in the first term through the year 2010. It is shown here. \nIt averages about $22 billion per year. In 2006, the situation now, as \na result of that election, Democrats gained majorities in both the \nHouse and Senate.\n  Despite the opposition of the Democratic leadership in the House and \nSenate, Congress passed and President Bush signed an ``unoffset'' \nalternative minimum tax. That legislation averaged $13 billion in tax \nrelief.\n  This year Congress and the President agreed to $34 billion in \ntemporary economic stimulus. At present, the Democratic Congress and \nPresident Bush are in a stalemate on an AMT patch extension and other \nexpiring tax relief matters. The reason for the stalemate is the House \nand Senate Democratic leadership's opposition to passing these bills \n``unoffset.''\n  I want to use one chart to sum up today's discussion. This chart \nshows a tax thermometer. We have got it up there. The heat side is the \ntax increase side. This chart shows the relationship between party \ncontrol of Congress, Presidency, and tax hikes or tax relief.\n  If Republicans control the Presidency and Congress, then lowering the \ntax burden, which is a tentative Republican philosophy, is virtually \ncertain to be put in place. So you can point to that point in the chart \nthere that demonstrates having both a Republican President and a \nRepublican Congress is a certainty to have a lower tax burden for the \nAmerican people.\n  If Democrats control both the Presidency and the Congress, then an \nincrease in the tax burden is certain to occur. That is what history of \nthe last 25 years shows. So it is a virtual certainty, regardless of \ncampaign rhetoric to the contrary.\n  If the parties split control of the Presidency and the Congress, the \nrecord is, as you might expect, mixed, though generally against tax \nrelief.\n  So if you look at the median picture there, you see that we have \nabout three decades of history backing this up. I would encourage \neveryone to take a look at this thermometer chart. When folks go to the \nvoting booth on November 4, they will need to consider the probability \nof a change in fiscal policy. They will need to consider the potential \nchange to their family budget, from higher or lower taxes, because \nelections have consequences. They will have to also think about the \nbroader economic effects of higher or lower tax burdens on business or \ninvestment, because tax policies by the Congress of the United States \ndo have consequences, some ways good, some ways bad. My view is, higher \ntaxes are bad for the economy.\n  That change could be dramatic if the vote is for one party to control \nthe House, the Senate, and the Presidency. There would be consequences \nthen,\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\nlower taxes if that is House and Senate Republicans, Republican \nPresident; House and Senate Democratic, Democratic President, higher \ntaxes.\n  In my next discussion, which will not be today, I will follow up this \none with a detailed examination of what happens in the last bit of \nhistory most like the present. I am referring to the 1992 campaign and \nthe legislative record that followed in 1993.\n  The reason I do that is I think I see the same thing evolving in this \ncampaign. We ought to learn from history, and the voters need to take \nthat into consideration before November 4.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I commend Senator Grassley for focusing \nagain on the importance of lower taxes and promoting a better economy \nand higher standard of living in America.\n  It is disturbing, as we talk about energy and high gas prices, to \nhear from our Democratic colleagues in the House that they are actually \nconsidering raising taxes on gasoline 10 cents or more per gallon at a \ntime when it is already a crushing cost to Americans on energy.\n  The energy debate has been very helpful. I think for years Americans \nhave known, at least many Americans, that the Democratic Party has \nblocked the development of energy supplies, America's own energy \nsupplies, from the time of Jimmy Carter stopping nuclear generation to \nPresident Clinton vetoing the legislation that would have opened some \noil reserves in Alaska, to constant votes by our Democratic colleagues \nto stop the opening of oil and natural gas which is plentiful in \nAmerica.\n  Americans do not trust Congress to fix this because they know it is \nthe inaction by Congress that has caused the gas prices, and we see \nthat the Democratic leadership is going to do everything they can to \nkeep amendments and an open and honest debate about real energy \ndevelopment in America from happening.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  The same thing has happened on another bill that is going to be \ninterjected into this energy debate, this massive housing bill, this \nmassive mortgage bailout that is going to come back to the Senate floor \nfor a vote. This is another situation where the American people know \nthat the mortgage crisis, the foreclosure crisis, the problems with \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae are caused by incompetence and gross \nnegligence by this Congress and past administrations.\n  We suspect, and there is every evidence, that part of that negligence \nhas come from the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars to lobby Members of Congress and other \nwatchdog groups to keep them from focusing on the reforms that were \nneeded.\n  When this housing bill comes back, I have proposed one amendment. I \nasked for one amendment in this process, that if the American taxpayers \nput their money on the line to back these private companies, that these \nprivate companies should no longer be able to spend millions of dollars \nlobbying Members of Congress to keep them from implementing the reforms \nthat are so important.\n  Last night I made an offer to the majority leader. I suggested we \ncould have one vote under a time agreement to allow my amendment to \nprohibit lobbying and political donations from Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. We could have been done with the bill last night. If the majority \nleader tabled the amendment, the bill would have been passed and sent \nto the President last night. But I do not think he wanted his Members \nto have to vote on that.\n  If the amendment had been adopted, the bill would have been \nimmediately sent to the House, passed and sent to the President, \nprobably today. The only thing that prevented this from happening was \nthe objection of the majority leader last night, because the majority \nleader was intent on blocking this amendment to prohibit Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac from lobbying.\n  The bill will likely pass the Senate on Saturday and will not reach \nthe President until next week. So the argument that my one amendment is \nslowing this down is not true. Let me state again one more time, to be \nclear. This Senator was prepared to vote on the housing bill last \nnight. I do not support the bill. I do not think it should become law. \nI simply wanted one amendment.\n  My constituents sent me here to Washington to clean up this place. \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have spent hundreds of millions of dollars \nover the past decade to block commonsense reform, which could have been \nprevented. We could have prevented the debacle that we are faced with \nnow if Congress had not been blind to the problem. But because the \nleader was intent on filibustering my amendment, blocking me from doing \nwhat my constituents sent me here to do, the housing bill will be \ndelayed until next week. This is fine with me, because there is a lot \nwrong with the bill. But the decision to delay the bill was made by the \nmajority leader and him alone.\n  I wish to offer one more opportunity here for the majority to \nexpedite the housing bill and to give me the one vote on this amendment \nand then we can proceed to a final vote.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3221\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nthe consideration of the housing bill, the pending Reid amendment be \nwithdrawn and the only amendment in order be a DeMint amendment which I \nwill send to the desk. This is a measure to address lobbying by Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the majority clearly will not permit this \nor any other amendment on the bill. He says he does not want anything \nto delay it. As I have already pointed out, however, I think his own \nobstruction is delaying the bill.\n  I wish to make one more proposal. I will explain it, and if the \nmajority is willing, then I will read the technical language. But I am \nvery willing to offer a unanimous consent request to move immediately \nto a final vote on the housing bill, and then once the energy debate is \ncompleted, that my amendment, then in bill form, be allowed a straight-\nup vote in the Senate.\n  This may be several weeks from now. But if the concern by the \nmajority is that my amendment would slow the bill down, they should \ncertainly agree that if we can move to housing and pass it straight up, \nand finish the energy debate, whatever time that is finished, then we \ncould have a simple vote at the scheduling of the majority leader to \nvote on this lobbying amendment.\n  I would be glad to put this in unanimous consent form if the majority \nis interested in entertaining this. If I could get some indication from \nthe speaker or the leader over there. Would you be interested in that \nunanimous consent request?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, I would \nindicate that on behalf of the majority, if that were offered I would \nobject.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. Clearly there is no need to continue \nto try to get this housing bill expedited. It is clear my Democratic \ncolleagues do not support this reform, and apparently they are going to \ndo everything they can to protect their relationship with these \nGovernment entities.\n  The majority leader suggested yesterday that he would be happy to \njoin me in sending a letter to these two entities, Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae, to request that they be more transparent in their lobbying. \nWell, I am not interested in sending a letter to the management of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That would be as effective as sending a \nletter, which has been suggested by my Democratic colleague, to Saudi \nArabia demanding lower gas prices. I am not interested in transparency \nin their lobbying or political donations. The lobbying contracts need \nto be terminated and their PACs should be disbanded.\n  The majority leader disagrees. In fact, his staff sent out a blast e-\nmail to their lobbyist friends asking for help in defeating my \namendment.\n  I want to protect taxpayers and end the culture of corruption in \nWashington, but I am afraid in this case, the majority clearly does not \nwant to join me.\n  All I am requesting is one amendment on a 694-page bill that spends\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\nanywhere from $25 billion to hundreds of billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer money to bail out two companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  I believe my amendment is essential to considering the way Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac have spread their wealth around Washington for years to \nbuy Government influence and to cover up their problems. The housing \nlegislation that will be before us authorizes the Secretary of the \nTreasury to use taxpayer money to rescue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nbut it does not include an immediate end to their lobbying and \npolitical activities.\n  If American taxpayers are forced to bail out or buy out Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, their lobbying and political activities should stop. \nOur Nation has a longstanding tradition of preventing American tax \ndollars from being used for lobbying and for soliciting and making \ncampaign contributions. There is no doubt that this housing legislation \ncrosses that line. Under current law, the Department of Treasury cannot \nretain high-powered lobbyists or make political contributions to \ncandidates. This rule should apply to Fannie and Freddie. There may \nhave been some doubt as to whether a government guarantee existed for \nFannie and Freddie before, but now with this legislation, that \nguarantee is made very explicit. They are, in effect, government \nentities and should be treated as such.\n  The Politico newspaper recently reported on how Senators and \nCongressmen are benefiting politically from propping up these two \nmortgage giants. The article said:\n\n       If you want to know how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \n     survived scandal and crisis, consider this: Over the past \n     decade, they have spent nearly $200 million on lobbying and \n     campaign contributions. But the political tentacles of the \n     mortgage giants extend far beyond their checkbooks. The two \n     government-chartered companies run a highly sophisticated \n     lobbying operation with deep-pocketed lobbyists in Washington \n     and scores of local Fannie- and Freddie-sponsored homeowner \n     groups ready to pressure lawmakers back home.\n\n  One thing that should get our colleagues' attention, this chart is a \ncopy of an invitation by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and other groups \nfor a big party at the Democratic National Convention. There is one \nvery similar to this for the Republicans. They will continue to lavish \nentertainment on those of us in Congress until we stop it.\n  National Public Radio reported that in the first 3 months of the year \nalone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent a combined total of $3.5 \nmillion on lobbying and hired 42 outside firms.\n  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac have been such prolific donors to political parties, \ncandidates, and PACs that they are the No. 1 and No. 3 top contributors \nin the mortgage industry and rank in the top 100 political donors of \nall time.\n  May I inquire as to how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair. I can see I have more to say than I \nhave time to say it.\n  Let me close by encouraging my colleagues. There is no need for this \nissue to be partisan. Clearly, if we are going to put hard-working \ntaxpayer dollars behind our bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we \nshould not allow them to continue to throw millions of dollars around \nfor political activities. It just makes good common sense.\n  On a bill that is this large and this important and that probably not \none Senator has read even half of, the opportunity to have at least one \namendment and a limited time for debate seems to be a small request. \nUnfortunately, the majority is not going to give us any amendments, and \napparently they are going to turn a blind eye to this obvious problem \non which the Wall Street Journal and news media all over the country \nhave been focusing. The American people know about it. I think they \nwould trust the Senate much more to make the proper reforms for housing \nand mortgages and Fannie and Freddie Mac if they could see that we were \neliminating a conflict of interest that has clearly existed for a \nnumber of years.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and encourage my colleagues to ask the \nmajority leader to reconsider and give us the opportunity to have a \nvote on this one amendment, and then we could speed the housing bill \nthrough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, let me indicate my strong support for \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and the motion to proceed \nunder which we are currently working. I hope we will have a strong \nvote. We know regardless of the debate we are having on solutions or \ncauses for how we got here, seniors, families, those we represent are \nbeing affected by this every single day.\n  Making sure that LIHEAP is increased and that we have support for \nfamilies in paying their heating bills is absolutely critical. I very \nmuch appreciate our majority leader making this a top priority and \nSenator Sanders for his advocacy. I look forward to what I hope will be \na strong bipartisan vote in support of improving and strengthening \nLIHEAP.\n  I want to speak further today about the reality of what is happening \nfor families, businesses all across America, certainly in my great home \nState of Michigan. Since President Bush and Vice President Cheney, two \noilmen, two people from the oil industry, took office, gas prices have \nnearly tripled. Oil prices have gone up four times higher than before \nthe current administration came into office. The average family is \nspending a record 6 percent of their income, and counting, paying for \ngas to get to work, to get the kids to childcare, to try and maybe take \na little vacation up north in beautiful northern Michigan or Rhode \nIsland. I can't leave out beautiful Rhode Island, the State of our \nPresiding Officer.\n  But the reality is, families are making incredibly tough choices. At \nthe same time, energy prices certainly are taking a toll on the \neconomy. We are seeing the level of unemployment going up. People are \nlosing their jobs or are underemployed or are working three jobs, \ntrying to get to work, paying more for gas. It is outrageous. I go home \nevery weekend, and it is amazing. It makes you want to scream as you \nstand at the pump and the price goes $50, $60, $70, $80, to fill up a \ngas tank. It is unbelievable. Families are trying to figure out what to \ndo about it.\n  Unemployment rises, and we have now 12 States with unemployment rates \nover 6 percent. My State has an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent, 45 \nout of 50 States have seen job loss and unemployment numbers going up.\n  One of the challenges, if we are going to talk about what to do about \nthis, is we need to be talking about how we got here. How did we get \nhere? We have had 8 years and two oilmen leading us in the White House, \nand it is not, unfortunately, a surprise, based on their agenda, that \nwe have ended up with $4 and higher per gallon of gasoline. That is the \nshorthand way of talking about what has been happening.\n  For the folks they represent, for the folks who met with the Vice \nPresident to put together his energy policy, what has been happening \nfor them, while families are seeing their wages go down, if they have a \njob at all, every cost they have going up--what has been happening to \nthem? The total combined net profits of the big five oil companies \nsince this President took office are upwards of $556 billion. That is \nnet profits. ExxonMobil alone has had, since this President took \noffice, $185 billion in profits.\n  One could say, well, businesses want to be profitable. I want them to \nbe profitable, and I am working hard to make sure our manufacturers \nwho, by the way, pay a lot of these costs and are impacted by gas \nprices when it comes to what is happening in the economy, I want them \nto be profitable as well. This is not about whether companies should be \nprofitable. This is about the fact that we have had an energy policy \nput forward by two oilmen in the White House that has focused on \nsupporting an industry and their backers, their supporters, that has \nnow created a crisis in America, a crisis in the economy.\n  To add insult to injury, it is one thing if there are profits and \nthey are put back into creating more oil and gas exploration, \nalternative energy exploration, if this was reinvested to strengthen \nAmerica, the folks who are helping to subsidize this, taxpayer money. \nThe folks I represent who have lost their jobs, they are subsidizing \nthis right now because of tax policy.\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\n  To add insult to injury, are they putting this back into the economy \nto make us energy independent? No. The oil companies have spent $188 \nbillion in stock buybacks over the last 5 years, instead of investing \nin increasing supply at home or in supporting a man who has now become \nvery well known to everyone, T. Boone Pickens, an oilman his whole \nlife, who is now investing in alternative energy. Instead of going in \nthat direction because they care about America, the American people, \nAmerican businesses, American economy--no, that is not what is \nhappening. That is what adds such insult to injury about what is \nhappening to the people of Michigan and around the country. It is the \nfact that people are taking this and having stock buybacks or adding \nanother corporate jet or putting it into their pockets as opposed to \ninvesting in America and the ability for us to have energy \nindependence.\n\n  Then, on top of that, with what is being drilled for--and we know we \nare in a global market. We understand that. We are in a global economy \nwhere commodities move around the world. But it is important to know \nthat when our colleagues put forward the oil agenda of drill, drill, \ndrill, let's keep doing what we have always done and hope maybe \nsomething will change, maybe we will get out of the hole we are in if \nwe just keep digging--when they talk about that, they are not \nacknowledging the fact that a record 1.6 million barrels a day from \nU.S. refineries, 1.6 million barrels a day in refined petroleum \nproducts were exported in the first 4 months of this year, up 33 \npercent.\n  So we are paying more. We are being told the problem is we are not \ndrilling more, and then 33 percent more of the oil drilled in America \nleaves America. Why? We are in a global marketplace. It goes to the \nhighest bidder. We understand that. We understand the fact that China \nis using more, the fact that the weak dollar impacts that and oil \nspeculation, the whole question of energy speculation which, again, I \nappreciate Senator Reid and all the leadership of my colleagues--\nSenator Durbin, Senator Dorgan, so many people--who have been focused \non this as a piece of the problem, but we are being told: Use the old \nsolution over and over and over, knowing that we don't even know if \nthat oil is going to stay here.\n  I have supported drilling in the gulf. I have supported efforts to \nadd to our domestic supply. But this is not the way we are going to \ncreate energy independence by only focusing on that. According to the \nDepartment of Energy, shipments this February topped 1.8 million \nbarrels a day, shipments outside the country, the highest for the first \ntime in any given month.\n  We are being told that we should do the same old thing, add to it, \nbut do the same old strategy, and somehow we will get a different \nresult. I suggest that the same old strategy, first of all, has \nachieved great results for friends of the administration, for friends \nof my colleagues, the Republican leadership that has been fighting for \nthe oil agenda of this country. It has achieved a goal but not a goal \nfor the American people. This is a question of who you are fighting \nfor, whose side you are on.\n  These folks are doing well. We know whose side the current \nadministration and those who support the administration are on. \nUnfortunately, it is not the side of the folks in Michigan who are \nworrying about whether they can buy enough gas to get to work.\n  We have, in fact, a formula the Presiding Officer is very well aware \nof: 8 years divided by 2 oilmen in the White House has gotten us this \nresult: $4 and counting.\n  So what has been the energy plan of the administration that has \ngotten us to this situation? Well, for one thing, we have seen a free \nride for the oil companies. In January 2006, the New York Times \nreported that the Bush administration was allowing oil and gas \ncompanies to forego royalty payments--so they were not having to pay \ntheir royalty payments they should be paying--on oil and gas leases in \nFederal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. This decision by the Department \nof Interior could cost American taxpayers more than $60 billion.\n  So to go back again to another chart--they are not paying oil and gas \nleases, which costs American taxpayers up to $60 billion. I wonder how \nmuch of these profits came from that decision. I wonder how much.\n  We all know that the administration and, unfortunately, those who \nsupport the administration's policy, Republican colleagues, have joined \nin supporting an effort to block the elimination of taxpayer subsidies \nto the oil industry so we can take those precious dollars, hard-earned \ndollars of people working every single day, money that has been going \nto subsidize the oil companies--we wanted to move that over to real \nenergy independence, to focus on the priorities of the American people, \nAmerican families, American businesses that are having to pay for all \nthis. We tried to move over $12.5 billion that would be used for real \nenergy independence, for incentives for solar and wind and, yes, our \nnew hybrid and plug-in vehicles that are coming in the next couple \nyears that, frankly, provide a much quicker opportunity for us to be \nable to get to energy independence than what we are talking about here \nin terms of a long-term drilling strategy.\n  We have an opportunity to take precious taxpayer money and move it \nover to invest in the future, to invest in the American people and in \nthe future, rather than in the past and the oil companies. We lost that \nby one vote, not because we did not have enough to pass it, not that we \ndid not have 51 votes, but unfortunately the Bush administration and \nthe Senate Republican leadership blocked it, filibustered it: Let's \nfilibuster. Let's make sure nothing happens to this. So there was a \nfilibuster that then we were not able to overcome because we were \nmissing one vote.\n  So the solution that has come forward by this administration, the \nsolution that has come over the last 8 years of the leadership in the \nWhite House--the two oilmen in the White House--has been simply to have \none solution, which is to continue drilling even if, in fact, that oil \ndoes not stay in the United States. So between 2001 and 2007, the Bush \nadministration issued leases on over 26 million acres of onshore public \nlands. There are already 44 million acres, as we know, of onshore \nFederal lands under lease, but 31 million acres of those are currently \nnot being drilled upon. There are 2,200 producing leases on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and 6,300 nonproducing leases at this time.\n  So that has been the strategy. That has been the strategy that has \ngotten us to this--okaying more and more land and not even using it. \nAnd in the first 4 months of this year, when we were drilling for \ndomestic production--because we are in a global economy--33 percent \nmore of that went out into the global marketplace.\n  Let me say there is a better way. In addition to supporting the \nenergy speculation bill that is in front of us and in addition to \nsupporting efforts, as I have done before, to have a responsible \ndrilling policy in this country, there is a quicker way to get to where \nwe want to go, and it is one that creates jobs, jobs right now.\n  I am so appreciative of the fact that, through our budget resolution \nin the Senate, our Democratic majority put jobs as No. 1 and green-\ncollar jobs in support of manufacturing and retooling our auto industry \nat the top of the list. I am grateful for our leader's support, Senator \nReid, and Senator Dorgan, who has been such a leader on these issues, \nchairing the Energy and Water Subcommittee in Appropriations. I am very \ngrateful for his support. But here is what we could be doing.\n  Oil exploration and drilling will take 7 to 10 years to bring new \nsupplies to market. Some people say longer. But there are technologies \nwe can bring to market in the next 2 years--in the next 2 years--for \nadvanced technology vehicles. The more we invest in technologies such \nas advanced battery technologies, the quicker we are going to find \nrelief at the pump. That is the way we are going to do it, not by \nrewarding the oil companies more but by investing in our own energy \nindependence, with innovation, American ingenuity, hard work that \nallows us to not only create jobs but create a future for us here in \nterms of energy independence and lowering costs.\n  The facts are simple. Advanced vehicles that run with new batteries \nare much cheaper to drive than conventional automobiles, and we need to \nbe moving to them as quickly as possible. Currently, the average cost \nto run a vehicle is 16 cents per mile--16 cents per\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nmile--on the roads. But the cost to run a plug-in hybrid car with \nadvanced lithium-ion batteries is only 3 or 4 cents a mile--a 75-\npercent reduction. Not only does this save energy, but, as I said \nbefore, it creates jobs. This technology is right around the corner.\n  Frankly, there is a huge competition going on in the world today to \nsee who is going to get to that plug-in battery, that lithium-ion \nbattery that is lightweight enough, small enough, with the technologies \nthat will allow it to be mass-produced on the assembly lines so \nthousands can be produced a day. The prototypes are there. We have \nprobably all driven them. We have prototypes for a variety of different \nvehicles. The question is not the prototype; the question is being able \nto get something mass-produced so it is in the realm of price where \nconsumers can afford to buy it and it can be produced in the volumes we \nneed. We are really in a race right now to do that.\n  I am grateful there is support from our Senate Democratic leadership \nto invest in advanced battery research, R, the next generation, to \nprovide low-interest credit to retool our plants, to keep the jobs here \nin America, and to provide consumer tax credits for plug-ins and \nhybrids to make sure the price is affordable. All of those things are \nin legislation right now. They are before us in the tax package. They \nare before us in Senator Bingaman's amendment, if he has the \nopportunity to offer it, as it relates to the Energy bills. They are in \nour appropriations. They are right now in front of us, and we have the \nability to act on this and quickly be able to move us to the next \ngeneration of vehicles that go from a cost of 16 cents per mile on the \nroad down to 3 or 4 cents--much faster than what is being talked about \nin terms of drilling.\n  Germany has announced the Great Battery Alliance, which will invest \nover $650 million in advanced lithium-ion batteries for German \nvehicles. The German automobile companies are receiving the support of \nthe German Government to be able to be the first ones that are able to \nget to where we need to be in terms of the new battery technology.\n  South Korea, by 2010, will have spent $700 million on advanced \nbatteries and developing hybrid vehicles.\n  China has invested over $100 million in battery research and \ndevelopment.\n  Over the next 5 years, Japan will spend $230 million on advanced \nbattery research. It is spending $278 million a year on hydrogen \nresearch for zero-emission fuel-cell vehicles.\n  We are in a race. We are in a race as it relates to technology. We \nhave the engineers. We have the scientists. We have the skilled \nworkforce here in America to do this. We have not had an administration \nor a willingness by our Republican colleagues to join with us to be \nable to partner in the investments that need to be made in the \nautomotive industry of the future. That is just a reality. I believe it \nwas last year when I looked at the President's budget and it was \nsomething like $22 million he was suggesting for advanced battery \ntechnology research. Unfortunately, they just don't get it about what \nis going on around us.\n\n  If we want to see prices go down and have energy independence and be \nable to move to the future for our country, frankly, that is the \nfastest way to do it. I am very proud our Democratic majority \nunderstands that.\n  We know there is no silver bullet on any of this. But I can tell you \nwhat I also know: a game show approach to battery technology research \nis not the answer. Frankly, both the Republican alternative as well as \nthe candidate who we understand will be the Republican nominee for \nPresident have put forward the idea of a prize at the end of the line, \na prize for whoever can create the new advanced battery technology \nresearch.\n  Well, Mr. President, we do not need a prize. We do not need \nmotivation. We do not need the motivation to get there. We need the \ncapital to get there. We need the investment. We need the partnering. \nWe need the priority of investing in this innovation to get there. The \nprize is going to be real easy. Whoever gets there first, they are \ngoing to get a big enough prize without us in terms of the marketplace.\n  The question is, How do we invest up front? What is it that Germany \nknows, Japan knows, South Korea knows, China knows that we do not know \nabout this, when they are all racing to put hundreds of millions of \ndollars into this technology? It is very unfortunate that the approach \nthat has been taken--primarily in the Republican alternative; not \ncompletely but primarily; and certainly by the Republican nominee--is \nto treat our economy and certainly the industry that I care deeply \nabout somehow as a game show, and I find that really appalling.\n  As I conclude, as indicated before, there is no silver bullet to stop \nthe outrageous price increases at the pump. We know that. We have to \npass our legislation dealing with energy speculation. I hope we will be \nable to proceed to do that. We all understand that a responsible \ndrilling policy is part of this. We have, frankly, supported that and \nmade those acres available. But we also know--we also know--if we want \nAmerica to be energy independent, we have to invest in the future.\n  We have seen this chart before, but I am going to show it again \nbecause we have a lifelong oilman now running ads on television who is \nso concerned about what is happening in our country and this constant \npolicy that has not been working that he has been presenting, through \ncommercials, a message that we should be paying attention to:\n\n       I've been an oilman all my life, but this is one emergency \n     we can't drill our way out of. . . .\n\n  ``We can't drill our way out of.''\n\n     . . . But if we create a new RENEWABLE energy network, we can \n     break our addiction to foreign oil.\n\n  There are some folks who are making a lot of money by ignoring this \nstrategy, there is no question about it. There has been an energy \nstrategy in place that has worked for the oil companies. I understand \nthat when somebody comes out of a particular industry, their focus is \non that industry. I understand that. But the reality is, we have gone \ntoo long--too long--with a strategy: 8 years of a Republican strategy, \nwith two oilmen at the head of this, creating $4-per-gallon gasoline. \nThat is the simple explanation for how we got where we are. We have to \nstop digging. We have to stop doing more and more of the same and \nhoping somehow we are going to get a different result. We need a new \nstrategy: Energy independence, investing in American ingenuity, \ninvesting in a strategy for the future, and, most importantly, what we \nneed is to put the American people first. That has not happened for the \nlast 8 years. It is time to make it happen. That is what our energy \nproposals are all about. That is what we are fighting for, and we are \ngoing to continue to fight for that until we make it happen.\n\n  The American people have had enough, and I don't blame them. I have \nhad enough too. It is time for a change, and we are going to work very \nhard to get that change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Menendez be the \nnext speaker following the remarks of Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the Warm \nIn Winter and Cool In Summer Act as the lead Republican cosponsor, \nalong with 52 of my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle.\n  I first thank the Senator from Vermont, Senator Sanders, for his \ntireless leadership on this vital issue of heating and cooling \nassistance and for his steadfast vigilance throughout the last few \nmonths in pressing for this debate on energy assistance when there is \nnot a moment to waste in preparing for what could be the worst winter \nin a generation, given the historic cost of energy today. At a time \nwhen skyrocketing energy prices are at the forefront of our national \nagenda--when heating oil prices have increased from about $2.77 per \ngallon a year ago in my home State of Maine to a staggering $4.81 cents \na gallon today, and when electricity has risen 3.6 percent in the last \n12 months, and gas prices have jumped from $3.05 a gallon to $4.05 in \nthe last year--as we know, it should come as no surprise that countless \nAmerican families are faced with choices that, frankly, no family \nshould have to make. Indeed, as a direct result\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nof spiraling energy costs, 70 percent of low-income Americans are \nbuying less at the grocery store, 31 percent are purchasing less \nmedicine, and 19 percent say they have changed plans for the education \nof their children. Even now, in the midst of July, in truth, \nAmericans--and certainly Mainers across my home State--are wondering \nhow exactly they will pay for the fundamental necessity of heating \ntheir homes this coming winter, just as many others cannot afford the \ncosts for critical cooling during these dangerously hot summer months \nin so many States. In fact, in South Carolina, electricity services \nhave been suspended to 39,000 homes that are falling behind on their \nbills, leaving these individuals with no assistance to alleviate the \nstifling heat. In Arizona there has been a 40-percent spike in shutoffs \nfor residential electricity users. The bottom line is this issue knows \nno boundaries regionally or politically.\n  The reality is the stunning effects of these astronomical energy \ncosts are not a regional problem, they are a national problem requiring \nnational attention and a national solution. In fact, as I think about \nit, with the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program pending before the \nSenate--at least the motion to proceed; and I hope we will proceed, Mr. \nPresident and Members of this body, because I think we ought to be \ntranslating words into action--I think there is no better place to \nstart than on this very crucial and vital program. In fact, if I \nrecall, it was back in 1979 and 1980 when we first had the debate on \nwhether to create this program called the Low-Income Fuel Assistance \nProgram, and it was my first term in the House of Representatives. I, \nalong with the late Speaker O'Neill, testified before the then House \nAppropriations Committee to create such a program. It was born out of \nthe energy crisis that was engulfing our Nation at that time when we \nhad gas lines here in the District of Columbia and across this country.\n  It was interesting to think that at that time, in the midst of an \nenergy crisis, that previously--6 years previously or 7 years \npreviously--we had another energy crisis and, unfortunately, didn't \nlearn from that event. Out of that crisis in 1979 and 1980, we created \nthe Low-Income Fuel Assistance Program in order to give low-income \nfamilies the ability to heat their homes and to cool their homes in \nother parts of the country. That is how this program was created. So I \nthink this program was created as a result of a crisis--as a result of \nthe failure of this country to create and enact a comprehensive energy \nplan. I think too today, 30 years later, we are in the same \ncircumstance, regrettably and tragically, and the people who rely on \nthis program should not be the victims of our inability, or our \nunwillingness, to address the energy problem. That is what we should \ncome to terms with here in the Senate, that we should proceed to \nconsider this legislation and have it become law. I think absolutely it \nis our responsibility and obligation to give peace of mind to our \nconstituency as they are despairing about the oncoming winter and how \nthey are going to meet the costs of home heating oil that is now close \nto $5 per gallon.\n  I think we do have an obligation to continue to support this social \nsafety net that is so essential. It is a matter of life and death, and \nI don't think they should be the victims of our political failure or \nour failure to address a comprehensive energy policy. That should \nhappen. No doubt it should. Frankly, I hope we can reconcile our \nrhetoric here on the floor of the Senate with legislative action that \nbecomes law that has an actual, direct impact on people's daily lives. \nThey deserve that. They deserve for us to take action. Irrespective of \nthe time or place we are in, in the Senate--whether or not it is a \npolitical year--we ought to reconcile our differences to do what is \nright for America on this mighty challenge that is facing so many \nacross this country, including my constituency.\n  Here we are in the third energy crisis of recent times, and we see \nthat the program was at least designed to minimize the burden for the \nleast fortunate for years and has provided a level of funding. However, \nas you can see, with the historically high home heating oil prices you \nsee over time, and yet, even though we have provided funding for low-\nincome fuel assistance basically on a consistent basis, it never \naddressed the gap between the level of funding and the costs for home \nheating oil. So we are seeing, as you can see in the recent times, in \nthe recent months, what has happened to the cost of home heating oil. \nYet at the same time the level of funding for low-income fuel \nassistance has leveled off.\n  That is why we need the legislation that is pending before the \nSenate. My colleague Senator Sanders is absolutely right, we need to \ndouble this funding. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee as \nwell for doubling the authorization. I appreciate his leadership on \nthis question because we are in very different times, and that is the \nreason why we need to increase the level of support for this valuable \nprogram.\n  This program is for the most vulnerable. We are talking about income \nlimits of $17,680 for an individual, and the average individual \nrecipient earns around $13,000 per year. Think about it. The assistance \nwe are providing is for those who have income eligibility of somewhere \nbetween $17,000 and $13,000 on an individual basis. That is who we are \ntalking about when it comes to the income eligibility standards for \nlow-income fuel assistance--$13,000 for an individual and as high as \n$17,000, and for a family of four the limit is $36,000. In Maine, in \nterms of the projected costs for paying for a household for home \nheating oil during the course of a winter, based on today's prices, is \nclose to $5,000, just to keep warm this winter--$5,000. So if the \neligibility standards are $33,000--$36,000 for a family of four, and \nfor an individual it is anywhere from $13,000 to $17,000, it costs \n$5,000 to heat one's home or residence for a winter. These are hard-\nworking individuals and families who, quite frankly, were in desperate \nneed of assistance back in 2006 when we witnessed the first major \nincrease in home heating oil. So we were able to provide additional \nfunding at that time of $1 billion for a total of $3.1 billion. At that \npoint, again, it was a crisis that, given the sharp hike, New \nEnglanders were paying about $2.39 per gallon. Well, fast forward 2 \nyears to today and you will see, based on our charts we have provided, \nthat oil costs $4.81. That is a 75-percent increase in only 2 years--75 \npercent.\n\n  So we augmented the funding back in 2006 up to $3.1 billion when home \nheating oil was $2.39. Today, it is at $4.81, and of course we are in \nJuly, so we have no idea in terms of what we can anticipate or expect \nfor home heating oil costs when it comes to winter. So a 75-percent \nincrease as we know it today. So when winter actually arrives, New \nEngland could spend, under today's prices, more than $19 billion on \nhome heating oil--$19 billion on home heating oil alone. That is a \nstaggering price increase compared to back in 2006 when it was \napproximately $9 billion. That gives us a dimension of the escalation \nof the problem as we face it today and still not knowing what we can \nexpect when winter approaches.\n  As we see on this other chart I have presented, here is the cost of \nhome heating oil, and as we have seen, it has increased 147 percent \nsince 2004. So basically, in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, we have seen an \nincrease in home heating oil of 147 percent. Yet when you look at the \nwage increase, it has only been 17.1 percent. So you see that the cost \nof home heating oil in Maine has outpaced wages by 174 percent. Prices \nare now well ensconced in the stratosphere, with the legitimate fears \nthat the sky may not, in fact, be the limit. It is a huge disparity \nwhen you see how little wages have grown over the last 3\\1/2\\ years and \nwhat has happened with a basic commodity such as home heating oil \nhaving increased 147 percent.\n  Yet given all of these alarming numbers, what has happened to the \nlevel of low-income fuel assistance? It has actually dropped. It has \nactually declined to $2.5 billion from the $3.1 billion that we \nprovided and that I sought, very actively, back in 2006, when the \nprices had spiked. So we were able to augment, as I said, that funding \nby an additional billion dollars to reach $3.1 billion, but \nunfortunately, the funding for low-income fuel assistance fell back to \n$2.5 billion. So it obviously doesn't make sense. We are actually \nregressing in terms of a level of funding at a time when home heating \noil is actually skyrocketing and we don't know where the boundaries \nare, we don't know where\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\nthe limitations are. As I said, the sky could be the limit, given what \nthe unknown presents for the future with respect to home heating oil.\n  In testimony before the Senate Committee on Small Business that \nSenator Kerry and I convened last month to discuss the dimensions \ninvolving small businesses and home heating oil and what the impact \nwould be in our region, I had an individual from my State--her name is \nJennifer Brooks--who is the community relations manager at Penquis \nCommunity Action Program. They are on the front lines of providing \ncritical services to Maine in multiple counties during these difficult \ntimes.\n  Last year, the community action program provided fuel assistance to \nmore than 9,000 Maine households. The average benefit received by each \nhousehold was $736. In order to qualify for low-income fuel assistance \nthis upcoming heating season, a family of four must earn less than \n$31,800. So under the best case scenario, if a household does qualify \nfor LIHEAP and benefits remain constant, a household on average can \nexpect to receive 158 gallons of oil for the season, which isn't even \nenough to fill a 250-gallon tank one time.\n  We know it takes, on average, to get through a Maine winter, 850 \ngallons of heating oil--850 to 1,000 gallons--and it costs $4.81, which \nwe know is the price today. When you look at what is available in the \nlow-income fuel assistance program, if we fail to take action and \nincrease funding, as this legislation would prescribe, to $5.1 billion, \nour lowest income families will receive a mere 19 percent of their home \nheating oil costs through this program--the lowest in the program's \nhistory.\n  Now, it is unbelievable to think people can anticipate this winter \nfacing, at the minimum, spending close to $5,000 for home heating oil. \nYet given the dimensions of this program, we will only be able to \nprovide support for 19 percent of the entire cost for the entire \nwinter. As you can see from the previous support of this program, the \npercentages have declined over the years. Over the last 25 years, the \naverage Maine low-income fuel assistance recipient received assistance \nthat provided 41 percent of their heating oil costs. Last year, that \nstarted eroding, and it declined from $3.1 billion to $2.5 billion. For \nthe nearly 50,000 Maine households that received benefits, they were \nonly provided 35 percent of the entire cost for the season.\n  At today's prices, if we fail to increase or double the funding of \nthe low-income fuel assistance program to $5.1 billion, then we can \nonly provide 19 percent of the entire cost of winter for home heating \noil. Obviously, I think that speaks volumes, in terms of the dimension \nof the problem we are facing and what families are facing in my State, \nin New England, and across the country. Whether you are living in a \ncold- or hot-weather region, you depend on this program either for air-\nconditioning or heating during the winter. It is a basic social safety \nnet program.\n  I think it is absolutely incumbent upon us to do everything we can to \ndouble funding for this program and to do it now and provide the \nassurances, instead of the rhetoric about what we will do sometime down \nthe road. I think we do have a responsibility, individually and \ncollectively, to make the process work in the Senate and in the \nCongress, with the President, to do what is right for this country, for \nthese families who are agonizing over the anticipation of what next \nwinter will bring in terms of costs. Here, with this program, we are \ntalking about the lowest of incomes. When it comes to $13,000, $17,000 \nfor a family of four, or even $31,000 or $33,000, we need to help these \nfamilies and these individuals, without question.\n  As my constituent Jennifer Brooks said in her testimony before the \nSmall Business Committee:\n\n       If the average person on fuel assistance makes about \n     $14,000 a year and the benefit only pays for 158 gallons of \n     oil, I don't know how they come up with any more money . . . \n     they can't, with the cost of food and the cost of gas and \n     everything else. There is no money left over to pay even in \n     the summer months . . . there is talk [of having] ``warming \n     places'' so people can shut their furnaces down real low \n     during the day and go to libraries and stay warm during the \n     day . . . we are in a crisis.\n\n  Last year, I heard many stories. After we were expecting $2.50 to \n$2.70 a gallon for home heating oil, I heard stories of desperation \nthen. One TV station, channel 13, in Portland, ME, decided they would \ninitiate a program where they would provide a few hundred gallons of \nheating oil to four families requiring assistance. They were asked to \nsubmit e-mails or letters if they believe they qualified for this \nassistance. They received an astounding response, with more than 2,000 \nrequests.\n  Again, there is no doubt as to the magnitude of the problem. That was \nfor last winter. One hesitates to think about what we can expect for \nthis winter, when prices have increased by more than $2 since last \nwinter. Here we are in July. So we must step up to our responsibilities \nin this crisis and fully fund the low-income fuel assistance program at \nthe $5.1 billion. That is the least we can do. It is not that it will \naddress all the problems or fulfill the needs for all those individuals \nwho rely on this program, but certainly it will be a very important \nstep forward. We must do it now. We should be proactive and preemptive \nand prescriptive in our measures, not reactive, and not wait until \nafter the August recess and continue to dither and talk but fail to \ntake action.\n  We have a responsibility to provide assurances to those people we \nrepresent in this country, to take the strong measures, and to take \nthose actions that are so vital and instrumental to providing peace of \nmind during these very difficult times when people are facing these \nmighty challenges.\n  There are many ways to debate this energy problem. Certainly, we \nshould have a comprehensive energy solution, no doubt. I don't think we \nshould place the burden on those individuals who rely on this program, \nwho are concerned--deeply concerned--and anguishing about the future \nbecause of our failure to reconcile our differences to reach out across \nthe political aisle. I question as to why we cannot do it. I don't \nthink we should live in an all-or-nothing world because that is not the \nworld our constituents live in. These issues are not mutually \nexclusive. It is not that we cannot do one because we were haven't done \nthe other. How about starting someplace? We can start with this \nprogram, which was born because of an energy crisis 30 years ago. We \nare in a similar circumstance today.\n  These people should not bear the brunt of our political failures or \nunwillingness or inability to resolve these differences.\n  I think the Senate should not be a roadblock to results but a pathway \nto hope. What I see here today, regrettably, is, again, my way or the \nhighway. Here, at a time when we are dealing with monumental challenges \nconfronting this Nation--and they are affecting our country \nsimultaneously. Look at our economy and the job picture, the housing, \nenergy, and we are in a war in Iraq and in Afghanistan and we continue \nto dither, to remain intractable, intransigent about achieving results. \nTruly, it is not in keeping with the legacy of this institution, which \nhas done so much throughout our history.\n  That is why Senator Nelson, from Nebraska, and I sent a letter to the \nPresident, along with 14 other colleagues, asking the President for a \nbipartisan summit. After all, we think these times demand it. The \nPresident should convene a national energy summit, bringing together \nthe congressional leadership, on a bipartisan basis, and other Members \nof the House and Senate from the committees of jurisdiction, \nenvironmental leaders, industry leaders and scientists, to sit around a \ntable to see what we can do for the good of this country now.\n  It is immaterial that we are in an election year, that we are 7 \nmonths away from the election. The American people deserve to have us \nhonor our obligations as elected officials. After all, there was an \nelection in 2006, as I recall. We promised our constituents we would \nwork on the problems facing this country. Here we are today with an \nabysmal 14 percent approval rating. I don't know, that may be the \nlowest approval rating in the history of Gallup Polls.\n  We all bear a responsibility, individually and collectively. We \nshould care how Americans feel about this institution and what can we \ndo every day to\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\nmake it better. Some days, I wonder if we wake up and say: Well, this \nis going to be another ``can't do'' day. We are not going to achieve \nanything for the people. We are going to see if we can continue to be a \nroadblock to results and action. We are going to do everything we can \nto be a barrier to solutions. We will wait for the next election or \nnext year or maybe some other time.\n  Yet people are suffering. They are losing their jobs. They are \nwondering how to heat their homes next winter. They are losing their \nhomes. This is a time for us to step up to the plate and demonstrate to \nthe American people that we can do it. Frankly, we are experiencing a \ncrisis in confidence in America, in a variety of institutions, not the \nleast of which is Congress. People are not only despairing about their \nindividual situations, they are also despairing about the inability of \nelected officials in our political institutions to address these \nproblems. It is not so much that America has these problems, it is the \nquestion of our inability to address them and to reach across the \npolitical aisle.\n\n  I hope we can find a way to extricate ourselves from this \nconfrontational morass and not constantly engage in all-or-nothing \npolitics and scoring political points, making it all about the \nelection, and not live up to the expectations the people rightfully \nhave of their elected officials and political institutions to address \nthe mighty challenges confronting this Nation.\n  Without question, we can and we must have answers to this national \nemergency. That is why I thought it would be an important step forward \nif the President convened an emergency energy summit. There are short-\nterm and long-term solutions. There are many pieces to the energy pie. \nThe low-income energy assistance program is a critical aspect of that \nin terms of mitigating the impact on the most vulnerable in our \nsociety. We have an obligation, at a very minimum, to address that for \nthese individuals. It is not their burden and it should not be; they \nshould not have the responsibility of our failure to address the energy \nproblem. That is why we need to double the funding for this critical \nprogram.\n  Yes, we should pass legislation with respect to speculation. It is \nsomething most of us agree on. Why can't we do it? There are other \naspects to energy policy we have failed to address. Everybody is \nagreeing we should extend the tax credit for renewables. So why haven't \nwe done that? It should have been part of the stimulus package--and it \nwas, to a point. But, regrettably, again, there were those who opposed \nit. Yet it could have very well been stimulative to this economy. It \nwould have created up to 100,000 jobs. In Maine, we get $1.5 billion \nfor wind projects, but we didn't extend the tax credits for renewables \nbeyond this year. Why couldn't we do it? Everybody talks about it. Yet \nwe failed to address that problem. We keep postponing, deferring, \ndelaying, and denying that the problem exists. Yet this is something \nthat could be readily accomplished.\n  My constituents are looking into alternatives; for example, wood \npellet stoves or other energy-efficient means of heating our homes. Yet \nthe tax credits for those have expired. They expired at the end of last \nyear. So they cannot even resort to that as an alternative because, \nregrettably, we have not extended that tax credit.\n  The question is, Why? Why are we at an impasse on those issues upon \nwhich we agree? I think that is the most startling dimension to the \nproblems facing this country--that in the Senate, where we should be \ntaking and adopting the can-do approach, why can't we do the right \nthing and address this energy crisis? We all agree extending tax \ncredits for renewables is something we should do. So why aren't we \ndoing it? Because individuals or companies or entities aren't going to \nmake investments in renewables if they don't have the assurance of tax \ncredits. That is abundantly clear. They have no way of knowing how long \nor whether they are going to be extended. They are not going to put \nthemselves on the line financially without the certainty of knowing \nthey will be extended.\n  Why are we not doing that? It will create jobs and, certainly, we \nneed job creation in America, at a time when unemployment is rising at \nhigh levels.\n  We should be concerned about creating jobs, and that is one \ndimension. We should be concerned about creating alternatives, creating \nincentives, inspiring innovation, entrepreneurial spirit. We should do \nall of that and more, and we hesitate and fail to take action on issues \non which we agree, which is truly dismaying and disconcerting, most \ncertainly to the American people who depend on us to take those \nmeasures and those steps that can begin to resolve effectively the \nproblems that are at hand.\n  We can do all of these things. We are certainly capable of doing \nthem, unless we are stuck in the status quo and the gridlock that \nconstantly is where we try to score the political points time and time \nagain to no avail.\n  I hope we can proceed and take action on this very basic social \nsafety net program for the most vulnerable in our society and \ndemonstrate that we do have the opportunity, these rare moments, to \nreach across the political aisle and proceed to double the funding for \nthis program at this moment in time because, certainly, it is one \nprogram that is of immense value to the people of my State and \nthroughout this country, and it is certainly at the very least, at the \nminimal, what we should be able to accomplish.\n  I hope we can do more. I hope we can find the political wherewithal \nto search within ourselves to reach across the political aisle so the \nmonkey wrenches don't continue to grind down the deliberative process \nwith polarization and partisanship that yields no achievements, no \naccomplishments, no opportunity, and provides no hope for the people we \nrepresent.\n  The American people deserve more than what they are receiving today. \nFrankly, I cannot believe that we would adjourn for the August recess \nwithout addressing the energy crisis--this program, speculation, and \nmuch more. The American people do deserve to have a comprehensive \napproach. They do deserve to have their elected officials stay here as \nlong as it takes, as much time as it requires for bold action that will \nbe so essential and can measure it with the problems we are facing in \nthis country today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to start off by saying how much I \nagree with my distinguished colleague from Maine. I think the LIHEAP \nprogram is one that is essential. There is a real possibility if we do \nnot deal with the LIHEAP program, fellow Americans across the landscape \nof this country will find themselves in the cold, literally and \nfiguratively, and they will be in such a situation where they will have \nto make desperate choices in their lives.\n  So this is something, among other things, on which we should be \nreaching across the aisle. As one Democratic Senator, I want the \nSenator from Maine to know that we are absolutely in agreement with \nher, and we believe this is essential to move forward.\n  I appreciate her comments about coming to common ground and common \ncause on those things on which, in fact, we can agree. There is much, \nat least from listening to the speeches on the Senate floor, that, in \nfact, we supposedly can agree on. We see there are elements of the \nRepublican package that deal with market speculation. That is the \nessence of the underlying bill we are debating. Let's come together on \nthat. Let's come together on the renewable energy tax credit extenders, \nsomething that we began, that existed, and we need to extend if we want \nto get the marketplace not depending on oil, whether it be foreign or \ndomestic. Let's agree on that. That is apparently something we can \nagree on from speeches I heard. We should come together in that \nrespect.\n  I heard conservation about using less. We agree on that issue. Let's \ncome together on that. I agree with the Senator from Maine that while \nthere may be differences, there are a lot of elements together that we \ndo agree on, and if we can begin to move on those elements, maybe we \ncould come to a point in which we could move forward on other items as \nwell.\n  But why not allow those things that ultimately can make a difference \nin the short term and in the long term for our collective constituents? \nWhen you are cold, it doesn't have a Republican or Democratic label to \nit. When you\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\nhave to make a choice between a gallon of gas or putting a gallon of \nmilk on the table, it doesn't have a Democratic or Republican label on \nit.\n  I agree with the Senator from Maine. I am glad to have been on the \nfloor to listen to her. She is a voice of reason, and I appreciate \nwhere she stands on these issues, and I agree with her. Hopefully, we \ncan move in that direction.\n\n\n                            Coastal Drilling\n\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor various times over the last \ncouple of weeks to discuss opening our coastline to drilling. This is \npart of one of the marvelous beaches in New Jersey. You have to get off \nthe New Jersey Turnpike to understand.\n  I had some colleagues say: Why are you so fixated on this drilling \nissue? Isn't your State one big refining place? They obviously never \ngot off the New Jersey Turnpike.\n  If you get off the New Jersey Turnpike, you will see one of the most \nincredible parts of the United States coastline where not only millions \nof New Jerseyans go, which they consider a birthright, but people from \nthroughout the region. Canadians come down and contribute to our \neconomy because they want to go to the New Jersey shore.\n  The Presiding Officer, the distinguished senior Senator from Florida, \nunderstands what that Florida coastline means to his State and his \neconomy. That is why he has been such a vigorous voice on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Ever since I have been having to come down to the floor, ever since \nwe have had these two oilmen in the White House, the Presidential \ncandidate they support, and many on the other side of the aisle--not \nall but many on the other side of the aisle--have begun a very hard \nsell to the American people over an absurd notion that opening our \ncoastlines to drilling will ever lower gas prices. They have grabbed on \nto a source of fear and frustration among American families, and there \nis no question that there is frustration and pain for our American \nfamilies. But they are using that frustration and pain to pull a fast \none on the American people.\n  Exploitation of pain at the pump to grab more land to build up stock \nprices, that is what this is all about. They are using it to sell a \nplan that in reality will bring absolutely zero relief to Americans but \ninstead represents one last great big handout to oil companies that are \nalready making astronomically staggering profits.\n  We just saw the beginning of that parade with ConocoPhillips, an \nincredible increase in profits. On one hand, you have American families \nwho are getting absolutely slammed by high gas prices. On the other \nhand, you have oil companies counting their money, sitting on 68 \nmillion acres of public land that are not being put to use and focusing \nway more on taking that money and using it on stock buybacks that \nultimately drive up the value of their shares than exploration or \ninnovation.\n  It is not because I say that. Listen to what the President of the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute said when he was asked: Why can't you \ncreate more production?\n  He said: We don't have the infrastructure and the rigs and the drills \nand all the pipeline and everything that is necessary to create more \nproduction. He didn't say why. One of the reasons is they haven't been \ninvesting the money to do that.\n  So all the suggestions to lift the moratoria and tomorrow out sprouts \noil and, therefore, gasoline and prices plunge is simply not true. They \ncannot even pursue the 68 million acres, the extra area in the gulf, \nthe extra area off the Outer Continental Shelf in Alaska that is not \nsubject to any moratoria right now. They cannot even do that and \nhaven't done it. What an incredible falsehood perpetuated on the \nAmerican people. But I believe the American people know better.\n\n  If we listen to these proposals, you would think--I have seen some of \nmy colleagues shake the legislation and say: There is no oil in here. \nGuess what. There is no oil in their proposals either. That is really \nlaughable.\n  Who do our colleagues on the other side of the aisle choose to help? \nThe oil companies have more money than the eye can see, and you don't \neven hear them talk about the oil companies. They never invoke their \nname unless it is to say: Oh, we need to give them more. We need to do \nmore for them. We need to do everything for them. The average American \nwishes they were in the role of the oil companies--record profits, huge \namounts of money. Let's give them more. Let's give them more.\n  We never hear from our Republican friends talking about the oil \ncompanies having any responsibility--I am not saying the \nresponsibility, any responsibility--for some of our lack of production. \nI have just heard one too many speeches that are apologies for the oil \ncompanies. Multibillion profits--I am not going to be an apologist for \nthe oil companies.\n  As we try to pass legislation to crack down on greedy oil speculation \nwhich could lower gas prices quicker than anything, they just say no, \neven though they include it as part of their proposals.\n  Back at home, people who are hearing these debates say: They keep \ntalking about speculation. I know what speculation generally means.\n  What does it mean in the context to the average person? What it means \nis traders buy huge quantities of oil online, many times intentionally \ninflating prices. They then turn around and sell those very orders to \nother traders at even higher prices. These traders never intend to use \nthe oil. This is not a purchase of oil because they are going to \nultimately use it in distribution in the country and make sure people \nhave, for example, home heating oil or they are going to refine it and \nhave gasoline. No, they use these constant trades bidding up the price \nso they can ultimately cash in.\n  But who gets stuck with the bill every time we have to pay to fill \nour tanks and heat our homes? It is the American consumer.\n  We Democrats want to do something about it. For those who keep \nsaying--even though it is part of their plan--oh, no, this is really \nnot a problem, let me read to you from an article that appeared today, \nJuly 25, in the New York Times:\n\n       Firm said to manipulate oil market. Commodity regulators in \n     Washington have accused a Dutch trading company of making \n     roughly a million dollars in illegal profits by manipulating \n     the prices of crude oil, heating oil--\n\n  What we are going to be using this winter--\n\n     and gasoline--\n\n  Over what period of time?\n\n     over an 11 day period of time.\n\n  One million dollars in 11 days in illegal profits. Oh, it is not a \nproblem; speculation is not a problem.\n\n       In audio tapes uncovered in their investigation, regulators \n     said one defendant described the scheme as an effort to \n     ``bully the market''--\n\n  Bully the market--\n\n     by making a large number of trades at or near the end of the \n     trading day to move closing prices.\n\n  But this is a marketplace that cannot be bullied. Therefore, we don't \nneed to do anything about the speculative nature and unbridled \nspeculation. Well, guess what. One million dollars in 11 days, with \ntheir own voices saying that this is an effort to ``bully the market.'' \nMoreover, unlike many manipulation cases, this one accuses the \ndefendants of actually succeeding in moving prices that were used as \nbenchmarks for consumer markets--actually moving the benchmarks that \nare used for consumer markets, in essence, saying not only is it our \nintention to bully the market, but the regulators are saying yes, and \nthey did bully the markets. They did bully the markets.\n\n  Now, the complaint that was filed in the Federal District Court in \nManhattan says at least two of those attempts resulted in, guess what, \nhigher prices for gasoline and crude oil. But our Republican friends \nsay: Oh, no, market manipulation and speculation isn't a problem. But \nhere is only one example, and this has been a reluctant regulator to \npursue this. When they have heard the speeches on the floor and they \nhave heard this going on for some time now, all of a sudden we grab one \nof these companies, 11 days, $1 million, bullying the market and doing \nit successfully.\n  That is why we need the legislation Senator Reid and the Democratic \nmajority brought to the floor and that others only talk about, saying \nit is part of our package. Well, join us. Join us before more market \nspeculation takes place.\n\n[[Page S7263]]\n\n  What are Democrats trying to do about it? We are trying to add 100 \nnew cops on the beat to the commission that oversees these traders. We \nare trying to create greater transparency, for the first time \nrequiring--for the first time--detailed reporting of previously \nundisclosed trades. And oversight--stopping speculators from inflating \noil prices by playing domestic and foreign markets off of each other.\n  We had testimony before the Congress, sworn testimony, as a matter of \nfact--and it is not often we have sworn testimony--from oil company \nexecutives. They were challenged as to why we are having these high \nprices. You tell us, in fact, it is the demand and the supply side. We \nsaid we have heard a lot of talk about supply and demand, and that \nlargely over the last 2 years they have traced each other pretty \nclosely together. Well then, what is the issue? And what is their \nresponse, these very oil company executives? Their response is: market \nspeculation. But no, we don't have to go after that. It is not one of \nthe most important issues, something that can be done now. So they say \nno.\n  I have to hand it to my colleagues for their political talent, to \ntake an issue so vital to the daily lives of Americans and convince \nthem they want to do something about it with a proposal that is more \nabout oil company stock prices than gas prices. That is quite a feat, \nif you can pull it off. That is talent. But here is the problem. The \nfacts always come out, and the facts ultimately always win.\n  It has been tremendously important to me, as a Senator from New \nJersey, to come down here and give the facts about coastline drilling. \nIt is not just the facts about drilling and gas prices, although that \nis how they initially make their plan popular, it is also the facts \nabout oil spills, which they say are virtually impossible with today's \ndrilling technology, virtually impossible.\n  That is exactly what they told us about the tanker industry that \ncarries the oil. We don't have any rigs that I know of in the country, \nalong the coastal waters of the United States, where there is drilling, \nthat either don't have a pipeline system or don't ultimately have a \nvessel. And we were told: Don't worry about our tanker system. In fact, \nit is impossible to have any spills.\n  This is what happened with that impossibility. Workers there are \ncleaning up after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound--a \nlot of oil there, obviously, a huge disaster. So if we could say that, \nand if it were true, that would surely be nice for the eastern and \nwestern coastlines of the United States. If it were true, in fact, that \nit is virtually impossible to have no spills, that surely would be nice \nfor the $200 billion that our coasts generate each and every year in \nfishing and tourism revenues--$200 billion. And it surely would be nice \nif it were true for my home State of New Jersey and the millions of \npeople who end up on the Jersey shore each summer and the half a \nmillion jobs in the State of New Jersey supported by the economy there \nbetween recreation, tourism, and the commercial and recreational \nfishermen.\n  It surely would be nice if an oil spill off the coast of Virginia \ndidn't have the potential to affect the coastline from South Carolina \nup to New York. That surely would be nice, if it were true. But the \nfacts always come out, and at the end of the day, the facts always win.\n  Earlier this month, the distinguished minority leader made this \nstatement, echoed by several of his colleagues as part of their hard \nsell to the American people: ``Not a drop of oil was spilled during \nKatrina.'' Not a drop of oil. Well, that surely would be nice, if it \nwere true. But the fact is, we can see here from this U.S. Coast Guard \nphoto that was published in the Washington Post on July 14 of 2008 what \nwas happening with this spill and how they were trying to burn the \nspill up in order to try to deal with the disaster. Oh, but not a drop \nof oil was spilled during Katrina. I guess this picture must be a \nfabrication of the Coast Guard.\n  Last month Senator McCain said: ``Not even Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita could cause significant spillage.'' Well, the same picture from \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. That surely would be nice, if it were true. Last \ntime I checked, 7.7 million gallons of oil is pretty significant, \npretty significant.\n  And then in the last 24 hours, there was a stroke of poetic justice. \nSenator McCain was ready to fly out to an oil platform in the Gulf of \nMexico to stage a photo opportunity. He was ready to show how safe it \nis to drill for and transport oil these days. Nothing to worry about. \nUnfortunately, he should have known better, because the facts always \ncome out, and the facts always win. Just as he was set to do this \nyesterday, there was an accident on the Mississippi near New Orleans in \nwhich a freighter rammed a barge and spilled 419,000 gallons of fuel \noil. Next thing you know, the McCain photo-op was postponed. It seems \nthey realized it is hard to make the case that oil drilling and oil \ntransportation is completely safe when there are 419,000 gallons of oil \nfloating around and washing up on the shore nearby.\n  Of course, now his representatives are saying it was postponed \nbecause of the hurricane that hit the southern tip of Texas yesterday \nthat this event was cancelled. I thought: Well, that might be a \nlegitimate reason. But then I checked the National Weather Service \nforecast. And what did the National Weather Service's detailed forecast \nsay, which I have right here--satellite images?\n  The National Weather Service made the following forecast today for \nthe Louisiana gulf coast: Partly cloudy. Scattered thunderstorms, \nmainly in the afternoon. Highs in the lower 90s. Southeast winds 5 to \n10 miles per hour. Chance of thunderstorms, 30 percent.\n  I think the Presiding Officer has a pretty good sense that this is \npretty tame weather conditions for this time of the year--certainly not \nhurricane weather.\n  So if you look up ``irony'' in the dictionary, I think you will find \npossibly that it might describe cancelling an oil drilling photo-op \nbecause a massive nearby oil spill took place. Having to cancel your \nbig oil drilling photo-op because of a massive oil spill is like \ncancelling a crime safety photo-op because the house next door got \nrobbed. In selling this absurd coastline drilling plan to the American \npeople, Senator McCain and others have time and time again pointed to \nadvanced technology that would supposedly eliminate the threat of \nmassive oil spills. Well, this is the oil fire after Katrina. As he can \nnow personally attest to, even with the most modern technology, we \ncan't prevent massive oil spills such as the one currently devastating \nthe Mississippi, just as we couldn't prevent a 7.7 million gallon oil \nspill after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. And that is the type of \nstraight talk we need about oil drilling and the type of talk the \nAmerican people need to hear and that they deserve.\n  As to the claim that coastline drilling will lower gas prices, we \nknow it simply won't. That is clear when we realize there are millions \nof acres already subject to oil exploration that aren't being pursued. \nIn fact, the American Petroleum Institute president says: Well, we \ndon't have the infrastructure and the rigs and the drills to pursue it. \nWe can't do that overnight.\n  We know we have reduced 800,000 barrels a day in demand because of \nhigh gas prices. The Saudis have produced 500,000 barrels a day in \nextra production--a 1.3 million barrel a day shift in barrels of oil--\nand yet gas prices have done what? They have gone up. We opened the \ngulf--181--and gas prices have gone up.\n  So if 1.3 million barrels in either reduced demand or increased \nproduction haven't done anything about gas prices, imagine the very \nlarge sum of 200,000 barrels in the year 2030 at this risk. If 1.3 \nmillion barrels can't do it, how does 200,000 do it, and yet accept \nthis risk? Accept this risk to this environment and to the $200 billion \nthat is generated by the coasts of the east and west.\n  And, by the way, that 200,000 would mean that every State would have \nto agree, assuming we would give States an option, and we have already \nheard the Governor of California say: No way. They are one of the \nbiggest parts of the coastline. I doubt you will get Oregon and \nWashington in that respect. We have heard some of their distinguished \ncolleagues say that is not going to happen. New Jersey won't do it. So \nby the\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\ntime you are finished, you are nowhere near even the 200,000.\n  Now, what is it we can do? Well, I agree with the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, who said: Let's do what is possible \nand what we agree to. And what is possible and what we agree to is very \nsignificant.\n  The Republicans say they are for a renewable energy source, and are \nproviding the tax credits that existed and expired and should be \nbrought back to life. They say they are for that. Well, they have said \n``no'' twice, though. Twice we have brought that forward, and twice \nthey have said ``no.''\n  The fact is that passing the tax credit extenders would create the \nincentives that are necessary to move us in a direction in which oil is \nnot the issue, and risking the coastlines and the $200 billion economy \nis not the issue, and where we could do things in a tighter timeframe \nand better timeframe than the year 2030. That would move us toward \nrenewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, biomass, and cellulosic \nethanol, plug-in hybrids, which are critical. All of these things would \nmove us in a direction long before 2030, which is when all of this \nproduction would take place, if it takes place.\n  We supposedly agree on moving forward on that, but our Republican \nfriends have said ``no'' twice. Republicans say that speculation is \npart of their package. I talked about that earlier. We saw already one \ncompany being pursued--$1 million, 11 days, bullying the market and \nsucceeding in doing it. Well, it is time to move on speculation. Yet \nthat is the very essence of the underlying bill. We can't seem to get \nthem to agree on that. Most of the speeches I have been hearing is that \nthey pooh-pooh speculation. When it made a difference in oil and gas \nprices, as that case suggests, I would simply say that is certainly not \nanything to be pooh-poohed. It is real and it is consequential, and \neven the testimony of the oil company executives says it could produce \nanywhere up to $50 per barrel more.\n\n  Republicans say that conservation is part of their package. We agree. \nSo why not join us in that respect as well, with the conservation \nproposals we have put forward?\n  There are three very significant areas: renewable energy tax credits, \nspeculation, conservation. Let's move forward. But instead, what we \nhave is a series of noes. Then we have 18 amendments filed by \nRepublicans, all to do what? To open the coastline of our country, \nwhich, as I have already discussed, will not achieve anything. But do \nyou need 18 different amendments even to pursue what you think is an \nappropriate energy policy to open the coastline to drilling, to risk \nthe consequences of this? OK, the majority leader said: Go ahead, we \nwill give you an amendment. But you cannot take yes for an answer. We \nhave to have 18 different amendments to do virtually the same thing.\n  You can repeat a big lie over and over. We have seen that in the \nhistory of the world, that you can take something that is not quite \ntrue, repeat it over and over, and try to give it the life it otherwise \ndoes not deserve--try to make it true. But saying it over and over \ndoesn't make it true, saying over and over that drilling is the \npanacea, the solution to bring down gas prices.\n  The way I hear it, I hear: Pass the legislation, have the President \nsign it, tomorrow oil sprouts up, gas gets made, prices go down. I give \na lot more credit to the American people than that.\n  The truth, crushed down to the floor, springs back up. The truth is \nthat, in fact, we have the wherewithal to move our country in a much \ndifferent direction. It is the can-do spirit of America. It is the \npioneer spirit of America. It is the spirit that gets going--the tough \nget going when the going gets tough. That is the spirit we have. That \nis the spirit we should pursue. That is the renewable energy from tax \ncredits. That is the conservation. That is stopping the speculation in \nthe marketplace. That is ensuring that, in fact, we move to necessary \nrenewable energy sources. That makes for a great America, a new \neconomy--and do something about global warming all at the same time \nthat we deal with the challenges of gas prices in the short term and \nliberate ourselves in the long term. That is what the debate is all \nabout.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator has given an excellent exposition \nand debunking of a number of these myths. As to his recitation \ndebunking the statements made by a number of Senators on this floor \nthat there was no oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane \nKatrina and Hurricane Rita, I want to ask the Senator whether he had \nseen this particular report from the White House, ``The Federal \nResponse to Hurricane Katrina, Lessons Learned,'' February of 2006, \nafter Katrina, in August of 2005.\n  I want to find out whether the Senator had seen this report:\n\n       In fact, Hurricane Katrina caused at least 10 oil spills \n     releasing the same quantity of oil as some of the worst oil \n     spills in U.S. history. Louisiana reported at least six major \n     spills of over 100,000 gallons and four medium spills of over \n     10,000 gallons. All told, more than 7.4 million gallons \n     poured into the Gulf Coast region's waterways, over two-\n     thirds of the amount that spilled out during America's worst \n     oil disaster, the rupturing of the Exxon Valdez tanker off \n     the Alaskan coast in 1989.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the very report on Katrina from the \nWhite House. Has the Senator seen that report?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I have. I appreciate the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida pointing it out. The words are powerful because there it is not \na Member of the Senate saying this, not a Democrat saying this. This is \nthe official report. I have used the pictures because a picture speaks \nbetter than a thousand words, and you cannot deny it as you cannot deny \nthe report. The fact is that we had massive oilspills after Katrina and \nRita.\n  This is a Coast Guard picture. That is the reality. The fact is, we \nwere told we have the most highly technologically advanced--it is \nimpossible to have any spills as a result of tankers.\n  The Exxon Valdez.\n  It simply is not true to suggest that there was not. How is it that \nit has been quoted here--\n\n       Not even Hurricanes Katrina and Rita could cause \n     significant spillage . . .\n\n  At least that says ``significant spillage.''\n\n       Not a drop of oil was spilled during Katrina . . .\n\n  It is pretty tough to say that not a drop of oil was spilled during \nKatrina. This is why we have to be so cautious about risking the \ncoastlines, the economy, the environment, when it will not produce a \ndrop of oil for over a decade, it will not do anything about gas prices \nnow or in the future, but can create an enormous consequence.\n  We need to be honest with the American people, and I hope this \nopportunity to get to the floor and talk about some of the facts and \nshow some of the photos from the Coast Guard will make it very clear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is an unusual day in the Senate. I \nhave been in this body for a while. I have never seen the floor so \ncrowded. I have sought, since early morning, to find a little floor \ntime and have waited more than an hour at the present time, past the \ntime I was scheduled to speak. I am glad to listen.\n  I am beginning, on my consideration of the pending legislation, the \nenergy speculation bill, to note what is happening on the Senate floor. \nThere has been a lot of talk, a lot of talk in the Senate for the last \n4 days, and really no action--only one vote on Tuesday morning on a \nprocedural matter to invoke cloture to proceed to the consideration of \nthe bill. What has happened? We have been talking a great deal but not \nconsidering anything which would advance an energy policy for the \nUnited States.\n  We are engaged in a process which is a little difficult to \nunderstand, but I think it is important for the American people to know \nwhat is happening. A procedure has been utilized recently--the past \ncouple of decades--where the majority leader exercises his rights as \nleader to take a procedural step which precludes anybody from offering \namendments to the bill.\n  This is an opportunity. The Senate Chamber is empty, which it is \nfrequently, certainly past 7 o'clock on a Thursday evening, but it is \nvery hard\n\n[[Page S7265]]\n\nto convey this information so that people would understand why no \naction is being taken in the Senate. There is no doubt that it is a do-\nnothing Senate and has been for some time as a result of political \ngridlock. That is why the ratings of the Senate have plummeted.\n  We have a situation which really started to percolate back in 1992, \nand it has been a practice of both Democrats and Republicans. \nCustomarily--really invariably--when there is political blame in this \nbody, it is attributable to both political parties. You can divide it \nright down the center aisle, and it is evenly split. But this procedure \nto preclude amendments is of fairly recent origin.\n  In the 101st Congress of 1989 to 1990, where Senator Mitchell was the \nleader, he did not use this procedure on any occasion. But by the 103rd \nCongress, 1993 to 1994, Senator Mitchell employed it on nine occasions. \nThen it was picked up in the Republican tenure of Senator Lott in the \n106th Congress, in 1999 to 2000, when Senator Lott used it nine times. \nThen, in the 109th Congress, 2005 to 2006, Senator Frist, the majority \nleader, used it nine times. In this Congress, the 110th, 2007 and \npartly through 2008, Senator Reid has used it 13 times.\n  What does this mean so that it can be understood by the American \npeople who have such a vital interest in having the Senate function? \nLet me illustrate it with a bill on climate change which was called up \nin June of this year.\n  As soon as the bill was called up, Senator Reid exercised his rights \nas leader to get first recognition. In the Senate, Senators are \nrecognized in terms of who first seeks recognition, but in case of a \ntie it goes to the leader. He then offers an amendment and then another \namendment so that procedurally no other of the 99 Senators can offer \nany amendment.\n  The global warming bill was a very important bill. There has been a \ndemand to deal with this issue which poses great threats to our \nenvironment. There was legislation pending, legislation which Senator \nBingaman and I had introduced, the Bingaman-Specter bill, legislation \nintroduced by Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner on a very complex \nsubject.\n  Early in the week of June 2, I came to the floor and spoke about some \namendments which I wanted to offer. I wanted to offer an amendment on \nemission caps. I wanted to offer another amendment on cost-containment \nsafety valve--a price cap. I wanted to offer a third amendment on \nenergy-intensive manufacturing competitiveness and a fourth amendment \non steel process gas emissions. Of course, that was only one Senator, \nat the beginning of what I wanted to have considered. But I was \nforeclosed from offering any of those amendments by the procedure which \nSenator Reid used to fill the tree.\n  Then Senator Reid moved for what is called cloture; that means to cut \noff debate in order to proceed to final passage of the bill.\n  I wanted to consider the global warming issue, but I certainly was \nnot about to agree to cutting off debate and proceeding to final \npassage before I or others had had an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Now, what happens as a result? The result is that Republicans \ncomplain about what Senator Reid has done on precluding amendments, and \nSenator Reid complains about it being another Republican filibuster in \nresponse to the Republican's inability to offer amendments.\n  So there is finger-pointing. That is what we are really good at these \ndays. And the American people do not understand anything except that \nnothing is being done. Now, we have had consideration this week on a \nbill called the energy speculation bill. We all wonder why the cost of \noil has gone through the roof, causing gasoline prices of more than $4 \na gallon.\n  There is no doubt about the anguish and difficulties that the \nAmerican people are suffering as a result of these costs, of these \nprices. And there is concern about the speculators who may be involved. \nMaybe they are. There are some indicators that part of the problem is \ncaused by speculation.\n  Well, we haven't dealt with the issue in a logical, factual way; that \nis, for Senators to come to the floor and address the substance of the \nbill which is pending or offer amendments to modify the bill which is \npending.\n  Now, Senator Reid, the majority leader, has followed the same course \nof action. He has filed cloture. We are going to have a cloture vote \ntomorrow. It takes 60 votes for cloture to cut off debate. It will not \nhappen. When the motion for cloture fails, Senator Reid is going to go \nto his podium over there, and he is going to blast the Republicans for \nshutting down the bill at a time when the American people need relief, \nat a time when the American people need a decision as to what the \nspeculators are doing.\n  I want to offer an amendment on bringing OPEC within our antitrust \nlaws; something that I have been pushing for years. Right now, the OPEC \ncombine has an exemption under our antitrust laws. The OPEC nations get \ninto a room, they decide how much the production is going to be, they \nlimit supply, and the price of oil goes up.\n  They have what is called sovereign immunity. Well, they ought not to \nhave it. The Congress of the United States has the authority to change \nthat. We can bring them within our antitrust laws so that the Attorney \nGeneral can take action against them.\n  They are subject to jurisdiction in the United States because they do \nbusiness here, and they have a lot of assets here. If we brought OPEC \nwithin our antitrust laws, you would see a change in their policy. They \nhave argued for a long time--Saudi Arabia--that they cannot have any \ngreater production. But about a month ago, when there were some signs \nof change in our consumption of oil, some fear that their preeminent \nposition in their monopoly was in some jeopardy, somehow they increased \ntheir production.\n  If they increase their production, if the supply goes up, prices will \ncome down--the inexorable law of supply and demand, one of the few laws \nthat works.\n  So here we are, with an enormously serious problem with what is \nhappening with the issue of oil prices and gasoline prices, and here we \nhave a bill on the floor which addresses an issue of grave concern to \nthe American people, and my hands are tied. My hands are tied with 99 \nother Senators because procedurally we are blocked.\n  Then the next move is going to be to invoke cloture. It is not going \nto be invoked. Debate is not going to be cut off; 60 votes will not be \nreceived. Then the majority leader will remove the bill from the floor, \nand he is going to blame Republicans for obstructing, and the American \npeople are not going to have any opportunity to understand what went \non, except for the few who were watching on C-SPAN.\n  I made this speech during the consideration of the global warming \nbill. There was not a word in the newspapers about it. Why? Well, it is \ntoo complicated. It is too arcane. It is too ``inside the beltway.'' \nBut until the American people understand it and send a message to \nWashington that they are not going to tolerate it, we are going to have \nto continue to have this gridlock.\n  When the shoe was on the other foot and Republicans controlled the \nSenate, during the time when Senator Frist was the majority leader, he \ninvoked this procedure on nine occasions. Senator Reid and the \nDemocrats were very unhappy about it, as well as Senator Durbin and \nSenator Dodd.\n  This is what Senator Dodd had to say about it:\n\n       This chamber historically is the place where debate occurs.\n\n  And what Senator Dodd is referring to is that the Senate, unlike the \nHouse of Representatives, Senators have been able to offer any \namendment on any subject at any time. And that is one of the great \nbeauties about the Senate because any one of us can bring up an issue \nand call the attention of the American people to it, and with \nsufficient public backing, sufficient newspaper coverage, radio, TV, a \nlittle broader than C-SPAN2, there can be some action. But that has \nbeen foreclosed.\n  Senator Dodd was very emphatic about it back on May 11, 2006, when \nthe Republican leader, Senator First, had filled the tree. Senator Dodd \nhad this to say:\n\n       To basically lock out any amendments that might be offered \n     to this proposal runs contrary to the very essence of this \n     body. When the amendment tree has been entirely filled--\n\n\n[[Page S7266]]\n\n\n  He called it filling the tree when the procedure is used--\n\n     when the amendment tree has been entirely filled, obviously \n     we are dealing with a process that ought not to be. The \n     Senate ought to be a place where we can offer amendments, \n     have healthy debate over a reasonable time, and then come \n     to closure on the subject matter.\n\n  Well, what did Senator Reid have to say about this subject on March \n2, 2006, when we were debating the PATRIOT Act? Senator Reid said:\n\n       Do not fill the tree. That is a bad way, in my opinion, to \n     run this Senate.\n\n  What did Senator Reid have to say about the subject on February 28, \n2006, on the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, speaking about filling the \ntree.\n\n       This is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic \n     nature of the Senate. The hallmark of the Senate is free \n     speech and open debate.\n\n  What did Senator Durbin have to say about it, the assistant majority \nleader for the Democrats, on May 11, 2006, when the Republican majority \nleader had filled the tree and precluded amendments?\n\n       The Republican majority brings a bill to the Senate, fills \n     the tree so no amendments can be offered, and then files \n     cloture which stops debate; we cannot offer amendments.\n\n  So Senator Durbin outlines it as I did: The Republican majority \nleader fills the tree and then files cloture. Well, cloture was not \nadopted, and then these important issues are not considered and the \nAmerican people wonder what is going on.\n  Well, I have taken a little longer to explain the subject, but it is \nvery hard to get it across. I am going to keep trying. I have acted \nwithin the Senate to try to get the rule changed. A year and a half \nago, I filed a rule amendment to try to get the rule changed. On \nFebruary 15, 2007, I introduced S. Res. 83, and so far, I have not been \nable to get an answer from the chairman of the Rules Committee about \nwhat action she intends to take.\n  I might say to my colleague from Washington that I have been waiting \nan hour. I have limited time. But I am always a little wary when I see \na colleague waiting. But there are some other subjects I want to talk \nabout, so I want to give you some advance notice.\n  May the record show that Senator Murray has graciously given me a \nhand signal, sort of like the Patriots used in the Jets game, a hand \nsignal, understanding that I am going to talk a little more. I will try \nto be brief, but there are some subjects I do want to address.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  I am very encouraged by what the administration has done as noted in \nthe Washington Post within the past few days. The President has sent \nhis first high-level emissary to sit down with Iran and has agreed for \nthe first time to set a time horizon for withdrawing troops from Iraq \nand has authorized the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to join \nthe North Korean diplomats at the Six Party talks about ending that \ncountry's nuclear weapons program.\n  I would urge the President, in the course of these talks, to exercise \nflexibility in the dealings with Iran. There is no doubt that on the \ninternational scene the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon \nis the most serious international threat there is in the world today. \nNo doubt about that. It is intolerable for Iran to have a nuclear \nweapon when its President talks about wiping Israel off the face of the \nEarth. And when Iran flouts international law by supporting \ninternational terrorists, no doubt about the threat that would pose.\n  It has been my urging of the administration that the United States \nnot impose a precondition on the talks. The object of the talks is to \nstop Iran from continuing to process nuclear weapons and to abandon \ntheir effort to get nuclear weapons. They should stop their activities \non processing uranium.\n  It seems to me where the object of the talks is to stop Iran from \nprocessing nuclear materials, that ought not to be a precondition of \nthe talks. It is very difficult to go to a sovereign nation, it seems \nto me, and say: Before we begin the talks, we want you to have a freeze \non processing nuclear materials, which is the object of our talks.\n  We have to approach anybody in any situation with a certain amount of \ndignity, with a certain amount of understanding about the other \nperson's position, if we are to find some way to solve the problem. The \nadministration talks about a freeze for freeze, but the freezes are \nvery different. The freeze demanded by Iran is for them to stop a \nprocess which they have been engaged in, which they have asserted they \nhave a right to as a sovereign nation. We don't like what they are \ndoing. If they become a sufficient threat under the U.N. charter, \narticle 51, there are circumstances where the threat is sufficiently \nimminent to take preemptive action. We all hope we never get to that \nstage. But until you have that situation, they are a sovereign nation, \nand they are engaging in activities which sovereign nations do.\n  The freeze we are offering is a freeze to not impose sanctions to \ntake negative action against Iran. It is the projection of the six \npowers, led by the United States, that we have suggestions to make to \nIran on a package of economic, political, a variety of incentives to \nstop Iran from processing nuclear material. It seems to me the best way \nto get on with it is to start to discuss with Iran what we have to \noffer specifically, to see if what we have to offer will be sufficient \non the talks or to engage in the discussions and in the negotiations. \nWe do know that notwithstanding the grave difficulties in dealing with \nNorth Korea, that when the United States was willing to engage in \nbilateral talks with North Korea, we made some progress. We thought the \nNorth Korean leadership was impossible, but we were able to work \nthrough it.\n  Similarly, in dealing with Libya and Qadhafi, we were able to work \nout an arrangement where Libya, Qadhafi, stopped the development of \nnuclear weapons. Qadhafi is the greatest terrorist in the history of \nthe world; with very heavy competition, the greatest terrorist in the \nhistory of the world. He blew up Pan Am 103. It was proved that he did \nit. He made reparations to the passengers. He blew up a discotheque in \nGermany, killed American soldiers. Yet through discussions, through \ntalks, he has been brought back into the so-called family of nations. \nLibya has a seat on the Security Council. It is hard for me, frankly, \nto understand how we have gone that far with Libya, but that goes to \nshow how far we can go.\n  As these talks proceed, it would be my hope the United States would \nshow flexibility. When the Secretary of State talks about their having \n2 weeks to respond, I don't think that is the way negotiators deal in \nputting on time limits. Iran responded, apparently, according to the \nmedia reports, with a long written statement which was not \nunderstandable. But they have quite a number of points which they want \nto make. I have had the opportunity, and have discussed this on the \nSenate floor at some length, of having a number of discussions with the \ncurrent Iranian Ambassador to the U.N. and the previous two \nAmbassadors. There are people from Iran whom you can talk to in a \nsensible way. But a demand on a precondition that they stop processing \nnuclear material, which is the object of the talks, seems to me to be \ntotally counterproductive.\n  I have raised these issues at some considerable length over the \ncourse of the past year and a half, going back to an appropriations \nhearing on February 27, 2007, when Secretary of State Rice was before \nthe committee, posing the issue with her as to why the precondition. I \nhad an extensive discussion with her, similarly, with Secretary of \nDefense Gates, in hearings before the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. It is worth noting that when Secretary of \nDefense Gates was on the Commission evaluating United States-Iranian \nrelations, he was a party to recommending discussions with Iran. These \ndiscussions, these lines of questioning and responses are lengthy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Statement of Senator Arlen Specter, U.S.-Iranian Relations\n\n       Mr. President. I have sought recognition to compliment \n     President Bush and Secretary Rice on their initiative to \n     dispatch Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs \n     William Burns to meet directly with Iranian officials this \n     past weekend in Geneva, Switzerland.\n       On Saturday, July 19, Secretary Burns joined \n     representatives of Russia, China, the\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\n     United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union in \n     negotiations with Iran's chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, over \n     Iran's nuclear program. This was one of the highest level \n     meetings between a representative of the U.S. and Iran since \n     the American Embassy was seized in Tehran in 1979, and \n     represents the highest level of American engagement with \n     Tehran during the Bush administration's tenure.\n       The meeting followed a June 12, 2008 letter from Secretary \n     Rice, European Union foreign minister Javier Solana, and the \n     foreign ministers of China, France, Germany, Russia, and the \n     United Kingdom to Iranian Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki \n     outlining a new set of incentives to encourage Iran to stop \n     enriching uranium. The letter proposed that the six world \n     powers ``will refrain from any new action in the Security \n     Council,'' while Iran ``will refrain from any new nuclear \n     activity, including the installation of any new \n     centrifuges.'' The formula was called ``freeze-for-freeze.'' \n     The letter and accompanying proposal was notable in that it \n     concentrated on incentives rather than proposing new punitive \n     measures.\n       I spoke with Secretary Burns this week who briefed me on \n     the meeting. While I will not detail our conversation, I \n     commended Secretary Burns for his efforts.\n       The Administration has long held they would not sit down \n     with the Iranians prior to them agreeing to suspend their \n     nuclear activities. The meeting this weekend at Geneva's City \n     Hall represents a welcomed flexibility in that policy--a \n     flexibility I strongly support and hope will continue.\n       I have consistently, both publically and privately, urged \n     President Bush, Secretary Rice and Secretary Gates, for the \n     U.S. to have direct talks with the Iranians without \n     preconditions.\n       During the May 20, 2008 hearing before the Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee, I made the following statement: \n     ``I would like to focus on the future and most specifically \n     on Iran and on the critical issue of talks with Iran and \n     whether talking with Iran is really feasible. We have seen \n     our talks with North Korea bear fruition. We have seen the \n     talks with Libya--Qadhafi--bear fruition. Qadhafi, arguably \n     the worst terrorist in the history of the world in a very \n     tough competition with Pan Am 103 and the bombing of the \n     Berlin discotheque, and yet he has given up his nuclear \n     weapons.'' I further stated, ``We have seen the president's \n     comment about appeasement of terrorists, but if we do not \n     have dialogue with Iran, at least in one man's opinion, we're \n     missing a great opportunity to avoid a future conflict.''\n       This hearing afforded me the opportunity to engage \n     Secretary Gates on the matter. It is important to note that \n     Secretary Gates, prior to his tenure at the Department of \n     Defense, co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations task force \n     which concluded, ``it is in the interests of the United \n     States to engage selectively with Iran to promote regional \n     stability, dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, \n     preserve reliable energy supplies, reduce the threat of \n     terror, and address the `democracy deficit' that pervades the \n     Middle East as a whole.'' When asked about dialogue and Iran \n     in a questionnaire submitted by members of the Armed Services \n     Committee, Secretary Gates responded that, ``no option that \n     could potentially benefit U.S. policy should be off the \n     table'' and noted that ``in the worst days of the cold war \n     the U.S. maintained a dialogue with the Soviet Union and \n     China.''\n       Picking up on Secretary Gates' comments about the Soviet \n     Union, I discussed the applicability to Iran:\n       ``Secretary Gates, we have seen that President Reagan \n     identified the Soviet Union as the `evil empire' and shortly \n     thereafter engaged in direct bilateral negotiations and very, \n     very successfully. As noted before, we have seen President \n     Bush authorize bilateral talks with North Korea, as well as \n     multilateral talks, which produced results. As noted with \n     Libya, on Gadhafi, the talks have produced very positive \n     results. I note that there have been three rounds of \n     bilateral talks where United States Ambassador Crocker has \n     had direct contact with Iranian Ambassador Qomi. So we are \n     not really saying, in practice, that we will not talk to \n     them. The question is to what extent will we talk? I'm very \n     much encouraged, Mr. Secretary, by the statement you made on \n     May 14th of this year that, ``We need to figure out a way to \n     develop some leverage and then sit down and talk with \n     them. If there is to be a discussion then they need \n     something too. We can't go to a discussion and be \n     completely the demander with them not feeling that they \n     need anything from us.''\n       Continuing with Secretary Gates, I said, ``Now the position \n     taken by the Secretary of State has been `we won't talk to \n     Iran unless, as a precondition, they stop enriching Uranium.' \n     It seems to me that it is unrealistic to try to have \n     discussions but to say to the opposite party, `as a \n     precondition to discussions we want the principal concession \n     that we're after.' Do you think it made sense to insist on a \n     concession like stopping enriching Uranium, which is what our \n     ultimate objective is, before we even sit down and talk to \n     them on a broader range of issues?''\n       I further questioned, ``Isn't it sensible to engage in \n     discussion with somebody to try to find out what it is they \n     are after? We sit apart from them and we speculate. We have \n     all of these learned op-ed pieces and speeches made and we're \n     searching for leverage. But wouldn't it make sense to talk to \n     the Iranians and try to find out what they need as at least \n     one step on the process? We only have one government to deal \n     with. Let me put it to you very bluntly, Mr. Secretary: is \n     President Bush correct when he says that it is appeasement to \n     talk to Iran?''\n       Secretary Gates responded, ``Well, I don't know--I don't \n     know exactly what the president said. I believe he said it \n     was appeasement to talk to terrorists, to negotiate with \n     terrorists . . .''\n       I interjected, ``He said in his May 15 address to the \n     members of the Knesset he said, `some seem to believe that we \n     should negotiate with terrorists and radicals.' He does not \n     say specifically Iran, but I think the inference is \n     unmistakable in light of the entire policy of the \n     administration.''\n       I concluded by telling Secretary Gates, ``I've had an \n     opportunity to talk to the President about it directly, and I \n     believe he needs to hear more from people like you than \n     people like me, but from both of us and that it's not \n     appeasement and that the analogy to Neville Chamberlain is \n     wrong. We've only got one government to deal with there, and \n     they were receptive in 2003. I've had a chance to talk to the \n     last three Iranian ambassadors to the U.N. and I think there \n     is an opportunity for dialogue. I think we have to be a \n     little courageous about it and take a chance because the \n     alternatives are very, very, very bleak.''\n       A month prior to my engagement with Secretary Gates, I \n     posed a similar question to Secretary Rice during the April \n     9, 2008 Foreign Operations Subcommittee hearing:\n       I told Secretary Rice, ``I want to visit with you a couple \n     of subjects that you and I have talked about extensively both \n     on and off the record, and that is the Iranian issue and \n     later the Syrian issue. We have talked about the initiative \n     of 2003, which has been confirmed by a number of people in \n     the administration, on Iran's effort to initiate bilateral \n     talks with the United States. And I have discussed this with \n     you urging you to do so. We all know that among the many \n     pressing problems the United States faces, none is more \n     important than our relation with Iran and the threat of Iran \n     getting a nuclear weapon. And the multilateral talks and the \n     sanctions in the United Nations are very, very important. But \n     I would again take up and urge the bilateral talks. You were \n     successful on the bilateral talks with North Korea in \n     structuring an agreement. There had to be multilateral talks \n     with China involved and Japan and South Korea and other \n     nations. But Madam Secretary, in the waning days of the \n     administration, in light of the intensity of the problems, \n     why not use the approach taken in North Korea and engage Iran \n     in bilateral talks to try to find some way of coming together \n     with them on the critical issue of their building a nuclear \n     weapon?''\n       Secretary Rice responded, ``Senator, I think we've made \n     clear that we don't have a problem with the idea of talking \n     to the Iranians. I said at one point in a recent speech that \n     we don't have any permanent enemies, so we don't--''\n       I told Secretary Rice I was referring to dialogue, ``but \n     without preconditions.''\n       Secretary Rice replied, ``But I think the problem of doing \n     this, and we do talk with North Korea bilaterally but, of \n     course, in the context of a six-party framework, and we have \n     a six-party framework really for Iran. The reason that the \n     precondition is there--and it's not just an American \n     precondition, it is one that the Europeans set well before we \n     entered this six-party arrangement some two years ago--it's \n     to not allow the Iranians to continue to improve their \n     capabilities while using negotiations as a cover. They have \n     only one thing to do, which is to suspend their enrichment \n     and reprocessing efforts, and then everybody will talk to \n     them. And I've been clear that we're prepared to talk to them \n     about anything, not just about their nuclear.''\n       I followed up with Secretary Rice, ``They don't need talks \n     to have a cover to proceed with whatever it is they're doing. \n     They're proceeding with that now. I've had some experience. I \n     haven't been secretary of State and I haven't been in the \n     State Department, but I've been on this committee--\n     subcommittee for 28 years and chaired the Intelligence \n     Committee, talked to many foreign leaders, and frankly, I \n     think it's insulting to go to another person or another \n     country and say we're not going to talk to you unless you \n     agree to something in advance. What we want them to do is \n     stop enriching uranium. That's the object of the talks. How \n     can we insist on their agreeing to the object that we want as \n     a precondition to having the talks?''\n       Secretary Rice replied, ``Well, Senator, we've not told \n     them that we--the talks would be in fact about how to get \n     Iran civil nuclear energy and a whole host of other trade and \n     political benefits, by the way, because the package that the \n     six parties have put forward is actually very favorable to \n     Iran. But they do need to stop--suspend until those talks can \n     begin and those talks can have some substance. They need to \n     stop doing what they're doing, because to allow them to just \n     continue to do it, to say well, we're in negotiations while \n     they continue to do it, I think sends the wrong signal to \n     them and frankly would erode our ability to continue the kind \n     of efforts at sanctions that we're also engaged in.''\n       On February 27, 2007, I questioned Secretary Rice when she \n     appeared before the Appropriations Committee. I stated that, \n     ``It would be my hope, as you know from our correspondence in \n     the past and our discussion, that there would be more intense \n     one\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\n     on one negotiations with the Iranians. . . . And the most \n     famous illustration is President Nixon going to China--used \n     really as an example. If that can be done, that's the way to \n     do it.'' While Undersecretary Burns' recent meeting is not of \n     the same magnitude, it still represents a step in the right \n     direction and perhaps is the initial building block or \n     stepping stone to enhanced bilateral discussions.\n       Perhaps one of the best opportunities to engage in serious \n     dialogue with Iran came during 2003. Press reports have \n     suggested the existence a document that was passed to the \n     United States through the Swiss Ambassador to Iran and later \n     rejected by the Administration. The document laid out issues \n     for the U.S. and Iran to discuss and parameters for dialogue.\n       Knowledge of the memorandum existed in the State Department \n     and the National Security Council. However, according to \n     Michael Hirsh of the Washington Post, the memorandum ``was \n     ignored.''\n       During my May 20, 2008 questioning of Secretary Gates, he \n     appeared to allude to the fact that the U.S. may have missed \n     an opportunity following the 2003 memorandum. I asked \n     Secretary Gates, ``Mr. Secretary, we had leverage in 2003 \n     when we were successful in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the \n     record is pretty clear that we wasted an opportunity to \n     respond to their initiatives.'' Secretary Gates stated, ``I \n     think it was one of the things [Khatami's tenure as \n     President] that created perhaps an opportunity that may or \n     may not have been lost in 2003 and 2004.''\n       While I believe it is clear that an opportunity to engage \n     Iran was lost in 2003, I agree with Secretary Gates that we \n     need to find ways to generate leverage in dealing with Iran \n     and need to continue to work on a resolution. One proposal \n     which I find promising is the Russian proposal to enrich \n     uranium for Iran's civil nuclear program. It would provide \n     Tehran with the nuclear power it claims is the sole intention \n     of its nuclear program, but would prevent Iran from turning \n     the lowly enriched uranium needed for civil nuclear reactors \n     to the highly enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons.\n       During the April 9, 2008 Foreign Operations Subcommittee \n     hearing I raised this issue with Secretary Rice, ``Let me \n     move to another subject, and that is President Putin's \n     proposal to have the Russians enrich their uranium. . . . To \n     what extent has the Putin proposal been pressed? In a sense, \n     if we join with Putin and they refuse what is really a good \n     offer to have somebody else enrich their uranium so they have \n     it for peaceful purposes, but there is a check on using it \n     for military purposes--why hasn't that worked?''\n       Secretary Rice responded, ``Well, we are fully supportive \n     of it, and the president just told President Putin that again \n     at Shchuchye, that he is fully supportive of the Russian \n     proposal. And in fact, not only did President Putin himself \n     put that proposal to the Iranians when he was in Tehran, his \n     foreign minister went back within a few days and put the same \n     proposition to the Iranians, which makes people suspicious, \n     Senator, that this is not about civil nuclear power but \n     rather about the development of the capabilities for a \n     nuclear weapon . . . Not only did we support the Russians in \n     making their offer, but when the Russians decided to go ahead \n     and shift the fuel for Bushehr saying to the Iranians now \n     that we've shipped the fuel, you certainly have no reason to \n     enrich, we supported that effort too. So I think this really \n     speaks to the intentions of the Iranians.''\n       I concurred with Secretary Rice, but urged her to press \n     this idea at the highest levels: ``My suggestion would be to \n     try to elevate it. It's been in the media and the press a \n     little, but not very much. So if we could elevate that, I \n     think you'd really put Iran on the spot that they deserve to \n     be on.'' Secretary Rice responded favorably to the \n     suggestion: ``It's a very good idea, Senator. We'll try to do \n     that.''\n       I have engaged senior Administration officials in meetings, \n     phone conversations and via letters on the Iranian issue. On \n     January 14, 2007, I met Secretary Rice in her office and \n     urged her to undertake an aggressive diplomatic initiative in \n     the Middle East and to engage all regional actors including \n     Iran. One month later during her February 27, 2007 testimony \n     before the Senate Appropriations Committee, she announced an \n     initiative to enhance regional engagement. When I spoke to \n     Secretary Rice via phone on August 14, 2007, she indicated \n     there had been no significant movement on this front. After \n     learning of the lackluster progress, I wrote to Secretary \n     Rice that, ``The U.S. should be willing to engage in dialogue \n     with those whom we consider to be our enemies in order to \n     advance our goals of peace and security. As I have expressed \n     to you in the past, I believe that talks with people--even \n     our most ardent adversaries--hold the potential to yield \n     positive results.''\n       On September 10, 2007, I wrote a six page letter to \n     Secretary Rice in which I noted, ``Terrorism, military \n     nuclear capabilities, energy security, and the Israeli-\n     Palestinian dilemma are all major issues confronting the U.S. \n     and indeed the world. These challenges cannot be confronted \n     without engaging Iran . . .''\n       In a March 28, 2007 letter to Secretary Rice, I wrote ``In \n     my view, a renewed focus on dialogue with North Korea and \n     recent participation of the U.S. in an international \n     conference attended by Iran and Syria, hold open the \n     possibility of easing the tensions that exist in our \n     relationship with those countries through diplomacy. . . . On \n     a carefully selective basis, I believe dialogue should be \n     pursued with our adversaries.''\n       On August 1, 2007, I stated on the Senate floor, ``While we \n     can't be sure that dialogue will succeed, we can be sure that \n     without dialogue there will be failure.''\n       As the clock runs out on this administration, I urge it to \n     push for resolution of this matter through direct, bilateral, \n     unconditional negotiations with Tehran. The recent talks in \n     Geneva were significant, but I continue to believe that \n     bilateral negotiations may aid in resolving this issue of \n     tremendous importance.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Syria-Israeli Negotiations\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is one further subject I wish to \ndiscuss. This will be not relatively brief, but brief. That is a \ndiscussion which is pending between Syria and Israel with Turkey acting \nas an intermediary. It would be my hope and suggestion to the President \nthat he extend the flexibility which he is now showing as to Iran and \nNorth Korea and Iraq to assist in the Israeli-Syrian negotiations. The \nUnited States was instrumental in negotiations back in 1995, when Prime \nMinister Rabin almost came to terms with Syria on the Golan Heights. It \nis a very difficult subject that I don't believe anybody should tell \nIsrael or suggest to Israel or in any way pressure Israel as to what to \ndo about the Golan Heights. It is a decision Israel has to make for \nitself on their security. But it is a different world than it was in \n1967, when Israel took the Golan Heights. Now we have a world of \nrockets, and security matters are entirely different.\n  Again, the United States participated extensively in the Syrian-\nIsraeli talks in the year 2000. I have made many trips to Syria since \n1984. I got to know President Hafez al-Asad and traveled to the Middle \nEast extensively and recommended to a number of Israeli Prime Ministers \nthe desirability of my view--at least in one man's opinion--to have the \nnegotiations. Right now there is a unique opportunity which could \nimpact on Lebanon. Syria is opening an embassy in Lebanon, treating \nLebanon as a sovereign nation which is quite a shift. Syria has \nenormous influence on Hezbollah. It is a very complex subject in \nLebanon, with Hezbollah having significant power in the government, a \nveto in their Parliament. Syria has considerable influence with Hamas. \nIf the circumstances were right, there is a great opportunity to \nseparate Syria from Iran, a great opportunity to get some assistance \nwith Syria on some major problems. It is unknowable whether that can \nhappen. But I do believe dialog is the way. It would be my hope the \nPresident would show he still has muscle. He is going to be in the \nWhite House for 6 months. What he has done with respect to North Korea \nand Iran and Iraq shows he is not taking his last 6 months with a view \nthat there are things he can accomplish. I refer to an extensive \narticle I have written on this subject which summarizes a good many of \nmy activities and views in the Washington Quarterly for 2006-2007.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington for her patience, if, in fact, \nshe has been patient. It is always difficult with Senators having the \nright to speak. But it took me more than an hour to get the floor after \nwaiting most of the day. As usual, Senator Murray is gracious and \nnodding in the affirmative. I thank her and the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I assure my colleague from Pennsylvania, I was listening \ncarefully to his comments. He has traveled worldwide, and I am \ncertainly interested in his viewpoints. I hope I didn't make him feel \nrushed at all, and I appreciate what he had to say.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  Mr. President, this week, tens of thousands of homeowners traveled \nhere to the Nation's Capital, and lined up for hours--and even days--in \nhopes of taking advantage of a mortgage counseling workshop through the \nNeighborhood Assistance Corporation of America.\n  These homeowners came from as far away as Boston or Miami--all \nbecause they are struggling to hold onto their homes, and they need \nhelp with their mortgages. Many others are now steps away from \nforeclosure because they have seen their mortgage rates rise out of \ncontrol, or because their mortgage now exceeds the value of their home\n\n[[Page S7269]]\n\nbecause property values have plummeted.\n  Now, while many of the homeowners who came to DC this week were able \nto get help, there are millions more across this country in the same \nposition who are still in need of assistance. Nearly 8,500 families \nfile for foreclosure each day. And as many as 2 million homeowners \ncould lose their homes this year. Fortunately, we will have a bill \nbefore us soon that will enable the Federal Government to lend a \nhelping hand to many of those families.\n  The housing package that passed the House on Wednesday includes a \nvariety of provisions that would restore stability to the housing \nmarket, provide assistance to communities hurt by this crisis, and help \nprevent thousands of foreclosures. We have considered much of this \npackage before, but it has been blocked by Republicans who have \npreferred to drag their feet than to address this crisis. We now have \nanother chance, and I have come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and get help into the hands of \nthe homeowners and communities that need it.\n  Those of us who go home each weekend to talk to their constituents \nknow how worried our families are about the economy--and about whether \nsomething will happen to threaten their ability to keep their homes.\n  It is hard to overstate how serious the housing crisis has become. \nThere are communities across this country where people are literally \nabandoning their homes because they can't afford their mortgages, and \nthey can't find a willing buyer. As I said, as many as 2 million \nfamilies could lose their homes to foreclosure this year. And reports \nestimate the number of families facing foreclosure is higher than at \nany time since the Great Depression.\n  At the beginning of this crisis, many of those people were subprime \nborrowers who received adjustable-rate loans or who were the victims of \nloan scams. But as home values have dropped across the country, the \nproblem has spread. Families with strong credit, who received fixed-\nrate mortgages, have seen their homes drop in value by tens or hundreds \nof thousands of dollars over the past couple of years. Their mortgages \nare now under water, and thousands of them are at risk for foreclosure \ntoo.\n  This is a problem even in regions that have been relatively healthy, \nlike my home state of Washington--where more and more people tell me \nthey are worried that they will be stuck with homes they can't afford.\n  The housing legislation that we will consider soon may be one of the \nmost important steps we take this year to help our faltering economy \nbecause it addresses the root of the problem--the housing crisis. So I \nwant to take the next couple of moments to talk about three of the main \nprovisions of this bill to explain why we must act now.\n  First, the bill provides $180 million to give counseling agencies the \nresources to reach out and help struggling homeowners. Counseling is \none of the most cost-effective tools we have to help families who are \non the verge of foreclosure. Counselors can help families negotiate \nwith their lenders, readjust their payments, or learn how to budget \ntheir expenses better.\n  And it is incredibly important that we provide the resources now so \nthat we can help families before they reach the crisis point.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to meet a single mother from \nOhio who had fallen on hard times, which in turn led her to fall behind \non her mortgage. Luckily she was able to talk to a counselor, and she \nand her children were able to stay in their home. She explained that \nwhen she got behind, she was overwhelmed. She told me she didn't know \nwhat to do. She said, ``This isn't something they teach you in \nschool.''\n  This bill would help more families like hers get help. Despite the \nnumbers who traveled to Washington, DC for help this week, far too many \nhomeowners still don't know they have options when they get behind on \ntheir mortgages.\n  I fought alongside Senators Mikulski, Schumer, and Brown to include \nthis counseling funding back when this bill was first debated in April. \nIt comes on top of a $180 million initiative that my ranking member, \nSenator Bond, and I included in the 2008 Transportation-Housing \nAppropriations Act. And I want to thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking \nMember Shelby for helping to protect the funding in the most recent \npackage.\n  Next, the bill makes some important changes to help modernize the \nFederal Housing Administration and enable it to help more homeowners \nrefinance their mortgages. First, it raises the loan limit to take into \naccount the increase in home prices over the last several years. This \nis very important because in many communities, home prices are higher \nthan the current loan limits, meaning FHA mortgages aren't an option.\n  It also provides $300 billion to enable the FHA to back loans and \nhelp as many as 400,000 homeowners at risk of foreclosure get more \naffordable--and less risky--mortgages. These changes will help \nstabilize the housing market and encourage more mortgage holders to \ngive borrowers a more affordable loan that will enable them to keep \ntheir homes.\n  Now, while I support these measures, I want to add--as chairman of \nthe Transportation and Housing Appropriations Subcommittee--that this \nbill is also putting a lot of new responsibility into the hands of the \nFHA. That agency currently has close to 300 vacancies and it has the \nmoney to fill them. Unfortunately, it has been burdened by the \npainfully slow hiring processes at HUD.\n  It is my understanding that FHA Commissioner Montgomery, and our new \nHUD Secretary, Steve Preston, are determined to reverse this hiring \nrecord and get more people on board soon. I certainly hope they \nsucceed. But I also recognize that as we head into the new fiscal year, \nwe may need to take measures to boost the salary and expense funds \nprovided to the FHA as well as get money to the agency to improve its \ncomputing capabilities. I intend to address those needs when the \nAppropriations Committee marks up the next Supplemental Appropriations \nbill in September.\n  Finally, I want to caution my colleagues on the Banking Committee \nthat we will all need to continually monitor the lending activity and \nthe funding balance of the FHA's existing mutual mortgage insurance \naccount as well as the new homeownership preservation entity fund \nestablished in this bill. None of us wants to saddle taxpayers with \nunnecessary risk as we try to help homeowners. This bill establishes a \nnew board that will face the daunting challenge of deciding which \nhomeowners can and can't be helped under this new program.\n  But Congress will also need to do its part to monitor the fiscal \nhealth of both the new and old FHA accounts to ensure that the taxpayer \nisn't guaranteeing loans that have no hope of being repaid. The whole \nhope of this legislation is about calming the housing markets and using \nthe FHA guarantee to entice mortgage holders to give borrowers a better \nbreak--an affordable loan that will keep them in their home. But we \nmust ensure that taxpayers don't end up holding the bill for \nunsalvageable loans.\n  Finally, the bill would take important steps to strengthen Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac by establishing a new regulator. It also provides \ntemporary authority to allow the Treasury Department to take action \nwhen needed to keep them stable. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the \nfoundation of our system to finance homeownership in the U.S., and it \nis absolutely critical that we take decisive action to help quickly \nrestore confidence in them.\n  We started work on this bill in February because Democrats wanted to \nget help into the hands of homeowners who need it. But despite the \ndesperation people feel in communities across this country, some \nRepublicans have preferred up to this point to stall and block this \nbill. Now, I was very happy to see President Bush finally drop his \nopposition this week. And I hope my Republican colleagues will help us \nget this bill to his desk as quickly as possible.\n  Especially when it comes to helping people keep their homes, timing \nis everything. A family that gets access to housing counseling before \nthey start missing mortgage payments can still save their home. And I \nhope we will finally be able to make that possible for thousands more \nfamilies in need.\n  I hope when we finally get this bill out of here, we will be able to \nmake it\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\npossible for more families to feel secure in this country again.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and look forward to the \nvote tomorrow morning.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable and legendary Illinoisan, Jerome Holtzman. Mr. Holtzman was \na pioneer of baseball writing and renowned for his numerous \naccomplishments. He passed away on July 19 at the age of 81.\n  The first official historian of Major League Baseball, Holtzman wrote \nabout the game, but truly he cared about the people. He was known for \nspending time with umpires before games and was able to bring \ngenerations of fans together through his columns.\n  Jerome Holtzman was a true American success story. In 1943, at the \nyouthful age of 17, he started his newspaper career as a copy boy for \nthe Chicago Times. After 2 years in the U.S. Marine Corps during World \nWar II, he covered high school sports at the Times and Sun-Times.\n  He started at the bottom, but he impressed many along the way. \nHoltzman stayed on as a baseball beat writer and columnist at the \nChicago Sun-Times for 30 years. It was at the Sun-Times where Holtzman \nmet his wife Marilyn Ryan. With their five children, they lived in \nEvanston--in a home frequented by baseball fans and Jerome Holtzman \nfans. He spent the last 10 years of his career writing for the Chicago \nTribune.\n  One of the most distinguished honors Holtzman achieved over his \nremarkable career was the induction into the writers' wing of the \nBaseball Hall of Fame in 1989. His colleagues knew him as ``the Dean,'' \na nickname given to him by fellow Hall of Famer Billy Williams. The \nnickname reflects his stature as a baseball-writing ``lifer'' and his \nloyal dedication to the game.\n  Among his accomplishments was the creation of the save. Holtzman's \nsave rule became an official Major League Baseball statistic that \nacknowledges effective relief pitching. Acknowledging his profound \ninfluence, former Sun-Times columnist Bill Gleason stated, ``The \nreality is, he revolutionized baseball.''\n  In addition to his columns, Holtzman was the author of six books, \nincluding a classic titled ``No Cheering in the Press Box.'' Many \ncolumnists considered his book required reading and a foundation to \nbaseball writing. Cubs Chairman Crane Kenney remembered Holtzman as \n``an accomplished writer who earned respect from both his readers and \nfrom those whom he covered.''\n  Jerome Holtzman will be remembered as a great friend and mentor. \nChicago and baseball fans across the Nation have lost a celebrated \nsportswriter and icon, but future generations will continue to remember \nhis great legacy and influential contributions to the game.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7270-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CAPTURE OF RADOVAN KARADZIC\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ncommend Serbian authorities for apprehending former Republika Srpska \npresident Radovan Karadzic. Earlier this month we marked the 13th \nanniversary of the genocide at Srebrenica. The arrest this week of \nRadovan Karadzic, in connection with that crime, shows that it is never \ntoo late to seek justice for the terrible crimes committed during the \n1992-95 war in Bosnia. Over a decade after being indicted for genocide, \ncrimes against humanity, and war crimes by the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY, at The Hague, Radovan \nKaradzic was arrested on Monday, July 21, outside Belgrade.\n  Radovan Karadzic's arrest represents a significant breakthrough for \ninternational jurisprudence. Serge Brammertz, prosecutor of the war \ncrimes tribunal in The Hague, said, ``This is a very important day for \nthe victims who have waited for this arrest for over a decade.'' ``It \nis also an important day for international justice because it clearly \ndemonstrates that nobody is beyond the reach of the law and that sooner \nor later all fugitives will be brought to justice.''\n  Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton Accords in 1995 which \nended the war in Bosnia, said, ``This is a historic event.'' ``Of the \nthree most evil men of the Balkans, Milosevic, Karadzic and Mladic, I \nthought Karadzic was the worst. The reason was that Karadzic was a real \nracist believer. Karadzic really enjoyed ordering the killing of \nMuslims. . . .\n  Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's International \nJustice Program, said, ``Radovan Karadzic personified impunity for more \nthan a decade, but his efforts to run the clock on justice have \nfailed.'' ``This arrest offers hope to the victims of the horrific \ncrimes that occurred here. We welcome this long-overdue arrest and look \nforward to his fair trial in The Hague.''\n  I commend the Serbian Government for the resolve it has demonstrated \nin arresting Mr. Karadzic. I think it is vital that Mr. Karadzic be \ntransferred to The Hague in due course, and that the search for \nRepublika Srpska military commander General Ratko Mladic continue. It \nis vital that the international community, including the United States, \ncontinue to support efforts to bring justice for these crimes, not just \nin The Hague, but also at the local level in Bosnia, where lack of \nresources and other obstacles mean that many victims continue to wait \nfor justice for the crimes committed against them. To that end, local \nwar crimes trials for thousands of other suspected perpetrators from \nthe Bosnia atrocities must receive support to overcome the challenges \nthey face in order to seal any remaining impunity gaps in Bosnia.\n  To echo a statement I made on the Senate floor on February 11, 1998, \nit is my sense that if the war crimes tribunal at The Hague is \nsuccessful, if we can bring the rule of law into the international \narena, we may have the most important institutional change in \ninternational relations of the past century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7270-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7270-S7272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADVANCING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, earlier this week, I joined the majority \nleader in the introduction of S. 3297, the Advancing America's \nPriorities Act. The majority leader selected 35 legislative items from \nthe jurisdiction of seven Senate committees, including eight bills from \nthat of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for this effort. These are all \nmeasures with bipartisan support and, we believe, the support of a \nstrong bipartisan majority of the Senate. I have moved several through \nthe Judiciary Committee, and several have already passed the House. All \nhave the support of all Democratic Senators, and all were cleared for \nunanimous Senate passage, but each has been stalled on the Senate floor \nby Republican objection.\n  One key bill included in this package is the Emmett Till Unsolved \nCivil Rights Crime Act. I thank Senator Dodd and Congressman Lewis for \ntheir tireless work on this bill over the last 4 years. It will \nstrengthen the ability of the Federal Government to investigate and \nprosecute unsolved murders from the civil rights era. It would create \nnew cold case units in the Justice Department and FBI dedicated to \ninvestigating and prosecuting unsolved cases involving violations of \ncriminal civil rights statutes which resulted in death and occurred \nbefore January 1, 1970. The Senate legislation was introduced on \nFebruary 8, 2007. I was proud to cosponsor Senator Dodd's bill. The \nJudiciary Committee reported it by unanimous consent as amended on June \n20, 2007, more than a year ago. The House legislation passed the House \non June 20, 2007, more than a year ago, by a vote of 422 to 2. Its \nRepublican cosponsors include Senator Cochran,\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\nSenator Hatch, Senator Alexander, and Senator Cornyn.\n  Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting Emmett Till's cousin, Simeon \nWright, who was with him that terrible night. The brutal killing of \nEmmett Till galvanized this Nation. I want to acknowledge Mr. Wright's \ncourage and his commitment to fight for justice for all these years.\n  The primary purpose of the Till bill is to track down those whose \nviolent acts during a period of national turmoil remain unpunished. By \npassing this legislation, we honor Emmett Till and all those who \nsacrificed their lives advancing civil rights. It is disgraceful that \nit has taken us so long to take this basic step to pursue justice too \nlong delayed. It is incredible to me that some continue to obstruct \nthese efforts. It reminds me of those who so adamantly opposed a \nnational holiday to recognize the contributions of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and the progress this country has made toward equal justice.\n  Another important piece of legislation in this bill is the \nreauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Many Vermonters \nhave told me how much that act is needed to help young people in \nVermont and around the country. I held a hearing in Rutland this year \non crime in small cities and towns, which emphasized the need for \nprograms to help young people in difficult circumstances, and held \nanother here in Washington on this measure before the Judiciary \nCommittee reported it in April. The companion House bill passed in \nJune.\n  In addition, the eight Judiciary Committee related bills include \nseveral concerning child pornography, exploitation and drugs. The \nEffective Child Pornography Prosecution Act passed the House 409 to 0 \nlast November; the Enhancing the Effective Prosecution of Child \nPornography provision passed the House 416 to 0 last November; the \nPROTECT Our Children Act passed the House 415 to 2 last November; the \nDrug Endangered Children Act passed the House last September 389 to 4. \nAll of these bills have been cleared by all Democratic Senators.\n  Thus, the Judiciary Committee components in S. 3297 are all measures \nthat should have passed the Senate long ago. Two of the eight have \nRepublican Senators as their lead sponsors. Others have Republican \ncosponsors.\n  People are rightly worried about keeping their communities safe and \nprotecting their children. The Judiciary Committee has worked \nthroughout this Congress to advance these priorities of Americans. \nSadly, these important efforts have been obstructed by Republican \nobjections. I hope that all Senators will join together tomorrow to \npass S. 3297 without further delay.\n  The bill we will consider tomorrow contains eight Judiciary \nCommittee-related pieces. There were selected from many more bills that \nhave been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee and that \nhave passed the House. All these bills have the support of every \nDemocratic Senator, and it is Republican objections, usually anonymous \nobjections, that are keeping them from passing.\n  Let me mention some of the others:\n  S. 879, No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007--this bill \nwould make it illegal for any foreign state or any instrumentality or \nagent of a foreign state to act collectively with another foreign state \nto limit the production, set the price, or take any other action to \nrestrain trade of oil, natural gas, or any petroleum product. The \nactions of OPEC to limit production of oil, natural gas, and other \npetroleum products result in higher prices of crude oil and, thus, \ngasoline in the United States. These actions are having a harmful \neffect on American consumers. This legislation will make clear that the \nactions of nations and their agents to limit supply and fix prices of \noil, natural gas, and other petroleum products to affect the U.S. \nmarket violates U.S. antitrust law, and it will authorize the Attorney \nGeneral to enforce antitrust law against such nations and prevent \ntechnical legal doctrines such as sovereign immunity and act of state \nfrom preventing actions for redress.\n  S. 368, COPS Improvements Act of 2007--this bill would reauthorize \nand improve the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented \nPolicing Services, COPS. Since 1994, the programs created by the COPS \ninitiative have helped drive down crime rates. The COPS Program would \nrestore vital programs that have been cut at a time when our law \nenforcement officers need it most. S. 368 would authorize $600 million \nto hire officers to engage in community policing, intelligence \ngathering and antiterror initiatives, and to serve as school resource \nofficers. It would authorize $350 million per year for technology \ngrants and $200 million per year to help local district attorneys hire \ncommunity prosecutors. Also, it would establish the COPS office as an \nentity within the Department of Justice to carry out these functions \nand activities under the COPS Program in order to eliminate duplication \nof efforts.\n\n  S. 119/H.R. 400, War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007--this \nlegislation would strengthen the tools available to Federal law \nenforcement to combat contracting fraud during times of war, military \naction, or relief or reconstruction activities. It would also extend \nextraterritorial jurisdiction in an attempt to reach fraudulent conduct \nwherever it occurs. The bill would create a new criminal fraud offense \nin title 18 of the U.S. Code to prohibit fraudulent acts involving the \nprovision of goods or services in connection with a war, military \naction, or relief or reconstruction activities.\n  S. 185, Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007--this bill would repeal \nprovisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 that eliminated the \njurisdiction of any court to hear or consider applications for a writ \nof habeas corpus filed by aliens who have been determined by the United \nStates to have been properly detained as enemy combatants. Passage of \nthis bill would restore the basic and essential right to challenge \narbitrary detention by the Government to noncitizens, including the 12 \nmillion lawful permanent residents currently in this country, who under \ncurrent law may be held forever with no recourse to challenge their \ndetention in court. This legislation will contribute to renewed global \nrespect for American values and the rule of law.\n  S. 2511, a bill to amend the grant program for law enforcement armor \nvests to provide for a waiver of or reduction in the matching funds \nrequirement in the case of fiscal hardship--this bill would amend the \nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the \nDirector of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to waive, in whole or in \npart, matching fund requirements applicable to the grant program for \nthe purchase of armor vests for law enforcement officers.\n  S. 2344, Internet Safety Education Act of 2007--this bill would \ncreate a competitive grant program for eligible organizations to carry \nout free, age-appropriate programs that promote Internet safety for \nchildren. This would give educators and parents the tools necessary to \nteach proper online interactions and promote safe Internet usage to \ntheir students and children in an age-appropriate manner.\n  H.R. 3095, to amend the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of \n2006 to modify a deadline relating to a certain election by Indian \ntribes--this bipartisan bill would provide Indian tribes a 1-year \nextension in which to decide how to comply with the requirements of the \nAdam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. The Adam Walsh Act \nenacted new requirements for States and Indian tribes to maintain sex \noffender registration information, post such information on the \nInternet, and share such information among States and other Indian \ntribes. The Justice Department proposed detailed regulations for States \nand Indian tribes to comply with the Adam Walsh Act, but those \nregulations are not yet final. The Indian tribes cannot make an \ninformed decision on how to comply with the act until those regulations \nare final. This 1-year extension would give Indian tribes sufficient \ntime to make appropriate choices.\n  S. 267/H.R. 545, Native American Methamphetamine Enforcement and \nTreatment Act--this bill would ensure that Indian tribes are able to \napply for grant programs authorized by the Combat Methamphetamine \nEpidemic Act. When Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic \nAct, tribes were unintentionally left out as eligible applicants in \nsome of these programs. This bill would clarify that\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\nterritories and Indian communities are eligible to receive the \nresources they need to fight methamphetamine use.\n  S. 877, Controlling the Abuse of Prescriptions Act of 2007--this bill \nseeks to crack down on performance-enhancing drugs by putting human \ngrowth hormone on the same list of controlled substances as anabolic \nsteroids. Classifying human growth hormone, HGH, as a schedule III \ncontrolled substance would subject the drug to more Government \nregulation and stiffer penalties for illegal distribution.\n  S. 1027, PACT Act--this bill would help combat cigarette trafficking \nby updating existing antitrafficking laws and introducing new tools to \ncombat illegal remote sales, such as those conducted over the Internet. \nThe legislation closes loopholes in current tobacco trafficking laws, \nenhances penalties for violations, and provides law enforcement with \nnew tools to combat the innovative new methods being used by cigarette \ntraffickers to distribute their products. By strengthening criminal \nlaws governing cigarette trafficking and empowering Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement with the powers to investigate and prosecute the \ncigarette traffickers of the 21st century, the PACT Act can help \ndisrupt terrorist groups and other organized criminal enterprises.\n  S. 627, Safe Babies Act of 2007--this bill would amend the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to require the Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to award a grant to a \nnational early childhood development organization to establish a \nNational Court Teams Resource Center. The goals of the Center would be \nto promote the well-being of maltreated infants and toddlers and their \nfamilies, help prevent the recurrence of abuse and neglect of children, \nand promote timely reunification of families.\n  H.R. 5569, to extend for 5 years the EB-5 Regional Center Pilot \nProgram, and for other purposes--this bill would extend the EB-5 \nRegional Center Program for 5 years. This program allows entrepreneurs \nfrom around the country to apply for Regional Center designation with \nthe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which in turn allows \nproject managers to attract foreign investment to discrete projects \nwithin specified geographic areas, many of which are rural areas in \nneed of economic stimulation. Over the years, this program has resulted \nin foreign capital investment of billions of dollars and the creation \nof thousands of jobs in American communities. This important program is \nset to expire on September 30, 2008, and its reauthorization is \ncritical for the many Americans who depend upon this program to make \npositive economic changes to their communities.\n\n  S. 442, John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of \n2007--this bill would establish a student loan repayment program for \nqualified attorneys who agree to remain employed for at least 3 years \nin certain public sector employment. This targeted student loan \nrepayment assistance program will bolster the ranks of attorneys in the \ncriminal justice system, enhancing the quality of that system and the \npublic's confidence in it.\n  S. 3296, to extend the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court Police to \nprotect court officials off the Supreme Court grounds and change the \ntitle of the Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice--this bill \nwould extend for 5 years the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court Police \nto protect Supreme Court Justices when they leave the Supreme Court \ngrounds. In January of this year, the Court Security Improvement Act \nwas signed into law to authorize additional resources to protect \nFederal judges, personnel, and courthouses. This additional legislation \nwould extend the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court Police to protect \nthe Supreme Court Justices on and off Court grounds. It would also \nchange the title of the Chief Justice's senior advisor from \n``Administrative Assistant'' to ``Counselor.''\n  S. 3106, a bill to amend chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code, \nrelating to the vessel hull design protection, to clarify the \ndefinitions of a hull and a deck--this bill would give the Department \nof Defense full assurance that Government and defense designs will not \nbe subject to unwarranted restrictions. In 1998, Congress passed the \nVessel Hull Design Protection Act to recognize the significant time, \neffort, and innovation that figure into ship design. Recent action in \nthe courts has made it clear that in order to be effective, this law \nneeds to be clarified and refined. This bill does exactly that by \nclarifying the definition of ``hull'' and ``deck,'' to ensure that the \nintellectual property rights of vessel hull designers would be \nprotected.\n  H.R. 6344, Responsive Government Act of 2008--this bill would provide \nthe Federal courts and the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, \nPTO, with needed emergency authority to delay judicial proceedings or \nstatutory deadlines in the event of a natural disaster or other \nemergency situation which makes it impractical for parties, including \nthe United States, to comply with certain filing conditions or to \nprotect the rights and privileges of people affected by certain \nemergencies or a major disaster. We have recently observed how the \nravages of natural disasters disrupt the lives of our fellow citizens, \nwhich can impede the ability to comply with strict statutory deadlines. \nThus the Responsive Government Act provides critical flexibility to the \ncourts and the PTO to help ameliorate the practical difficulties caused \nby these emergency situations.\n  S. 621, Wartime Treatment Study Act--this bill would establish two \nfactfinding commissions to supplement the work done in the 1980s by the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, which \nstudied the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The \nact would create one commission to review the U.S. Government's \ntreatment of German Americans, Italian Americans, and European Latin \nAmericans during World War II, and another commission to review the \nU.S. Government's treatment of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution \nduring World War II.\n  S. 2942, a bill to authorize funding for the National Advocacy \nCenter--this bill would authorize the National District Attorneys \nAssociation to use the National Advocacy Center in Columbia, SC, for a \nnational training program to improve the professional skills of State \nand local prosecutors and to enhance the ability of Federal, State, and \nlocal prosecutors to work together.\n  I hope that those Republican Senators who are holding up these \nmeasures will work with me by coming forward and letting me know what \nit is in the bill that they find objectionable. That way, we might be \nable to work something out to accommodate them. But when they object \nanonymously and do not come forward to work with us, it seems they are \nonly interested in obstruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7272-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7272-S7274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF JAMES A. WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Mr. James A. Williams to be the Administrator of the \nGeneral Services Administration, GSA. My concerns are based on my \ninvestigation of a dubious GSA contract with Sun Microsystems. In 2006 \nand 2007, my oversight staff conducted a thorough inquiry into the GSA \nMultiple Award Schedule contract with Sun Microsystems for computer \nproducts and services. GSA inspector general, IG, auditors had alerted \nGSA's top management of alleged fraud on this contract as early as \n2005.\n  In 2006, Mr. Williams became the Commissioner of the GSA Federal \nAcquisition Service, FAS. His office was directly responsible for this \nquestionable contract with Sun Microsystems. He and Administrator Doan \nwere alterted to the alleged fraud and the referral of the matter to \nthe Department of Justice, DOJ.\n  I previously made the findings of my inquiry known in a floor \nstatement on October 17, 2007.\n  In a nutshell, all the evidence developed in my oversight \ninvestigation appears to indicate that top-level GSA management, \nincluding Administrator Doan and FAS Commissioner Williams, may have \nimproperly interfered in the ongoing contract negotiations with Sun \nMicrosystems in May-September 2006; and Administrator Doan and Mr. \nWilliams pressured the GSA contracting officer to approve the new Sun \ncontract even though they both knew that the IG had detected alleged \nfraud on the existing Sun contract and had\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\nreferred the matter to the DOJ for possible prosecution/litigation. \nThis case is now pending in Federal court.\n  The facts appear to show Mr. Williams, as FAS Commissioner, failed to \nact in the best interest of the American taxpayer. He had the \nopportunity to put an end to or bring into compliance a contract that \nwas allegedly fraudulent, but in the end he could not do it. Instead, \nhe sided with former Administrator Doan by taking steps to remove the \nGSA contracting officer. When the final contract was signed with Sun \nMicrosystems by a newly appointed contracting officer, he chose to look \nthe other way. He didn't even try to have the IG audit or examine the \nterms of the proposed contract. At the very least, this was a very poor \nmanagement decision by Mr. Williams. It was a deplorable error in \njudgment that he probably regrets today.\n  We need a strong leader at GSA. The responsibilities of GSA \nAdministrator require an individual who will stand up to anyone to \nprotect the financial interests of hard-working American taxpayers. \nAlthough I agree he is well qualified and a devoted civil servant, I \ndon't believe Mr. Williams has the bureaucratic and intestinal \nfortitude to make the tough decisions at GSA when it matters.\n  Reports of alleged fraud on the Sun contract surfaced on his watch. \nHe knew about the alleged fraud. The taxpayers may have been cheated \nout of tens of millions of dollars. As FAS Commissioner, he was the top \nGSA official responsible for making the tough calls, and he chose not \nto protect the taxpayers. He made the wrong choice. He is now \naccountable for that decision. Because he failed to protect the \ntaxpayers at a crucial moment, we should not elevate Mr. Williams to \nhigh office.\n  For all these reasons, I oppose his nomination to be GSA \nAdministrator.\n  Mr. Williams's nomination is now before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. On July 22, I wrote to the chairman, \nSenator Lieberman, laying out the reasons behind my opposition to this \nnomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2008.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman, I am writing to express opposition \n     to the nomination of Mr. Jim Williams to be the Administrator \n     of the General Services Administration (GSA).\n       My opposition to Mr. Williams' nomination is rooted in an \n     in-depth oversight investigation conducted by my staff in \n     2006-2007. This investigation focused on the re-negotiation \n     of a Multiple Award Schedule contract with Sun Microsystems, \n     Inc. for computer products and services. The contract was \n     initially awarded to the company in 1999. Sales on this \n     contract totaled $268,987,689.00.\n       The results of this investigation were presented in three \n     separate reports in October 2007. These reports were provided \n     to your committee, Administrator Doan, the House Oversight \n     Committee, the White House Chief of Staff, and GSA Inspector \n     General (IG). In addition, there was a follow-up report \n     issued by the U.S. Postal Service in May 2008. None of these \n     reports have been released to the public. However, on October \n     17, 2007, I spoke about the findings in these reports in very \n     general terms on the floor of the Senate. My remarks appear \n     on pages S12952-12954 of the Congressional Record.\n       At the time of my investigation, Mr. Williams was the \n     Commissioner of GSA's Federal Acquisition Service (FAS).\n       In a nutshell, all the evidence developed in my oversight \n     investigation appears to indicate that: 1) top-level GSA \n     management, including Administrator Doan and FAS Commissioner \n     Williams, may have improperly interfered in the ongoing \n     contract negotiations with Sun Microsystems in May-September \n     2006; and 2) Administrator Doan and Mr. Williams pressured \n     the GSA contracting officer to approve the new Sun contract \n     even though they both knew that the IG had detected alleged \n     fraud on existing Sun contract and had referred the matter to \n     the Department of Justice (DOJ) for possible prosecution/\n     litigation.\n       The IG auditors first blew the whistle on alleged fraud on \n     the Sun contract in 2005--at least a year before Mr. Williams \n     became FAS Commissioner.\n       The GSA IG auditors had the Sun contract under a microscope \n     for several years. They had uncovered extensive contract \n     violations, including potential civil and criminal fraud. \n     These problems were first reported to GSA acquisition \n     management in February 2005. The IG auditors briefed DOJ on \n     the alleged fraud on April 20, 2006. In April 2007, DOJ \n     charged Sun in a False Claims Act suit. That case is now \n     pending in the Arkansas Federal Court District (Norman Rille \n     and Neal Roberts vs Sun Microsystems, Inc.).\n       The GSA IT Acquisition Center staff was briefed on these \n     issues on May 2, 2006. FAS Commissioner Williams ``grilled'' \n     the IG auditors about the alleged fraud and DOJ referral \n     during the contract ``Impasse'' briefing on August 14, 2006. \n     On August 29, 2006, Administrator Doan was briefed by the IG \n     audit team on the decision to refer the Sun contract to DOJ \n     for possible prosecution/litigation. Mr. Williams and Ms. \n     Doan discussed the alleged fraud on the Sun contract on \n     several different occasions in August 2006.\n       Despite the red warning flags raised by the IG auditors, \n     according to my findings, Administrator Doan and Mr. Williams \n     pressured the GSA contracting officer to sign the contract. \n     When that person refused to sign the contract, they had the \n     contracting officer removed and replaced under duress.\n       The record shows that Mr. Williams played a key role in the \n     removal of the contracting officer as follows:\n       A high-level meeting--known as the ``Baltimore Conference \n     Call''--was held on August 31, 2006. All the key players \n     participated, including Commissioner Williams. According to \n     interviews with a number of participants, Mr. Williams made \n     it very clear that the Sun contract was of ``strategic \n     importance'' in Administrator Doan's view, and it had to be \n     awarded. Still, the contracting officer refused to back down \n     in the face of mounting pressure from the very top. He had \n     dug in his heels and refused to sign what he considered a bad \n     contract. During interviews, the contracting officer told my \n     staff that he thought the price reduction clause, discounts, \n     and maintenance deals offered by Sun were ``essentially \n     worthless,'' and he said he was equally concerned about the \n     alleged fraud referral to DOJ. Mr. Williams then asked the \n     contracting officer if he wished to step down, and the \n     contracting officer accepted the offer.\n       Under standard GSA procedures, contracting officers make \n     the final decision on whether or not to sign a contract. They \n     have ``Go No Go'' authority. No other person is authorized to \n     preempt or otherwise interfere with that authority. So when \n     the contracting officer said ``No'' on the Sun contract, why \n     didn't that mean ``No''? Why didn't the story end there?\n       One of Mr. Williams' directors suggested that the \n     ``Impasse'' in the negotiations was caused by the \n     intimidation of the contracting officer by IG auditors. On \n     September 5, 2006, in response to that complaint, Mr. \n     Williams lodged a quasi-formal complaint with the IG, \n     alleging that the IG auditors had made threatening statements \n     to GSA contracting officers.\n       Mr. Williams' complaint of IG auditor intimidation came \n     just five days after the contracting officer was removed and \n     four days before the new contract was signed. Mr. Williams \n     also passed these allegations to Administrator Doan.\n       Mr. Williams' allegations of IG auditor intimidation were \n     examined in detail by the GSA IG, by my staff, and by the \n     U.S. Postal Service IG. There is not one shred of evidence to \n     support those allegations. They appear to have been bogus \n     allegations. A senior official in the IG's office suggested \n     that Mr. Williams' allegations regarding IG auditor \n     intimidation were ``a smokescreen for things going on in the \n     agency itself.''\n       After forcing the contracting officer to step down, GSA \n     management appointed a new one. It took her just nine days to \n     negotiate a final deal with Sun. In interviews, the new \n     contracting officer claimed that she did not need to talk to \n     the IG auditors who had years of knowledge on the contract. \n     She said that she could solve the impasse in the negotiations \n     by listening to the contractor. Many of the provisions she \n     accepted were ones steadfastly opposed by the previous \n     contracting officer--the very same terms that led to the so-\n     called ``impasse'' and the removal of the previous \n     contracting officer. She even admitted during questioning \n     that she did not fully understand key provisions in the \n     contract she signed. She admitted making ``big oversights'' \n     in some of the contract terms. I found these revelations very \n     disturbing. They raised questions about the motives behind \n     her appointment. She later received a $1,400 cash award for \n     signing off on the Sun contract.\n       Following my staff's interview of the new contracting \n     officer, I had grave concerns about the new contract. Was Sun \n     continuing to cheat on government discounts mandated by the \n     price reduction clause--as feared by the IG auditors? I \n     thought I would be remiss in not asking more questions. \n     Consequently, on June 5, 2007, I asked the IG to conduct an \n     audit of the new contract. Since Sun claimed it was such a \n     ``good deal for America,'' I felt sure the company would rush \n     to cooperate. How wrong I was! For three months straight, Sun \n     stonewalled and procrastinated. Sun withheld information. Sun \n     fought the audit tooth and nail every step of the way. They \n     even lashed out at the GSA IG. Then suddenly and \n     unexpectedly, on September 13, 2008, Sun canceled the \n     contract. What happened? Why would Sun cancel a contract it \n     had fought so hard to get? Was Sun trying to avoid the audit? \n     Did Sun have something to hide? Something about this just \n     does not smell right.\n       Mr. Chairman, Mr. Williams was the Commissioner of GSA's \n     Federal Acquisition Service at the time of the Sun/GSA \n     contract debacle. That made him the top dog overseeing and \n     managing the procurement of\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\n     computer equipment and services for the whole government. The \n     Sun Microsystems contract was being re-negotiated right under \n     his nose. He was the top official accountable for that \n     contract. When he was informed in August 2006 by IG auditors \n     about the alleged fraud on the Sun contract and the DOJ \n     referral decision, he should have brought the Sun contract \n     negotiations to a screeching halt. He should have called for \n     a comprehensive, independent review and/or audit and \n     assessment of Sun's corrective action plan. He should have \n     carefully weighed the gravity of the fraud allegations before \n     proceeding any further.\n       Mr. Chairman, instead of heeding all the IG's warning \n     signals, Mr. Williams pushed the throttle to the firewall at \n     Administrator Doan's direction. The record shows pressure was \n     put on the contracting officer to sign a potentially bad \n     contract. When the contracting officer refused to bend under \n     pressure, Mr. Williams involved himself directly in the \n     contracting process. He participated in the decision to \n     remove that contracting officer from the Sun contract \n     negotiations. His actions eliminated the last standing \n     barrier to contract approval. In doing these things, he may \n     have improperly interfered in the contracting process and \n     hurt the taxpayers.\n       The alleged contract violations and alleged fraud on the \n     Sun contract, which supposedly occurred over a long period of \n     time, may have wasted tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer \n     money. Mr. Chairman, there must be more accountability in the \n     government contracting process. Elevating those who have been \n     detrimental to this process would certainly be anti-\n     accountability and anti-taxpayer. That would clearly send the \n     wrong message to the whole contracting community.\n       For these reasons, I intend to oppose the nomination of Mr. \n     Williams to be the next Administrator at GSA, and would \n     expect your Committee to do so, too.\n       Your careful consideration of my concerns would be \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E.

Mr. President, on July 20, 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus. \nThirty four years later, Turkish troops continue to occupy 37 percent \nof the land on Cyprus. During the occupation, some 180,000 Cypriots \nbecame refugees and over 5,000 Cypriots were murdered.\n  The European Court of Human Rights recently found Turkey guilty of \nviolating the European Convention on Human Rights. Notably, 26 year-old \nSolomos Solomou, was killed on August, 14, 1996 after being shot three \ntimes by Turkish snipers while trying to climb a pole in order to \nremove a Turkish flag from its mast. The killing happened after the \nfuneral of his cousin, Tassos Isaak, who was himself beaten to death on \nAugust 11, 1996 by a Turkish mob while taking part in an anti-\noccupation demonstration.\n  On March 12th of this year, I sent a congratulatory letter to the \nnewly elected Cypriot President Christofias. In addition to a new \nPresident in the Republic of Cyprus, his election represents a new \ndirection for the Republic of Cyprus. I commend President Christofias \nfor the intensification of efforts to reach a just, viable, and \nfunctional solution to the Cyprus problem. I believe this is a unique \ntime to capitalize on the commitment made to find a solution and I am \noptimistic that the working groups and technical committees will \nprepare the necessary groundwork for full-fledged negotiation. However, \nI also believe that any solution that will reunite the island, its \npeople, its institutions and its economy and must come from the \nCypriots themselves.\n  On September 25, 2007, I introduced S. Res. 331, which calls on the \nUnited States Government to initiate a new effort to help Turkey \nunderstand the benefits that will accrue to it as a result of ending \nits military occupation of Cyprus. In addition, the resolution urges \nthe Government of Turkey to immediately begin the withdrawal of its \nmilitary occupation forces. Ultimately, it is on their shoulders to \nprove their good will and I hope they do so promptly.\n  As Cypriot-Americans join with Cypriots from throughout the world to \nhelp to rebuild their homeland, and as they seek to secure an \neconomically prosperous state free of illegal occupation, I will stand \nby them. I will work to ensure that the Turkish occupation comes to an \nend.\n  This week, we remember those who perished on Cyprus, and honor those \nwho survived and who continue to live under Turkish occupation. We have \nnot forgotten and our thoughts and prayers are with them and their \nfamilies.\n  Remembering together the events of July 20, 1974 in solidarity gives \nreverence to historical events we cannot afford to forget as we move \nforward to a peaceful, just solution and a hopeful tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7274-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

He developed a lasting legacy as a man \nwho held to his convictions and championed the causes he believed in so \ndeeply.\n  He began his career in the U.S. Navy during World War II, where he \nwas assigned as a recruiter. After the war, he became involved in North \nCarolina politics and campaigned for Senator Willis Smith, later \nserving on his staff. Senator Helms continued to establish himself, \nworking as a political commentator for local Raleigh newspapers and \nradio stations. In 1957, Senator Helms was elected to the Raleigh city \ncouncil, where he served with the same conviction that he would later \nbring to the Senate.\n  He was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and was reelected four \nmore times, making him the longest serving U.S. Senator in North \nCarolina history. He quickly became known for his unfailing dedication \nto uphold traditional American values and protect freedom. He said, \n``The challenge is always before us. Whenever we lose sight of the \nprinciples that mattered to our founders we run into trouble.''\n  During his tenure in the Senate, Helms served on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and was chairman from 1995 to 2001.

Mr. President, last week marked the end of a distinguished \nand honorable career in Government service for one of the most widely \nrespected professional staff members on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Today, I wish to pay tribute to this gentleman--Mr. Don \nMitchell.\n  For over 24 years, Don Mitchell devoted his life to public service. \nRemarkably, except for a 2-year period when he served as the Director \nof Intelligence Programs for the National Security Council, 22 of those \nyears were spent here in the Senate, first as a national security \nlegislative assistant for Senator John Glenn and then as a professional \nstaff member for the Intelligence Committee. Senator Glenn knew a good \nthing when he saw it, so in 1989, he asked Don to move to the \nIntelligence Committee staff. As they say, the rest is history .\n  In a world where politics often seems to define who we are and with \nwhom we associate, Don transcended those barriers. He earned the \nrespect of Members and colleagues on both sides of the aisle. His work \nethic--often evidenced by long days and late nights--was admired by \nall. It comes as no surprise that Don's reputation is well known not \nonly here in the Senate but throughout the intelligence community with \nwhom he worked so closely through the years. During my tenure on the \nIntelligence Committee, and in particular since becoming the vice \nchairman, I have benefited from Don's expertise and seasoned judgment \nin analyzing some of our most sensitive national security programs. We \nhave been fortunate to have him for so many years.\n  We all know that the demands of working here in Congress often take \nthe greatest toll on those who support us and sustain us in life--our \nfamilies. For selflessly giving Don to us for so many years, his wife \nGrace, son Logan, and daughter Ella deserve our gratitude. We thank \nthem for their sacrifices through these many years.\n  Ensuring our great Nation's security is a high calling and one of \ntremendous responsibility. Through his service to the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Senate, and the United States of America, Don Mitchell \nhas answered this call\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\nwith characteristic professionalism, integrity, and perseverance. We \nwish him the very best in his future pursuits.

President Lincoln established the grounds at Arlington as a \nmilitary cemetery in 1864. By the end of the Civil War, Arlington \nhoused 16,000 graves. It now serves as the final resting place for over \n300,000 of our Nation's most distinguished service personnel and public \nofficials, including hundreds of distinguished North Carolinians. \nVeterans from all of the Nation's wars are interred at Arlington, from \nthe American Revolution through the present wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The gravesites of these men and women span an area of 624 \nacres.\n  The beauty and simple elegance of Arlington's grounds is renowned \nthroughout the world, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors, \nmourners, and tourists every year. The work that goes into maintaining \nArlington is a reflection of the honor and reverence that America has \nfor our veterans and leaders. The members of PLANET share in this \nreverence. Through their work at Arlington each year, they have \ndemonstrated a special level of commitment to the memory of our \ncountrymen who have made some of the greatest sacrifices.\n  Many PLANET members who volunteered their time and expertise this \npast week have a personal connection to Arlington, either through \nrelatives or friends who are buried there or through their own military \nservice. But whether or not they have a family or service connection to \nthe cemetery, all of the volunteers care deeply about maintaining \nArlington as a place of dignity and respect in recognition of those who \nhave served the public good and those who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  Their work does not go unnoticed by the family members of those who \nare buried at Arlington, nor does it go unnoticed by the membership of \nthe U.S. Senate. I applaud the generosity of the PLANET members who \ndevoted their work to honor our Nation's servicemembers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7275-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7275-S7276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent that today's letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Not affected much yet. But then we operate on a CASH basis \n     around here, so we are not drowning in credit card debt while \n     the cost of gas and food skyrockets. Do not drive 45 miles to \n     Sandpoint just to shop anymore.\n     Dorothy.\n                                  ____\n\n       I want to thank you for keeping us informed of what is \n     going on from your point of view. I, myself, am very \n     disappointed in the lack of positive actions that affect the \n     ``people'' of this great nation with regards to fuel. We have \n     been listening to lots of talk and promises for years since \n     the shot across the bow by foreign oil in the seventies. We \n     are the father of nuclear power and seem to be last in the \n     world to take advantage of it. Let us get with the program. \n     There are far too many environmental laws that do not allow \n     us to develop as we should. Let us look at these laws or, \n     better yet, suspend all environmental considerations during \n     this emergency until the economy and prices get back to \n     normal. Let us start tomorrow and take advantage of our own \n     resources in this country and get away from foreign oil, we \n     can do it and do it fast. Let private industry do what they \n     are capable of and let the government get out of the way \n     other than to remove regulations that stop progress. There \n     are too many regulations on the books now and, in many cases, \n     they contradict each other.\n       [Some examples:] hydrogen fuel cells for housing and \n     transportation, and solar energy for heating water and \n     electricity. Every new house built in this nation should be \n     required from now on to use solar and wind power as much as \n     possible and be capable of upgrade as new technologies come \n     on line. The power grid as we now know it is in big trouble, \n     so let us start getting off of it. Do not even think about \n     getting rid of hydroelectric power from our dams. We should \n     be adding more as we should to supply the growing demands and \n     not buckle under to a handful of tree huggers as was the case \n     in Boise County on the Payette River a few years ago.\n       I think your estimate of $200 a month for fuel is real \n     conservative; in many cases, it is double that. I have \n     watched mushroom soup go from $.32 a can to $1.50+, and that \n     is totally unacceptable. To me, making fuel out of our food \n     supply is a little crazy. Let us not get carried away with \n     the biofuel stuff until we know more about it. As I \n     understand ethanol, it is not good for the environment and it \n     takes more fuel to make it than it will produce. Petroleum \n     and corn are the main ingredients in many, many, many \n     everyday items I do not think most Americans are aware of; we \n     can do better.\n       I have been personally hit by this fuel and food crisis as \n     I just retired from my state job to be able to visit my \n     grandkids and relatives and peruse our family tree and to get \n     a break. I joined the U.S. Navy in 1963 when I was seventeen \n     and have been going like hell ever since. I was medically \n     retired from the US Navy with a medical discharge and VA \n     disability. I am now one of the folks on a fixed income, and \n     these prices did not appear on the horizon when the plans to \n     retire were made. I am not sure how this will affect the big \n     picture, but I do know I cannot travel as I had planned, and \n     that is sad for the whole family. I have folks from Wisconsin \n     to all the states in the Northwest to California. I did a \n     short trip to Winnemucca, Nevada, from Boise, Idaho, for a \n     softball game my granddaughter was in; round trip gas was \n     $225 for my camper; it used to be $50. Where will it stop? I \n     thank you for your letter and please put pressure on whoever \n     is in the way to immediate progress to get out of the way. \n     Remember the Manhattan Project and the first moon shot; it \n     CAN be done.\n     Hal, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband is a logger and, because of the high price of \n     gas, he has been off from work for six months. I wish every \n     Congressman had to live on the same amount of money a week \n     that we have tried to live on $300. We only go into town once \n     every 8 to 10 days, and when we do go to town, we never go \n     anywhere that is not on our list. Last month it cost us over \n     $100 just to go into town four times. It [seems that Congress \n     doesn't have] regard for the working man's life. [Perhaps] \n     they should [try living the same way] we do and I am sure \n     their outlook on our future would be different. We need to \n     drill for oil in our own country and then do not let the gas \n     companies sell the oil to other countries. It is time for a \n     change and please let the change start soon.\n     Ruby.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not like the high gas prices, but what I detest is \n     that, for years, it seems that many have preferred to posture \n     and bicker about drilling/not drilling for oil, expanding/\n     limiting refinery growth, paying lip service to yet-to-be-\n     available alternative energy sources, and demonizing the oil \n     companies rather than making adult, farsighted decisions \n     about our energy needs and creating a responsible policy to \n     meet our needs.\n       The same actions that could have--and should have--been \n     taken 10, 15, 20 years ago to put us in a better place today \n     are still being proposed today and ignored again, often by \n     the same people who made the faulty decisions about them \n     originally. It is something that wouldn't be tolerated in the \n     private sector, where leadership would have been fired long \n     ago for such incompetence. Congress needs to put the energy \n     needs and associated security aspects of our country first \n     and take prompt, forceful action or have the decency to get \n     out of the way for someone who will.\n       If we are not currently knowledgeable enough or committed \n     enough to quickly develop a full-blown, workable energy \n     policy, here's a temporary policy until we do:\n       Drilling may not be the answer, but it is what we need to \n     do while we discover or develop the answer.\n       Spread the word, Senator, and leave behind the short-term \n     thinking of the past!\n     Gregory.\n                                  ____\n\n       The fuel prices are totally out of control. My husband and \n     I run a charter fishing business, which means we have to use \n     hundreds of gallons of fuel every day. The most disappointing \n     part of the whole process is that the government could change \n     things in a\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\n     heartbeat. I am tired of hearing that car manufacturers have \n     until 2015 to come up with vehicles which will be improved to \n     give around 35 miles per gallon. That is the way the \n     government tries to ``ease'' the citizens' concerns of \n     skyrocketing fuel prices and allay fears of global warming. \n     Right now, as I type this, there is a solution to the \n     problem, an almost immediate solution, and I know there is \n     not only one of them out there. One gentleman in Idaho has \n     invented a carburetor which can be used on any type of \n     vehicle and will increase fuel efficiency to around 70 miles \n     to the gallon. So why, I ask with tears in my eyes, does the \n     government not take a stand and mass produce the carburetors? \n     Is not that a novel idea. . . . . imagine what effect that \n     would have on the demand for fuel and therefore the quantity \n     of fuel we would need to purchase from price gougers? The USA \n     can put people on the moon but coming up with fuel efficient \n     transportation is just way beyond their scope of \n     capabilities. Why not take a stand and insist on an immediate \n     improvement in fuel efficiency standards? That would at least \n     be a start. Maybe it wouldn't solve our demand for fuel but \n     it might cut the demand in half. What about this story \n     below--that explains how the government manipulates the \n     public--it is a joke:\n       Ron Brandt: 90 MPG Carburetor--Ron Brandt is the inventor \n     of the perm-mag motor. He is of retirement age. When he was a \n     young man, he invented a 90-mpg carburetor. He was paid a \n     visit by a man from Standard Oil, another man, and two men \n     wearing U.S. Marshal uniforms. They told him that if he ever \n     made another carburetor, they would kill him, his wife, and \n     two young children. He was quickly persuaded that his life \n     wasn't worth a ``damn'' carburetor. He happened to think to \n     memorize the badge numbers of the two U.S. Marshals, and so \n     had an attorney in Washington, DC check with the U.S. \n     Marshal's office. They had no record of the two badge \n     numbers.\n     Rene.\n                                  ____\n\n       I normally go to Colorado to get my grandchildren for the \n     summer; however, this year I have had to put it off for a \n     while. Because my parents are both in their late 80s and my \n     mother had cancer last year, I go to Florida every year \n     around Thanksgiving. Having to save more for airline tickets \n     means I do not have money for the local trips I normally take \n     during the summer. I have even had to curtail my fishing. I \n     have had to stop or go less often to my various camping \n     spots. We generally have a family get together, but we are \n     not this year because of the expense some would experience in \n     traveling here. In short, we are traveling less, going less \n     distance when we do travel and spending less at hotels and \n     restaurants, but we are seeing less of our extended family.\n     Sheila.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am not surprised by the ``high'' prices for fuel. Most of \n     Europe has paid these prices for years; when I was in Germany \n     in the mid-80s the price was about $4/gallon. We have kept \n     the fuel prices artificially low here in the U.S. for various \n     reasons. This has led to waste (Hummers, Escalades, etc.) and \n     disincentive for change/improvements in our fuel/\n     transportation situation. I am happy to see the prices climb, \n     as this will force conservation, alternative energy types and \n     improvements in fuel mileage, etc. We declared that this \n     situation would never occur again in the early 70s with the \n     OPEC slowdown on oil production--seems that our collective \n     memories are rather short.\n     Gustaf, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       All of my family is being hit very hard by the gas prices. \n     I do not understand why anyone would stand against us \n     drilling oil on our own land and/or working towards any type \n     of energy that would make us self-sufficient against our \n     enemies. I am ready to drill here in the U.S. Please support \n     us. Another question: why, if we are spending billions of \n     dollars supporting and rebuilding IRAQ, are we not getting \n     some of their oil?\n     Cindi.\n                                  ____\n\n       As soon as the price of fossil fuels, and the electorate's \n     reaction to it, drives the political will in Washington and \n     the rest of the world's capitals to get serious about making \n     policy that threatens to bring about the conversion of our \n     energy paradigm to self-renewing, non polluting, less \n     profitable energy sources, which are available, simple, \n     plentiful and inexhaustible, look for oil to drop to $30 and \n     gasoline prices to drop back below $2/gallon. Through long \n     experience, those who put profits above the health and well-\n     being of future generations have learned how to milk the most \n     possible money out of the market without killing the milk \n     cow. The reason [some have] always been opposed to the REAL \n     emphasis on self-renewing energy technologies that is needed \n     to help those burgeoning industries get a level playing field \n     with the fossil fuels powerhouses is that they are \n     [financially connected to the oil, gas and coal industries. \n     Recent presidential administrations have not set an example, \n     regardless of the party affiliation of the president.] And \n     THAT, Senator, is why you now have a special email address \n     for remarks about fossil fuel prices. Thanks for your \n     concern. Wish it had come many years earlier!\n     William, Tetonia.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your email information on your stand on the \n     economy and its ever-\n     increasing price increases.\n       I am a business owner and self employed. I care for two \n     adult handicapped women and I am a co-partner in our painting \n     business with my husband. We know that the increase of one \n     major product strongly affects all products and services, \n     specifically oil and electricity. I grew up in Alaska, and \n     lived there for 18 years, especially at the time the Alaska \n     Pipeline was put in place. My husband worked in the oil \n     fields of Wyoming in the early 1980s. We have personally seen \n     the expansion and development of natural resources. We now \n     reside in Eastern Idaho. We have seen the increased use of \n     wind towers to generate wind electricity. Knowing the days of \n     wind compared to the days of no wind in Eastern Idaho, we \n     appreciate the justification of tapping this source of \n     energy.\n       I have seen inventions that create more economical use of \n     the gasoline powered vehicles, and then the invention is \n     halted, or made to disappear, because it gets people too good \n     gas mileage. Hydro engines are an example, and gasoline \n     engines that get 50 or more miles to the gallon. I witnessed \n     the electrical price increases every year for the last 15 \n     years. While the average citizen just has to sit by and take \n     it, I think it is criminal how those who govern the sources \n     of electricity and oil consider their resources a priceless \n     commodity, and are encouraged to increase the price of them \n     at a drop of a suggestion. It is interesting how we create \n     the need and dependency for electricity and oil, only to have \n     created a destructive power to control the price and supply \n     of the need.\n       Sometimes I consider the foresight of our forefathers \n     recognizing the impact that greed and pride which puts one's \n     value above another, how this concept seems to be the ever-\n     increasing normal opinion of controlling business, and how \n     they can take advantage of those who contribute to their \n     wealth. I believe the answers are already there, the \n     solutions of resource and need have already been developed, \n     but the pride of those who control outweighs the circumstance \n     of financial availability for the everyday person.\n       It is great to acknowledge that gas prices went \n     ridiculously high, but the reasons for them are at best made \n     to protect those who imposed the increases. I am constantly \n     reminded of the gas shortage of the late 1970s. People lined \n     up, only being allowed to purchase a few dollars of gas to \n     get to work. The biggest pretense for the reasoning power \n     behind this was to increase gas prices; there was NO shortage \n     then, there is NO shortage now. Those who have seen and know \n     the process of control understand how a little information is \n     necessary, but the full puzzle pieces kept from being put in \n     place can create loopholes and safety nets for those in the \n     controlling power of supply and demand. The public of America \n     does not know the amount of capped off and reserved oil wells \n     drilled 20, 30 or more years ago, here in America. We, as a \n     public, are not informed as to the actual amount of oil that \n     truly goes out of Alaska. One could surmise to the extent, \n     because of the `dividend' cash given to its residents for \n     over 20 years now.\n       America's, Idaho citizens see what is really going on; we \n     have just been conditioned to have the feeling we have no \n     power or say in how it goes in our favor. We have been taught \n     by the public system that government and its process are left \n     to elected officials; that supply and demand concepts are in \n     the control of those with the most material wealth and power.\n       If our elected officials really want to help make a \n     difference, then say what needs to be done and the process to \n     make it happen. The power of wealth may be strong, but the \n     power of numbers may overturn that philosophy one day. \n     History repeats itself often. America became America because \n     a repressed people sought to be free of ``tyranny.'' It is a \n     process of greed and power that creates tyranny, and so the \n     process will continue until the greed and power of those who \n     impose it on others cease.\n       I appreciate your time in hearing my thoughts on the \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Annette.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are on fixed income (retired). Our annual income is \n     about $50,000. All our vehicles are debt-free, but they are \n     1999 models. Our car gets 31 mpg, and the pickup gets 16 mpg. \n     We cannot afford to buy new more energy-efficient vehicles, \n     so if the auto industry suddenly produces a car that gets 40 \n     mpg, we cannot afford to buy it.\n       We have family in Denver and Alaska. We had planned to \n     travel to both places periodically, but cannot due to the \n     energy prices.\n       We do not have a choice to buy our gas at a reduction in \n     that all the stations in our town are basically at the same \n     rate per gallon (price fixing??).\n       Our house cost and household energy costs are rather stable \n     at this time so the excess funds needed for gas/diesel has to \n     be taken from our grocery bill and optional health care \n     elections that we may need.\n       The rhetoric about how Congress is going to fix matters--it \n     is not as simple as waving a magic wand. Nothing I have heard \n     thus far is immediate unless our Middle East ``friends'' \n     decide to be compassionate toward a country that has \n     volunteered to free them from the enslaving control of \n     dictators.\n       We need immediate relief . . . not platitudes about ``plans \n     on the horizon.'' Unfortunately, no one has made long range \n     energy plans and now we are paying for it.\n       Congress has succumbed to the environmentalists and has \n     forgotten ``Joe Average Citizen.''

FISCHER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to ask my colleagues \nto join me in recognizing Herb Fischer as he retires from a long and \ndistinguished career in education. His service and commitment to \nCalifornia's schoolchildren, and to his community, have provided an \nexample for us all.\n  Dr. Fischer received his undergraduate degree in business \nadministration from California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo. He later \nearned his teaching credential, master's degree, and doctorate from the \nUniversity of California, Riverside. Dr. Fischer served his 38-year \ncareer in education in San Bernardino County, beginning as a classroom \nteacher. He later served as a principal and district administrator in \nthe San Bernardino City Unified School District, where he remained for \n22 years. One of his chief accomplishments was his administrative \nsupport for San Bernardino City Unified's Desegregation and Integration \nMagnet School Program. This has been a model in providing quality \nprograms for all students and offers parents and students more \neducational choices. Dr. Fischer also served as superintendent of the \nColton Joint Unified School District for 7 years. There he directed a \nstaff of over 2,500 employees. In 1998 Dr. Fischer was elected to serve \nas County Superintendent, where he oversees the programs and operations \nof the County Superintendent of Schools Office, which has an annual \noperating budget of $250 million.\n  Under Dr. Fischer's leadership, the County Superintendent of Schools \nOffice has prioritized services to support school districts' efforts to \nimprove student performance and accountability. This has included \nclosing achievement and access gaps for underperforming schools and \nunderrepresented students, improving postsecondary education and career \nreadiness, and ensuring safe school campuses.\n  Among other accomplishments during Dr. Fischer's tenure, the County \nSuperintendent of Schools Office lead a county-wide emphasis to improve \nstudent performance collectively with district superintendents, \nresulting in increased scores on the State Academic Performance Index \nfor 7 consecutive years. He also was responsible for the construction \nof the county's first permanent school site, the Dorothy Gibson County \nHigh School in Ontario, and six additional schools to improve housing \nfor the 6,000-plus special and alternate education students served by \nthe county. Dr. Fischer also established three regional councils to \nprovide seamless education, and close access and achievement gaps for \nstudents, and launched the Alliance for Education initiative that has \nover 1,500 business, labor, community, and faith-based partners working \nwith public schools to improve the college, career, and labor readiness \nof students.\n  For his outstanding leadership and contributions to education and the \ncommunity, Dr. Fischer has been recognized by many organizations. He \nwas awarded the University of California, Riverside Alumni \nAssociation's prestigious Alumni Public Service Award for his service \nto the public sector. He has been recognized by the Rialto/Fontana \nChapter of the NAACP, the Victor Valley African American, and Inland \nEmpire Hispanic Chambers of Commerce for building collaborative \nrelationships to benefit the education of all students throughout San \nBernardino County.

I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join \nme in congratulating him on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7277-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRAISE FOR THANKSUSA AND TENNESSEE SONGWRITERS\n\n Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, today I praise the efforts of \nThanksUSA and two of Tennessee's outstanding songwriters, Leslie \nSatcher and Monty Holmes. This weekend, these parties will join \ntogether to perform a charity concert for our country's Armed Forces.\n  ThanksUSA is a nonpartisan charitable endeavor to encourage Americans \nof all ages to ``thank'' the men and women of the United States Armed \nForces by providing academic scholarships for their children and \nspouses. ThanksUSA offers two interconnected programs: the national \ntreasure hunt and the military family scholarship program. The treasure \nhunt raises awareness and money for the scholarship program.\n  This weekend's charity concert would not be possible without the \ntalent and performances of Ms. Leslie Satcher and Mr. Monty Holmes. In \nthe traditional Tennessee spirit, Ms. Satcher and Mr. Holmes have \nvolunteered to perform their own country music hits to entertain the \nattendees.\n  With dreams of making it big in country music, Satcher moved to \nNashville to put her song writing skills to the test. After a church \nfriend encouraged her to show her work to Larry Strickland and Naomi \nJudd, Satcher's career in country music officially began, and her \ndreams became a reality. Leslie is no stranger to charity concerts as \nshe is frequently found on stage performing for benefits with other \ncountry music celebrities.\n  Another gifted songwriter and performer, Monty Holmes, will join \nSatcher in the evening's benefit concert. At a young age, country music \nwas instilled in Monty Holmes. With a grandfather who played the \nfiddle, guitar and piano, Monty grew up with a love of music. As a \nyoung adult, Holmes moved to Nashville and quickly gained a reputation \nfor both his voice and his words. Writing songs for some of country \nmusic's greatest artists, Holmes quickly earned a prominent place in \ncountry music.\n  It is a privilege to serve in the Senate on behalf of Tennesseans \nsuch as Leslie Satcher and Monty Holmes, who personify the voluntarism \nand patriotism of Tennessee. Leslie and Monty have shared many stories, \nmemories, and inspirations through the mouthpiece of country music. I \nthank them and ThanksUSA for their efforts. I cannot think of a more \nvaluable way to express our gratitude for our troops than with the gift \nof education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7277-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7277-S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JUDY GORMAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations to a South Dakotan who has been very committed to the \neducational well-being of the young people in my State.\n  For the past 6 years, Judy Gorman has served as executive director of \nthe Department of Defense program, STARBASE. Exclusively designed for \nyoung adults, STARBASE provides science, math, technology and \nengineering skills through hands-on experience in aviation and space-\nrelated fields. She has served as an effective liaison with schools, \nmilitary, community, and business leaders and has worked tirelessly to \ndevelop a superb curriculum in the community of the Black Hills.\n  In early August, Judy will retire from the program she has worked so \nhard to promote and foster. While executive director she has overseen \n191 STARBASE classes of over 4,800 students, 2 manufacturing classes of \n35 students, and 5 ``Feel the Power'' graduate classes. Her dedication \nto the STARBASE program was grounded in a 23-year career as an \nelementary counselor, special educator, and fourth grade teacher in the \nRapid City Area Schools and Meade School District. She also has served \nas the administrator for Project Achieve, a summer youth program for \nat-risk teens in the Rapid City area. For many years she supported and \nguided her husband, Mike Gorman, in his excellent leadership as the \nAdjutant General of the South Dakota National Guard.\n  I commend Judy for her years of great stewardship with the STARBASE \nprogram. I had the privilege of touring the facilities a few years ago, \nwitnessing first-hand the importance of the program and commitment Judy \nbrings to her students. There are few better rewards for an educator \nthan witnessing countless students expanding their horizons, applying \nscience, math, and engineering in aviation and space-related fields of \nstudy. You may expect this from high school, college,\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nor graduate students, but Judy has been able to ``plant the seeds of \nlearning'' in the minds of fourth graders. Those seeds will undoubtedly \nresult in a bright future as these youngsters grow up to pursue their \ndreams and goals. Many will look fondly to Judy's great guidance and \ntutorship.\n  On the occasion of her retirement, I want to wish Judy all the best. \nI want to thank her for her tireless work and dedication to the \nSTARBASE program and her commitment to the youth of South Dakota. The \nlegacy of her work will rest in the minds of these young people, for \nwhich I thank her for her service on behalf of all South Dakotans, and \nwish her well in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7278-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING COUNCILMAN KEVIN KINGSTON\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Councilman \nKevin Kingston, Sr. of Slidell for his dedicated service to the State \nof Louisiana. I would like to take a few moments to remark on his \naccomplishments.\n  Mr. Kingston was born in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, but resided in \nSlidell since 1979. His nickname was ``Kingfish,'' and he was truly a \nman of the people. He owned Kingfish Seafood Market on Pontchartrain \nDrive and also ran Lil' Ray's Seafood Restaurant for 18 years until the \n1990s. Mr. Kingston had gusto for life and food; however, it was his \nservice on the City Council that gave him his greatest pleasure. He was \nelected in 1998 in District D representing west-northwest Slidell and \nin 2006 was elected to serve as Councilman-at-Large representing the \nentire city. In the past year, he took a special interest in helping a \nhandful of residents replace their storm-damaged mobile homes. His \nmeasure, which passed on the council's third try in almost 2 years, \namended a section in the city's zoning code that prohibited people from \nplacing new trailers in the city even if the old ones were destroyed by \nan act of God. A popular public servant and caregiver, he would often \npay people's water and light bills, gestures that displayed his big \nheart and kind spirit.\n  Kevin Kingston passed away Thursday, July 3, after a long battle with \nliver disease that included a liver transplant in 2003. He is survived \nby not only family members but also the grateful city of Slidell and \ncouncil who have lost a great man and great leader. Mr. Kingston opened \nhis heart to everyone he came in contact with and his generosity and \nfriendship will be deeply missed.\n  Thus, today, I honor a fellow Louisianan, Kevin Kingston, Sr., and \nthank him and his family for his dedicated service to our State and \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7278-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7278-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7278-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:16 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to enhance remedies for violations of intellectual \nproperty laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I was a Senator, I was a prosecutor, \nas the Chittenden County State's Attorney for 8 years, I prosecuted all \nvarieties of crime in Vermont. I know first hand how important it is \nfor criminal investigators, and the lawyers who prosecute those cases, \nto have a full arsenal of legal tools to ensure that justice is done. I \nalso know how important the intellectual property industries are to our \neconomy, and to our position as a global leader. In Vermont, Hubbardton \nForge makes beautiful, trademarked lamps. The Vermont Teddy Bear \nCompany relies heavily on its patented products. Likewise, SB \nElectronics needs patents for its film capacitor products. Burton's \nsnowboards and logo are protected by trademarks and patents.\n  While Vermont is closest to my heart, every state in the Nation has \nsuch companies, and every community\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\nin the United States is home to creative and productive people. \nIntellectual property--copyrights, patents, and trademarks--is critical \nto our fiscal health and to our continuing dominance of the world \neconomy. This valuable property is also terribly vulnerable; by its \nvery nature, it is subject to numerous types of thievery and \nmisappropriation. The Internet has brought great and positive change to \nall our lives, but it is also an unparalleled tool for piracy. The \nincreasing inter-connectedness of the globe, and the efficiencies of \nsharing information quickly and accurately between continents, has made \nforeign piracy and counterfeiting operations profitable in numerous \ncountries. Americans suffer when their intellectual property is stolen, \nthey suffer when those counterfeit goods displace sales of the \nlegitimate products, and they suffer when counterfeit products actually \nharm them, as is sometimes the case with fake pharmaceuticals and \nfaulty electrical products.\n  The time has come to bolster the Federal effort to protect this most \nvaluable and vulnerable property, to give law enforcement the resources \nand the tools it needs to combat piracy and counterfeiting, and to make \nsure that the many agencies that deal with intellectual property \nenforcement have the opportunity and the incentive to talk with each \nother, to coordinate their efforts, and to achieve the maximum effects \nfor their efforts. The Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act \nof 2008 does just that.\n  First, it gives the Department of Justice the ability to bring civil \nactions against anyone whose conduct constitutes criminal copyright \ninfringement. Many times, a criminal sanction is simply too severe for \nthe harm done. This provision, the concept of which has passed the \nSenate on three separate occasions as the PIRATE Act, gives the \nDepartment of Justice an extra tool.\n  Second, the bill enhances civil intellectual property rights law by \neliminating unnecessary burdens to instituting a suit; improving \nremedies; and applying the copyright and trademark laws not only to \nimported goods, but also to exported and transshipped items.\n  Third, the bill improves and harmonizes the forfeiture provisions in \ncopyright and counterfeiting cases.\n  Fourth, the bill addresses concerns that the current governmental \nstructure to coordinate intellectual property rights enforcement among \nagencies and departments is impeding the Government from reaching its \nfull potential. It creates a Coordinator within the Executive Office of \nthe President to chair an inter-agency committee that will produce a \nJoint Strategic Plan to combat piracy and counterfeiting.\n  Finally, the bill will increase the resources available to Federal, \nstate and local law enforcement.\n  We are not addressing theoretical concerns with this bill, nor are we \nmaking grandiose policy proclamations. We are synthesizing the real-\nworld experiences of our many constituents who develop and monetize \nintellectual property--the individuals and companies that turn their \ncreative and innovative efforts into jobs, goods, and services--with \nthe daily frustrations of law enforcement agents who lack the laws, and \nthe resources, to vindicate those property rights.\n  I was once a prosecutor. I am now a Senator. But I have always been a \nfan of movies. My cameo in the latest Batman movie, The Dark Knight, \nwas priceless to me, but we can put real numbers on the value of that \nproduction to the economy. The Dark Knight shot for 65 days in Chicago, \npouring almost $36 million into the local economy. Seventeen million \ndollars went to nearly 800 local vendors that were critical to the \nproduction of the movie. For example, one local lumber supplier \nemploying 40 people played a central role in the set construction that \nhelped transform Chicago into the mythical ``Gotham City.'' In order to \nfulfill the production needs of the film, the lumber company worked \nclosely with 15 other Illinois-based companies. Those 15 suppliers \nemployed an additional 350 workers.\n  All of that value is threatened by piracy. Just in the movie \nindustry, piracy costs 140,000 U.S. jobs and $5.5 billion in wages each \nyear. Piracy costs cities, towns and states an estimated $837 million \nin additional tax revenue each year. The movie industry alone produces \n$30.2 billion each year in revenue for 160,000 vendors all across the \nNation, and 85 percent of those vendors employ 10 people or fewer.\n  This is a well balanced bill, drawn from numerous conversations with \nall manner of interested parties. It brings together the best of \nnumerous proposals, including important legislation I introduced \nearlier this year with Senator Cornyn. His support on intellectual \nproperty matters is critical to our success moving forward. I thank \nhim, and all the cosponsors of this legislation for their efforts and \nsupport. This bill will improve the enforcement of our Nation's \nintellectual property laws, bolster our intellectual property-based \neconomy, and protect American jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3325\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today on the \nintroduction of the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act of \n2008, which I am sponsoring with Senator Leahy.\n  The United States has always placed a high value on creativity and \ninnovation. As a result, we rank number 1 for innovation in the World \nEconomic Forum's Global Competition Report. Yet, the U.S. does not even \nmake it into the ``top 20'' countries when it comes to the protection \nof intellectual property. When you consider that intellectual property \ncontributes over $5 trillion annually to our national economy, this is \nnot acceptable.\n  If we want to profit from our intellectual property, then we must \nprotect it. Counterfeiting and piracy, though, are on the rise. \nCounterfeiting, which at one time involved mainly ``knocking off' \nproducts in the high end and luxury goods markets, is now much more \npervasive. According to FBI, Interpol, World Customs Organization and \nInternational Chamber of Commerce estimates, roughly 7-8 percent of \nworld trade every year is in counterfeit goods. That is the equivalent \nof as much as $512 billion in global lost sales. Of that amount, U.S. \ncompanies annually lose between $200 billion and $250 billion in sales.\n  Counterfeiting, piracy, and the theft of intellectual property, are \nnot victimless crimes. Exporters face unfair competition abroad. Non-\nexporters face counterfeit imports at home. Businesses face legal, \nhealth and safety risks from the threat of counterfeit goods entering \ntheir supply chains. Consumers, too, face serious health and safety \nrisks.\n  For every legitimate product on the market, one can find a \ncounterfeit version, being passed off as the same quality at a fraction \nof the cost. Counterfeit products run the gamut from low end products \nsuch as razor blades, shampoos, batteries, and cigarettes to more \nspecialized products like auto and plane parts. Although these products \nmay look real, they are not subjected to the same quality protocols as \ntheir legitimate counterparts and a consumer--be they knowing or not--\nuses the product at their own risk. Counterfeit products that are \nsubstandard goods have been the subject of public recalls and seizures \nin industries ranging from food products both human and pet \nconsumables, pharmaceuticals both lifestyle and life-saving drugs, \naircraft or automobile parts, toys and baby furniture, and building and \nmanufacturing components. The potential for harm is very serious. Every \nday, our newspapers are filled with stories of the damage that \ncounterfeit products have caused.\n  Further, each counterfeit item that is manufactured overseas and \ndistributed in the United States costs American workers their jobs. \nAccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, overall intellectual \nproperty theft costs 750,000 U.S. jobs a year. These are losses that \ndirectly impact each and every person listening to my voice by \ninhibiting the growth of the American economy. Although private \nindustry is more vigilant than ever in pursuing infringers civilly and \ndevoting enormous amounts of human and financial capital to combat \nviolations of their intellectual property rights, the U.S. Government \nmust do its part to protect one of our Nation's most valuable assets.\n  Building on the work of the House with the Prioritizing Resources and \nOrganization of Intellectual Property Act of 2007, better known as the \nPRO-IP Act, and Senators Bayh and Voinovich with the Intellectual \nProperty Rights Enforcement Act, Senators Leahy and I have crafted a \ncomprehensive intellectual property that responds to that need.\n  This bill will provide the current and future administrations with \nthe additional tools it needs to combat intellectual property theft by, \namongst other things: Giving the Attorney General the authority, in \nlieu of a criminal action, to pursue a civil action for intellectual \nproperty infringement and collect damages and profits resulting from \ninfringement; enhancing the civil and criminal penalties for \nintellectual property violations in order to deter new criminal \norganizations from entering into ``the business'' of counterfeiting and \npiracy; elevating the intergovernmental coordination of intellectual \nproperty enforcement efforts; and authorizing funding for State and \nlocal governments for pursuing intellectual property related \ninvestigations.\n  Alan Greenspan stated in ``The Age of Turbulence'' that, ``Arguably, \nthe single most important economic decision our lawmakers and courts \nwill face in the next twenty-five years is to clarify the rules of \nintellectual property.''\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\n  Great legislation does not happen overnight--nor should it. When \nconsidering any reforms to something as valuable as our intellectual \nproperty assets--whether it is reforms to our Nations patents, \ntrademarks, or more relevantly to this group, copyright laws--we must \nact cautiously and with a careful understanding of the effects that any \nsuch changes will have on the interested industries. That said, I \nbelieve that we can work together in the few remaining days that is \nleft in this Congress in not just a bipartisan but a nonpartisan manner \nto pass and send this bill to the President this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 3324. A bill to provide leadership regarding science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics education programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the United States has been the most \ninnovative, technologically capable economy in the world. Yet our \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, education \nsystem is failing to ensure that children in our great Nation are \nentering the workforce with the skills and knowledge required for \nsuccess in the global economy of the 21st century. Meanwhile, the rest \nof the world is catching up. I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Coleman to introduce the Science, Technology, Engineering, and \nMathematics Education for the 21st Century Act. This legislation seeks \nto promote and coordinate existing science and technology education \nefforts and to improve the communication among various stakeholders so \nthat tomorrow's workforce will be prepared to continue the American \ntradition of innovation and enterprise. There are three pieces to this \nlegislation, which is based largely on the recommendations found in the \nNational Science Board's action plan on STEM education.\n  First, this legislation charters a new, independent, and non-Federal \nNational Council for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics \nEducation, which will coordinate and facilitate STEM education \ninitiatives across the Nation and inform policymakers and the public on \nthe state of STEM education across the United States. This council will \nbe housed in the National Academy of Sciences and will have a Board of \nDirectors comprised of representatives from the various State and local \ngovernments, organizations, businesses, and industries that have a \nstake in the success of STEM education. This includes current and \nformer governors, chief State school officers, representatives from \nlocal school boards, classroom teachers, school administrators, \nrepresentatives from institutions of higher education, private \nfoundations, and representatives of businesses and industries.\n  Much of the innovation and success in improving STEM education \nthroughout the country is being done locally, in the State's counties, \nand school systems, often partnering with businesses and industry in \nneed of a STEM-educated workforce. The Council will bring together \nthese various stakeholders to facilitate and coordinate the flow of \ninformation on STEM education systems to various stakeholders; to \nindependently evaluate the success of Federal and non-Federal STEM \ninitiatives; to fairly determine and promote best STEM classroom \npractices; to encourage the acquisition and retention of highly \neffective STEM teachers; and to inform policymakers and the general \npublic on the state of STEM education across the United States. More \nspecifically, the Council will also be responsible for issuing an \nannual report on the state of STEM education in America to the States, \nCongress, the Federal Government, and the general public; disseminating \nresults from research on teaching and learning in STEM fields to State \neducational agencies; helping the States establish their own Science, \nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education boards or councils; \nproposing models for the effective professional development of teachers \nin STEM fields; and launching and updating a publicly available website \nthat hosts a database consisting of information on scholarships, \nfellowships, grants, internships, and summer programs for both students \nand teachers.\n  Second, this bill authorizes a full standing Committee on Science, \nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education within the National \nScience and Technology Council, NSTC, which is part of the Executive \nOffice of the President. This committee would be responsible for \ncoordinating STEM education across all the Federal agencies involved in \nsuch efforts, including the National Laboratories, the Department of \nCommerce, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science \nFoundation, and NASA. Currently, the NSTC Committee on Science has a \nSubcommittee on Education and Workforce Development with jurisdiction \nover issues relating to STEM education. However, this subcommittee has \nbeen largely inactive: it rarely meets and has not been effective in \ncoordinating the efforts of these different agencies. Senator Coleman \nand I believe that the state of STEM education in the Nation today \nwarrants a full committee at the NSTC that will meet regularly to \nassess the effectiveness of such Federal efforts.\n  Finally in this legislation we direct the Secretary of Education to \nundergo a comprehensive review of all programs within the Department of \nEducation relating to education in science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics fields, and to evaluate them for their effectiveness. \nWe want to make sure that the current panoply of such programs are \neffective, target the students they are intended to target, are not \nunnecessarily redundant, complement State and local educational \nagencies, and are promoted effectively so that students, teachers, and \nparents know about these efforts. We also direct the Department to \nsubmit to Congress a plan for addressing the challenges they identify \nin this review.\n  I believe this legislation will help science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics education in this country, and will help \nstudents, parents, teachers, and other educators as we strive to \nprepare tomorrow's workforce for the global economy of the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to award \ngrants to local education agencies to improve college access; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to make it easier for students to reach college and to succeed \nin college. An educated workforce is crucial to the success of the \nAmerican economy, but too many students are not receiving a college \neducation. Of students who were in eighth grade in 2000, only 20 \npercent of the lowest-income students will earn a college degree by \n2012, compared to 68 percent of the highest income group. Every student \nwho wants to go to college should have that opportunity, and we should \nprovide them with the tools they need. Today, I am introducing the \nPathways to College Act, which creates grants for school districts to \nhelp them increase the number of low-income students who are entering \nand succeeding in college.\n  Lack of guidance and information about college has a real effect on \nstudents in poor schools. The Consortium on Chicago School Research \nrecently released a report called ``Potholes on the Road to College.'' \nThis report examines the difficulties faced by Chicago Public School \nstudents during the college application process. The Consortium \ndiscovered that only 41 percent of Chicago Public School students who \nwanted to go to college took the steps necessary to apply to and enroll \nin a 4-year college. Only one-third of students enrolled in a college \nthat matched their qualifications. Of the students who had the grades \nand test scores to attend a selective college, 29 percent went to a \ncommunity college or skipped college entirely.\n  But the most heartbreaking parts of this report are the profiles of \nsmart, ambitious students who find themselves helplessly lost in the \ncollege admissions process. One student, Amelia, worked hard in her \nclasses at Silverstein High School and dreamed of studying criminal \njustice. Amelia never received the help she needed to achieve her goal. \nThe wait was two weeks to see a guidance counselor, and so Amelia \nlearned about the process on her own. She did not apply for federal \nfinancial aid and ended up at a local community college where she \ndescribed the classes as easy and ``just like high school.''\n  The Pathways to College Act would create a grant program for school \ndistricts serving low-income students to increase their college-\nenrollment rates. The Consortium's ``Potholes'' report found that the \nmost important factor in whether students enroll in a four-year college \nis if they attended a school where teachers create a strong college-\ngoing culture and help students with the process of applying. The \nPathways to College Act would provide the funding to help school \ndistricts improve the college-going culture in schools and guide \nstudents through the college admissions process.\n  A school with a strong college culture is a school where the \nexpectation throughout the school is that every single student will go \nto college. Administrators, teachers, and staff members embrace and act \non that goal every day. With a grant through the Pathways to College \nAct, schools could train student leaders, integrate college planning \ninto the curriculum, and provide opportunities for college fairs, \ncollege tours, and workplace visits. Most\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nimportantly, teachers and counselors would be trained in post-secondary \nadvising so that they can motivate their students to reach for high \ngoals. Every school in the school district would incorporate these \nelements and others into a school-wide plan of action to strengthen the \ncollege-going culture.\n  KIPP Ascend Charter School in Chicago is a school that does this \nwell. A few weeks ago, a group of eighth grade students from KIPP came \nto my constituent coffee here in Washington. Each one was wearing a \nshirt that said ``I am college bound.'' Every child and each teacher \nbelieved the message on those shirts, and I did too. The facts prove we \nare all right. Eighty percent of students in the KIPP program nation-\nwide attend college. KIPP accomplishes this by training teachers to \nconstantly reinforce high college expectations. If you walk into a KIPP \nclassroom, you see college posters on the walls and hear college \ndiscussed as part of the day's lesson. If you ask the students about \ngoing to college, they will answer without hesitation and might tell \nyou about their last field trip to a local university. When you combine \nthose clear, high expectations with KIPP's rigorous college-preparatory \ncurriculum, you can understand their enormous success.\n  The Pathways to College Act will also give school districts the tools \nthey need to help students meet their high aspirations. Participating \nschool districts would provide each high school freshman with at least \none meeting with an advisor to discuss their goals post-graduation and \ncreate a plan to reach those goals. School districts would also educate \nstudents and families about the intricacies of the college application \nprocess and the federal financial aid application process. The average \nstudent-to-counselor ratio in high schools is 315 to one, but schools \ncould use grant money to hire more counselors and form partnerships \nwith community groups to help students with college applications and \nfinancial aid forms. School districts also consider could create \ncollege planning classes or establish a college access center in their \nschool.\n  The Pathways to College Act provides flexibility to school districts \nto achieve higher college enrollment rates, but requires that each \nschool accurately track their results so we can learn from what works. \nChicago Public Schools is doing a great job--both in tackling the \nproblem and in documenting progress. Under the leadership of CEO Arne \nDuncan, Chicago Public Schools responded aggressively to the \n``Potholes'' report. A team of postsecondary coaches were deployed in \nhigh schools to work with students and counselors. To ensure that \nfinancial aid is not a roadblock, FAFSA completion rates are tracked so \nthat counselors can follow-up with students. A spring-break college \ntour took 500 students to see colleges across the country. Because \nChicago Public Schools tracks its college enrollment rates, we know \nthat their efforts are working. Half of the 2007 graduating class \nenrolled in college, an increase of 6.5 percent in four years. The \nnational increase was less than one percent in the same time-frame. \nNationally, the number of African-American graduates going to college \nhas decreased by six percent over the last four years while the Chicago \nrate has increased by almost eight percent.\n  Applying to college is not easy. Low-income students often need the \nmost help to achieve their college dreams. When schools focus on \ncollege and provide the tools to get there, students make the \nconnection between the work they are doing now and their future goals \nin college and life. Students in those schools are more likely enroll \nin college and are also more likely to work hard in high school to be \nprepared for college when they arrive. The bill I am introducing today \ntries to ensure that lack of information never prevents a student from \nachieving his or her college dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pathways to College Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An educated workforce is crucial to the success of the \n     United States economy. Access to higher education for all \n     students is critical to maintaining an educated workforce. \n     More than 80 percent of the 23,000,000 jobs that will be \n     created in the next 10 years will require postsecondary \n     education. Only 36 percent of all 18- to 24-year olds are \n     currently enrolled in postsecondary education.\n       (2) Workers with bachelor's degrees earn on average $17,000 \n     more annually than workers with only high school diplomas. \n     Workers who earn bachelor's degrees can be expected to earn \n     $1,000,000 more over a lifetime than those who only finished \n     high school.\n       (3) The ACT recommends that schools--\n       (A) provide student guidance to engage students in college \n     and career awareness; and\n       (B) ensure that students enroll in a rigorous curriculum to \n     prepare for postsecondary education.\n       (4) The Department of Education reports that the average \n     student-to-counselor ratio in high schools is 315:1. This \n     falls far above the ratio recommended by the American School \n     Counselor Association, which is 250:1. While school \n     counselors at private schools spend an average of 58 percent \n     of their time on postsecondary education counseling, \n     counselors in public schools spend an average of 25 percent \n     of their time on postsecondary education counseling.\n       (5) While just 57 percent of students from the lowest \n     income quartile enroll in college, 87 percent of students \n     from the top income quartile enroll. Of students who were in \n     eighth grade in 2000, only 20 percent of the lowest-income \n     students are projected to attain a bachelor's degree by 2012, \n     compared to 68 percent of the highest income group, according \n     to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance in \n     2006.\n       (6) A recent report by the Consortium on Chicago School \n     Research found that only 41 percent of Chicago public school \n     students who aspire to go to college took the steps necessary \n     to apply to and enroll in a 4-year institution of higher \n     education. The report also reveals that only \\1/3\\ of Chicago \n     students who want to attend a 4-year institution of higher \n     education enroll in a school that matches their \n     qualifications. Even among students qualified to attend a \n     selective college, 29 percent enrolled in a community college \n     or did not enroll at all.\n       (7) The Consortium found that many Chicago public school \n     students do not complete the Free Application for Federal \n     Student Aid, even though students who apply for Federal \n     financial aid are 50 percent more likely to enroll in \n     college. Sixty-five percent of public secondary school \n     counselors at low-income schools believe that students and \n     parents are discouraged from considering college as an option \n     due to lack of knowledge about financial aid.\n       (8) Low-income and first-generation families often \n     overestimate the cost of tuition and underestimate available \n     aid; students from these backgrounds have access to fewer \n     college application resources and financial aid resources \n     than other groups, and are less likely to fulfill their \n     postsecondary plans as a result.\n       (9) College preparation intervention programs can double \n     the college-going rates for at-risk youth, can expand \n     students' educational aspirations, and can boost college \n     enrollment and graduation rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to improve \nthe State plan amendment option for providing home and community-based \nservices under the Medicaid program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, every day millions of Americans are faced \nwith significant challenges when it comes to meeting their own personal \nneeds or caring for a loved one who needs significant support. Many \nelderly Americans and individuals of all ages with disabilities need \nlong-term services and supports, such as assistance with dressing, \nbathing, preparing meals, and managing chronic conditions. They prefer \nto live and work in their community, and it is time that the Federal\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\nGovernment and states act as better partners to provide improved access \nto home- and community-based long-term care services HCBS.\n  The Medicaid program, administered by the states but jointly financed \nwith the Federal Government, is our Nation's largest payer for long-\nterm care services. Medicaid spends about $100 billion per year on \nlong-term services. Despite recognizing that per person spending is \nmuch lower in community settings, and that people generally prefer \ncommunity services, Medicaid still spends 61 percent of its long-term \nservices spending in institutional settings. This disparity is due, in \nlarge part, to a strong access and payment bias in the program for \ninstitutional care.\n  Where Medicaid does offer HCBS, it is often in short supply, with \nmore than 280,000 Medicaid beneficiaries on waiting lists for HCBS \nwaiver services. Further, eligibility for HCBS waiver services requires \nbeneficiaries to already have a very significant level of disability \nbefore gaining access they must meet a level of functional need that \nqualifies them for a nursing home. This not only contributes to the \nunmet needs of those in the community but it also prevents states from \nproviding services that can help prevent beneficiaries from one day \nrequiring high-cost institutional care. While institutionalized care \nmay be an appropriate choice for some, it should be just that: a choice \nthat individuals and families are allowed to make about the most \nappropriate setting for their own care.\n  The result of Medicaid's ``institutional bias'' is that, according to \nthe Georgetown Health Policy Institute, ``one in five persons living in \nthe community with a need for assistance from others has unmet needs, \nendangering their health and demeaning their quality of life.'' This is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  The lack of long-term care options available to families has a \nsignificant impact on their lives. Many of my constituents are \naffected, as are countless Americans across the country. Take the \nparents living in Newton who continue to wait for their physically \ndisabled daughter, Julia, to have the opportunity to live \nindependently. Julia is a young adult and instead of starting out on \nher own, she must watch as her peers move away and begin their \nindependent lives- something she yearns to do as well. Growing up, \nJulia was able to attend Newton schools and keep a similar schedule to \nother children in the community but now has limited social interaction, \nas there is no other option but to live at home with her parents. \nJulia's parents are her full time caregivers and would like to see her \nable to live in an environment more conducive to both her needs and \ntheir own. Community based care or home based care in an apartment she \ncould share with a roommate are options Julia and her parents would \nmutually benefit from. As the opportunities for the future grow for her \npeers, Julia's options continue to shrink because housing and home \nbased supports for adults with disabilities are limited at best. I have \nheard many stories similar to that of Julia, which emphasizes the \nurgency in which HCBS is needed. In addition to individual lives being \nput on hold, entire families must deal with the consequences of \ninadequate services available to their family members.\n  Access to HCBS affects individuals in all stages of life, including \nAmericans dealing with conditions such as Alzheimer's. Take Ann Bowers \nand Jay Sweatman for example. Without access to HCBS services, Jay, who \nsuffers from early onset Alzheimer's, was forced to first move into \nassisted living and then a nursing home. By the time Jay was approved \nfor HCBS it was too late and he was no longer able to live \nindependently. Ann had worked tirelessly to coordinate her husband's \ncare and get additional HCBS support but the process was so difficult \nthat by the time help came, it was simply too late. This is just one \ncase of many where early HCBS intervention would have not only saved \ntime, money, and stress for family members, but would have made a \nsignificant impact on the quality of life and personal independence for \nJay and Ann.\n  So today, I am introducing with my colleague from the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, the Empowered at Home Act, a bill that \nincreases access to home and community based services by giving states \nnew tools and incentives to make these services more available to those \nin need. It has four basic parts.\n  First, it will improve the Medicaid HCBS State Plan Amendment Option \nby giving states more flexibility in determining eligibility for which \nservices they can offer under the program, which will create greater \noptions for individuals in need of long-term supports. In return we ask \nthat states no longer cap enrollment and that services be offered \nthroughout the entire state.\n  Second, the bill ensures that the same spousal impoverishment \nprotections offered for new nursing home beneficiaries will be in place \nfor those opting for home and community based services. In addition, \nlow-income recipients of home and community based services will be able \nto keep more of their assets when they become eligible for Medicaid, \nallowing them to stay in their community as long as possible.\n  Third, the Empowered at Home Act addresses the financial needs of \nspouses and family members caring for a loved one by offering tax-\nrelated provisions to support family caregivers and promote the \npurchase of meaningful private long-term care insurance.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to improve the overall quality of home and \ncommunity based services available by providing grants for states to \ninvest in organizations and systems that can help to ensure a \nsufficient supply of high quality workers, promote health, and \ntransform home and community based care to be more consumer-centered.\n  I want to say a word about the Community Choice Act, legislation \nlong-championed by Senator Harkin that would make HCBS a mandatory \nbenefit in Medicaid. I am a strong supporter and co-sponsor of this \nlandmark legislation, and look forward to working for its enactment as \nsoon as possible. The legislation I am introducing today seeks to \nsupplement--not supplant--the Community Choice Act by increasing access \nto HCBS for those who are disabled but not at a sufficient level of \nneed to qualify for nursing home services. These two complimentary \nbills will finally make HCBS a right while vastly improving HCBS \navailability to vulnerable citizens of varying levels of disability.\n  I would also like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Empowered at Home Act and who have \nendorsed it today, including the National Council on Aging, the Arc of \nthe United States, United Cerebral Palsy, the American Association of \nHomes and Services for the Aging, the Alzheimer's Association, the \nNational Association of Area Agencies on Aging, the American Geriatrics \nSociety, ANCOR, the Trust for America's Health, and SEIU.\n  Improving access to a range of long term care services for the \nelderly and Americans of all ages with disabilities is an issue that \nmust not stray from the top of our Nation's health care priorities. I \nbelieve this legislation can move forward in a bi-partisan manner to \ndramatically improve access to high-quality home- and community-based \ncare for the millions of Americans who are not receiving the \nsignificant supports and services they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Kerry today to introduce the Empowered at Home Act. This bill \nis a continuation of efforts that I undertook in 2005 to improve access \nto home and community based services for those needing long-term care. \nThis is an important piece of legislation that continues our efforts to \nmake cost-effective home and community based care options more \navailable to those who need it.\n  In 2005, I introduced the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act with \nSenator Bayh. That legislation set forth a series of proposals aimed at \nimproving the accessibility of long-term care insurance and promoting \nawareness about the protection that long-term care insurance can offer. \nIt also sought to broaden the availability of the types of long-term \ncare services such as home and community-based care, which many people \nprefer to institutional care.\n  The year 2005 ended up being a very important year for health policy \nas it relates to Americans who need extensive care. In the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005, Congress passed into law the Family Opportunity \nAct, the Money Follows the Person initiative, and many critical pieces \nof the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act. With the bill I am \nintroducing today with Senator Kerry, I hope to set us on the path to \ncompleting the work we started in 2005.\n  Making our long-term care system more efficient is a critical goal as \nwe consider the future of health care. There are more than 35 million \nAmericans, roughly 12 percent of the U.S. population, over the age of \n65. This number is expected to increase dramatically over the next few \ndecades as the baby boomers age and life expectancy increases. \nAccording to the U.S. Administration on Aging, by the year 2030, there \nwill be more than 70 million elderly persons in the United States. As \nthe U.S. population ages, more and more Americans will require long-\nterm care services.\n  The need for long-term care will also be affected by the number of \nindividuals under the age of 65 who may require a lifetime of care. \nCurrently, almost half of all Americans who need long-term care \nservices are individuals with disabilities under the age of 65. This \nnumber includes over 5 million working-age adults and approximately \n400,000 children.\n  Long-term care for elderly and disabled individuals, including care \nat home and in nursing homes, represents almost 40 percent of Medicaid \nexpenditures. Contrary to general assumptions, it is Medicaid, not \nMedicare, that pays for the largest portion of long-term care for the \nelderly. Over 65 percent of Medicaid long-term care expenditures \nsupport elderly and disabled individuals in nursing facilities and \ninstitutions. Although most people who need long-term care prefer to \nremain at home, Medicaid spending for long-term care remains heavily \nweighted toward institutional care.\n  Section 6086 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171) \nwas based on the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act. The DRA \nprovision authorized a new optional benefit under Medicaid that allows \nStates to extend home and community-based services to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries under the section 1915(i) Home and Community-Based \nServices State Option. Under this authority, States can offer Medicaid-\ncovered home and community-based services under a State's Medicaid plan \nwithout obtaining a section 1915(c) home and community-based waiver. \nEligibility for these section 1915(i) services may be extended only to \nMedicaid beneficiaries already enrolled in the program whose income \ndoes not exceed 150 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  To date, only one State, my own State of Iowa, has sought to take \nadvantage of the provision authorized through the DRA. While we had \nhoped far more States would participate, we know that the relatively \nlow income cap, 150 percent, in the DRA provision creates an \nadministrative complexity that has not made the option appealing for \nStates.\n  In this bill we are introducing today, the income eligibility \nstandard would be raised for access to covered services under section \n1915(i) to persons who qualify for Medicaid because their income does \nnot exceed a specified level established by the State up to 300 percent \nof the maximum Supplemental Security Income, SSI, payment applicable to \na person living at home. This will significantly increase the number of \npeople eligible for these services. States will be able to align their \ninstitutional and home and community-based care income eligibility \nlevels.\n  The bill would also establish two new optional eligibility pathways \ninto Medicaid. These groups would be eligible for section 1915(i) home \nand community-based services as well as services offered under a \nState's broader Medicaid program. Under this bill, States with an \napproved 1915(k) State plan amendment would have the option to extend \nMedicaid eligibility to individuals: (1) who are not otherwise eligible \nfor medical assistance; (2) whose income does not exceed 300 percent of \nthe supplemental security income benefit rate; and (3) who would \nsatisfy State-established needs-based criteria based upon a State's \ndetermination that the provision of home and community-based services \nwould reasonably be expected to prevent, delay, or decrease the need \nfor institutionalized care. Under this new eligibility pathway, States \ncould choose to either limit Medicaid benefits to those home and \ncommunity-based services offered under section 1915(k) or allow \neligibles to access services available under a State's broader Medicaid \nprogram in addition to the 1915(k) benefits. These changes will give \nthe States the option of exploring the use of an interventional use of \nhome and community-based services. If States have the flexibility to \nprovide the benefit as contemplated in the bill, they can try to delay \nthe need for institutional care and people in their homes longer.\n  As the number of Americans reaching retirement age grows \nproportionally larger, ultimately the number of Americans needing more \nextensive care will grow. Many of those Americans will look to Medicaid \nfor assistance. States need more tools to provide numerous options to \npeople in need so that they can stay in their own homes as long as \npossible.\n  The cost of providing long-term care in an institutional setting is \nfar more expensive care than providing care in the home. States will \nbenefit from having options before them that allow them to keep people \nappropriately in home settings longer. The more States learn how to use \nthose tools, the more states and ultimately the Federal taxpayer will \nbenefit from reduced costs for institutional care.\n  I am also pleased that this bill will include key provisions from S. \n2337, the Long-Term Care Affordability and Security Act of 2007. The \nbill includes important tax provisions that I introduced in previous \nCongresses as well--most recently, the Improving Long-term Care Choices \nAct of 2005, introduced in the 109 Congress.\n  Research shows that the elderly population will nearly double by \n2030. By 2050, the population of those aged 85\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nand older will have grown by more than 300 percent. Research also shows \nthat the average age at which individuals need long-term care services, \nsuch as home health care or a private room at a nursing home, is 75. \nCurrently, the average annual cost for a private room at a nursing home \nis more than $75,000. This cost is expected to be in excess of $140,000 \nby 2030.\n  Based on these facts, we can see that our Nation needs to prepare its \ncitizens for the challenges they may face in old age. One way to \nprepare for these challenges is by encouraging more Americans to obtain \nlong-term care insurance coverage. To date, only 10 percent of seniors \nhave long-term care insurance policies, and only 7 percent of all \nprivate-sector employees are offered long-term care insurance as a \nvoluntary benefit.\n  Under current law, employees may pay for certain health-related \nbenefits, which may include health insurance premiums, co-pays, and \ndisability or life insurance, on a pre-tax basis under cafeteria plans \nand flexible spending arrangements, ``FSAs''. Essentially, an employee \nmay elect to reduce his or her annual salary to pay for these benefits, \nand the employee doesn't pay taxes on the amounts used to pay these \ncosts. Employees, however, are explicitly prohibited from paying for \nthe cost of long-term care insurance coverage tax free.\n  Our bill would allow employers, for the first time, to offer \nqualified long-term care insurance to employees under FSAs and \ncafeteria plans. This means employees would be permitted to pay for \nqualified long-term care insurance premiums on a tax-free basis. This \nwould make it easier for employees to purchase long-term care \ninsurance, which many find unaffordable. This should also encourage \nyounger individuals to purchase long-term care insurance. The younger \nthe person is at the time the long-care insurance contract is \npurchased, the lower the insurance premium.\n  Our bill also allows an individual taxpayer to deduct the cost of \ntheir long-term care insurance policy. In other words, the individual \ncan reduce their gross income by the premiums that they pay for a long-\nterm care policy, and therefore, pay less in taxes. This tax benefit \nfor long-term care insurance should encourage more individuals to \npurchase these policies. It certainly makes a policy more affordable, \nespecially for younger individuals. This would allow a middle-aged \ntaxpayer to start planning for the future now.\n  Finally, a provision that is included in our bill that I am really \nproud of is one that provides a tax credit to long-term caregivers. \nLong-term caregivers could include the taxpayer, him- or herself. \nSenator Kerry and I recognize that these taxpayers--who have long-term \ncare needs, yet are taking care of themselves--should be provided extra \nassistance. Also, taxpayers taking care of a family member with long-\nterm care needs would also be eligible for the tax credit. These \ntaxpayers should be given a helping hand. As our population continues \nto age, the least that we can do is provide a tax benefit for these \nstruggling individuals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 3330. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe deduction for domestic production activities for film and \ntelevision productions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto stimulate domestic film production and create jobs. I am pleased to \nbe joined by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.\n  Our bill, the Domestic Film Production Equity Act of 2008, would \nexpand a tax deduction, known as the section 199 domestic production \nincentive, for qualifying U.S. film producers.\n  In 2008, this deduction will be worth 6 percent of a domestic \nmanufacturer's qualifying production activities. It will increase to \nnine percent in 2010.\n  Specifically, our bill would expand the production incentive to allow \nstudios to include wages paid to full-time short-term employees, \nincluding U.S. actors, writers, directors, and production personnel in \ndetermining the limit on the deduction amount.\n  The bill will treat films produced by partnerships between several \nstudios as qualified property, each partner must have at least 20 \npercent interest in a project to qualify.\n  The bill will deduct income from the licensing of copyrights and \ntrademarks relating to films; and lastly, the bill will deduct income \nfrom films and TV programs broadcast over the Internet.\n  Most film production companies receive only a limited benefit from \nthe production incentive because the industry relies heavily on short-\nterm contract work, and because many films are produced by multiple \nstudios through partnerships.\n  As a matter of fairness, these domestic production incentives should \nbe extended to fully benefit an industry that employs over 1.3 million \nAmericans.\n  Filming a movie is different than traditional domestic manufacturing \nbecause short-term contract workers, including actors, writers, \ndirectors, and production personnel often work full-time on projects; \nmultiple studios often produce one project; studios generate \nsignificant licensing fees associated with copyrights and trademarks \nrelated to films; and a number of media, including the Internet may be \nused to view each film or production.\n  Our bill takes these circumstances into account to modernize this \nsection of the tax code.\n  The film industry is an important asset to the American economy.\n  More than 1.3 million Americans work in motion picture and television \nproduction.\n  In 2005, these jobs provided $30.24 billion in wages, with employees \nearning an average salary of $73,000.\n  Of these employees, 231,000 were short-term contractors, often \nworking multiple projects each year.\n  California was the primary location for 365 film productions in 2005. \nThis generated $42.2 billion in economic activity for my State.\n  Our bill would help studios continue to provide opportunities to \nthese talented actors, writers, directors, and production personnel in \nAmerica.\n  Expanding the Section 199 deduction to include these four categories \nis also a response to the competitive business of captivating an \nincreasingly technology-adept viewing audience.\n  The film industry, like the music industry, is increasingly seeing \ntheir sales move to digital formats via the internet. On iTunes--an \nonline digital music store operated by Apple--around 50,000 movies are \nrented or sold each day.\n  Moreover, by not allowing film studios to take advantage of domestic \nproduction tax incentives, we risk losing more operations abroad.\n  For example, Canada currently provides domestic film producers with a \ntax credit worth 15 percent of qualifying production costs. Foreign \nstudios with operations in Canada may also receive a tax credit worth \nup to 16 percent of wages paid to Canadian residents.\n  The film industry plays a unique role in our society.\n  The world recognizes Hollywood as the center of the entertainment \nindustry. Millions of tourists annually travel from across the globe to \nvisit the sites that embody the golden age of film.\n  Hollywood film studios are American institutions that continue to \nproduce some of the finest films in the world.\n  Needless to say, it is critical that studios continue to film in my \nState and across the country. If not, the golden age of Hollywood and \nthe economic activity it brings may be a part of the past.\n  We are fortunate to have a vibrant domestic film industry.\n  This legislation will help ensure that the U.S. entertainment \nindustry continues to be the world leader.\n  American workers and our economy stand to benefit.\n  Efforts to expand the production incentive for domestic films have \nenjoyed broad bi-partisan support. Our bill is similar to a provision \nincluded in the tax extenders package which passed the House \noverwhelmingly by a vote of 263-160 in May.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will move quickly to enact this much-\nneeded modernization of the tax code.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\n                                S. 3330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \nthat the payment of the manufacturers' excise tax on recreational \nequipment be paid quarterly; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my friend \nSenator Crapo to introduce an important piece of legislation that would \nhelp to strengthen the financial health of America's firearm and \nammunition manufacturers, who in turn support wildlife conservation in \nAmerica.\n  The firearm and ammunition industry pays a Federal excise tax of 11 \npercent on long guns and ammunition and 10 percent on handguns. The Tax \nand Trade Bureau in the Treasury Department collects this tax. The \nBureau sends the proceeds to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, where \nthey are deposited into the Wildlife Restoration Trust Fund, also known \nas the Pittman-Robertson Trust Fund.\n  The tax is a major source of conservation funding in America. Since \n1991, the firearm and ammunition industry has contributed about $3 \nbillion to the Pittman-Robertson Fund.\n  Of all the industries that pay excise taxes on the sale of their \nproducts to support wildlife conservation efforts, firearms and \nammunition manufacturers are the only ones that have to pay excise \ntaxes every 2 weeks. Other industries, such as archery and fishing, pay \ntheir tax every 3 months.\n  This frequent payment obligation imposes a costly and inequitable \nburden on the firearms and ammunition industry. Manufacturers spend \nthousands of additional man-hours just to administer the paperwork \nassociated with making the bi-weekly excise payments.\n  According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, changing the \ndeposit schedule from a bi-weekly to quarterly payment would save the \nindustry an estimated $21.6 million dollars a year. That's money that \nthe industry could use for investment in researching and developing new \nproducts, purchasing new manufacturing plants and equipment, and \ncommunicating with the hunting and shooting sports community.\n  Let me take a moment to explain what this legislation does not do. It \ndoes not reduce the firearm and ammunition industry's excise tax rates. \nIt simply adds fairness to the tax code.\n  It is important for my Colleagues to understand the history and \nnature of the firearm and ammunition excise tax. During the Great \nDepression, hunters and conservationists recognized that overharvesting \nof wildlife would destroy America's treasured wildlife and natural \nhabitats. Sportsmen, state wildlife agencies, and the firearm and \nammunition industries lobbied Congress to extend the existing 10 \npercent excise tax and impose a new 11 percent excise tax to create a \nnew fund. The fund was called the Pittman-Robertson Trust Fund after \nSenator Key Pittman of Nevada and Representative A. Willis Robertson of \nVirginia. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the legislation into \nlaw in 1937.\n  The industry, hunters, and conservationists came together to create \nthis structure. They recognized the importance of conservation. And \nthey encouraged Congress to impose a tax on their guns and ammo. It is \na rare thing when taxpayers ask to be taxed. But preserving our \ncountry's wildlife habitat was and continues to be that important.\n  Today, more than $700 million each year is generated and used \nexclusively to establish, restore, and protect wildlife habitats.\n  Now let me explain the effect that the bill we are introducing today \nwould have on the Pittman-Robertson Trust Fund. As the Joint Committee \non Taxation explained in its revenue estimate, the net budget effect to \nthe fund is $4 million. This is purely a result of the shift in the \ntiming of collections, from bi-weekly to quarterly, over a 10-year \nbudget window. Consumers of firearms and ammunition would still pay the \nexact same amount of tax.\n  The firearm and ammunition industry recognizes the 10-year $4 million \nloss to the trust fund. The industry developed a comprehensive 5-year \nproposal to ease this effect. Under the proposal, the industry would \ncontribute $150,000 a year for the next 5 years, a total of $750,000, \nto the fund.\n  These actions again show the partnership between hunters, \nconservation groups, and the firearm and ammunition industry to protect \nconservation programs and initiatives. That is why this legislation is \nsupported by the following groups: Archery Trade Association; \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies; Boon and Young; \nCongressional Sportsmen's Foundation; Delta Waterfowl; Ducks Unlimited; \nNational Rifle Association; National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc.; \nNational Wild Turkey Federation; North American Wetlands Conservation \nCouncil; Pheasants Forever; Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation; Safari Club \nInternational; Wildlife Management Institute; U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService; U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance.\n  I urge my Colleagues to support this legislation. I hope that we can \ncome together, just as the industry, hunters, and conservation groups \nhave, to pass this legislation. It's a matter of tax fairness. Let us \ndo our part to correct this inequity in the tax code. Let us do our \npart to support an American business that in turn supports wildlife \nhabitat restoration and conservation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 3333. A bill to amend the Whaling Convention Act so that it \nexpressly applies to aboriginal subsistence whaling, and in particular, \nauthorizes the Secretary of Commerce to set bowhead whale catch limits \nin the event that the IWC fails to adopt such limits; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, currently, annual catch limits for \nsubsistence whaling by Alaskan natives is set through periodic \nnegotiations of the international whaling commission. In setting the \nquota, the IWC has tremendous power to influence the lives--even the \nsurvival--of these aboriginal communities.\n  For over 30 years I have worked with the International Whaling \nCommission to secure the right for native Alaskans to hunt bowhead \nwhales and preserve their subsistence lifestyle. Currently, native \nAlaskans living in 10 villages on Alaska's north slope and St. Lawrence \nIsland carry forward an ancient tradition of harvesting small numbers \nof bowhead whales. Not only do these whales serve as a primary source \nof food for the communities, but they define their very identity and \nculture.\n  The Alaska natives who rely on this subsistence hunt have complied \nwith the mandates passed down from the IWC to ensure a sustainable and \nhumane harvest. In fact, since the IWC\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\nbegan regulating these catches, the number of bowhead whales in the \nArctic has risen substantially.\n  The IWC, however, may not always produce the bowhead quota upon which \nAlaska natives depend due to political games. Over the last several \nyears, I have seen other nations attempt to influence the U.S. position \non other whaling issues at the IWC by specifically interfering with the \nnative Alaskans bowhead quota votes. This is unacceptable. Any \npositions on whaling issues under IWC's purview need to be debated on \ntheir own merits. It is unthinkable to allow other countries to use The \nhealth and welfare of our Alaska natives, whose lives depend on this \nhunt, as leverage for influencing U.S. positions on other IWC matters.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing will ensure that native Alaskans \nmaintain their rights to engage in subsistence whaling--an ancient \npractice vital to their culture and survival. This bill would amend the \nWhaling Convention Act of 1949 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce \nto issue bowhead whale catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling \nin Alaska native communities.\n  This bill ensures that the U.S. will continue to seek and negotiate \nbowhead whaling quota through the IWC. But if the IWC is unable to \nissue bowhead whaling quota, the Secretary of Commerce could then issue \ndomestic aboriginal subsistence whaling permits. Such action would need \nto ensure consistency with IWC rules on subsistence whaling ensuring \nsafe, sustainable, and humane hunts, and the harvest must not exceed \nthe original subsistence needs recommended by the U.S.\n  The IWC has the great responsibility of ensuring that any subsistence \nwhaling, now or in the future, is carried out in a scientifically sound \nand sustainable manner. I continue to support the IWC's efforts on this \nvital issue. yet the United States must also protect the rights of our \nnative communities to continue their ancient subsistence bowhead \nharvesting. This bill strikes the proper balance between supporting IWC \nwork and protecting our Alaska native communities. I thank my \ncolleagues for considering this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7301-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 622--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 7, \n2008, AS ``NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. \nByrd, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, \nMr. Cornyn, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nNelson of Florida, Mr. Obama, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Specter, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wicker) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Lander first began \n     construction in 1858: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the important role of the \n     Lander Trail in the settlement of the Western United States \n     on the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Lander Trail.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a part of \nWyoming's history that is celebrating its one hundred and fiftieth \nanniversary this year. The Lander Trail, which runs for 256 miles from \nSouth Pass, WY, to Fort Hall, ID, was an important part of the \nexpansion of the American West in the 1800s when people took up the \nchallenge to ``go west'' and settle new territory. In 1858, Frederick \nW. Lander began surveying and construction for the first federally \nfunded road west of the Mississippi to provide a better route for \nemigrants headed to California, Oregon, and a new life on the frontier. \nToday, I would like to recognize the historical role the Lander Trail \nplayed in Wyoming and the American West.\n  It was tough going for emigrants going west in the 1850s. The \ndangerous journey halfway across the country could take 6 months or \nmore. After the Lander Trail was completed, it was a better road \nthrough easier territory. Emigrants headed to California or Oregon \ncould cut 7 days off their journey by following the Lander Trail, and \nthere were good sources of food, water, and forage for livestock along \nthe way. Thirteen thousand people traveled the Lander Trail on their \nway to homestead in western territories or to pan for gold in \nCalifornia. The Lander Trail is part of the National Historic Trails \nsystem and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n  The Lander Trail can still be seen today in Wyoming and the land \nlooks almost the same as it did when Frederick Lander first started \nsurveying it. The work of groups in Wyoming like the Lander Trail \nFoundation have ensured that the history of this unique piece of my \nState is being preserved and that people today can go and see and \nexperience the Lander Trail. I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the role that the Lander Trail has played in the history of \nmy State of Wyoming and the settlement of the American West.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/24/senate-section/article/S7301-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7301-S7304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5114.

POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) the United States is blessed with abundant energy \n     resources on the outer Continental Shelf and has developed a \n     comprehensive framework of environmental laws and regulations \n     and fostered the development of state-of-the-art technology \n     that allows for the responsible development of these \n     resources for the benefit of its citizenry;\n       (2) Adjacent States are required by the circumstances to \n     commit significant resources in support of exploration, \n     development, and production activities for mineral resources \n     on the outer Continental Shelf, and it is fair and proper for \n     a portion of the receipts from such activities to be shared \n     with Adjacent States and their local coastal governments;\n       (3) the existing laws governing the leasing and production \n     of the mineral resources of the outer Continental Shelf have \n     reduced the production of mineral resources, have preempted \n     Adjacent States from being sufficiently involved in the \n     decisions regarding the allowance of mineral resource \n     development, and have been harmful to the national interest;\n       (4) the national interest is served by granting the \n     Adjacent States more options related to whether or not \n     mineral leasing should occur in the outer Continental Shelf \n     within their Adjacent Zones;\n       (5) it is not reasonably foreseeable that exploration of a \n     leased tract located more than 25 miles seaward of the \n     coastline, development and production of a natural gas \n     discovery located more than 25 miles seaward of the \n     coastline, or development and production of an oil discovery \n     located more than 50 miles seaward of the coastline will \n     adversely affect resources near the coastline;\n       (6) transportation of oil from a leased tract might \n     reasonably be foreseen, under limited circumstances, to have \n     the potential to adversely affect resources near the \n     coastline if the oil is within 50 miles of the coastline, but \n     such potential to adversely affect such resources is likely \n     no greater, and probably less, than the potential impacts \n     from tanker transportation because tanker spills usually \n     involve large releases of oil over a brief period of time; \n     and\n       (7) among other bodies of inland waters, the Great Lakes, \n     Long Island Sound, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Albemarle \n     Sound, San Francisco Bay, and Puget Sound are not part of the \n     outer Continental Shelf, and are not subject to leasing by \n     the Federal Government for the exploration, development, and \n     production of any mineral resources that might lie beneath \n     them.\n\n     SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS UNDER THE SUBMERGED LANDS ACT.\n\n       Section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) by striking all \n     after ``seaward to a line'' and inserting ``twelve nautical \n     miles distant from the coast line of such State;'';\n       (2) by striking out paragraph (b) and redesignating the \n     subsequent paragraphs in order as paragraphs (b) through (g);\n       (3) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (g) (as \n     so redesignated) and inserting ``; and'';\n       (4) by adding the following: ``(i) The term `Secretary' \n     means the Secretary of the Interior.''; and\n       (5) by defining ``State'' as it is defined in section 2(r) \n     of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331(r)).\n\n     SEC. 104. SEAWARD BOUNDARIES OF STATES.\n\n       Section 4 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1312) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence by striking ``original'', and in \n     the same sentence by striking ``three geographical'' and \n     inserting ``twelve nautical''; and\n       (2) by striking all after the first sentence and inserting \n     the following: ``Extension and delineation of lateral \n     offshore State boundaries under the provisions of this Act \n     shall follow the lines used to determine the Adjacent Zones \n     of coastal States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \n     to the extent such lines extend twelve nautical miles for the \n     nearest coastline.''\n\n     SEC. 105. EXCEPTIONS FROM CONFIRMATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                   STATES' TITLE, POWER, AND RIGHTS.\n\n       Section 5 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1313) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (a) through (c) in order as \n     paragraphs (1) through (3);\n       (2) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``There is excepted''; and\n       (3) by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Exception of Oil and Gas Mineral Rights.--There is \n     excepted from the operation of sections 3 and 4 all of the \n     oil and gas mineral rights for lands beneath the navigable \n     waters that are located within the expanded offshore State \n     seaward boundaries established under this Act.

All existing Federal oil and gas leases within the \n     expanded offshore State seaward boundaries shall continue \n     unchanged by the provisions of this Act, except as otherwise \n     provided herein. However, a State may exercise all of its \n     sovereign powers of taxation within the entire extent of its \n     expanded offshore State boundaries.''.\n\n     SEC. 106.

The date of receipt \n     by the Secretary of such concurrence by the Neighboring State \n     shall constitute the date of receipt of the petition for that \n     area for which the concurrence applies.\n       ``(B) Limitations on leasing.--In its petition, a State \n     with an Adjacent Zone that contains leased tracts may \n     condition new leasing for oil and gas, or natural gas for \n     tracts within 25 miles of the coastline by--\n       ``(i) requiring a net reduction in the number of production \n     platforms;\n       ``(ii) requiring a net increase in the average distance of \n     production platforms from the coastline;\n       ``(iii) limiting permanent surface occupancy on new leases \n     to areas that are more than 10 miles from the coastline;\n       ``(iv) limiting some tracts to being produced from shore or \n     from platforms located on other tracts; or\n       ``(v) other conditions that the Adjacent State may deem \n     appropriate as long as the Secretary does not determine that \n     production is made economically or technically impracticable \n     or otherwise impossible.\n       ``(C) Action by secretary.--Not later than 90 days after \n     receipt of a petition under subparagraph (A), the Secretary \n     shall approve the petition, unless the Secretary determines \n     that leasing the area would probably cause serious harm or \n     damage to the marine resources of the State's Adjacent Zone. \n     Prior to approving the petition, the Secretary shall complete \n     an environmental assessment that documents the anticipated \n     environmental effects of leasing in the area included within \n     the scope of the petition.\n       ``(D) Failure to act.--If the Secretary fails to approve or \n     deny a petition in accordance with subparagraph (C) the \n     petition shall be considered to be approved 90 days after \n     receipt of the petition.\n       ``(E) Amendment of the 5-year leasing program.--\n     Notwithstanding section 18, within 180 days of the approval \n     of a petition under subparagraph (C) or (D), after the \n     expiration of the time limits in paragraph (1)(B), the \n     Secretary shall amend the current 5-Year Outer Continental \n     Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program to include a lease sale or \n     sales for at least 75 percent of the associated areas, unless \n     there are, from the date of approval, expiration of such time \n     limits, as applicable, fewer than 12 months remaining in the \n     current 5-Year Leasing Program in which case the Secretary \n     shall include the\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\n     associated areas within lease sales under the next 5-Year \n     Leasing Program.

IMMEDIATE STEPS TO CONSERVE GASOLINE ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Immediate Steps to Conserve Gasoline Act''.\n       (b) Federal Conservation of Gasoline.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) each day, as Americans contend with rising gasoline \n     prices, personal stories reflect the ways in which Americans \n     are altering their family budgets, including food budgets, to \n     cope with record high gasoline costs;\n       (B) as a consequence of economic pressures, Americans are \n     taking initiatives to reduce consumption of gasoline, such \n     as--\n       (i) driving less frequently;\n       (ii) altering daily routines; and\n       (iii) changing, or even cancelling, family vacation plans;\n       (C) the conservation efforts being taken by Americans, on \n     their own initiative, bring hardships but save funds that can \n     be redirected--\n       (i) to meet essential family needs; and\n       (ii) to relieve, to some extent, the demand for gasoline;\n       (D) just as individuals are taking initiatives to reduce \n     gasoline consumption, the Federal Government, including \n     Congress, should take initiatives to conserve gasoline;\n       (E) such Government-wide initiatives to conserve gasoline \n     would send a signal to Americans that the Federal \n     Government--\n       (i) recognizes the burdens imposed by unprecedented \n     gasoline costs; and\n       (ii) will participate in activities to reduce gasoline \n     consumption;\n       (F) an overall reduction of gasoline consumption by the \n     Federal Government by even 3 percentage points would send a \n     strong signal that, as a nation, the United States is working \n     to conserve energy;\n       (G) in 2005, policies directed at reducing the usage of \n     energy in Federal agency and department buildings by 20 \n     percent by 2015, at a rate of a 2-percent reduction per \n     calendar year, were enacted by the President and Congress;\n       (H) in 2007, policies increasing the energy reduction goal \n     to 30 percent by 2015, at a rate of a 3-percent reduction per \n     calendar year, were enacted by the President and Congress; \n     and\n       (I) Congress and the President should extend the precedent \n     of those mandatory conservation initiatives taken in 2005 and \n     2007 to usage by the Federal Government of gasoline.\n       (2) Reduction of gasoline usage by federal departments and \n     agencies.--For fiscal year 2009, each Federal department and \n     agency shall develop and carry out initiatives to reduce by \n     not less than 3 percent the annual consumption of gasoline by \n     the department or agency.\n       (3) Congressional conservation of gasoline.--For fiscal \n     year 2009, Congress shall develop and carry out initiatives \n     to reduce by not less than 3 percent the annual consumption \n     of gasoline by Congress.\n       (c) Studies and Reports on National Speed Limit and Future \n     Gasoline Conservation.--\n       (1) National speed limit.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Energy \n     Information Administration shall conduct, and submit to \n     Congress a report describing the results of, a study of the \n     potential transportation fuel savings of imposing a national \n     speed limit on highways on the Interstate System of 60 miles \n     per hour.\n       (B) Inclusions.--The study under subparagraph (B) shall \n     include--\n       (i) an examination of the fuel efficiency of automobiles in \n     use as of the date on which the study is conducted;\n       (ii) a description of the range at which those automobiles \n     are most fuel-efficient on highways on the Interstate System;\n       (iii) an analysis of actions carried out by the Federal \n     Government, with the full support of Congress, during the \n     1973-1974 energy crisis, resulting in a national speed limit \n     on highways on the Interstate System of 55 miles per hour, \n     which remained in effect until 1995;\n       (iv) a recognition that in 1974, when fewer than \n     137,000,000 cars traveled in the United States (as compared \n     to 250,000,000 cars in 2006) and only 30 percent of United \n     States oil was imported from foreign sources (as compared to \n     60 percent of oil so imported on the date of enactment of \n     this Act), 167,000 barrels of oil per day were saved by the \n     imposition of a national speed limit, such that greater \n     savings are possible on the date of enactment of this Act \n     than the savings realized in 1974; and\n       (v) a determination of whether a limitation on the national \n     speed limit on highways on the Interstate System similar to \n     the limitation described in clause (iii) could serve as a \n     model to generate gasoline savings, through a national speed \n     limit on highways on the Interstate System of 60 miles per \n     hour, given the improved fuel efficiency of automobile \n     engines in use on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Future gasoline conservation.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct, and submit to the Committees on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Environment and \n     Public Works, and Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate \n     and the Committees on House Administration, Transportation \n     and Infrastructure, and Energy and Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives a report describing the results of, a study \n     to determine whether additional gasoline reduction measures \n     by Federal departments and agencies and Congress are \n     technically feasible.\n       (B) Inclusion.--The report under subparagraph (A) shall \n     include a proposed schedule of future gasoline reduction \n     measures, if the measures are determined to be technically \n     feasible.\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5164.
