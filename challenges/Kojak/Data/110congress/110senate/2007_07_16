Today, when we finish morning business, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. \nAs we announced, there will be no rollcall votes tonight. This is the \nonly Monday or Friday during this work period there will be no rollcall \nvotes, unless we are able to get work done that we do not expect to get \ndone that soon.\n  The amount of work we have to do this work period is significant. As \nI have indicated, we want to do what we can to finish this Defense \nauthorization bill. We want to do the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill. We want to be able to complete reconciliation, which is for \nhigher education. We have SCHIP, for which there is a bipartisan \nagreement that will be reported out of the committee, I understand, \ntomorrow, which has been worked on for weeks and weeks by Senators \nBaucus, Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch. They have agreed on a \nbipartisan arrangement. In fact, it may have been--I do not know if it \nwas reported out last week, but I do know there is good bipartisan \nsupport on that legislation. Some people believe it is not enough \nmoney, the $35 billion, some think it is too much, but it is \nbipartisan, and Senator Hatch has contacted the President, that the \nPresident would reconsider his threat to veto that bill.\n  We also have to do the 9/11 Commission recommendations conference \nreport. It is my understanding the House is going to appoint conferees \non that today. There has been a lot of work done preconference on that \nwith Democrats and Republicans working together. I think that will work \nout very well.\n  We still have the holdup with the ethics and lobbying reform. I do \nhope we can get that done. We will get it done. It may take a number of \ncloture votes, but we are going to finish that before the August \nrecess. It would be to the advantage of everyone here to get that done. \nThe staff of Senator McConnell and my staff have worked very hard to \nsee what they can do to help the various committees that are involved \nin this issue. It is now being held up. I hope this can be worked out. \nI have reached out to Senator DeMint, who is the person at this stage \nholding it up on behalf of the Republicans. He, at this stage, has not \nbeen willing to change his position, which is very unfortunate because \nit is important we work out the earmarking provisions in this bill in \nconference. We cannot jam something into the process here, where you \nhave the House with one rule, the Senate with another rule, and you go \nto conference and you wind up in no-man's land. We have to work out \nsomething.\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\n  Everyone acknowledges we need earmark reform, and the Appropriations \nCommittee has been following that this year. Senators Byrd and Cochran \nhave made that direction, even though the legislation has not been \ncompleted. But in the meantime, we do not have lobbying and ethics \nreform, which is long past due. So I hope we can work together to \ncomplete our work in a timely fashion; otherwise, it will be finished \nin an untimely fashion because we are going to finish all this work \nbefore we have our August recess.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, after 52 months--about 210 weeks--and about \n1,500 days, America finds itself mired in one of the most tragic \nforeign policy blunders in our Nation's history. The sad part about it \nis, there is no end in sight. In my view, and that of academics and \nothers, it will take years, and even decades, to finally close the book \non the damage this war has caused our troops, our economy, and our \nmoral standing in the world.\n  On May 24, 2007, President Bush said:\n\n       We are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. \n     This is a sovereign nation. Twelve million people went to the \n     polls to approve a constitution. It's their government's \n     choice. If they were to say leave, we would leave.\n\n  That is the quote of President Bush.\n  This weekend, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki--for whom President Bush \nhas expressed consistent support and confidence--said that Iraqi forces \ncould take control of their security at ``any time'' American troops \nwant to leave or were to leave.\n  A recent poll of the Iraqi people showed that 21 percent think the \nAmerican presence makes their country safer, while 69 percent say it \nputs them, the Iraqi people, at greater risk. That is what the Iraqis \nsay.\n  The Iraqi people and their leaders say they are ready for us to end \nour combat operation. I think it is time we listen to them.\n  In the war's soon to be 5 years, our troops have accomplished \neverything they have been asked to do. They took down the Iraqi \ndictator. They secured the country for not one, not two, but three \nelections. They provided the security needed for Iraqi factions to come \ntogether to negotiate peaceful settlement of their differences.\n  But the Iraqi leaders have not done their part. After these 52 \nmonths: more than 3,600 Americans killed, tens of thousands wounded, \nand after nearly $600 billion of American taxpayer dollars spent. And \nafter this sacrifice--52 months of sacrifice--it is long past time for \nthe Iraqi leaders and the Iraqi people to put their words into action \nby taking responsibility for their own future. After 52 months, more \nthan 3,600 Americans killed, tens of thousands wounded, and nearly 600 \nbillion in taxpayer dollars spent, President Bush continues to tell our \ntroops and all Americans that we should wait it out, just stay the \ncourse. After 52 months, our troops and our security cannot afford the \nPresident's ``run-out-the-clock'' strategy.\n\n  We have an opportunity and an obligation to change course in Iraq \nright now. We can remove our brave troops from the front lines of \nanother country's civil war, a conflict we have no business policing \nand little chance to diffuse. We can conduct the kind of tough and \nstrong diplomacy required to stabilize Iraq and the region, which even \nthe President's own military experts plead with him to revise. \nRemember, General Petraeus has said the war cannot be won militarily. \nWe can refocus our resources and fight a real war on terror that drives \nthe terrorists back to the darkest caves and corners of the Earth.\n  We can choose that path now. We don't have to mark time waiting for \nthe President to wake up one morning with a change of heart or his term \nto run out. We don't have to wait 2 more months for an arbitrary \nSeptember deadline when it is so clear a course change is required and \nrequired now. With our courage and our votes, we can rise above the \ntragic failure to deliver a new course that our brave troops and all \nAmericans demand and deserve. We can do that today by voting for the \nLevin-Reed amendment to the Defense authorization bill.\n  What does Levin-Reed do? It sets a firm date and an end date to \ntransition the mission and begin the reduction of U.S. forces beginning \n120 days after enactment and completed by April 30 of 2008. Levin-Reed \nlimits the U.S. military mission after April 30 to counterterrorism; \nthe training of Iraqi security forces and protection of U.S. personnel \nand assets; requires that the reduction in forces be part of a \ncomprehensive, diplomatic, regional, political, and economic effort; \nand appoints an international mediator to bring together the warring \nfactions. That provision dealing with appointing an international \nmediator to bring together warring factions was newly placed in the \nbill. The idea and the language came from Senator Hagel of Nebraska and \nis a great addition to this amendment.\n  To those who say this language is binding on the President, I say it \nis, and that is what it is meant to be. It is binding because the \nPresident has resisted every effort we have made to work with him to \nchange the direction of his failed Iraq policy. The record will show \nthat binding language was not our first choice. We passed legislation \nrequiring that 2006 be a year of transition. Instead, the President \nignored this language and dug us in even deeper into an intractable \ncivil war. We gave the President a chance to develop his own new course \nas Commander in Chief. He refused to do that. Instead, he chose to \nextend deployments and ask even more of our brave men and women in \nuniform.\n  Earlier this year we passed legislation that would have begun the \nphased redeployment while leaving significant discretion to the \nPresident about how and when to execute the redeployment. Instead, the \nPresident vetoed this bill and asserted that only he had the power to \nset war policy, even though we have a constitutional obligation to do \nso.\n  So the record is clear, the President's decision to stubbornly cling \nto the current course leaves this body no choice but to enact binding \nlanguage. He has failed to lead us out of Iraq. We are ready to show \nhim the way.\n  I am going to propound a unanimous consent. I have the greatest \nrespect for my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from Arizona, \nbut I say that I am going to enforce the rule that when I propound \nthis, the distinguished Senator from Arizona should either agree to it \nor object. This is not the time for speeches because if he objects to \nit, I have more to say.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that if the House further amends H.R. 1 \nwith the text of H.R. 1401 and requests a conference with the Senate--\nMr. President, I misread the first line. I ask unanimous consent that \nif the House further amends H.R. 1 with the text of H.R. 1401 and \nrequests a conference with the Senate, that the Senate agree to the \nrequest and appoint the same conferees which the Senate has already \nappointed to H.R. 1.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator could withhold.\n  I withdraw the unanimous consent request.\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The unanimous consent request is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friend. It was the wrong unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President we had a shuffling of unanimous consent \nrequests, and obviously the wrong one was shuffled to me. I apologize \nfor holding up my friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9231-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS--AMENDMENT NO. 1401\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the second-degree amendment to \nthe Levin-Reed amendment be withdrawn and that there be 6 hours of \ndebate on the Levin-Reed amendment; at the conclusion or yielding back \nof that time, the Senate vote on the Levin-Reed amendment with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order thereto.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I apologize. If I could ask the distinguished \nleader, was this with respect to the Levin-Reed amendment No. 1401?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I did propound that request asking, basically, that we \nhave an up-or-down vote on it. I have suggested 6 hours, but we would \ntake any reasonable time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could respond, and reserving the right \nto object, I assume that if the Cornyn amendment, which was designed to \nbe a side-by-side amendment, and the Levin-Reed amendment could both be \nvoted on and both had a 60-vote threshold, a time agreement could be \nworked out. I ask the majority leader, could the unanimous consent \nrequest be modified to incorporate that principle so that there \nwouldn't have to be cloture, but there could be a vote on both of those \namendments?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have said earlier that we had to file \ncloture on the initial amendment of Senator Jim Webb, which was an \namendment that simply called for the proper rotation of our troops: 15 \nmonths in country, 15 months out of country. We wanted the Senate to \nspeak its will on that with a simple majority, and we were unable to \nget it. We feel the same way about Levin-Reed. It is a very important \npolicy decision this Senate needs to make. Not to change--I don't know \nwhat Cornyn is, but I am sure it is something that is much different \nthan Levin-Reed. Therefore, if there is a suggestion that I amend my \nunanimous consent request to have some side-by-side, 60-vote margins, I \nwould object to that. I believe we should have in that instance an up-\nor-down vote. I have no problem giving Senator Cornyn a majority vote, \nwhich I think would be very appropriate. I think that is where we need \nto be on this issue; that is, this issue of the Defense authorization \nbill. It is very unusual to have on the Defense authorization bill, \neven issues dealing with Iraq--in times passed, we haven't had a 60-\nvote margin.\n\n  So I would not accept my friend's suggestion that there be side by \nsides. I renew my request that there be a time for an up-or-down vote \non the Levin-Reed amendment. I have suggested 6 hours.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, Mr. President, unfortunately, under that circumstance, \nI object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to express my apology to my friends \nbecause I held them up for a few minutes on their being able to speak. \nI apologize for that, but they do have a full hour.\n  Mr. President, my worst fears on this bill, the Defense authorization \nbill, have been realized. We have just seen the Republican leadership \nagain resort to this technical maneuver to block progress on this \ncrucial amendment. It would be one thing for the minority to vote \nagainst this bill. If they honestly believe that ``stay the course'' is \nthe right strategy, they have the right to vote no. Now Republicans are \nusing a filibuster to block us from even voting on the amendment that \ncould bring this war to a responsible end. They are blocking this like \nthey did the Webb amendment. They are protecting the President rather \nthan protecting our troops by denying us an up-or-down, yes-or-no vote \non the most important issue our country faces.\n  So I say through you to my Democratic and Republican colleagues that \nwe are going to work on this amendment until we get an up-or-down vote \non it. If that means staying in session--we have no votes, of course, \ntonight, but if it means staying in session all day tomorrow and all \ntomorrow night, that is what we will have to do. I will file cloture so \nthat we can have a Wednesday vote, if this continues. I certainly hope \nduring the next few hours and tomorrow that we will have a change of \nmind so we can have a vote and then move on to the other amendments. \nThe American people deserve an honest debate on this war and deserve an \nup-or-down vote on this amendment which we believe will bring a \nresponsible end to this intractable war in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9231-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1\n\n  Mr. REID.

I am not familiar with all the provisions of H.R. \n1401, but I know the Senate has not acted on that bill, and we don't \nbelieve it was part of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  Having said that, we need to object to this request at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9231-5", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9231-S9233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DETAINEES IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to address a subject that I hope we \nwill be able to address soon and that is an amendment that Senator \nGraham of South Carolina has filed and, hopefully, we will debate soon. \nIt relates to conditions that have been placed in the underlying bill, \nrelating to the treatment of detainees captured in Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about the damage that \nwould\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\nbe brought on the global war against terrorists and future wars that we \nmay have to fight if we go forward with the language that is in the \nbill, specifically in section 1023 of the bill. That essentially would \nreturn us to a law enforcement approach to terrorists that, frankly, \nfailed us before 9/11 and, once Osama bin Laden and others declared war \non us, would obviously not work in the post-9/11 context.\n  Senator Graham's amendment strikes these harmful provisions in the \nbill and would replace them with commonsense measures to provide a more \nfair process in dealing with detainees at Guantanamo. I remind my \ncolleagues for a moment about the nature of these terrorists whom we \nare talking about, and then I will go through specific provisions of \nthe bill that need to be removed--specifically three: a requirement \nthat al-Qaida terrorists held in Iraq and Afghanistan be given lawyers; \nthe authorization to demands discovery and compel testimony from \nservicemembers; and the requirement that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees \nbe provided access to classified evidence.\n  To review the nature of the detainees that we are holding, not just \nat Guantanamo Bay but also in Iraq and Afghanistan, these are not nice \npeople. At least 30 of the detainees released from Guantanamo Bay have \nsince returned to waging war against the United States and our allies; \n12 of these released detainees have been killed in battle by U.S. \nforces and others have been recaptured; two released detainees became \nregional commanders for Taliban forces; one released detainee attacked \nU.S. and allied soldiers in Afghanistan, killing three Afghan soldiers; \none released detainee killed an Afghan judge; one released detainee led \na terrorist attack on a hotel in Pakistan and a kidnapping raid that \nresulted in the death of a Chinese civilian, and this former detainee \nrecently told Pakistani journalists he planned to ``fight America and \nits allies until the very end.''\n  The provisions of section 1023 would make it very difficult, if not \nimpossible, for the United States to detain these committed terrorists \nwho have been captured while waging war against us. No nation has, in \nthe history of armed conflict, imposed the kinds of limits that the \nbill would impose on its ability to detain enemy war prisoners. War \nprisoners released in the middle of an ongoing conflict, such as \nmembers of al-Qaida, will return to waging war. We have already seen \nthis happen 30 times with detainees released from Guantanamo Bay. If \nsection 1023 of the bill is enacted into law, we could expect that \nnumber to increase sharply. If section 1023 is enacted, we should \nexpect that more civilians and Afghans and Iraqi soldiers will be \nkilled, and it may be inevitable that our own soldiers will be injured \nor killed by such released terrorists. This is a price our Nation \nshould not be forced to bear.\n  Let me talk first about the requirement in the bill that al-Qaida \nterrorists held in Iraq and Afghanistan must be provided with lawyers. \nThis cannot be executed. It would require the release of detainees. \nHere is why: The Defense bill requires that counsel be provided and \ntrials be conducted for all unlawful enemy combatants held by the \nUnited States, including, for example, al-Qaida members captured and \ndetained in Iraq and Afghanistan if they are held for 2 years. We hold \napproximately 800 prisoners in Afghanistan and tens of thousands in \nIraq. None of them are lawful combatants and all would arguably be \nentitled to a trial and a lawyer under the bill. Such a provision would \nat least require a military judge, a prosecutor, and a defense \nattorney, as well as other legal professionals.\n  That scheme is not realistic. The entire Army JAG Corps only consists \nof approximately 1,500 officers, and each is busy with their current \nduties. Moreover, under the bill, each detainee would be permitted to \nretain a private or volunteer counsel. Our agreements with the Iraqi \nGovernment bar the United States from transferring Iraqi detainees out \nof Iraq. As a result, the bill would require the United States to train \nand transport and house and protect potentially thousands, or even tens \nof thousands, of private lawyers in the middle of a war zone during \nongoing hostilities. That is impossible.\n  That proposal is half baked at best. It would likely force the United \nStates to release thousands of enemy combatants in Iraq, giving them \nthe ability to resume waging war against the United States. Obviously, \nthis would tie up our military. By requiring a trial for each detainee, \nthis provision would also require U.S. soldiers to offer statements to \ncriminal investigators, needing later to prove their case after they \ncaptured someone. They would need to carry some kind of evidence kits \nor combat cameras or some other method of preserving the evidence and \nto establish its chain of custody. They would need to spend hours after \neach trial writing afteraction reports, which would need to be reviewed \nby commanders. Valuable time would be taken away from combat operations \nand soldiers' rest.\n\n  It would be a bad precedent for the future. Aside from the war in \nIraq, this provision would make fighting a major war in the future \nsimply impossible. Consider this: During World War II, the United \nStates detained over 2 million enemy war prisoners. It would have been \nimpossible for the United States to have conducted a trial and provided \ncounsel to 2 million captured enemy combatants. So the bottom line is \nthat the bill, as written, would likely be impossible to implement in \nIraq and, in the context of past wars, it is patently absurd.\n  The second point is authorizing al-Qaida detainees to demand \ndiscovery and compel testimony from American soldiers. The underlying \nbill would actually authorize unlawful enemy combatants, including al-\nQaida detained in Iraq and Afghanistan, to demand discovery and could \ncompel testimony from witnesses as we do in our criminal courts in the \nUnited States. The witnesses would be the U.S. soldiers who captured \nthe prisoner. Under this bill, an American soldier could literally be \nrecalled from his unit at the whim of an al-Qaida terrorist in order to \nbe cross-examined by a judge or that terrorist.\n  Newspaper columnist Stewart Taylor describes the questions that such \na right would raise:\n\n       Should a Marine sergeant be pulled out of combat in \n     Afghanistan to testify at a detention hearing about when, \n     where, how, and why he had captured the detainee? What if the \n     northern alliance or some other ally made the capture? Should \n     the military be ordered to deliver high-level al-Qaida \n     prisoners to be cross-examined by other detainees and their \n     lawyers?\n\n  The questions abound. As the Supreme Court observed in Johnson v. \nEisenstrager, which is the law on this subject:\n\n       It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering \n     of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is \n     ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his \n     own civil court and divert his efforts and attention from the \n     military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.\n\n  That is what the U.S. Supreme Court said in World War II when a \nsimilar issue was raised. It would be difficult to conceive of a \nprocess that would be more insulting to our soldiers. In addition, many \nal-Qaida members who were captured in Afghanistan were captured by \nspecial operators whose identities are kept secret for obvious reasons. \nThis would force them to reveal themselves to al-Qaida members, \ntherefore exposing themselves or to simply forgo the prosecution of the \nindividual, which is more likely what would happen.\n  Clearly, Americans should not be subject to subpoena by al-Qaida. \nThat brings me to the last point--the requirement that al-Qaida and \nTaliban detainees be provided with access to classified evidence. The \nbill requires that detainees be provided with ``a sufficiently specific \nsubstitute of classified evidence'' and that detainees' private lawyers \nbe given access to all relevant classified evidence.\n  Foreign and domestic intelligence agencies are already very hesitant \nto divulge classified evidence to the CSRT hearings we currently \nconduct. These are part of the internal and nonadversarial military \nprocess today. Intelligence agencies will inevitably refuse to provide \nsensitive evidence to detainees and their lawyers. They will not risk \ncompromising such information for the sake of detaining an individual \nterrorist.\n  In addition, the United States already has tenuous relations with \nsome of the foreign governments, particularly in the Middle East, that \nhave\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\nbeen our best sources of intelligence about al-Qaida. If we give \ndetainees a legal right to access such information, these foreign \ngovernments may simply shut off all further supply of information to \nthe United States. These governments will not want to compromise their \nevidence or expose the fact that they cooperated with the United \nStates. By exposing our cooperation with these governments, the bill \nperversely applies a sort of ``stop snitching'' policy toward our \nMiddle Eastern allies, which is likely to be as effective as when \napplied to criminal street gangs in the United States.\n  A final point on this: We already know from hard experience that \nproviding classified and other sensitive information to al-Qaida \nmembers is a bad idea. During the 1995 Federal prosecution in New York \nof the ``Blind Sheikh,'' Omar Rahman, prosecutors turned over the names \nof 200 unindicted coconspirators to the defense. The prosecutors were \nrequired to do so under the civilian criminal justice system of \ndiscovery rules, which require that large amounts of evidence be turned \nover to the defense. The judge warned the defense that the information \ncould only be used to prepare for trial and not for other purposes. \nNevertheless, within 10 days of being turned over to the defense, the \ninformation found its way to Sudan and into the hands of Osama bin \nLaden. U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, who presided over the case, \nexplained, ``That list was in downtown Khartoum within 10 days, and bin \nLaden was aware within 10 days that the Government was on his trail.''\n  That is what happens when you provide classified information in this \ncontext.\n  In another case tried in the civilian criminal justice system, \ntestimony about the use of cell phones tipped off terrorists as to how \nthe Government was monitoring their networks. According to the judge, \n``There was a piece of innocuous testimony about the delivery of a \nbattery for a cell phone.'' This testimony alerted terrorists to \nGovernment surveillance and, as a result, their communication network \nshut down within days and intelligence was lost to the Government \nforever--intelligence that might have prevented who knows what.\n  This bill--this particular section of the bill repeats the mistakes \nof the past. Treating the war with al-Qaida similar to a criminal \njustice investigation would force the United States to choose between \ncompromising information that could be used to prevent future terrorist \nattacks and letting captured terrorists go free. This is not a choice \nthat our Nation should be required to make.\n  I will talk more about some provisions that Senator Graham would like \nto substitute for these provisions that provide a more fair process for \ndetainees held at Guantanamo Bay--a process that would enable them to \nhave greater benefit of the use of counsel and of evidence in their \nCSRT hearings.\n  I will wait until he actually offers that amendment to get into \ndetail. But the point is, we have bent over backward to provide the \ndetainees at Guantanamo the ability to contest their detention and to \nhave that detention reviewed and eventually have it reviewed in U.S. \ncourts. That is a very fair system, more fair than has ever been \nprovided by any other nation under similar circumstances and more than \nthe Constitution requires. So we are treating the people we captured \nand are holding at Guantanamo in a very fair way.\n  What we cannot do is take those same kinds of protections and apply \nthem to anybody we capture in a foreign theater who is held in a \nforeign theater and therefore is not, under current circumstances--and \nnever has been in the history of warfare--subject to the criminal \njustice system of our country. To take that system and try to transport \nit to the fields of Afghanistan or Iraq would obviously be not only a \nbreaking of historical precedent but a very bad idea for all of the \nreasons I just indicated.\n  I ask my colleagues to give very careful consideration to the \ndangerous return to the pre-9/11 notion of terrorism as a law \nenforcement problem that is inherent in section 1023 of the bill. The \nterrorists have made no secret that they are actually at war with us, \nand we ignore this point at our peril.\n  I conclude by reminding my colleagues that the Statement of \nAdministration Policy on this bill indicates that the President would \nbe advised to veto it if these provisions remained. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues, when the opportunity is presented, to join me in \nstriking the provisions of the bill, not only as representing good \npolicy but to help us ensure that at the end of the day, there will be \na bill signed by the President called the Defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I have a half hour to speak \nin morning business. Prior to doing so, I wish to give a brief \nrejoinder to my colleague from Arizona on some of the comments he just \nmade.\n  It is my understanding that the underlying Defense Authorization Act \nhas several provisions that are necessary to address shortcomings in \nthe legal process for individuals detained on the battlefield. One of \nthese provisions limits the use of coerced testimony obtained through \ncruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. Such testimony is immoral, and \nthis provision is necessary if we are to obtain and use accurate \ninformation.\n  Another provision provides for reasonable counsel and the ability to \npresent relevant information to detainees who have been held for 2 or \nmore years. This is necessary in a war of undetermined duration.\n  Finally, the bill does not provide classified information to a \ndetainee. It provides for a summary that is intended to be unclassified \nto the counsel for detainees.\n  One of the things that might help is if, on line 16, page 305, \nsubsection II, the word ``unclassified'' was added before the word \n``summary'' on that line. I believe that is the intent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9233-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9233-S9235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, many in this body and people all over \nthe world watched as America, 5\\1/2\\ years ago, began to arrest, \napprehend, and incarcerate detainees. Some were real terrorists, some \nwere conspirators, and some were simply in the wrong place at the wrong \ntime. We watched as Camp X-Ray was built at the naval base at \nGuantanamo, and we have seen the development of a different and lesser \nstandard of American justice developed for proceedings at that base. \nSince that time, Guantanamo has been derided as a blight on human \nrights values and as a stain on American justice worldwide.\n  I believe the time has come to close Guantanamo. An amendment I have \nfiled with Senator Harkin--Senator Harkin is my main cosponsor--and \nSenator Hagel would do exactly that. It is cosponsored by Senators \nDodd, Clinton, Brown, Bingaman, Kennedy, Whitehouse, Obama, Durbin, \nByrd, yourself, Mr. President, Senator Salazar, Senators Feingold, \nBoxer, and Biden.\n  It is my understanding that the Republican side has refused us a time \nagreement, which means we will not be allowed a vote. The amendment is \nnot germane postcloture. So if the Republican side will not allow us a \ntime agreement, we have, unfortunately, no way of getting a vote on \nthis amendment.\n  The fact is that yesterday's New York Times editorialized that \nGuantanamo should be closed. That is what many people believe, and yet \nwe cannot fully debate that issue and vote on it here. I think that is \ntruly a shame.\n  I very much regret this, but Senator Harkin, Senator Hagel, and I \nwish to take some time to address this issue. I assure this body that \nwe will not stop here, but we will find another venue in which to \ndebate and vote on this matter.\n  The amendment we have proposed would require the President to close \nthe Guantanamo detention facility within 1 year, and it provides the \nadministration flexibility to choose the venue in which to try \ndetainees--in military proceedings, Federal district courts, or both. \nThe administration would choose which maximum security facilities in \nwhich to house them.\n  Why should we close the Guantanamo detention facility? First and \nforemost, this administration's decision to create Guantanamo appears \nto have been part of a plan to create a\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\nsphere of limited law outside the scrutiny of American courts that \nwould result in a lesser standard of justice.\n  Guantanamo is unique. It is not sovereign territory of the United \nStates; however, under a 1903 lease, the United States exercises \ncomplete jurisdiction and control over this naval base. I believe the \nadministration hoped to use this distinction to operate without \naccountability at Guantanamo.\n  This is revealed in a December 2001 Office of Legal Counsel memo by \nJohn Yoo of the Justice Department, who later authored the infamous \ntorture memo. Yoo knew there was a risk that courts would reject the \nlegal theory of unaccountability at Guantanamo, but, just as he did \nwith his torture memo, he laid out the various arguments why his \nextreme views might prevail.\n  Let me point this out. In his memo, he says:\n\n       Finally, the executive branch has repeatedly taken the \n     position under various statutes that [Guantanamo] is neither \n     part of the United States nor a possession or territory of \n     the United States. For example, this Office [Justice] has \n     opined that [Guantanamo] is not part of the ``United States'' \n     for purposes of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. . . \n     .Similarly, in 1929, the Attorney General opined that \n     [Guantanamo] was not a ``possession'' of the United States \n     within the meaning of certain tariff acts.\n\n  The memo concludes with this statement:\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that a district \n     court cannot properly entertain an application for a writ of \n     habeas corpus by an enemy alien detained at Guantanamo Bay \n     Naval Base, Cuba. Because the issue has not yet been \n     definitively resolved by the courts, however, we caution that \n     there is some possibility that a district court would \n     entertain such an application.\n\n  So here the administration apparently hoped to turn Guantanamo into a \nlegal hybrid wholly under U.S. control but beyond the reach of U.S. \ncourts.\n  What has happened since then? The Supreme Court rejected the \nadministration's position in Rasul v. Bush in a 2004 ruling that \nAmerican courts do have jurisdiction to hear habeas and other claims \nfrom detainees held at Guantanamo.\n  Following another defeat in the Supreme Court, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld \nin 2006, which declared invalid the Pentagon's process for adjudicating \ndetainees, the administration responded by pushing the passage of a new \nMilitary Commissions Act. This expressly eliminated habeas corpus \nrights and limited other appeals to procedure and constitutionality, \nleaving questions of fact or violation of law unresolvable by all \nFederal courts. This happens nowhere else in American law. But this \nMilitary Commissions Act went through.\n  There are serious questions about whether this provision will \nwithstand a court test. On June 29, just 2 weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt agreed to hear two additional cases which go right to this point: \nBoumediene v. Bush and Al Odah v. the United States. The High Court \ndeclined to hear these cases in April but has reversed itself and \ngranted certiorari--the first time in 60 years that it agreed to take a \ncase after previously refusing it. From this case, we will find out \nwhether the military commissions law, which prevents full appeals, in \nfact, can stand the court test.\n  What is the administration arguing in that case? Once again, they are \ntrying to argue that the Constitution's protection of habeas corpus \ndoes not extend to detainees at Guantanamo because it is outside of \nU.S. jurisdiction.\n  I believe it is time to put an end to these efforts to use a legal \nmaneuver to create a law-free zone at Guantanamo.\n  As Justice Kennedy emphasized in his concurring opinion in Rasul:\n\n       Guantanamo is in every practical respect a United States \n     territory.\n\n  So U.S. law would apply at Guantanamo whether this administration \nlikes that or not.\n  The administration's efforts to create a land without law at \nGuantanamo has been a moral and a strategic catastrophe for the United \nStates. The bad decision to create a separate system of justice at \nGuantanamo led to another mistake, and I mentioned this briefly: the \nMilitary Commissions Act. In retrospect, let's look at what that act \nhas done:\n  It expands Presidential authority by giving the White House broad \nlatitude to interpret the meaning and authority of the Geneva \nConventions.\n  It presents vague and ambiguous definitions of torture and cruel and \ninhumane treatment that fail to establish clear guidelines for what is \na permissible interrogation technique.\n  It abandons the independent judicial review process by establishing a \nnew Court of Military Commission Review with members appointed by the \nPentagon. This court has yet to be established.\n  It limits appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit, which is given limited review authority. This is what \nwill most likely be before the court very shortly.\n  For the first time in U.S. history, it allows coerced evidence--\nobtained prior to December 30, 2005--to be entered into a court record, \nand it revokes habeas corpus rights that allowed detainees to appeal \ntheir status before the Federal court.\n  Direct review is limited and habeas is eliminated by this military \ncommissions bill.\n  Clearly, the military commissions bill, which passed by a vote of 65 \nto 34 in this House, seeks to once again set up a separate and lesser \nstandard of justice.\n  Senator Specter and Senator Leahy have introduced a bill to restore \nhabeas rights to Guantanamo detainees. I hope that bill is allowed to \nbe presented as an amendment to this bill. It is timely, it is \nimportant, and the world is watching. It should happen, and finally, it \nis the right thing to do.\n  So what have been all the consequences of this? The detention center \nat Guantanamo Bay has become a lightning rod for international \ncondemnation. It draws sharp criticism from our allies and hands our \nenemies a potent recruiting tool. It weakens our standing in the world \nand makes the world a more dangerous place for our troops, who may be \ncaptured on foreign battlefields in the future.\n  Yet the administration fails to act, despite public comments from \nPresident Bush and top advisers that the facility should be closed. \nRecent news reports say there is renewed debate inside the White House \nover closing Guantanamo, but still nothing happens. So I believe it is \nup to Congress to act.\n  What would this amendment do? In addition to requiring the President \nto close Guantanamo within a year, it would prohibit the administration \nfrom transferring detainees at Guantanamo to other U.S.-controlled \nfacilities outside the United States. It also requires the President to \nkeep Congress informed of efforts to close the facility and transfer \nthe detainees, and includes the specific requirement that the President \nreport to Congress in writing within 3 months of the bill's enactment.\n  I believe it is critical that we act. To do nothing, to leave \nGuantanamo open, as some in the administration would like, is to invite \nfurther condemnation and further risk. It will weaken our efforts to \nfight terrorism and it will continue to erode our standing in the \nworld.\n  I recently heard Peter Bergen, a terrorism expert, on CNN. I have \nread his books and listened to him throughout the years. He said he and \nhis colleagues had taken a good look at the increase in terror and he \nbelieved it would be fair to assert that our presence in Iraq has \nserved to increase terrorists by sevenfold--by 700 percent over what \nthe world of terrorists was before Iraq and today.\n  The simple fact remains that Guantanamo violates our values and our \ntraditions, including respect for the rule of law and for human rights.\n  In avoiding the full weight of American justice, Guantanamo has \nshocked the conscience of the world. It has led the men and women who \nhave worn the uniform, including many retired flag officers, to speak \nout. A dozen former generals and admirals warned in January of 2005 \nthat the interrogation techniques allowed at Guantanamo and elsewhere \nhad:\n\n        . . . fostered greater animosity toward the United States, \n     undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, and added to \n     the risks facing our troops around the world.\n\n  Among those who commented were GEN John Shalikashvili, former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs; GEN Merrill McPeak, former Air Force \nChief of Staff; Marine GEN Joseph Hoar, a former commander of the U.S. \nCentral Command; and RADM Dan Guter, a former Navy judge advocate \ngeneral.\n  Earlier this year, a very respected retired Marine Corps general, by \nthe\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\nname of James Jones, the former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, \nsaid:\n\n       I would close the prison tomorrow. I would do it \n     immediately. Just the images alone have hurt our national \n     reputation. I don't know how you fix that without closing it.\n\n  I agree with him. I don't know how you begin to fix the damage \nbrought by Guantanamo without closing it. A military commissions bill \ncouldn't do it. We can't do it, and that is the fact.\n  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said it succinctly:\n\n       I would close it not tomorrow, but this afternoon.\n\n  But importantly, the sense of conscience, as well as a measure of the \ninternational reaction to Guantanamo, came in a statement by Archbishop \nDesmond Tutu. Here is what he said:\n\n       I never imagined I would live to see the day when the \n     United States and its satellites would use precisely the same \n     arguments that the apartheid government used for detention \n     without trial. It is disgraceful.\n\n  In May of 2006, President Bush told German television:\n\n       I would very much like to end Guantanamo. I would very much \n     like to get people to a court.\n\n  Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, new to his job, made \nclear that he also wanted Guantanamo closed. He said:\n\n       There is no question in my mind that Guantanamo and some of \n     the abuses that have taken place in Iraq have negatively \n     impacted the reputation of the United States.\n\n  He said that at the Munich Conference on Security Policy earlier this \nyear. On February 27, following an Appropriations Committee meeting, I \npersonally asked him what he thought, and he said, equally as \nsuccinctly as General Powell, that he thought it should be closed.\n  The following month Secretary Gates told the House Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee that trials at Guantanamo would lack \ncredibility in the eyes of the world. In March, Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice said:\n\n       The President has been very clear, and he is clear to us \n     all the time. He would like to see it closed. We all would.\n\n  Well, then why is the Republican side preventing us from having a \nvote today or tomorrow or the next day that would say that Guantanamo \nshould be closed within a year? How can the Secretary of Defense, the \nPresident of the United States, the Secretary of State make these \ncomments that they want Guantanamo closed and the Republican side of \nthe aisle prevent us from taking a vote in the Congress? I don't \nunderstand this.\n  Additional fallout from the Military Commissions Act is that it has \nstymied further trials under its auspices. Two military judges recently \nfound that the detainees have been incorrectly classified as ``enemy \ncombatants'' rather than as ``unlawful enemy combatants.'' So that is \nanother hitch in this. They have classified people wrongly so they \ncan't be tried.\n\n  Recently, a lieutenant colonel, who was part of this process from an \nintelligence point of view, in an affidavit has stated that even this \nclassification was based on vague and incomplete intelligence. \nLieutenant Colonel Abraham also said tribunal members were pressured by \ntheir superiors to rule against detainees, often without specific \nevidence, and that military prosecutors were given ``generic'' material \nthat did not hold up in the face of the most basic legal challenges.\n  Now, let me be clear: I have no sympathy for Taliban fighters, al-\nQaida terrorists, or anyone else out to hurt the United States, or \ncommit cowardly and despicable acts of terror. There is nothing in this \namendment that puts terrorists back on the street. That is not the \ngoal. Any argument that this amendment would harm national security is \nflat out false.\n  I believe what harms national security is sacrificing our Nation's \nvalues--which have made us rightly the greatest democracy in the \nworld--by setting up a hybrid system of justice, by not following the \nUniform Code of Military Justice, but by creating this hybrid system, \nwhich has failed court tests now and will quite possibly fail another \none shortly.\n  Now, how do you stop all this? As long as you have this \nextraterritorial facility out there, without the light of day shining \non it, you can't. Today, two of our colleagues are visiting Guantanamo. \nUnfortunately, I couldn't go with them. The last time I visited \nGuantanamo was with Secretary Rumsfeld, rather early on, and I suspect \nwhat they will find is a rather well-run, strong, staunch military \nprison. But that doesn't mean the justice that is dispensed there is \ncorrect if it is secondary justice, if it is sublevel justice, if there \nis limited right of appeal, if you don't have access to an attorney \neasily, if you can't see evidence against you.\n  One can say, well, Guantanamo is no Abu Ghraib, and I would most \nlikely agree with that--today. There have been allegations of \ninappropriate behavior in terms of interrogation techniques, no \nquestion about that. I assume that is corrected now. But it still looms \nout there as a way the United States has of not allowing these \nprisoners to face justice. It is one thing if you are a terrorist; it \nis another thing if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, if \nyou are swept up, if you are put in either a cage or a cell at \nGuantanamo, and if you stay there year after year after year with no \nrecourse. That is a stain on American justice. We criticize the Chinese \nfor their form of administrative detention, and yet here we practice a \nsimilar thing.\n  We face a serious, long-term terrorist threat. It may well go on for \nthe next 10 or even 20 years. We must track down, punish, and prosecute \nthose who seek to hurt this country and hurt our people. At the same \ntime, we need national policies that are both tough and smart, and this \nisn't smart. We will fight terror with vigor and drive and purpose, but \nwe must not forget who we are. We are a nation of laws. We are a nation \nof value and tradition. These values have been admired throughout the \ndecades all over the world.\n  The world has looked at Guantanamo and made the judgment that it is \nwrong. I think it is time for the Senate to do something about it. The \nSenate has borne the burden of Guantanamo for too long. The time has \ncome to close it down. I appeal to the other side to allow the debate \non the floor and to give us a unanimous consent time agreement so that \nthere might be a vote in this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9235-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9235-S9236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today reflecting on the most \npressing issues on the minds of the American public--that of the \ncurrent situation in Iraq. We have been in Iraq for nearly 4\\1/2\\ \nyears, and frustration is certainly understandable. I wish nothing more \nthan to see the United States reach a point where our soldiers and \nsailors and airmen and marines are able to leave and the Iraqi people \ncan stand on their own. Our military has done an exceptional job. That \npoint cannot be debated. But as so many have said, victory and ultimate \nsuccess in Iraq cannot be completed solely through military strength.\n  I wish also to specifically point out the leadership of the ranking \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John McCain, on \nthis issue. Having just returned from Iraq, his pointed remarks on our \nunited efforts in Iraq and the importance of our mission are much \nneeded.\n  Senator McCain understands, as I do, that the terrorist threat in \nIraq will not stop, nor will our safety improve at home if our forces \nleave. In their own words, these dangerous ideologues continue to make \nbold and alarming threats worldwide, but even more importantly, they \nare backing up their words with action. They will continue to strike \nour allies in the gulf and they will continue to strike our friends in \nEurope, and I believe they will not hesitate to strike America again, \nas they did on September 11.\n  That said, I am extremely disappointed that more progress has not \nbeen made on the political and domestic security from within Iraq. The \nfact remains, Iraq is simply not ready to take over their own country \ntoday, and if the United States were to leave, the consequences would \nbe nothing short of catastrophic. Al-Qaida is training, operating, and \ncarrying out their missions in Iraq right now. As evidenced in Britain \n2 weeks ago, they are clearly still a threat and are still determined \nto accomplish their goals of destroying western culture. That much has \nnot changed.\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\n  On July 12 the President issued a report as required by the fiscal \nyear 2007 Supplemental Appropriations bill assessing the progress of \nthe sovereign government of Iraq's performance in achieving the \nbenchmarks detailed in the bill. As we know, this report told us that 8 \nof the 18 benchmarks detailed in that bill received satisfactory marks. \nWhile we are certainly disappointed that more benchmarks were not \nachieved, it is important to highlight the success that is being made, \nand how the Iraqi government is performing, as their success will \nultimately allow us to responsibly reduce our troop levels.\n  Specifically, the government of Iraq has made progress in forming a \nConstitutional Review Committee to review the constitution. This is \nimportant, just like in our Nation's history; we needed to create a \nconstitution that provided a standard for which to base our laws. \nThough many contentious issues continue to exist, I am pleased that \nsignificant progress is being made. If Iraq cannot form their \nconstitution, then it will be very difficult or impossible to move \nforward onto other matters.\n  Also, the Iraqis have satisfied the requirements set forth to enact \nand implement legislation forming semi-autonomous regions. This law is \nset to come into effect in 18 months, but thus far this potentially \nvery contentious issue has not received much attention. This is \nimportant as it further organizes and equips Iraq to take on the \nresponsibilities of a democratic government and this benchmark furthers \nthe necessary groundwork needed to build a responsible and legitimate \ngovernment.\n  Iraq has made progress to ensure the rights of minor political \nparties within the legislature and maintain that their rights are \nprotected. Clearly this is important in obtaining legitimacy, \nparticularly given the historical and present conflicts between the \nSunnis, Shia, and Kurds.\n  On the security front, the Iraqis, with coalition support, have \nsuccessfully reached benchmarks establishing joint security stations \nacross Baghdad that provide a continuous security presence. These \nstations are necessary as they can effectively combine American \ntechnology and capabilities with the Iraqi presence on the ground in \norder to counter insurgent threats where they begin. By mid-June, 32 \njoint security stations have reached initial operational capability and \n36 combat outposts have reached initial or full capacity.\n  Also, the goal of providing three trained and ready Iraqi brigades in \nsupport of Baghdad operations has been achieved and this complements \nthe recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. Certainly this is a major \npriority as the development of a functional and effective Iraqi \nfighting and security force is absolutely essential for the Iraqis to \nfurther take the reins of their government, and I am pleased that these \ngoals are being accomplished thus far.\n  At the beginning of this year, the President changed the focus of \nthis effort. Decisions were made for a new direction. ADM William \nFallon was placed in charge as CENTCOM commander and the Senate \nunanimously confirmed GEN David Petraeus as the new commander of our \nforces in Iraq. The much talked about, and much criticized, surge of \n28,000 additional troops has only been underway for just about 3 weeks \nnow.\n  Operation Phantom Thunder began on June 15 and already Iraq, and \nparticularly Baghdad, is a much different place than it was only 6 \nmonths ago. U.S. forces have begun working closely with Iraqis to bring \ndown sectarian violence of al-Qaida in country. So far the new \ncounterinsurgency has decreased Shiite death squad activity and many \nmilitia leaders have been disposed of. Execution levels are at the \nlowest point in a year, and al-Qaida hotspots in the city are shrinking \nand becoming isolated from one another and supply lines are being cut \naround the city.\n  For the first time in years the U.S. is operating freely in eastern \nBaghdad as we are surrounding the villages and small towns around \nBaghdad routing out insurgent bases. Already, total car bombings and \nsuicide attacks are down in May and June, and by the end of June, \nAmerican troops controlled about 42 percent of the city's \nneighborhoods, up from 19 percent in April.\n  Initial military success certainly does not mean that operations are \ncomplete, nor is political victory guaranteed. The fact remains that \nthis body unanimously confirmed GEN Petraeus with the knowledge that he \nplanned to initiate this surge that would ideally route out al-Qaida \nand ultimately clear the path for internal change within Iraq. Again, \nthe surge began on June 15 and we owe it to our troops who are placing \ntheir lives on the line not to pull the plug on them while they remain \nin harm's way.\n  Our best and brightest military minds have worked to construct this \nnew strategy and we need to see it through. I would like to see our \ntroops come home today, but the harsh reality remains that this is not \na valid option, will not make us safer, and is not in our national \ninterest. If we leave, it is naive to think al-Qaida and our enemies \nwill just go away and we will no longer be threatened.\n  Additionally, I have heard many of my colleagues discuss on the floor \nsome of their new strategies in Iraq, strategies that I believe would \nweaken us at home and abroad. What I find curious is that they keep \nreferring to finding a bipartisan resolution in Iraq, when only months \nago this body overwhelmingly approved 2 new military commanders in the \nregion and a new diplomatic leader in Ambassador Crocker. We also \napproved, in a bipartisan manner, the new way forward in Iraq that \nPresident Bush eloquently defended this morning. In that vote, this \nbody committed that we would allow the surge to go forward and would \ngive GEN Petraeus the time to enact the strategy. I cannot in good \nconscience cut short a plan barely 3 months old.\n  As we all know, in September a complete review of Iraq policy, \nincluding a detailed assessment of the surge will be presented. I look \nforward to that assessment. I look forward to making the appropriate \ndecisions based on that report. It would be disingenuous to simply \ndiscontinue the plans that our military leaders have planned and are \nputting into place simply for political gains.\n  Remarkably, the Senate is in a similar situation that we were only \nmonths ago when many in this body wanted to reject the strategy GEN \nPetraeus proposed in Iraq, even before he has been given the full \nopportunity to perform his mission. Well, we are at it again. For what \nreason did my colleagues agree to the new strategy in Iraq but are not \nwilling to support our own self-imposed guidelines? I don't know the \nanswer to that, but I do know that I will not. I will continue to vote \nagainst any legislation that sets arbitrary deadlines and thresholds in \nIraq--and plead with my colleagues to do the same.\n  Let's not stand here this week and prejudge what will come out of the \nSeptember 15 report, but more importantly, let's not prejudge the \ntalents of our men and women in Iraq. Let's give our military and \ndiplomatic teams the time they deserve, and which we had promised them.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Would we have the benefit of an important discussion on \nyour amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, it is the pending amendment. Those who want to speak \non the amendment would be free to do so. Hopefully, there will be many \npeople speaking on it because we should have an opportunity before \nWednesday.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to address it, but as a matter of courtesy--we \nhave been at this for 29 years--I am going to wait until you speak, and \nthen I will speak.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

We have been here many years together. We manage, even \nthough we oppose each other. But I do oppose you on this one, my dear \nfriend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I feel similarly about your amendment. I think both would \nenjoy being here when the other speaks. We can arrange that. We have \nbeen arranging this for 28 years. We will continue to arrange it.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, there are two truly critical \nissues for our country. You hear it every time you have a town meeting, \nevery time a Senator is home. One of those issues is changing course in \nIraq. The second issue is fixing health care in America.\n  The Senate is going to spend long hours on the floor of the Senate \nthis week, hopefully, changing course in Iraq, making a fundamental \nshift of the policy, where the Senate would come together on a \nbipartisan basis. I wish to spend a bit of time this afternoon talking \nabout the long hours that are ahead for members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee in a critical part of the effort to fix American health care.\n  Over the last several months, four members, a bipartisan group in the \nSenate Finance Committee--Senators Baucus and Grassley and Rockefeller \nand Hatch--have toiled hard to better meet the health care needs of \nthis country's youngsters.\n  It is a moral blot on our Nation that millions and millions of our \nkids go to bed at night without decent health care. This legislation is \npart of an effort to erase that moral blot--an unconscionable fact of \nAmerican life that so many kids are scarred by the inability to get \ndecent, good-quality, affordable health care.\n  In recent days, the Bush Administration has indicated they are \nconsidering vetoing this legislation. As one who has worked very \nextensively with the Bush Administration on health care issues, it is \nmy hope they will join the effort, the bipartisan effort in the Senate, \nto try to work this legislation out and to do it in a bipartisan way. \nIn fact, I think it is absolutely critical that it be done if there is \nto be another bipartisan effort in this Congress that would attack \nhealth care needs in this country on a broader basis.\n  Senator Bennett and I, as the distinguished Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Colorado, is aware, have brought to the Senate the first \nbipartisan health care overhaul bill in more than 13 years. It has \nbrought together business organizations and labor organizations. It has \nput us in a position, for the first time in more than a decade, to look \non a bipartisan basis at overhauling American health care. But to do \nit, we are first going to have to address the immediate needs of this \ncountry's kids. In fact, as part of the budget process, I was able to \nadd legislation to indicate that those critical needs of this country's \nchildren would be added first.\n  Now, I would be the first to acknowledge there is a connection \nbetween the children's health care program and the broader health needs \nof our citizens. The fact is, most kids in America get health care \nthrough private coverage through their parents. Those who are on the \nCHIP program--the Children's Health Insurance Program--many of them get \ncoverage through the private sector as well, through private policies.\n  But we are going to have to find common ground if we are to fix \nAmerican health care. Democrats and Republicans on the Finance \nCommittee have tried to do that on the CHIP legislation. As the \nPresiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, knows, \nthere are a great many Democrats who would like to spend more than this \ncompromise effort would allow. We would like to look at allocating $50 \nbillion for the needs of America's youngsters. The bipartisan \ncompromise--as part of the cooperative effort of Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley and Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hatch--is talking \nabout $35 billion. That is pretty hard for some on our side of the \naisle to swallow.\n  Also, with respect to the extent of coverage, a number of Members on \nthis side of the aisle had been concerned about other groups of \ncitizens who have not been able to get good-quality, affordable \ncoverage, and they have been able to get benefits under existing \nservices offered by the children's health program because the Bush \nadministration allowed for special waivers. So what the compromise is \nseeking to do is to say: All right, if it has been allowed under a \nwaiver program, let's not point the finger at anybody. Let's say those \nwaivers, in effect, would be grandfathered. They would be protected. \nBut then we will move on, and we would move on in a bipartisan kind of \nway.\n  I will tell my colleague, the Presiding Officer--because he and I \nhave spoken about health care often--we know what needs to be done in \nAmerican health care. We are spending enough money, certainly. This \nyear, we will spend $2.3 trillion. There are 300 million of us. If you \ndivide 300 million into $2.3 trillion, you could go out and hire a \ndoctor for every seven families in the United States. We are spending \nenough money on health care; we are just not spending it in the right \nplaces.\n  We also know--because Senator Bennett and I have talked to a great \nmany on both sides of the aisle--there is a real prospect for an \nideological truce here on the health care issue in the Senate.\n  A great many Republicans, to their credit, are acknowledging now, for \nthe first time, that to fix American health care you have to cover \neverybody because if you do not cover everybody, those who are \nuninsured shift their bills to the insured. A great many Democrats, \nalso to their credit, have been willing to acknowledge that just \nturning all this over to Government--having a Government-run health \ncare\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\nprogram--is not going to work politically either, that it is going to \nbe essential to have a private sector in American health care that \nworks. It would be a reformed one. Private insurance companies could \nnot cherry-pick any longer, they could not take just healthy people and \nsend sick people over to Government programs more fragile than they \nare, but that there would be a real private sector.\n\n  So in addition to spending enough money and in addition to something \nof an ideological truce now on health care between Democrats and \nRepublicans, for the first time--I particularly want to credit my \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, for working closely with me on \nthis part of the effort--I think we can show people who have coverage \nwhy it is in their interest to be for reform. Certainly, here in the \nSenate we know that past efforts--particularly in 1993, during the \ndebate about the Clinton plan, the single biggest barrier was \nconvincing people who had coverage why it would be in their interest to \nsupport reform.\n  What we have been able to do, on a bipartisan basis--Senator Bennett \nand I working together is to come up with an approach that will show \npeople who have coverage--workers and employers--why it will work for \nthem with the very first paychecks that are issued under our \nlegislation, the Healthy Americans Act. Not in 5 years, not in 8 years, \nnot sometime down the road, but it will work for those who have \ncoverage--workers and employers--with the very first paychecks that are \nissued when this legislation becomes law. The reason it would benefit \nthose workers and employers is they would have more cash in their \npocket. The workers would have more choices for the health care that \nwas available to them. They would certainly have more security--health \ncare that could never ever be taken away.\n  My hope is that we can have a cooperative, bipartisan effort on the \nCHIP legislation, starting tomorrow night. As my friend from Colorado, \nthe Presiding Officer, knows, we will have a late markup. Democrats and \nRepublicans on the committee want to work together. We want to work \nwith the Administration. I hope the Administration will join us in that \neffort.\n  I would also suggest that if that happens, we can go on to the \nbroader health care issue, where there are a number of areas where the \nAdministration seeks reform. I want to assure them I am interested in \nworking with them. For example, the President has made the point--it is \none that I share--that the Federal Tax Code as it relates to health \ncare disproportionally favors the most wealthy and rewards \ninefficiency. Today, in America, if you are a high-flying CEO and you \nwant to go out and get a designer smile plastered on your face, you can \ndo it and write off the cost of that operation on your taxes--every \ndime. But if you are a hard-working woman in a furniture store in \nColorado or Illinois or Oregon and your company has no plan, you get \nnothing out of the Tax Code. You get nothing.\n  So what Senator Bennett and I seek to do is redirect those several \nhundred billion dollars in tax expenditures for health care to people \nin the middle-income brackets, the lower middle-income brackets. The \nBush Administration has a different approach with respect to the Tax \nCode and health, but as I have said to the President personally, I \nthink he is still onto the basic concept. This is an area where \nDemocrats and Republicans can find common ground.\n  But if we are going to get, in this session, to the broader issue of \nhealth care reform--of course, a lot of people think it cannot be done; \nthey think it will be 2009 and we will have another Presidential \nelection before there is real reform--if we are going to deal with it \nin this session--and Senator Bennett and I are pulling out all the \nstops to try to get broader health care reform out there this session \nin order to get to that broader debate--Democrats and Republicans have \nto come together on this crucial issue of meeting the health care needs \nof this country, of wiping out this moral blot on our Nation that \nmillions of kids do not have decent health care.\n  That effort will start tomorrow night. This is a key time for those \nof us who want to reform American health care. If we can come together \nin this Senate--starting tomorrow night under Senators Baucus and \nGrassley and Hatch and Rockefeller--my hope is we can keep that \ncoalition together and then segue over to the broader reform where \nSenator Bennett and I have brought, for the first time in more than 13 \nyears, colleagues, a bipartisan proposal to overall American health \ncare. It has the support of business and labor. Consumer groups have \nbeen involved in the development of it.\n  I am very hopeful that under the leadership of Senator Reid--and I \nsee the distinguished leader from Illinois in the Chamber--we can \nchange course with respect to the war in Iraq but we can also change \ncourse with respect to the most pressing domestic issue of our time; \nthat is, fixing American health care. The effort starts tomorrow night.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would I be correct in saying this time is \nreserved for the distinguished Republican leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not see him present at the moment; \ntherefore, if some other speaker, for a period of time, wishes to go \nforward--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe the Republican leader will be here \nin approximately 5 minutes. I will, if the Senator from Virginia \nconcurs, suggest the absence of a quorum and wait.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I just wanted to accommodate any Senator who needed \n5 minutes. I see none.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know the majority leader has \nindicated he is going to file cloture on the Levin amendment and is \nsetting up a cloture vote for Wednesday. It had been my hope we could \nhave by consent set up a process by which we could put the Levin \namendment in the queue with a 60-vote threshold such as we have had on \nvirtually every Iraq amendment this week, and also a 60-vote threshold \non the Cornyn amendment, which is a logical counter to the Levin \namendment. As I indicated, it is my understanding the majority leader \nannounced earlier it would be his intention to file cloture on the \nLevin-Reed amendment this evening. That would, as I suggested, allow \nfor a cloture vote to occur on Wednesday of this week. As I indicated, \nit had been my hope we could have had the Levin amendment and the \nCornyn amendment in juxtaposition by consent, both requiring 60 votes. \nThis has been the way we have dealt with essentially every \ncontroversial Iraq amendment this year, no matter what bill it has been \noffered on.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2241 to Amendment No. 2211\n\n  Given the majority leader's intention to file cloture this evening on \nthe Levin amendment, I now send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  Mr. REED. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer will hold on for a \nsecond to ask a question of the Parliamentarian.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment 2241 to amendment No. 2211.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the termination of the \nreading of the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF A \n                   FAILED STATE IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\n       (1) A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are \n     determined to attack the United States and United States \n     allies.\n       (2) The Iraq Study Group report found that ``[a] chaotic \n     Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally''.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Al Qaeda will portray \n     any failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant \n     victory that will be featured prominently as they recruit for \n     their cause in the region and around the world''.\n       (4) A National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the \n     consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq would be \n     that--\n       (A) Al Qaeda would attempt to use Anbar province to plan \n     further attacks outside of Iraq;\n       (B) neighboring countries would consider actively \n     intervening in Iraq; and\n       (C) sectarian violence would significantly increase in \n     Iraq, accompanied by massive civilian casualties and \n     displacement.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group found that ``a premature American \n     departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater \n     sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions. . \n     . . The near-term results would be a significant power \n     vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, \n     and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our \n     withdrawal as a historic victory.''\n       (6) A failed state in Iraq could lead to broader regional \n     conflict, possibly involving Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \n     Turkey.\n       (7) The Iraq Study group noted that ``Turkey could send \n     troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdistan from declaring \n     independence''.\n       (8) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Iran could send \n     troops to restore stability in southern Iraq and perhaps gain \n     control of oil fields. The regional influence of Iran could \n     rise at a time when that country is on a path to producing \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       (9) A failed state in Iraq would lead to massive \n     humanitarian suffering, including widespread ethnic cleansing \n     and countless refugees and internally displaced persons, many \n     of whom will be tortured and killed for having assisted \n     Coalition forces.\n       (10) A recent editorial in the New York Times stated, \n     ``Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around \n     it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans \n     leave. There could be reprisals against those who worked with \n     American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. \n     Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and \n     Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power \n     grabs.''\n       (11) The Iraq Study Group found that ``[i]f we leave and \n     Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could \n     eventually require the United States to return''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should commit itself to a strategy that will \n     not leave a failed state in Iraq; and\n       (2) the Senate should not pass legislation that will \n     undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in \n     Iraq.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Levin-Reed, \n     et al., amendment No. 2087, to H.R. 1585, Department of \n     Defense Authorization, 2008.\n         Carl Levin, Ted Kennedy, Byron L.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on pending \n     amendment No. 2241 to Calendar No. 189, H.R. 1585, National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008.\n         Mitch McConnell, Wayne Allard, Pete V.

Bond, Mike \n           Crapo, Jon Kyl, Elizabeth Dole, Trent Lott, John \n           Barrasso, James Inhofe, Lindsey Graham, Lisa Murkowski, \n           John McCain.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is a shame we find ourselves in the \nposition we are in. The sensible and logical way to set up this debate \nwith the Levin amendment and the Cornyn amendment would have been to do \nit by consent with two 60-vote thresholds. This continued effort to \nthwart the ability of the minority to get amendments in the queue and \nto get them offered and voted on is not, I might say, a very effective \nway to legislate, because it produces a level of animosity and unity on \nthe minority side that makes it more difficult for the majority to pass \nimportant legislation.\n  In addition to the Cornyn amendment, we have the Warner-Lugar \nproposal, which certainly deserves a vote, as does the Salazar--the \noccupant of the Chair--the Salazar-Alexander amendment.\n  I hope we could do this in an orderly way. We have been on this bill \nnow for a week and a half. We are clearly going to be on it through the \nend of this week. It would be important, as we move toward disposition \nof this measure, to have all Senators who have important amendments \nhave an opportunity to be heard.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I had the opportunity this morning to listen to the \nmajority leader, Harry Reid, as I presided. He made it clear that he \nwould be perfectly willing to allow a 50-vote majority vote on both the \nLevin-Reed amendment and the Cornyn amendment or the proposed McConnell \namendment. I think if there is any attempt to obstruct the will of the \nSenate, it is by those who are suggesting that we must have a 60-vote \nthreshold. I think Senator Reid made it clear that he would be happy to \nentertain a limited debate and a majority vote on the Levin-Reed \namendment, the Kyl amendment, or other amendments that may be \nappropriate on the policy in Iraq.\n  I also understand at this moment, under the pending unanimous \nconsent, the Senator from Illinois is to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis hard work with the Senator from Michigan in preparing this bill on \nDefense authorization.\n  With all due respect to the minority leader, the statement he made on \nthe floor earlier is not accurate. The Republican minority leader said, \non issues relating to Iraq, we have required 60 votes. I remind the \nRepublican minority leader that the vote on the timetable on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill was a simple majority vote. It was not \na 60-vote threshold. The most important Iraq vote of the year did not \nrequire 60 votes on the floor of the Senate. It passed the Senate with \na bipartisan rollcall, with 51 or 52 Members supporting it, and it was \nsent to President Bush for one of his only three vetoes since he was \nelected President. I am sure the minority leader from Kentucky \nremembers that it was not a 60-vote requirement.\n  Now, let's look at the Defense authorization bill here--at the \nhistory of the Defense authorization bill. Once again, I ask the \nminority leader from Kentucky to please look at the record. What he \nsaid earlier on the floor is not accurate.\n  In the last debate on the Defense authorization bill, there were two \nIraq amendments offered. One was by Senators Levin and Reed and another \nby Senator Kerry. Both related to the war in Iraq, and both required \nonly a majority vote.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has not accurately portrayed what occurred \non the floor of the Senate either with our supplemental appropriations \nbill or the previous Defense authorization bill. Now, for those who are \nfollowing this debate and wondering: Why are you worried about how many \nvotes are required, this is what the Senate is all about. The question \nis, Will this Senate speak on the issue of the policy on the war in \nIraq?\n  The Senator from Kentucky understands--because he has been a veteran \nof this body--that he does not have a majority of the Senators \nsupporting his position or the position of President Bush. So he \nstarted this debate by saying we won't allow a majority vote.\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\nIt will take 60 votes--60 percent of the Senate--to change the policy \non the war in Iraq. The Senator from Kentucky is betting that he can \nhold enough Republican Senators back from voting for a change in policy \non the war in Iraq to defeat our efforts to start bringing our soldiers \nhome. That is his procedural approach. He has stood by it. But he \nshould confess it for what it is. It is a departure from where we have \nbeen on the debate on Iraq, on the supplemental appropriations bill, \nand on the Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate, and it is wrong. It is wrong to \nrequire 60 percent of this body to vote this way if, traditionally, on \nthe war in Iraq we have required only a simple majority. I suppose it \nis encouraging to us that more than 60 percent of the American people \nget it. They understand how failed this policy has been of the Bush \nadministration--the policy being supported by the minority leader of \nthe Senate. They understand that. They want us to do something about \nit. But the Senator from Kentucky has thrown this obstacle in our path. \nHe created this procedural roadblock. He has filibustered--starting a \nfilibuster to stop the debate on the war in Iraq.\n  I have been here for a few years, and I have not seen a full-\nthroated, fully implemented filibuster that you might have recalled \nfrom ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' when Jimmy Stewart stood at his \ndesk, until he crumpled in exhaustion, filibustering a bill to stop it. \nOver the years, our gentility has led us to a different kind of \nfilibuster. It is a filibuster in name only, where one side says we are \ngoing to keep this debate going on indefinitely, and the other side \nsays we are going to bring it to a close with a motion for cloture, and \nwe will see you in 30 hours; have a nice time we will see you tomorrow \nmorning.\n  We are going to change that procedure this week. Since the Republican \nside has decided they want to filibuster our effort to debate the war \npolicy on Iraq, we have decided on the Democratic side that we are \ngoing to have a real filibuster. One of the critics of this recently \ncalled it a stunt that we would stay in session--a stunt that we would \nhave a sleepless night for Senators, a stunt that we would \ninconvenience Senators and staff, the press, and those who follow the \nproceedings. I don't think it is a stunt. I think it reflects the \nreality of this war.\n\n  How many sleepless nights have our soldiers and their families spent \nwaiting to find out whether they will come home alive? How many \nsleepless nights have they spent praying that after the second and \nthird redeployment their soldier will still have the courage and \nstrength to beat back the enemy and come home to their family? It is \nabout time for the Senate to spend at least one sleepless night. Maybe \nit is only a symbol, but it is an important symbol for the soldiers and \ntheir families. It really goes to the nature of sacrifice.\n  I guess I was raised as a little boy reading about World War II and \nremembering the Korean war when my two brothers served. There was a \nsense of national commitment in those wars. People back home, as well \nas those on the front, believed they were in it together. Sacrifices \nhad to be made, your daily living habits, the kinds of things you could \nbuy, and ration cards and buying U.S. savings bonds. America was one \nunited Nation in those wars. We accepted that shared sacrifice, and we \nwere better for it. But during this war, sad to say, this President has \nnot summoned that same spirit of sacrifice. He basically told us that \nthis war can be waged without inconveniencing the lives of most \nAmericans.\n  Our soldiers go through more than inconvenience. They go through \nhardship and deprivation. Many face injury and death in serving our \ncountry. But for most of us, life goes on as normal. This President \nhasn't asked great sacrifice from the American people.\n  When I visited Iraq, it was not uncommon to have a marine or soldier \nsay to me over lunch: Does anybody know what is going on over here? \nDoes anybody know what we are up against? It is a legitimate question. \nWe focus on these superficial stories in the press that don't mean a \nthing and forget the obvious.\n  The obvious is this: Every month we are losing American lives; about \n100 American soldiers die each month in this war in Iraq, and 1,000 are \nseriously injured. We spend $12 billion each month. That is the \nreality.\n  I know there is frustration by the soldiers and their families that \nwe are not paying close enough attention. But the American people \nunderstand that this failed policy from the Bush administration has to \ncome to an end. Wasn't it interesting over the weekend when the Prime \nMinister of Iraq invited us to leave, and said: You can take off \nanytime you would like, America. We will take care of our own problems. \nPrime Minister al-Maliki, the man we helped to bring to office, whom we \nhoped would show the leadership in Iraq for its future, asked America \nto pick up and go whenever we would like to.\n  What do the Iraqi people think about our presence? Well, 69 percent \nof them say our presence in Iraq today, with our troops, makes it more \ndangerous to live there. More than 2 million of those soldiers, of \nthose Iraqis, have left that country as refugees. Millions have been \ndisplaced from their homes. Thousands--we don't even know the number--\nhave been injured and killed. They want us to leave--this occupation \nArmy of Americans.\n  What do the American people think about this occupation in Iraq? They \nwant it to end as well. They don't see any end in sight. They don't \nhear from this President the kinds of strategy or direction that leads \nthem to believe that this will end well or end soon. They want our \ntroops to start coming home. I agree with them. I don't believe the \nIraqis will accept responsibility for their own country until we start \nleaving. If the Iraqis know that every time there is a problem, they \ncan dial 9-1-1 and bring on 20,000 of our best and bravest soldiers to \nquell the violence on their streets, what kind of incentive is that for \nthem to protect their own country and make the critical political \ndecisions which may lead one day to stability?\n  I look at this Cornyn amendment just filed. I respect my colleague \nfrom Texas, but I tell you, he is asking for too much. He is asking the \nUnited States to stay in Iraq to make certain that it succeeds. How \nlong is that going to be? How long will that go on?\n  There are three battles going on in Iraq today: First, who is in \ncharge? The Sunnis, Shia, Sadr militia, al-Qaida, or some other force? \nThe Kurds also have to be part of the equation. That battle goes on \nevery day on the floor of the Parliament in Iraq as they try to decide \nwho is going to try to govern their country.\n  There is a second battle going on as well. It is a battle as to \nwhether Iraq is going to be a nation. The Cornyn amendment assumes, and \nmany people assume, that Iraq has been a nation forever. It has not. \nCertainly, in the depths of history, you can find Mesopotamia. We all \nread about it in the earliest civilizations, and about the Tigris and \nEuphrates. But Iraq, as we know it today, was the creation of British \ndiplomats after World War I who sat down with a map and said the French \ncan take Lebanon, bring in the Shia and Sunni--on and on, creating \ncountries out of whole cloth at the end of a war, dividing up the soils \nof the Middle East. That was the creation of Iraq as we know it. It has \nnot been in existence that long--not one century.\n  Iraq has to decide whether there is more that binds them than divides \nthem. They have to decide whether the Kurds, Sunni, and Shia of this \nlocation want to come together as a nation to share in governance, in \nrevenue, and to share in their future. That is an ongoing debate in \nIraq today.\n  There is a third debate in Iraq today that is even deeper in history. \nIt is a debate between warring Islamic factions that has been going on \nfor 14 centuries. Ever since the death of the great prophet Mohammed, \nIslamic people have argued over his rightful heirs--one branch of the \nSunni religion of Muslims or one in the Shia--and they came to \ndifferent conclusions. They have not resolved that. Often, that \ndifference of opinion has erupted into violence, which we see today on \nthe streets of Iraq.\n  So Senator Cornyn files an amendment that says the United States \nshould stay there with its forces until they resolve these three \nproblems: Who is going to govern, whether there will be a nation, and \nthis Islamic division. Is that what we bargained for when the President \nasked us to invade Iraq? It\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\ncertainly is not. Not one of those things was included in the \nPresident's request for the authorization of force in Iraq.\n  Do you remember why President Bush told us we had to invade Iraq? \nSaddam Hussein--a tyrant killing his own people--was a threat to the \nregion and to his own country. Saddam Hussein is gone, dug out of a \nhole in the ground, put on trial by his own people, and executed.\n  The second reason the President said we had to invade Iraq was to \nfind and destroy weapons of mass destruction. Well, we have been \nlooking for 4\\1/2\\ years, Mr. President, for weapons of mass \ndestruction, and we cannot find one. So that reason for the invasion of \nAmerican forces is long gone. And the final, of course, was to protect \nany threat of Iraq to America's security. I can tell you that after \nSaddam Hussein was deposed and dispatched quickly by our fine military, \nand when weapons of mass destruction were not found, Iraq was no threat \nto the United States.\n  Now comes the new Republican rationale, the Cornyn-McConnell \nrationale: We need to stay in Iraq until they resolve century-old \nbattles over the Islamic religion. We need to stay in Iraq until they \ndecide whether they want to come together as a nation. We need to stay \nin Iraq until the Parliament decides to roll up its sleeves and make \nimportant political decisions about their future. Just how long will \nthat be? How many American soldiers will be called into action for \nthose goals? How many times will Congress be called on to vote for \nauthorization of force to reach these objectives?\n  They have told us what it is all about. From the point of view of the \nBush administration and their supporters on the Republican side of the \naisle, there is no end in sight in our occupation of Iraq. They would \nhave us stay there for a long time. The American people know better. \nThey understand the sacrifices we have made.\n  The President likes to define this in terms of victory and defeat, \nsaying if we start bringing American troops home, somehow, in his mind, \nthat is a defeat. I say to the President, there are several things he \nshould consider. We were not defeated when we deposed Saddam Hussein. \nWe were successful. We were not defeated when we scoured that country \nand found no weapons of mass destruction. We were successful. We were \nnot defeated when we gave the Iraqi people a chance for the first free \nelection in their history. We were successful. We were not defeated \nwhen they were allowed to form their own Government to plan for their \nown future. We were successful. We certainly have not been defeated day \nto day with the courage of our men and women in uniform.\n  I hear an argument from time to time as well: If our troops start \ncoming home now and things go badly in Iraq, those who have served and \nsacrificed and even those who have died will have done so in vain. I \ncouldn't disagree more. History has taught us a very basic lesson. The \ntest of courage of a soldier is not to be measured by the wisdom of \nPresidents and generals to send them into battle. Presidents and \ngenerals make serious mistakes. They send troops into battle where they \nhave no chance to win. But those soldiers do their duty. They show \nheroism, courage, and valor, and no one--no one--can take that away \nfrom them.\n  This political debate about the wisdom of the President's foreign \npolicy has reached a point where we have a number of amendments on the \nfloor. The Republican leadership has established hurdles and \nblockades--everything they can find--to stop us from a vote that \nreflects the feelings of the American people. Mr. President, you know \nwhy? They are afraid of what the American people want. They are afraid \nthe American people may prevail. So they have dreamed up this \nprocedural requirement of 60 votes, a requirement that did not take \nplace on the Iraq amendments on previous Defense authorization bills, a \nrequirement that did not take place when it came to our supplemental.\n  We have offered them: Let's have a majority vote. Let's speak as a \nSenate to this issue seriously, an up-or-down vote on our amendment, an \nup-or-down vote on their amendment. They rejected it. Sixty votes--they \nhave it wired. They have it figured out. There is one thing they don't \nhave figured out and that is how they are going to go home and explain \nthis situation, how will these Senators go back to their States after \nthey have told their people they are giving up on the President's \npolicy in Iraq and explain why they didn't support the only amendment \nthat will seriously change our policy in Iraq?\n  I don't think they can. They can talk about supporting other \namendments. There is only one amendment by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed, and the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, that puts a \ntimetable to bring this war to a close that doesn't ask the President \nto consider our point of view but says we will use our congressional \npowers to require of the President a change in policy. Only one vote. \nEvery other vote these Senators may cast, they are going to say: Oh, I \ntold you I disagreed with the President and that is why I voted this \nway.\n  Let me tell you, they don't stand the test of scrutiny. Look \ncarefully at those amendments. See if they require of the President a \nchange in policy. See if they bring one American soldier safely home. \nIf they don't, then they don't achieve the goals the American people \nexpect of us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at some point, I would be privileged if I \ncould enter into a colloquy with my valued friend. So at the proper \njuncture in his remarks, perhaps we could have a bit of a colloquy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Out of great respect for the Senator from Virginia, I \nwould like to give him that answer now.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend. We can have our debates, and we \nfrequently do, on procedure, and it is very confusing, of course, to \nthe American public. But these are old rules that go back, I might say \nwith some sense of pride, to Thomas Jefferson. He had a hand in writing \nthem. Somehow this magnificent institution, the Senate, has been able \nto serve our great Republic these 200-some-odd years.\n  Apart from procedure--and it seems to me I recall that at an earlier \njuncture in the spring when we were debating certain amendments on \nIraq, the Senator from Virginia had an amendment. It got over 50 votes. \nIt was a bipartisan amendment. That amendment, quite interesting, while \nit failed to reach the 60-vote margin, it was picked up by the \nappropriators and word for word written into the appropriations bill.\n  It required, among other things, that the President report on July \n15. That report, I think, was of value. People can differ with it. I \nknow it attracted a lot of attention and widespread press coverage. It \nwas of value.\n  That report also set up an independent group. I consulted with my \ngood friend, the chairman, Senator Levin, and told him I felt all the \nyears we have been working together we get a lot of facts from the \nPentagon about the status of Iraq's security forces. Shouldn't we have \nan independent group not affiliated with the Department of Defense--I \nam not, in any way, impugning the accuracy of their facts--have an \nindependent group give us a second opinion.\n  GEN Jim Jones, former Commandant of the Marine Corps, offered to head \nup that group. I talked with him about it. He thought about it a long \ntime. He decided to do it. He has about 18 individuals with military \nexperience and two former police chiefs. They got back this weekend \nfrom a very intensive 1-week schedule studying these situations. So \nthere is a great convergence of information that will be brought to \nbear and made public the first week in September.\n  But back to this question before us. The distinguished Republican \nleader put an amendment up. I would like to ask my distinguished \ncolleague if he would cover with me the provisions and what his views \nare on some of the findings in the amendment.\n  This is a sense of the Senate on the consequences of a failed state \nin Iraq. Much of this material was put before the Senate a few days \nago, filed by our distinguished colleague from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. Would \nthe Senator from Illinois engage me in asking a few questions about it \nor is there another time he would be willing to do it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, if I may say to my colleague from Virginia, I will \nconsider this colloquy to be in the form of a question without yielding \nthe floor.\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Please proceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. For instance, the first finding:\n\n       A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are \n     determined to attack the United States and United States \n     allies.\n\n  We know from experience in Afghanistan that bin Laden occupied a \npiece of territory there and set up his training camp. Much of the \ntraining that led to the horrific damage to our Nation, loss of life \nand property, occurred there--of course, September 11. Does the Senator \nnot agree--I am curious, I would like to get some understanding of what \nthe Senator's thoughts are on this sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I wish to express my thinking and feelings about \nthe Senator from Virginia, whom I respect very much, who served our \ncountry so well in so many capacities. He is the longest serving \nSenator from the State of Virginia in the history of the United States \nof America.\n  Mr. WARNER. One other, Mr. President, was a bit longer. I am No. 2, \nkind of like the Senator from Illinois, No. 2.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Second longest in the history of the State of Virginia \nand who has been a constructive partner in our efforts to deal with \nthis issue of Iraq. Even before other Senators on his side of the aisle \nquestioned, spoke out, he was there, and I respect him very much for \nthat effort.\n  Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia that the Levin-Reed \namendment is conscious of the very first point he made, saying that \neven redeploying troops, we would reserve the right to use our \nsoldiers, use our troops to stop the expansion of al-Qaida. So we are \nnot walking away from that threat.\n  Al-Qaida, as the Senator from Virginia knows, were the real culprits \non 9/11. They are the ones who are sworn enemies of the United States \nand in what we believe. I don't believe any Senator on my side, in the \nLevin-Reed amendment or otherwise, has suggested we would not continue \nto work to stop the advance of al-Qaida and its evil scheme.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator is accurate. I have \nstudied the Levin amendment. I am opposed to it because of the fixed \ntimetables. But let's proceed to the second one. I think we have \ncovered the first, and I find it very helpful.\n  The second finding:\n\n       The Iraq Study Group report found that ``[a] chaotic Iraq \n     could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally.''\n\n  To me that seems to have some basis in fact. Does the Senator agree \nwith that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Virginia in response, at some \npoint, the Iraqis have to take control of their country, their \nterritory, and their future. It is certainly not in their best \ninterest, if they want to develop, for example, an oil industry that is \ngoing to fuel their economy and improve the lives of the people, to \nallow terrorist groups to run without restraint.\n  So, yes, I think that is a concern they should have as a nation, and \nthat is why the second part of the Levin-Reed amendment is so \nimportant. We reserve the right for American forces to help train and \nequip the Iraqi soldiers, Army, and police.\n  Fighting terrorism, we now see most often is a military function, but \nI think historically it has been a police function. Regardless of \nwhich, we reserve in the Levin-Reed amendment the right for America to \ncontinue to invest in the Iraqi Army and police force, for that very \nreason, so there is internal stability in Iraq, even as our combat \nforces are removed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate that answer. I think there is \na provision--as a matter of fact, the amendment Senator Lugar and I \nfiled has very much the same language in it. Let's proceed to No. 3.\n\n       The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Al Qaeda will portray any \n     failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant victory \n     that will be featured prominently as they recruit for their \n     cause in the region and around the world.''\n\n  That concerns me. I think there is some truth to that statement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Virginia served on the Intelligence \nCommittee, as I did for 4 years. I think he served longer. He will \nrecall we were told by our intelligence agencies that our invasion of \nIraq has led to an emergence of al-Qaida terrorism in that country. \nSadly, these terrorists are taking their training by trying to kill \nAmerican soldiers and those who support us.\n  So my feeling is that the current strategy we have been using, \nunfortunately, is fueling this growth in terrorism, growth in al-Qaida, \nthe presence of all these combat troops.\n  I sincerely believe we have to understand that fighting al-Qaida, \nfighting terrorism is still a high priority. This administration was \ndiverted from our first priority.\n  The Senator from Virginia may remember that after 9/11, within days, \nthe President came to the Senate and asked us to declare war on al-\nQaida and those responsible for 9/11. The vote was unanimous. Every \nSenator voted in favor of that request, both political parties. Those \nwere sworn enemies of the United States who had killed 3,000 innocent \npeople. But we lost sight of that goal. Instead of focusing on \nAfghanistan, the Taliban, and al-Qaida, we were diverted into Iraq.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, as we start bringing combat \nsoldiers out of Iraq, I don't believe we should walk away from our \nresponsibility in Afghanistan, fighting the Taliban, working on the \nborder with Pakistan to try to make sure the growth of al-Qaida is \nstopped.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator most respectfully, I \nknow no one over here who wants to try to do a precipitous withdrawal \nor lessen our efforts against al-Qaida. As a matter of fact, we want to \nreinforce our efforts against al-Qaida. We can go back and argue the \nnumerical presence of al-Qaida at the time we went in. I do recall that \nvery vividly and conducted many hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee. Al-Qaida was not high on the scope. There was mention of it. \nWe have to deal with the facts that exist now, and it is clear, for \nwhatever reason, they are now in that area in significant numbers \nlarger than when we went in. I, personally, feel it is not as a \nconsequence of our military action thus far. They simply see the \nterrific divisions between the Sunni culture and the culture of the \nShia, and they are trying to foment among those two venerable religious \ncultures as much fighting as they possibly can. I think we both have to \nagree, to that extent, they have been successful.\n  Clearly, al-Qaida has as its main goal, at such time as possible, to \nbring about further harm to the United States of America. There is no \ndoubt in my mind, and I am sure there is no doubt in the mind of the \nSenator from Illinois. So I think anything that is portrayed as a \nfailure of our commitment in Iraq could be utilized, as I said, for \nrecruitment of their troops, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere \nin the world.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I say to the Senator from Virginia in response that I \nbelieve--and I think the Levin-Reed amendment addresses this in section \n3--we also should be thinking beyond the parameters of our current \ndiscussion about military prisons and about other nations in the \nregion. I am sure the Senator from Virginia is going to bring that up, \ntoo, as part of it.\n  It strikes me at this point in time that other nations in the region \ninterested in stability in their own countries and stability overall \nhave not accepted or shouldered the responsibility they should. Whether \nit is the Arab League or some other group, they need to step forward \nand say that the territorial integrity of Iraq, the stability of Iraq \nis in the best interests of the region. I don't think they are going to \ndo that as long as the U.S. presence is so overwhelming, as long as we \nare the issue. If the issue is Iraq and its future, I think it is more \nlikely these countries will step forward, and this Levin-Reed amendment \nmakes that point.\n  What we are talking about is a comprehensive strategy to deal with \nthe future of Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. But I say, in response to my distinguished colleague, it \nis for that very reason the President is dispatching the Secretaries of \nState and Defense into that region, to bring that point very clearly, \nthis problem which is being experienced in Iraq. And when\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\nI say ``experienced,'' I mean devastating loss of life of Iraqi \ncitizens, considerable loss of life of our own forces, and loss of \nlimb. That is something which every Senator on both sides of the aisle \nis concerned with daily. But thus far, the bordering nations certainly \nhave not stepped up, in my estimation, to take a constructive role. If \nanything, we have, in Syria and Iran, pretty convincing evidence that \nthey are taking steps antithetical to bringing about a resolution of \nsome sort of peace and stability in Iraq.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say, in response to the Senator from Virginia, \nthat I don't recall the exact vote, but when Senator Lieberman offered \nan amendment to this bill last week relating to Iran, the vote was \noverwhelmingly bipartisan. We agree with that. How do you contain Iran? \nHow do you stop Iraq from becoming an Iranian client state?\n  There is so much we can do, but the region has to respond. The \nSenator from Virginia knows as well as I do that there is division \nwithin the Islamic religion and that the Sunni faction or element is \nthe most dominant in that region and around the world.\n  Mr. WARNER. By far. I think it has been 90 percent----\n  Mr. DURBIN. An overwhelming percentage.\n  Mr. WARNER.--are associated with the Sunni perspective versus about \n10 or less percent the Shia.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So it does not seem to be in the best interest of other \nIslamic states to see the development of a Shia force that combines \nIraq and Iran. So my feeling is, again either through the United \nNations, through NATO, through other groups, but trying to make this a \nmuch more inclusive effort, that we have a much better chance.\n  The problem is clear: As long as it is the United States dominating \nthe agenda in Iraq, it is an obstacle for other countries to get \ninvolved. I salute the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State \nfor their efforts, but I think we have complicated the situation \ndramatically with the length of this war and the visibility of the \nUnited States as the lead force in this invasion.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have to decide on the facts as they exist now, and I \nthink our Government has. But even in the recent words of the \nPresident, he wants to intensify the participation of other nations in \nthis situation.\n  My colleague, Senator Lugar, in preparing our amendment--and he is \nquite expert in this area--has a considerable portion of our \namendment--again, a sense of the Senate--directed at steps our country \ncould be taking to augment those steps already taken. He recently met \nwith the Secretary of State. They had a discussion here a few days ago, \nprior to our entering the amendment on this very matter. So we are \nmoving forward.\n  I think my colleague and I have no difference on the need to involve \nthe border states and other Muslim countries of responsibility.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Virginia, he used some words \nwhich I think tell part of the story here when he said his amendment \nwith Senator Lugar is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. He is a veteran \nlawmaker and knows a sense-of-the-Senate resolution does not have the \npower of law. It is to suggest policy changes to the administration. \nThe difference with Levin-Reed, if I am not mistaken, is we are dealing \nwith legislative language. We are actually changing the law of the land \nwhen it comes to our forces in Iraq. That is significantly different. \nThis is self-enforcing, the Levin-Reed amendment. Sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions, either by Senator Lugar or Senator Cornyn notwithstanding, \nwill not change the policy. They do not have the binding impact of law \nas the Levin-Reed amendment does.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have to always monitor ourselves with the Constitution \nof the United States, and it explicitly gives to the President the \npower as Commander in Chief to direct our forces and to employ such \nstrategy as he deems necessary to defend the security interests of our \ncountry. That is my concern with my distinguished colleague, Senator \nLevin, and he and I have worked here in this Chamber now in our 29th \nyear, for those following this debate. My concern is that Congress \nbecome involved in military strategy and writing into law precisely \nwhat is done. I think that is crossing a constitutional issue.\n  I would like to continue with my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might just say that I am glad my colleague from West \nVirginia is not on the floor because I don't have my Constitution in my \npocket. But certainly article I, section 8--thank you, Senator, for \ncovering for me here--says--if the Senator from Virginia will bear with \nme for just one moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know the provision quite well. It is on the regulation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. To raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, \nprovide for militia, to provide for organizing, arming, and \ndisciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be \nemployed--there may be another section here I am overlooking.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think you have about got it, if I may say.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Within the powers of Congress, we are not silent when it \ncomes to the conduct of our military in this country.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, we are on a coequal basis, as the Senator well knows.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. To make rules for the Government and regulation of the \nland and naval forces. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I remember on this floor and my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan remembers when Senator Byrd argued very \npersuasively about certain aspects of the famous War Powers Act. Now, \nif we bring all of that history into this debate, and it may well be \nthat we should do that, the reason that subject was carefully \nconsidered by the Senate, passed, and became law many years ago--each \nPresident has acknowledged that in spirit they are complying with the \ndirections of the Congress, but they do not want it put into law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator from Virginia, and I know this is \nnot following the exact process of our Senate rules, but I would ask \nhim if he would address a point I made earlier; that the authorization \nfor the use of force which President George W. Bush brought before us \nin October 2002 was explicit in the reasons for our invasion of Iraq--\nthe threat of Saddam Hussein, the threat of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and any threat of that nation to the security of the \nUnited States. Does the Senator from Virginia believe that \nauthorization of the use of force applies to the current circumstance \nin Iraq today?\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I was going to speak on that later tonight when I \naddress my colleagues and point to the Congressional Record today, \nwhich contains the amendment by Senator Lugar and myself. But, \nessentially, we bring to the attention of the Senate and provide the \nfollowing language for the President, if I may read it, on page S 9224 \nof Friday's Congressional Record, in our section:\n\n       The findings that supported H.J. Res. 114, Public Law 107-\n     243, which was enacted in 2002 and which authorized the \n     President to use the Armed Forces of the United States \n     against Iraq, require review and revision.\n\n  So, Senator, I have gone on record, together with my colleague, \nSenator Lugar, that this is necessary, and we further call on the \nPresident--and I read the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What section are you reading?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reading section 3 of my amendment, and it is on page S \n9224 of Friday's Congressional Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What section of the bill?\n  Mr. WARNER. It is our amendment, it is on page 14 of our amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there a number?\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment is at the desk, on page 14.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield so we can follow him, I \nwondered if there is a number in front of the paragraph you are \nreading.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will hand you my copy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Section 14.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wanted to read the important second sentence--I \nactually wrote this provision myself; Senator Lugar concurred in it--\nthe second sentence, after addressing the fact that we felt it required \nreview by the Congress of the United States. That is the one required \nunder the appropriations bill language, which we passed here--not \npassed; 50-some-odd Senators voted for it when I put it up.\n\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\n\n       Therefore, as part of the September 15th, 2007, report, \n     Congress expects that the President will submit to Congress a \n     proposal to revise Public Law 107-243.\n\n  So Senator Lugar and I come foursquare and address that issue \nstraight-on. There is concern. I was one of the four Senators who wrote \nthe language, and if I may engage my colleagues, the law, 107-243, \nprovided support for U.S. diplomatic efforts. That is section 2.\n\n       The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by \n     the President to\n       (1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security \n     Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding \n     Iraq, and encourages him in those efforts; and\n       (2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security \n     Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, \n     evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies \n     with all relevant Security Council resolutions.\n       Section 3. Authorization for the use of United States Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  That is the provision Senator Lugar and I address in our amendment. \nThat authorization is very short, and I would like to engage in the \nreading of it.\n\n       Authorization for use of United States Armed Forces. The \n     President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United \n     States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in \n     order to\n       (1) defend the national security of the United States \n     against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and\n       (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions regarding Iraq.\n\n  So one is the benchmark, the underlying statement by the Congress \nwhich gives rise to the actions today to support the President, but I \nbelieve that in view of all that has transpired in the nearly 5 years--\nthis will be 5 years since we passed this in October--it is the duty of \nthe Congress to review it, and we have asked in our amendment for the \nPresident to come forth with proposals.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to ask a very \npointed question. And I think I know the answer, but I want to get his \nopinion. Does the Senator from Virginia believe that today this \nadministration is using military force in Iraq beyond the scope of our \nauthorization for the use of force in October of 2002?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the President can still act within that language \nright there--defend the national security of the United States against \nthe continuing threat posed by Iraq. The Government of Iraq that \nexisted at the time this was written is gone; that was Saddam Hussein. \nThere is a new government there. But they, unfortunately, have not \nexercised the full control, the full reins of sovereignty that the \npeople of Iraq, voting freely, have given them. We set up the \nstructure, the infrastructure that enabled those votes to take place, \nand we gave them a measure of security so that they could go to the \npolls and vote. But, in my judgment, this language still underpins the \nPresident's actions.\n  I would remind the Senator, in a way, each authorization act of the \narmed services, since enactment of this law, in a sense de facto \nconfirms the President's authority that he is exercising under it. We \nnever challenged him in a single--I think I counted up 4 authorization \nbills and probably 10 different appropriations bills that have been \npassed authorizing the President to use these funds.\n  Again, it is sort of de facto recognition that the language still \nstands. But my thought is that the American people, the world is \nentitled to Congress addressing it and, hopefully, we can resolve it \nand put down in greater detail the authority that the Congress wishes \nto give the President as he moves forward, having hopefully given the \nCongress the benefit of such revisions in policy as he deems necessary \nin early October this year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Virginia, I am going to \nyield because I wish to allow the Senator from Michigan, if he wishes, \nto continue this colloquy. But I wish to say what the Senator from \nVirginia has said is troubling to me as an individual Senator in this \nregard. I was one of 23 Senators who voted against the authorization of \nthe use of force in Iraq. I believed it was wrong. My position did not \nprevail.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is this bill we are discussing became law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The majority position in the Senate at that time, even \nthe majority position on my side of the aisle, voted for the \nauthorization of force.\n  I had believed, and this goes back to earlier service in the House, \nthat once Congress has spoken before the Nation, we move forward \ntogether. That is why I have supported the appropriations necessary for \nthe forces in the field, even though I disagree with the policy and \nvoted against the authorization of force. I have always believed they \ndeserve to have the training, the equipment, whatever is necessary, to \ncome home safely.\n  I would say to the Senator from Virginia, his observation a moment \nago is troubling. I don't wish to put words in his mouth, but when I \nasked whether we were asking beyond the scope of the original \nauthorization, the Senator from Virginia said that with each subsequent \nDefense authorization bill and appropriations bill, we were \nreauthorizing. I use that word, but I don't want to presume the Senator \nsaid that word. That is how I interpret it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I said those words. I stand by those words. I said ``de \nfacto'' because there was every available means in the course of the \ndebate on our authorizations bill for colleagues to come and challenge \nthis. No one did.\n  As a matter of fact, the first reference to this occurred when I was \nchairman of the committee and I remember, it was last fall--I think it \nwas General Abizaid, I asked him about this very provision. It is in \nthe Record. I said I was concerned about whether there was an \nobligation of Congress to go back and review this language and \ndetermine whether it comports with the various missions he was \nperforming at the direction of the President.\n  I can't recall exactly what his responses were. But I did raise this. \nThat is the very reason I asked Senator Lugar to join me in raising it \nagain. I think it is incumbent upon the Congress to debate it. But we \ncertainly have passed by and legislated many times, with full knowledge \nthat this is the basis on which the funds we have appropriated are \nbeing utilized for the forces.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Virginia, I have been \nasked to file a motion, which I am going to do at this time. I will \nsend this to the desk.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we will go off the colloquy for that \npurpose?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2252 to Amendment No. 2241\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2252 to amendment No. 2241.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       This section shall take effect one day after the bill's \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no motions \nto commit be in order prior to the cloture votes on Wednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. We did get part way into one of the \npending amendments, and that is the amendment of Senator McConnell. I \nwish we had gotten one paragraph further and that is the National \nIntelligence Estimate, its conclusions. As a matter of fact, I \nunderstand another updated intelligence estimate is soon going to be \nreceived by the Congress and the American public. The National \nIntelligence Estimate states:\n\n       Al-Qaida would attempt to use Anbar province to plan \n     further attacks outside of Iraq;\n       Neighboring countries would consider actively intervening \n     in Iraq; and\n       Sectarian violence would significantly increase in Iraq \n     accompanied by massive civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n  That is my concern with the Levin amendment. If we go in and announce \nwith concrete law as to what our tactics should be, and we have this \nfixed timetable, with all due respect to my friend, I cannot support \nthat.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we are talking about some very serious\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\nissues that impact the life and safety of our soldiers whom we have \ncalled on to serve us in Iraq. It is a matter the American people care \nabout, and we owe them the most careful study.\n  To my distinguished colleague, the assistant Democratic majority \nleader, Senator Durbin, I would say one thing about a change in \nstrategy. We voted to change our strategy. We voted 80 to 14, 53 days \nago, to change our strategy, to send General Petraeus and fund the \nsurge that is going on in Iraq. That is our strategy. We just voted on \nthis. In fact, a few weeks ago, the last part of that surge arrived in \nIraq. What, are we going to change it again, this month?\n  Later this week, we will vote on the Levin amendment to decide \nwhether to change, again, our strategy in Iraq. Changing strategy by \nCongress during a time of war, particularly making changes that are \nopposed by the military and our Commander in Chief, is not a small \nmatter. Our decisions deal with war and how to achieve peace and will \naffect the safety and the mission of those magnificent men and women \nwho now serve us in Iraq.\n  For the busy American, the casual observer, and even the world \ncitizen, it may be this is an appropriate time to vote on this subject \nagain. Certainly, the frustration in our country and inside all of us \nis high and we are deeply concerned.\n  I would note that I think all of us agree that quite a number of \nerrors have taken place in our military actions in Iraq. I suggest \nperhaps the most serious error was our belief that we could, too \nreadily, alter this Government in Iraq and create a new government that \nwould be effective virtually overnight.\n  That is contrary to good, conservative principles. These people in \nIraq have never had a heritage of a functioning government other than \nbrutality, and it is very difficult to do. I think we are finding out \nit is very difficult to do. It can't be done as quickly as many of us \nwould like to have thought when this activity was begun some years ago.\n  But with regard to this change in policy, I suggest the Members in \nthe Senate know better. We know it is not appropriate to be changing \nour policy again. We know that any nation, especially one that aspires \nto be a great nation, must deal with these life-and-death matters with \nmaturity and sound judgment. We know if we were to lift our eyes off \npolitics and emotion, that our country, striving to do good, is facing \na most difficult challenge in Iraq. Things have not gone well. Our \nterrorist enemies are watching our politics with great interest. \nSometimes they play us like a Stradivarius. And so our allies are \nwatching. So, indeed, is the whole world. The terrorists are quite \nsophisticated and strive to produce a continuous series of bloody \nheadlines to affect American public opinion. Our judgment, our \ncharacter, our principles, our very souls are being tested. But this \nNation has faced tough times before.\n  Don't we remember the history of Washington at Valley Forge or the \nburning of our own Capitol by the British in 1812 or the brutal bloody \nCivil War or the massive deaths in World War I or the attack on Pearl \nHarbor or the Italian campaign, the ferocious battles for Iwo Jima, \nOkinawa, D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge or the Chosin Reservoir in the \nKorean war? These are major moments in American history, and blunders \nin strategy and tactics and timing occurred in almost every one of \nthem. Many errors occurred. Failures that cost lives unnecessarily, \nplaced our Nation at greater risk than was necessary. But that is the \nnature of war.\n  Enemies lose a great deal of sleep trying to figure out what the \nweaknesses are of their adversary and trying to exploit that, and \nfrequently they are successful, to a point. But certainly it is \nappropriate, even in times of war, that the Congress question and \nchallenge the Commander in Chief and our military generals. But that \nchallenge must be, no matter how vigorous, responsible, and honest. Our \ndomestic politics are quite partisan, true; and, frankly, I have been a \nlittle disappointed at the nature of the debate I have heard this \nafternoon. Republican this and Republican that and President Bush this \nand President Bush that--it sounds more like politics than a sincere \neffort to reach the proper decision about what our future course should \nbe.\n\n  Still, no one should deny that a congressional response to a war, a \nwar that over three-quarters of us voted to authorize, should rise \nabove political gain. With some exceptions, this Congress I think has \ndone so.\n  Truly, there is great concern in our land about the war in Iraq. It \nis real and justified. I readily admit my concern. I will admit I am \nnot able to state with certainty today what our long-term course should \nultimately be or how this will all play out in the end. Therefore, I do \nnot contest the sincerity of those who will disagree with my \nconclusions.\n  I can only state my views honestly and forthrightly because that is \nwhat I have been elected to do, and that is what our soldiers who \ndepend on us for support expect of me.\n  First, I strongly believe this Nation cannot flop around, changing \nits policy from month to month. That would be immature. It would result \nin bad execution of this military effort, this war. It would demoralize \nour soldiers who are walking the streets of Iraq this very moment \nbecause we sent them there.\n  Additionally, this Congress funded their military operations. We \nfunded them. Our duly elected President, our Commander in Chief, has \ndirected the policy with the advice of his commanders in the field. \nThat is what it is. That is what is going on. That is what is \nhappening.\n  Now we had a great debate in April and May over whether to fund the \nso called ``surge'' that President Bush and the Defense Department \nrequested. This is the surge that has, a few weeks ago, reached its \nfull strength. After the full debate, Congress could have said no to \nthe President on his request for the surge and not provided those \nfunds.\n  Fourteen Senators did vote no. But we said yes by an overwhelming \nvote of 80 to 14. On May 24, less than 2 months ago, we authorized the \nsurge and, more importantly, we passed an emergency supplemental to \nfund this surge. Nothing required us in Congress to do that. We \nconcluded it was the right thing to do, considering the serious \nalternatives that existed.\n  Because of the concerns we all had at that time, we required an \ninterim report on July 15th, which has been received on time. We also \ncalled for a complete report from General Petraeus, in September, on \nthe status of his efforts and our soldiers' work.\n  Of course, we had voted to confirm General Petraeus by a vote of 99 \nto 0 to command this operation. There was no mistake then concerning \nthe seriousness of the situation we were in. As General Petraeus \ndescribed the challenge:\n\n       It is difficult but not impossible.\n\n  We were in no way misled about the difficulties we faced, nor were we \nunaware of the most serious ramifications of a failure in Iraq.\n  Thus, on May 24, this Congress, with an overwhelming majority, said: \nLet's go with the surge. But we said: General Petraeus, we will expect \nyou to give us a full, complete, and honest report in September as to \nhow it is going with the good and the bad, and set out specific \nbenchmarks we want you to address. That he promised to, do, and off he \nwent.\n  Yet even before the personnel who were to be deployed to effect this \nsurge had even arrived in Iraq, the Democratic majority leader, Senator \nReid, who voted for the surge, to my dismay, declared it a failure. \nWhile the troops were still arriving, the Democratic leader, the \nmajority leader of the Senate, declared the surge a failure.\n  To me it is unthinkable that this Congress would pull the plug on \nthis operation before it has had a fair chance to work, and we have had \na fair chance to evaluate its effectiveness. We voted for it 53 days \nago. What must the world community think, friend and adversary alike? \nDoes not such immaturity of action reflect poorly on us as a nation? \nNothing has occurred since that time of decision in May to justify \nconcluding that the situation in Iraq has significantly changed for the \nworse? In fact, there are indications that some improvements have \noccurred. We know that General Petraeus, last year, after two tours in \nIraq, 2 years over there, came home and last year wrote the Department \nof\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\nDefense doctrine on how to defeat an insurgency. His expertise was much \nnoted when we confirmed him to go take charge of the soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines who would effectuate this effort. Nowhere in his \nmanual did he ever suggest an insurgency could be defeated in 50 days, \nor 90 days, or 120 days.\n  Victory, we must admit--if you read his manual--takes time, \ndiligence, determination, and smart application of politics, weaponry, \nand forces. His manual sets out methods for how to achieve victory \nagainst an insurgency, the methods for victory.\n  There is simply no basis at this point to conclude that our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines have failed in executing this policy. In \nfact, they are moving out with vigor. After seeing a reduction of \nsectarian violence in Baghdad by two-thirds. This is the sectarian \nviolence, the murders that were occurring between hit squads, Shia and \nSunni, as a result of the violence kicked off by the attack by al-Qaida \non the Samara mosque, and their determined, effective policy to create \nviolence between the Shia and the Sunni. That is what al-Qaida set out \nto do, and they succeeded last year.\n  We have seen that drop by two-thirds, although bombings still occur, \nand the bombings are suicidal, many times with large bombs that kill \nlarge numbers of civilians in shopping areas. But today some of our \ntroops are moving out of Baghdad into the toughest areas outside \nBaghdad, such as the Dyala Province, and making, it appears, progress \nthere.\n  As our soldiers confront enemy strongholds, some of which have never \nbefore been cleared, they demonstrate professionalism and courage that \nreflect the finest qualities that have ever been demonstrated by \nAmerican soldiers.\n  Nor, let me add, has anything occurred that suggests this new \nstrategy is flawed and will not succeed and should be abandoned 53 days \nsince we agreed to see it forward.\n  So with respect, I conclude it would be irresponsible in the extreme \nto have this bunch of politicians sitting in air-conditioned offices in \nWashington reverse a strategy we approved 53 days ago. But that is \nexactly what the Levin-Reed amendment would do.\n  I have tremendous respect for Senator Levin. He is a superb chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee. But I do not agree with him on this \npoint. I do not believe this is right.\n  If you were a soldier or a marine and you had just moved into a tough \nterrorist neighborhood in Iraq, following the directions given to you \nby your President and your Congress, and you saw your comrades take \ncasualties, maybe killed in the course of executing that policy, all in \nthe belief that somebody up there back in Washington had finally \nsettled on a workable plan for victory, and then before your work is \nhalf done, in less than 2 months, you learn the folks up there had now \nchanged their mind again, how would you feel? Wouldn't you think we do \nnot take our mission of our soldiers and what they are doing seriously?\n  We owe our military better than that. We owe them the same courage \nand character they are displaying right now. On the birthday of our \nArmy, I was at a celebration and met a young soldier. I thanked him for \nhis service and began to explain my concern about the long deployments \nwe were asking them to undertake. He cut in, saying, ``Senator, we just \nwant to win.'' Before all that is just, this Congress must not fail \nsuch men.\n  The Levin amendment is pernicious in more ways than I am able to \ndiscuss at this time. It must not pass. We know a full review of our \npolicies will occur in September. We agreed on that in May. That is \ncritically important and valuable. I support such a review. I am open \nminded about what we will decide to do in September.\n  I hope and pray we will be able to reduce the number of our soldiers \nand begin a mature, effective way to reduce that deployment in Iraq, \nbut we will decide our next step then. To execute a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq now, regardless of the conditions on the \nbattlefield, and regardless of the advice of our commanders in the \nfield, is unthinkable. It would be a stain on this Senate for years to \ncome.\n  Has anybody bothered to express an interest in what General Petraeus \nhas to say about it? Things don't always go well. My favorite statue in \nWashington is one that conveys the most historical import, I think, the \none of General Grant right down here in front of the Capitol. He sits \nastride his horse, his campaign hat pulled down, his coat \nwrapped around, his head tilted slightly forward, a perfect picture of \ndetermination in the face of great difficulty.\n\n  It is said 600,000 died in that war on both sides. Over 440,000 \nAmericans died in World War II. This Nation has seen dark days before, \ndays darker than these. So let's keep our poise and our wits about us. \nLet's give General Petraeus and his courageous military personnel a \nchance to effect the strategy we agreed on and asked him to effect.\n  There are other important issues I will suggest to my colleagues as \nwe discuss the Levin amendment. I will note a few briefly.\n  The surge report. The language in our affirmation of the surge in May \ncalled for a report that had benchmarks for improvements in Iraq. Those \nbenchmarks have been much commented upon, but these benchmarks for \nimprovement did not declare that all or any of the benchmarks must be \nmet by September or even by July 15, the time of our interim report. \nThey were to be objective markers by which we could judge progress and \nlack of it, and they were surely not exhaustive of every issue and \nchallenge we faced in Iraq.\n  The fact that progress has been made in only half of those benchmark \nareas does not mean, of course, we should now up and declare the new \noperation a failure and that we should now cut and run. How could \nanyone conclude this July 15 report that shows limited early progress \nin only some areas means General Petraeus has failed? All the extra \nsoldiers arrived there only 3 weeks ago.\n  It is also important to note that the benchmarks seemed to focus on \nthe performance we wish to see by the central government, and they have \nnot been meeting their responsibilities, in my view. I had my sixth \nvisit there this spring. I was able to share that view and that \nfrustration of the American people with the top leaders in Iraq, \nincluding Prime Minister Maliki. We believe they need to do more in the \ncentral government.\n  But, for example, the benchmarks provided no credit at all for the \nstunning progress that has occurred in the al-Anbar region, progress \nthat has resulted at the ground level where Sunni tribal leaders have \npartnered with the marines to rout whole groups of al-Qaida operatives.\n  Similar progress, though smaller, it appears, seems to be occurring \nin other areas at the local level. So the benchmarks do not consider \nthose events and whether progress is being made, but they are important \nas we evaluate what our situation truly is. We must remember that while \nsectarian violence continues, and it has occurred in large part as a \ndirect result of al-Qaida's strategy to foment it, safety and security \nin the capital city is important in furthering political \nreconciliation.\n  I wish I could agree with the idea of my able colleague Senator Levin \nwhen he declared that peace and security in Iraq can only come as a \nresult of a political settlement. Thus, he would suggest if a \nparliament cannot settle all of the difficult political issues on the \ntimetable we set, we must leave, because this is the only thing that \nwill make them agree on policy, our threatening to leave, and our \nactual leaving, it appears, because his amendment would require an \nactual departure from much of Iraq.\n  Well, I wish it were so easy. But, in truth, our commanders believe, \nour State Department believes, and I believe, it is far more \ncomplicated than that. Of course, a political settlement and \nreconciliations are critical to any long-term stability. But will not a \nreduction of violence and a more secure Baghdad be an event that will \nmake political progress more possible? That is what the generals are \ntelling us, that when the capital city is in a constant state of \nviolence and disorder, how can we expect the Parliament to be able to \nfunction and to provide a peaceful settlement of the disputes that need \nto be settled long term for a healthier Iraq?\n  I think we have a new strategy. We voted on it 53 days ago. We agreed \nto\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\nfund it. That is what the Congress does, we either put up the money or \nwe do not put up the money. By a vote of 80 to 14 we put up the money \nto fund this strategy. We asked for a report in September, and now we \nhave an amendment that has garnered quite a lot of political headlines \nand provided a lot of forums, a lot of ability to come forward on the \nfloor of the Senate to attack President Bush and Republicans, but it is \nnot a very responsible thing.\n  The responsible thing is for us to do what we said 53 days ago--to \ndemand a full, complete, and honest report by General Petraeus in \nSeptember, and at that point to evaluate the situation in Iraq and \nestablish a strategy and a policy going forward from there that serves \nour national interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment I can't \noffer right now because of the parliamentary situation, but I would \nlike to discuss the amendment with my colleagues so they know it is \ncoming and what it does.\n  My amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill is meant \nto strengthen our efforts to verify if people in the United States are \nhere legally to do their work. It deals with the Department of Defense \nbecause when it comes to the Department itself and to contractors who \ndo Defense Department work, we ought to make sure that everybody who is \nworking here has been here legally. That is for two reasons: One, \nbecause that is what the law says. You should not be in the country if \nyou don't have the permission of our Government legally to be here. No. \n2, one of the things we are concerned about in enforcing of the \nimmigration laws is to make sure that terrorists don't get into the \ncountry. We should be particularly concerned that we don't have people \nwith terrorist connections working for our contractors or working for \nthe Government itself.\n  Without a doubt, we have an illegal immigration problem. That was \nevident from the legitimate hoorah people raised against the bill and \nagainst the amnesty provisions of it and the 2 weeks of debate we had \nthis spring on the issue. People are crossing our borders each day to \nlive and work in the United States. Some of these individuals may have \ninnocent motives but some may not. There may be some illegal or \nundocumented individuals living in the shadows who aim to bypass law \nenforcement and do our country harm. We don't live in a pre-9/11 world \nanymore, so we must do all we can to protect our country and our \nassets.\n  My amendment would do two things. First, it would require all Federal \nGovernment agencies and departments to use what we call the basic pilot \nprogram, also known as the Electronic Employment Verification System. \nThis would be for all departments of Government. I will soon \ndemonstrate that a lot of departments are already doing it. But we \nought to, particularly in a bill such as this, make sure the Department \nof Defense is using it in every respect.\n  The second part of the amendment would require all Department of \nDefense contractors to use the basic pilot to check the eligibility of \ntheir workers. The reason this is needed and why it is appropriate in \nthe bill before us is, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 \nmakes it unlawful for employers to knowingly--and I emphasize \n``knowingly''--hire and employ aliens not eligible to work in this \ncountry. It required employers to check the identity and work \neligibility documents for all new employees.\n  Today, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on \ntheir face to be genuine, then the employer has met its document review \nobligation, and it has reason to believe it hired somebody who was \nlegally in the country. So they are off the hook. They can't be fined \nor any other action taken against the employer. But beyond those \ndocuments, the employer cannot solicit any additional documents from \nthe worker, or they would face allegations of employment \ndiscrimination. The easy availability, as we all know, of counterfeit \ndocuments has made a mockery of that law that we passed in 1986 which, \nquite frankly, I was here and I voted for. We thought it would solve \nall of our problems.\n  Well, we went from 1 million people being here illegally to 12 \nmillion people, so obviously it didn't solve anything. That is because \nfake documents are produced by the millions and can be obtained \ncheaply. Thus, our immigration policies benefit unscrupulous employers \nwho do not mind hiring illegal aliens but want to show that they have \nmet the legal requirements, and then the word ``knowingly'' being in \nthe law, if they have reason to believe legally, even if they are here \nillegally, unless the employer knows absolutely they are not here \nillegally, then they are off the hook. The problem is, you have a lot \nof these employers who know that even though the documents are \nfraudulent, that the person is here illegally, they hire them and never \nget caught. So we have tried to put this basic pilot program in place \nto be one step beyond where we were in 1986.\n  Now at the same time, our policies harm employers who don't want to \nhire illegal aliens but have no choice but to accept those fraudulent \ndocuments that they know have a good likelihood of being that way. In \nresponse to the illegal hiring of immigrants, Congress created this \nbasic pilot program in 1996. This program allows employers to check the \nstatus of their workers by checking one's Social Security number and \nalien identification number against the Social Security Administration \nand Homeland Security databases.\n  Since 1996, the system has been updated and improved. It is a Web-\nbased program. Employers can go online quickly and very easily when \nhiring an individual. It has been voluntary since its inception.\n  The basic pilot program was originally authorized in 1996, \nreauthorized in 2001, and expanded and extended again in 2003. \nOriginally, the authorization allowed six States to participate. In \n2003, the extension allowed employers in all 50 States to voluntarily \nuse the program. The immigration bill before the Senate I have already \nreferred to, last year and this year, would have required all employers \nto use the basic pilot program over a period of time, meaning phasing \nit in. Both the administration and Congress were poised to pass \nlegislation mandating participation and argued that this employment \nverification system using Social Security was crucial to enforcing the \nlaws on the books and getting around this problem of fraudulent \ndocuments. Moreover, during the debate on immigration this year, it was \nargued that the system was a needed tool for employers to check the \neligibility of their workers.\n\n  I had an opportunity to have a meeting way back in January of this \nyear with Secretary Chertoff about requiring all agencies to use the \nsystem and extending the requirement to contractors that do business \nwith the Federal Government. The Department of Homeland Security \nresponded by saying that 403 Federal agencies are participating in the \nbasic pilot program. Moreover, the Department claimed it was exploring \nways to verify all executive branch new hires, and its goal was to \nensure that all new hires in the executive branch are verified through \nthe basic pilot program by the end of fiscal year 2007; in other words, \n3 months from now.\n  Currently, all congressional offices are required to use the basic \npilot program. My office uses this process of checking everybody who \napplies to work for me, and if we are going to hire them, check with \nthe basic pilot program--in other words, Social Security--to make sure \nthat everything matches up. Since more than 400 agencies are already \nusing it, including congressional offices, requiring all agencies \nbeyond the 400 to participate would seem to me to not be overly \nburdensome and something we ought to do if we want to make sure we \ndon't hire people who are here illegally; and, No. 2, that the Federal \nGovernment would set an example for other employers; and, lastly, as \nthe effort to control the border has something to do with stopping \nterrorists from coming to this country, to make sure that we don't have \npeople like that working for the Federal Government.\n  With this goal in mind of Homeland Security to do this for all \nexecutive branch hires by the end of this fiscal year, it seems to me \nto be reasonable to make sure we move to make sure that it is done. My \namendment, then, clarifies, as I see it, what is existing\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\nlaw--that all agencies and all departments must use the basic pilot \nprogram and verify the status of their workers. My amendment is needed \nto push their participation in this program.\n  Congress and the administration would then set an example for the \nrest of the country. My amendment would also require those who do \nbusiness with the Department of Defense to use the basic pilot program.\n  This gets to the second part of the bill that deals with contractors \nworking for the Federal Government, working for the Defense Department. \nThere have been many examples of people here illegally working at \nmilitary bases and installations in the past few years. There have been \ninstances where Government contractors are employing people who are \nhere illegally and allowing them to work in sensitive areas. I will \nshare some examples.\n  In April 2005, 86 of 167 employees of a company called Naval Coating \nIncorporated were found to be hired illegally. This company was a \nmilitary contractor that painted ships at naval stations San Diego. \nMore than half of this company's workers were people here illegally. \nYet our Department of Defense was doing business with this company that \nhad more than half of its people illegally employed because they were \nhere illegally.\n  Last year, hundreds of illegal workers were found working for a Texas \ncompany which makes millions of ready-to-eat meals for our troops in \nIraq. Last July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more \nthan 60 illegal immigrants at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. In January \nof this year, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency arrested \nnearly 40 illegal immigrants hired by contractors working at three \nmilitary bases: Fort Benning, Creech Air Force Base, and Quantico \nMarine Base. One of the illegal workers was reportedly a member of the \ndangerous MS-13 gang.\n  While the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency has done its job \nto find unauthorized workers at secure sites, illegal aliens should not \nbe hired in the first place. One way to get at the problem is to \nrequire them to use this basic pilot program up front like every \ncongressional office does, or at least is supposed to do under the law. \nThat is why my amendment is needed, requiring that those who do \nbusiness with the Federal Government should be held to the same \nstandard as our executive department agencies, of which as I said, 400, \naccording to Secretary Chertoff, are already doing it. So you might say \nthat half of my amendment may not be needed because he wants them all \nto do it. But I think we are better off if the law says that they do \nit, and so I included that in the amendment.\n  So we need to do this like other people in Government are doing to \nmake sure it is done because we need to have the Federal Government \nsetting an example requiring those who do business with the Federal \nGovernment to be held, then, to the same standard as our executive \ndepartment agencies. This amendment will provide the tools to all \nemployers who work with the Department of Defense and require \nGovernment agencies to lead the Nation in verifying its workers.\n  I know now the parliamentary situation is such that I can't offer \nthis amendment at this point. I want to explain to everybody as I \nhave--and why I come to the floor now--so that before this bill is \nvoted on final passage, I think before the end of this week, we will \nhave a chance to deal with something that I see as very important from \nthe standpoint of making sure that laws are abided by, making sure the \nFederal Government as an employer is setting a good example, and making \nsure that we in this country use all the tools necessary to make sure \nthat people who work for anybody using the Social Security system as \nthat tool are here legally and can then be employed. It overcomes, \nthen, the problems we have with fraudulent documents and, lastly, \nsecuring our borders.\n\n  Who wants to work here should be a tool to make sure terrorists are \nnot working for anybody who works for the Government, meaning a \ngovernment contractor or for a government agency. Particularly, that \nought to be of most concern to us that we do not have that type of \nperson working for the Defense Department--because of national \nsecurity--or contractors who are doing work for the Defense Department, \nwhich is central to our national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \nreiterate my intention, along with the senior Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, and the senior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, to \noffer legislation to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba.\n  Now, again, we have decided not to offer the measure on the bill \nbefore us, the National Defense Authorization Act. But we certainly \nwill be offering it as an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill \nwhen that bill comes to the floor. One way or another, we intend to get \nthis legislation passed this year.\n  I think there is remarkable agreement on the need to find a way to \nclose this prison. All our closest allies have urged that Guantanamo be \nclosed, as have many leaders from across the political spectrum in the \nUnited States.\n  Last June, after three detainees committed suicide in a single day, \nPresident Bush acknowledged the prison has damaged America's reputation \nabroad. He said:\n\n       No question, Guantanamo sends a signal to some of our \n     friends--provides an excuse, for example, to say the United \n     States is not upholding the values that they are trying to \n     encourage other countries to adhere to.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       I'd like to close Guantanamo.\n\n  More recently, Secretary of Defense Bob Gates and Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice have urged the prison be shut down.\n  On March 23, the Washington Post, citing ``senior administration \nofficials,'' reported that Secretary Gates had ``repeatedly argued that \nthe detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had become so tainted \nabroad that legal proceedings at Guantanamo would be viewed as \nillegitimate.''\n  According to the Post, Secretary Gates ``told President Bush and \nothers that it should be shut down as quickly as possible.''\n  Let's make no mistake about it; the current detainees at Guantanamo \ndo include a number of extremely dangerous terrorists, with the \ndetermination and ability--if given the opportunity--to inflict harm \nupon the United States and its citizens. Among the detainees are 14 \nsenior leaders of al-Qaida, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who has \nconfessed to being a mastermind of the September 11 attacks, as well as \nothers. We must--and we can--hold these enemy combatants in maximum \nsecurity conditions elsewhere.\n  But the critics of Guantanamo are right. The 5-year-old prison at \nGuantanamo is a stain on the honor of our country. By holding people at \nGuantanamo without charge, without judicial review, without appropriate \nlegal counsel--and in the past subjecting many of them to what amounts \nto torture, regardless of how you want to dress it up--by doing all \nthose things, we have forfeited the moral high ground and stand as \nhypocrites in the eyes of the world.\n  As Secretary Gates has argued, any legal proceedings or convictions \nnow taking place on Guantanamo will be viewed as illegitimate in the \neyes of the world.\n  Perhaps most seriously, from a pragmatic standpoint, maintaining the \nprison at Guantanamo is simply counterproductive. It has become a \npropaganda bonanza and recruitment tool for Islamic fundamentalists. It \nalienates our friends and allies. It detracts from our ability to \nregain the moral high ground and rally the world against the terrorists \nwho threaten us.\n  The administration has repeatedly described detainees at Guantanamo \nas ``the worst of the worst,'' or, as former Secretary of Defense, \nDonald Rumsfeld, once described them, the ``most dangerous, best-\ntrained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.'' Unquestionably, \nsome of the detainees fit these descriptions. However, an exhaustive \nstudy of Guantanamo detainees conducted by the nonpartisan and highly \nregarded National Journal, last year, came to the following \nconclusions:\n  A large percentage--perhaps the majority--of the detainees were not \ncaptured on any battlefield, let alone on ``the battlefield in \nAfghanistan,'' as President Bush once asserted.\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\n  Secondly, fewer than--fewer than--20 percent of the detainees have \never been al-Qaida members.\n  Third, many scores--and perhaps hundreds--of the detainees were not \neven Taliban foot soldiers, let alone al-Qaida members.\n  Fourth, the majority of the people at Guantanamo were not captured by \nU.S. forces but, rather, handed over by reward-seeking Pakistanis and \nAfghan warlords and by villagers of highly dubious reliability.\n  For example, one of the detainees in Guantanamo is a man who was \nconscripted by the Taliban to work as an assistant cook. The U.S. \nGovernment's ``evidence'' against this detainee consists, in its \nentirety, of the following--keep in mind, the evidence against this \ndetainee consists, in its entirety, of the following--\n\n       a. Detainee is associated with the Taliban.\n       i. The detainee indicates that he was conscripted into the \n     Taliban.\n       b. Detainee engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or its \n     coalition partners.\n       i. The detainee admits he was a cook's assistant for \n     Taliban forces in Narim, Afghanistan under the command of \n     Haji Mullah Baki.\n       ii.\n\n  Get this--\n\n       ii. Detainee fled from Narim to Kabul during the Northern \n     Alliance attack and surrendered to the Northern Alliance.\n\n  That is it. That is the evidence they have against this detainee. He \nwas forced by the Taliban to be a cook. When he saw his opportunity to \nget out of there, he escaped and went to the northern forces and \nsurrendered to them. Now he sits in Guantanamo.\n  What kind of justice is this?\n  Well, the situation at Guantanamo is rather personal with me. Not \nonly was I stationed there for some time back when I was a Navy pilot--\nand I have since been back, of course, to visit--but more personal, in \nJuly of 1970, I was a rather young staff person for the Select \nCommittee on U.S. Involvement in Southeast Asia of the House of \nRepresentatives. I was working with a congressional delegation on a \nfactfinding mission to Vietnam in the summer of 1970, and through a \nseries of circumstances--and because of the bravery of a young \nVietnamese man who had been in the tiger cages on Con Son Island and \nwho was let out--now, why was he let out? Because usually when you got \nto the tiger cages, you were never seen again.\n  Well, the South Vietnamese had these prisons put up on Con Son \nIsland. Actually, they were built by the French when the French ruled \nIndo-China. So the French built these prisons on an island off the \ncoast. The Vietnamese took them over and then built these so-called \ntiger cages, which were hidden within the prison so no one could find \nthem.\n  Cao Nguyen Loi was sentenced to the tiger cages because he led a \nstudent protest at Saigon University. He was the student leader at \nSaigon University in 1969, early 1970. Because he led a protest against \nthe war, the police picked him up. The South Vietnamese Army picked him \nup and sent him out to Con Son Island.\n  No one knew who he was. But the students refused to go back to class \nuntil their student leader was released. It was time to take the exams, \nand this was a big deal for families. They were putting pressure on the \nuniversity, and finally the Government let Cao Nguyen Loi go. They told \nhim at the time, though, that if he ever said anything, they would kill \nhis brother because his brother was also in the tiger cages.\n  Well, this young man, very bravely, sought me out, along with Don \nLuce. Don Luce was a young man who I think at that time had been \nworking for the World Council of Churches in Vietnam. If I am not \nmistaken, I think he was a native of Vermont. Yes, Don Luce was a \nnative of the State of Vermont. He had been over there teaching the \nVietnamese how to grow sweet potatoes, agricultural things.\n  Well, Don Luce had known this young man. I had sought out Don Luce \nbecause Luce had written a book about Vietnam called ``Vietnam--The \nUnheard Voices.'' So in preparation for this trip to Vietnam, I read \nthe book because I felt that Congressmen should hear both sides. So I \nread this book. I never met Don Luce before, but I was intrigued by \nthis book, that there was a large sector--I questioned at the time--of \nSouth Vietnamese who were opposed to the war. We were led to believe \nquite differently, of course.\n  So Don Luce brought this young man to see me to tell me about the \nexistence of the tiger cages. These tiger cages had been rumored for a \nlong time. In fact, the year before, in 1969, a young Congressman by \nthe name of John Conyers went over with a Congressman, I believe it was \nFather Drinan, Bob Drinan, and they had inquired about the existence of \nthe tiger cages. They were told this was Communist propaganda, no such \nthing existed. Our military denied it. The Nixon administration denied \nit. The South Vietnamese Government denied it: There was no such thing. \nThis was Communist propaganda.\n  Well, this young man, who came to see me, said: They are out there \nbecause I was in them. But they told me if I talked, they would kill my \nbrother, so I have to place my trust in you because someone has to \nexpose them. I said: Well, I don't know if I could or not because I \nwould have to get a couple of Congressmen to go out there. It was on an \nisland. We had to get a plane, fly out to this remote island. It would \ntake a whole day. Then he told me: You would not find them unless you \nhave a map. I will draw you a map. So he sat down and he drew me a map \nof how to find the tiger cages. He said: Because, you see, there are a \nlot of prison camps on Con Son Island. There are about five different \nprison camps and they all look the same. Unless you know what you are \nlooking for, you will never find the tiger cages, because they are in \none prison camp and you have to know how to find them. He drew me a \nmap. He couldn't quite remember exactly, but he knew to look for these \ncertain symbols, these certain signs, these certain things he \nremembered. So I took the map.\n\n  I then went to see Congressman Gus Hawkins of California and laid \nthis out for him and said there might be a possibility that we could \nfind out once and for all whether these tiger cages existed. He said he \nwould go. We needed another Congressman. William Anderson, Congressman \nWilliam R. Anderson from Tennessee, when he heard the story, said: I \nwill go.\n  Keep in mind, Congressman William R. Anderson had until that time \nbeen a supporter of the Vietnam war. He wrote a book once, which is one \nof my favorite books. It was called ``Nautilus 90 North.'' This same \nCongressman Anderson was the first skipper of the first nuclear \nsubmarine called the Nautilus. He was a very famous guy at the time \nbecause he was the first one who took a nuclear sub underneath the \nNorth Pole and he wrote a book about the Nautilus submarine called \n``Nautilus 90 North.'' He retired from the Navy and was elected to the \nHouse from Tennessee.\n  Congressman Anderson, Congressman Hawkins, and I took off with Don \nLuce. We went out to the islands. I am not going to give you the whole \nstory, but armed with the map, we were able to find the tiger camps. \nWhen we found them, we were told by one Red Walton, who was the USAID \ndirector--public safety director--that we had no business being there. \nOh, I might say, before we got out there, this same Red Walton had told \nus these prison camps were more like a Boy Scout camp. They took us to \nsome of the prison camps and they weren't all that bad for prisons, I \nguess. But again, armed with a map, we found the tiger cages and the \nsuffering that we saw there, the inhumanity we saw there, was something \nyou never shake. I was armed with a camera. I had my camera, so I took \npictures. Of course, we had two Congressmen, William Anderson and Gus \nHawkins, there.\n  Armed with that information and coming back to the States, we \npublished the pictures and got the story out. It became a worldwide \nstory. The prisoners were released because of the pressure that was put \nupon the South Vietnamese government. They then began to tell their \nstories. But there was one picture I took that was in Life Magazine. It \nwas of a young Buddhist monk who looked up through the bars of these \ntiger cages as we looked down on him, and he said in Vietnamese--we had \nDon Luce as an interpreter--he said: I am here for only one reason: \nBecause I speak out for peace, and no matter how long I stay here, I \nwill continue to speak out for peace.\n  I took a picture of that young Buddhist monk. Yet before the \nprisoners\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\nwere all released, he was beaten to death.\n  While I have since gone back to Con Son Island and visited his grave, \nthe tiger cages are now a memorial, like a museum for people to see, of \nall the horrors they inflicted on so many hundreds of people. People \nwere shackled together in awful conditions--awful conditions.\n  This weekend I was handed a paper done by Vaughan Bagley. I visited \nwith her. She was doing a paper on the tiger cages of Con Son. She \nwrote a paper about it. She did some very good research. Vaughan is a \nhigh school student, but she did a lot of great research. She went back \nand looked at all of the congressional hearings that were held on this, \nand she quoted Representative Hawkins. Representative Hawkins stated at \nthe congressional hearings in 1970:\n\n       Con Son is a symbol of how some American officials will \n     cooperate in corruption and torture because they too want to \n     see the war continued and the government they put in power \n     protected.\n\n  Well, as she went on to point out, she said:\n\n       Unfortunately, however, in their democratic crusade, \n     America lost the very principles of freedom and equality that \n     they purported to defend, and ultimately violated Article 13 \n     of the Geneva Accords of 1949.\n\n  A former prisoner testified that the clear violation of these \nprinciples:\n\n       No matter what medical problem the prisoner has: TB, \n     Diphtheria, he is still thrown in with all the others who are \n     not sick, all eat out of the same bowl, sleep together, \n     shackled to the same rope. I know of no other place on Earth \n     where human lives are so cheap as in Con Son.\n\n  Congressman Hawkins argued: Con Son is the type of not looking at our \nown faults and atrocities that endangers our American prisoners of war \nheld by the Communists.\n  Vaughan Bagley did a great job on her research. What she pointed out \nin her paper was that in our pursuit of democratic ideals and democracy \naround the world, we can't condone, harbor, or support places like the \ntiger cages of Con Son Island, Abu Ghraib, or Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  I tell this story because now I think my colleagues get some idea of \nwhy I feel so strongly about Guantanamo. It has for me the same smell, \nthe same awful vision of Con Son Island. You see, in both cases these \nprisons were off on remote islands. Why? Well, to keep away the press, \nto keep people from asking questions about what was going on. Once you \nwere taken off the island, chances are you were never seen again.\n  That is what has happened at Guantanamo. Guantanamo has become the \nUnited States Con Son Island. It has become like the tiger cages on Con \nSon Island. The more the world knows about it, the harder it is for us \nto argue from kind of a morally high standpoint of supporting the \nGeneva Conventions or the rule of law.\n  Well, at the time of the discovery of the tiger cages, the United \nStates Government had been insisting that the North Vietnamese abide by \nthe Geneva Conventions. Yet here we were condoning, funding, and \nsupervising the torture not only of Vietnamese prisoners of war but of \ncivilians. People such as this young guide who was caught up and held \nby the Taliban as a cook, who escaped, who probably didn't want to \nfight for anybody--a clear violation of the Geneva Conventions.\n  There are disturbing parallels between what transpired on Con Son \nIsland nearly four decades ago and what has happened at Guantanamo in \nrecent years. As I said in both cases, prisons were deliberately set up \non remote islands, clearly with the intention of limiting scrutiny and \nrestricting access. In both cases, detainees were not classified as \nprisoners of war, expressly to deny them the protection of the Geneva \nConventions. In both cases, detainees were deprived of any right to due \nprocess, judicial review, or a fair trial. They were simply held \nindefinitely in isolation in legal limbo. In both cases, when the \nmistreatment of detainees was exposed, the United States stood accused \nof hypocrisy and of betraying its most sacred values and violating \ninternational law.\n\n  We need to reverse the damage Guantanamo has done to our reputation \nand to our ability to wage an effective fight against the terrorists \nwho attacked us on September 11 of 2001. The essential first step must \nbe to close the prison at Guantanamo as expeditiously as possible. The \nlegislation that Senator Feinstein, Senator Hagel, and I have would \naccomplish this within 1 year of the date of enactment.\n  Under the provisions of our legislation, one, the President shall \nclose the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. All detainees shall be \nremoved from the facility. No detainee shall be transferred to a \ndetention facility under U.S. custody located outside the United \nStates.\n  We heard all about these other little prisons around the world that, \nwell, maybe they are held by other countries, but they are supervised \nby us. Our legislation says it can't be transferred there either. No \nlater than 3 months after enactment, the President shall submit a \nreport to Congress describing plans for closing Guantanamo and removing \nthe detainees, and the President shall keep Congress currently informed \nof steps taken to implement the legislation.\n  That is basically our legislation. It is very clear, very \nstraightforward. As I said, we were going to offer it on the Defense \nauthorization bill. We have all agreed not to do so, but that we \ndefinitely will be seeing this coming up on the Defense appropriations.\n  In closing, on this issue, the United States has lost its way both in \nIraq and at Guantanamo. We need to wage a smarter, more focused, and \nmore effective fight against the Islamic terrorists who threaten us, \nand we must do so in ways that do not give credence to the American \nantipropaganda and do not rally more recruits to their cause. To that \nend, we must close the prison at Guantanamo as soon as possible. Our \namendment has won the enthusiastic endorsement of Human Rights Watch, \nHuman Rights First, Amnesty International, and the American Civil \nLiberties Union. We currently have 14 bipartisan cosponsors here in the \nSenate. I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          Levin-Reed Amendment\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I also want to talk for a minute on the \nbill--the Levin-Reed amendment--because I think it offers the best \nprospect for accomplishing the goals of a more focused and effective \ncampaign against the terrorists.\n  For 4 long years, President Bush has said that as the Iraqis step up \nto their responsibilities, the United States will be able to step down. \nToday it is painfully clear that the opposite is the case. The Iraqi \nmilitary and Government will only step up to their responsibilities \nonce it is clear that the United States is stepping down. The Levin-\nReed amendment says the United States will begin troop redeployment \nwithin 120 days and remove most American combat forces from Iraq by \nApril of next year. This acknowledges what has long been obvious to our \ncommanders: There can be no military solution to the mess in Iraq. At \nthe same time, by signaling our intention to redeploy by next spring, \nwe will create powerful incentives to force compromise within the \ndeadlocked Iraqi Government and to compel Iraq's neighbors to play a \nmore active and constructive role in pacifying that country.\n  Again, I say this only of myself, but there is no guarantee this \napproach will work--will succeed. There is no guarantee the Iraqis will \nbe willing or able to compromise and come together in a genuine \ngovernment of national reconciliation. However, the only certainty is \nthat our current force is a formula for more failure, more deadlock \nwithin the Iraqi Government, more death and destruction for both Iraq \nand America.\n  New developments this past week have driven home the urgency of the \nchange of course proposed by the Levin-Reed amendment. Last week, we \nlearned we are now spending an astronomical $10 billion a month in \nIraq. Last week, the administration issued the required progress report \non the benchmarks for Iraq. What did it show? It showed the Government \nin Baghdad has failed to meet any of the benchmarks for political and \neconomic reform. The Iraqis have failed to make progress in passing a \nlaw governing the sharing of oil revenues.\n  They have failed to make progress in allowing former Baath Party \nmembers to return to their jobs. They have failed to make progress in \ndisarming the militias. They have failed to make progress in organizing \nnew provincial\n\n[[Page S9251]]\n\nelections. Indeed, the only thing the Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds have \nagreed upon in Parliament is that they will go on vacation during the \nmonth of August.\n  Now, there was one glimmer of good news in the report, and that was, \nthe U.S. military has had some success since January in improving the \nsecurity situation, although the overall levels of violence and mayhem \nare unchanged. Well, limited success should come as no surprise to \nanybody. We all appreciate the professionalism, courage, and capability \nof our Armed Forces. It would be astonishing if an additional 30,000 \ntroops didn't see at least some small improvement in security.\n  There is one unfortunate thing about this. These modest gains are all \nbeing accomplished by U.S. troops, not Iraqis. Because the surge is not \nsustainable, even these modest gains are ephemeral.\n  Meanwhile, a new report by the National Counterterrorism Center \nconcludes that al-Qaida has grown stronger than at any time since 9/11. \nIn other words, while the U.S. military and intelligence assets have \nbeen massively sidetracked in Iraq over the last 4 years, al-Qaida has \nbeen able to regroup elsewhere, with most in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \nAs a CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence told a House committee:\n\n       We see more al-Qaida training, more al-Qaida money, and \n     more al-Qaida communication.\n\n  Indeed, the U.S. invasion of Iraq has been the gift that keeps on \ngiving to al-Qaida. There was no al-Qaida presence in Iraq before the \ninvasion. Now a home-grown organization, loosely affiliated with al-\nQaida, calling themselves ``al-Qaida in Mesopotamia,'' has emerged. \nWhat's more, as previous intelligence reports have concluded, America's \nongoing occupation of Iraq has been a powerful recruitment tool not \nonly for al-Qaida, but for many new extremist organizations, some of \nthem sprouting up spontaneously in western countries, including Britain \nand Spain.\n  So, Mr. President, we have reached an extraordinary juncture \nregarding the current failed policy in Iraq. We have reached the point, \nfrankly, where either you side with the President and his demand that \nwe stay the course in pursuit of what he calls victory--although the \nPresident has never really defined what that victory is--or you side \nwith the American people and our military commanders who have concluded \nthat there is no military solution in Iraq. You either support this \nendless, pointless war or you support a smaller, more focused campaign \nagainst the terrorists who truly threaten us. Those are the choices in \nthe current Senate debate.\n  On our side of the aisle, we Democrats and the American people have \nmade our choice to chart a new direction. I am confident that as more \nand more of our friends on the other side of the aisle make that choice \nin the days and weeks ahead, we will ultimately prevail.\n  The conflict in Iraq can only be solved through political compromise \nand reconciliation in Baghdad and through aggressive diplomatic \nengagement with Iraq's neighbors and across the Middle East. So it is \ntime to chart a new course. The approach embodied in the Levin-Reed \namendment offers us our best hope for extricating ourselves from this \nquagmire in Iraq and retaking the offensive against al-Qaida and other \nterrorist groups.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I urge all my colleagues to support \nthe Levin-Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to my good friend \nfrom Iowa that while there are so many things in which we find \nourselves in agreement as the months and years go by, in this area we \nfind disagreement. I have to say this. I wasn't going to mention \nGuantanamo, but since that is a subject of interest to everybody--and \nit certainly has the interest of the Senator from Iowa--I only mention \nthis. I have done this before on the Senate floor. I am very much \nconcerned about this obsession we seem to have in this country \npolitically to take care of these terrorists who are responsible for \ncommitting acts and killing Americans.\n  I was down at Guantanamo several times. One time was right after \neverything started escalating and they started arriving there. \nEverybody was concerned about the methods of questioning these \nindividuals, interrogating the prisoners. I remember going down and \nseeing a lot of them doing everything they could to antagonize the \ntroops that we had down there to police that situation. It was really \nkind of pitiful. You sit there and look at these people, and these are \nprisoners who probably have never eaten better in their lives, have \nnever had better medical attention in their lives, have never really \nlived better than they are living in Guantanamo. Yet these are \nindividuals who are terrorists. These are the worst, and some have \nkilled Americans. We all seem to have this propensity to be more \nconcerned about them than we are for the lives of Americans.\n  I want to give a different perspective. I have had the honor, I \nbelieve, of being in the Iraqi AOR--not always in Iraq, but the area of \nresponsibility--more than any other Member. I have watched this on a \nmonthly basis since we have gotten into this thing. As I look at it, I \nvery carefully chose the word of ``invasion'' on Iraq as opposed to a \n``liberation'' of Iraq.\n\n  I remember so well right after the first Iraqi war, I was honored to \ngo over to Iraq the day that it was actually declared to be over. This \nwas in Kuwait City. We had a thing called the ``first freedom flight.'' \nTony Cohelo was on that flight with me. Certainly, the Chair remembers \nhim well.\n  We also had one of the Kuwaiti nobility and his young daughter with \nus at the time. We got there, and they were burning the oil fields. It \nwas obscure. Even during the daylight hours you could not see anything. \nThe Iraqis didn't know that the war was over--those who were down there \nat that time. I remember so well seeing the devastation.\n  This little girl, I think, was 7 years old at the time. They wanted \nto go back to Kuwait to go to their mansion on the Persian Gulf, a \nbeautiful place, so she could go up in her bedroom and see her little \ndolls and animals. I remember going up there with her, and we found out \nthat their residence had been used as one of Saddam Hussein's torture \nchambers. I remember going up to her bedroom with her and, in fact, \nthat bedroom had been used as a torture chamber, one of Saddam \nHussein's headquarters. There were body parts--ears, hands, just strewn \nall around the room. You thought: What kind of a monster could this \nSaddam Hussein be? This guy had spent 30 years of his life terrorizing \nhis fellow citizens. We saw things like a little boy with his ear cut \noff. He was 9. The reason it was done was he had a little American flag \nin his pocket, and I guess they found that on him, and they considered \nthat to be inappropriate.\n  Looking into mass graves and hearing the stories of individuals going \nthrough grinders and begging to go head first so they would not torture \nthem quite as long, being dropped into vats of acid, begging to be \ndropped in feet first. These are the kinds of terrorists that we are \ntalking about over there. This is what Iraq was like. This is what \nSaddam Hussein was like.\n  While I don't want to get into the debate about weapons of mass \ndestruction, I never had that as the argument. It is a fact that \ntraining was taking place there; whether it was al-Qaida or not we \ndon't know. In Salman Pak in Iraq, they were training terrorists to \nhijack airplanes. Whether they trained in that area the particular 9/11 \nperpetrators, I have no way of knowing. Nonetheless, this is something \nthat had to be--all you had to do was look into the mass graves and \nhear the stories about weddings taking place and how they would raid \nthem and rape the women and bury them alive. That was the scene, and \nthat is what we were doing over there.\n  I really came to the floor to voice my objection to the Levin-Reed \namendment, No. 2087. Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and \n     easy. . . . Always remember, however sure you are that you \n     could easily win, that there would not be a war if the other \n     man did not think he also had a chance.\n\n  That was just as true in World War II when Churchill made the \nstatement as\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\nit is today. Today, we face an enemy that is determined and willing to \ngo to any means of terror and violence to win. He cannot be negotiated \nwith. You cannot negotiate with a terrorist. We keep hearing that we \nneed to negotiate with them, but we cannot do that. They will not be \nsatisfied until the whole world is brought under their dreadful \nideology. We have seen this kind before in Stalin and Hitler, but never \nbefore has our enemy metastasized this way.\n  In a way, you could say it is more dangerous now than it was back \nthen during Hitler and Stalin because the mentality is different. These \nare people who want to die and who are willing to die. This is their \nway of going to heaven. It is a totally different environment than \nunder the other cultures in the different wars. There is no centralized \nheadquarters or one leader that we can eliminate. There is no country \ninvolved. I don't think we have ever been involved in a war against an \nenemy who didn't have a country. When you defeat a country, you win the \nwar. Well, there is nothing centralized that we can point to. Victory \nwould come the way it always has: Destroy the enemy, undermine the \nsupport network, and expose the fact that they cannot win.\n  Any plan to leave Iraq before we have had a chance to understand the \noutcome of the troop surge tells the enemy, first of all, they have \nbeen successful and that their methods worked. Those individuals who \nwere perpetrating the crimes of terrorism will come back and do them \nagain. It gives them patience to wait us out.\n  Do you believe they do not watch our news or that they are not \nwatching us right now, scouring our media for any chink in our resolve? \nTheir survival depends on it, and they cannot win by force of arms. \nThey can only win by attacking our resolve.\n  Our country represents the light of freedom and democracy. Yet I fear \nthat we have begun a terrible introspective and downward cycle. Our \nresolve lasts for a few months, or maybe a year, but all it takes is \nenough time and then we break. Our enemy knows this. Look at our \nmission in Somalia. I remember it so well. So does the Presiding \nOfficer. They were dragging the naked bodies through the streets of \nMogadishu and our resolve was broken. Look at our reaction to the \nbombings in Lebanon at Khobar Towers. Look at Vietnam.\n  I am saying that we have to realize that while this introspection \nguarantees our freedom, it is also our greatest weakness. I recognize \nthere have been mistakes made in Iraq. In his January 10 speech, the \nPresident also recognized this and has taken full responsibility for \nmistakes, which are made in every war. Yet we still find ourselves in \ndifficult situations about the best way ahead.\n  These decisions affect many lives, both of our soldiers and the \nAmerican people they pledged to protect.\n  We should debate. That is what the Senate body intends to do. It is \nwhat we have been doing. But how we fight and when we leave will \ndetermine the fight our grandchildren face. I think we all agree that \nit would be disastrous to leave Iraq precipitously. If we do, we know \nwhat we can expect: increased levels of violence and the spread of \nextremist ideology. Iraq itself would collapse into anarchy. We know \nthis.\n  A personal friend of mine, DIA Director General Maples, said this:\n\n       Continued coalition presence is the primary counter to a \n     breakdown in central authority. Such a breakdown would have \n     grave consequences for the people of Iraq, stability in the \n     region, and U.S. strategic interests.\n\n  DNI John Negroponte and CIA Director General Hayden have also agreed \nwith that statement and analysis. It is not too late to avoid this \nbreakdown. I don't think it is time to start cutting our losses and \nhope all of this will somehow disappear, somehow it will go away. If we \ncan assist Iraq to reach the point of sustainable self-governance, then \nwe can bring defeat to our enemies and bring stability to the region. \nWe all want this to happen.\n\n  To those who say we cannot win, I look to Bosnia. I have to say, Mr. \nPresident, I was wrong in this case. That was a situation that many \nsaid and I said was intractable, that we would be bogged down for years \nand suffer thousands of casualties. I really believed this situation. I \nwent back to Bosnia. It is peaceful. This is directly because of our \nmilitary involvement. So I learned a lesson in Bosnia.\n  When I heard President Bush ask for our support for a troop surge, I \nheard the same message from many soldiers whom I have talked to in \nBaghdad, Fallujah, Tikrit, Balad, Mosul, and other areas. They said \nthey want to fight the enemy there and not at home. This is what the \ntroops have told me on these 14 trips I have made over there. They said \nthey are in a fight to win and that they will accomplish the mission. \nTheir morale is very high, and they back this up by reenlisting in \nrecord numbers.\n  I watched one of the Sunday shows, and they are trying to say: Look \nat the dissatisfying level. You can ask a question of all the troops \nover there and pull out some kind of answer that can be misinterpreted. \nThe true test is those individuals who are fighting the hardest and \nfacing the most risk are the very ones who have the highest \nreenlistment rate we have seen in modern history. We are seeing \nreenlistments in record numbers right now, and the sacrifice our \nservice men and women pay demand we pursue every possibility to leave \nstability in our wake.\n  The permanent Iraqi Government has only been in power since May. Many \nof the leaders have never had any kind of opportunity to run any kind \nof government before, let alone under the terrible circumstances they \nface. While Saddam was in power, they were in jail or were in exile. \nThey were on the outside. Now they have to build coalitions and a \ndemocracy that took us many years to achieve in this country. I think \nsometimes we forget that fact.\n  Last week, Hassan al-Suneid, a Shiite legislator and adviser to Prime \nMinister al-Maliki, was quoted in the Washington Post. This is what he \nsaid, an adviser to al-Maliki:\n\n       If the Americans withdraw, the militias and the armed \n     groups will attack each other, and that means a sure civil \n     war. What concerns me really is that U.S. troops might submit \n     to the Democrats' decision and withdraw without thinking \n     about Iraq's situation and what will happen to the Iraqi \n     people.\n\n  We owe it to the sacrifice of the brave servicemember, we owe it to \nthe Iraqi people, and we owe it to our children and grandchildren. Give \nour soldiers everything they need to win, and if Iraq doesn't step up, \nthen it will be time to go but not until then.\n  We haven't given enough time to see if the surge is working. July 15 \nwas supposed to be an interim White House update. We know the 16 \nbenchmarks. It is my understanding eight are proceeding as planned, \neight are not, and two are mixed signals. We know the surge has enabled \na number of things to happen, such as a new engagement strategy, which \nI will talk about in a minute. It is called the joint security \nstations. We have gotten a huge increase in tips. Tips are pieces of \ninformation that come from the Iraqi people that tell us where IEDs \nare, that tell us where individuals are, where terrorists are. These \nare the qualified tips. They are accelerating on a daily basis. It has \nenabled us to stage offensives throughout Iraq without significantly \ndiluting our troops in Baghdad. It has enabled the commanders to chase \ndown al-Qaida and keep them from regrouping and attacking areas that \nhave been historical sanctuaries of al-Qaida.\n  September 15 is when General Petraeus will give us a report. Let's \nnot forget, that is what the law says. We passed a law. We passed a law \neither in March or May. The law says September 15 is the date he will \ncome forth, this great general, General Petraeus, who is over there \nright now. It will give him time to say what our situation is and what \nwe should do if a change is necessary. We owe it to him at this time.\n  A total surge, of course, has just been in place for 2 weeks. We have \nsome good indicators that the time to make that kind of change is \nSeptember. We cannot change the terms of the deal now. That was the \ndeal, and that is written into law.\n  My colleague Senator DeMint stated it well:\n\n       If we're going to govern effectively, we can't change our \n     minds every week.\n\n  Let's not give a knee-jerk reaction to the headlines of IEDs and \nsectarian killings. This is exactly what the enemy is aiming its \npropaganda toward. I recognize this is not the fight we thought we were \ngoing to be getting\n\n[[Page S9253]]\n\ninto, but it is the fight that is before us now.\n  I admire Prime Minister Maliki's assessment. I quote him again:\n\n       A fundamental struggle is being fought on Iraqi soil \n     between those who believe that Iraqis, after a long \n     nightmare, can retrieve their dignity and freedom, and others \n     who think that oppression is the order of things and that \n     Iraqis are doomed to a political culture of terror, prisons \n     and mass graves.\n\n  I want to share one last point. Before I do, I want to put up a \nchart. If my colleagues will remember, we had the Webb amendment which \nwould have dictated terms of how we do our troops deployments. At that \ntime, I used this chart. We have to keep in mind that one of the \nproblems we had in orchestrating a surge and trying to address this now \nis that we went through a pretty tough climb back in the 1990s.\n  As this chart shows, if we look at the black line, this is the 1993 \nbaseline increase by inflation. In other words, if we did just what we \ntook in 1993 and only increased it by inflation, this is where we would \nbe in the year 2000. The Clinton administration is represented by this \nred line. If we take the difference between the status quo and what his \nrecommendation was in his budget, it is $412 billion total. We, in our \nwisdom, saw we were able to raise it to this green line in the middle. \nBut it still is $313 billion less.\n  I suggest that a lot of that represents our troop levels because the \nmost expensive thing we have in defense is the troop levels. We are in \nthe situation now where we have to see if this is going to work, if it \nchanges, the surge, General Petraeus and all his efforts are taking \nplace.\n  I mentioned the President's speech of January 10. I did it for a \nreason because I went back and reread that speech. If you read it, it \ntalks about the victory being in a bottoms-up situation. In other \nwords, instead of the top down, from the top political leaders down, it \nis going to be from the roots, from the people in these various \ncommunities. That is exactly what I witnessed.\n  Mr. President, I will share with you what I witnessed the last time I \nwas there. Keep in mind that just a few weeks ago, long before the full \nsurge effect was taking place, I spent a lot of time in Anbar Province \nin Ramadi, Fallujah, as well as in Baghdad. I saw some changes. I think \na lot of it was due to the fact that we have had a lot of the cut-and-\nrun or surrender resolutions and the Iraqi people are very much \nconcerned that is what we are going to do, and that all of a sudden got \ntheir attention.\n  What I will share with you, Mr. President, I know we spend a lot of \ntime and it is important we talk about the political leaders. Al-\nMaliki, we do talk about him. He is the Prime Minister. We talk about \nPrime Minister Jasim and Dr. Rubaie. What I noticed last time is a \nbottoms-up dramatic improvement, not coming from the political leaders \nbut the religious leaders. This is what I witnessed.\n  My colleagues might remember, we stood on the Senate floor a year ago \nand said the terrorists are saying Ramadi will become the terrorist \ncapital of the world. Now Ramadi is secure. If you go next door to \nFallujah--and we remember the World War II type of door-to-door \nactivities that were taking place there. The marines did a miraculous \njob, but Fallujah at the time I got over there on this last trip was \nsecure. The important thing is it was secured by the Iraqi security \nforces. They were the ones providing security at that time.\n  I mentioned a minute ago the joint security stations. This is a \nbottoms-up type of thing. I noticed in Baghdad, where, instead of our \ntroops going out into the field and coming back to the Green Zone at \nnight, they stayed out there. They bed down in the homes with the Iraqi \nforces. I talked with people who experienced this, theirs and ours. I \ndidn't see that in any of the previous trips over there.\n  If I can single out one thing that is causing the bottoms-up \nimprovement we have seen so far as a result of this surge announcement \nthat was made just a few months ago, it would be the attitude of the \nclerics and the imams in the mosques. We monitor these, by the way. Our \nintelligence is at all these mosque meetings where they meet once a \nweek. As most of us do on Sunday in our churches, mosques meet at \ndifferent times. Nonetheless, they have weekly services. In weekly \nservices prior to January of this year, 85 percent of the messages that \nwere given in the mosques by the clerics were anti-American messages. \nThey started reducing, and by April we went through the entire month \nwithout one mosque giving an anti-American message. That is why we are \ngetting the support of the people, the bottoms-up we are talking about \nand the President was talking about back on January 10. We are seeing \nthese individuals doing the same thing.\n  I don't think there is a person watching us or present in this \nChamber today who isn't from a State that has such programs as the \nNeighborhood Watch Programs. That is what they have over there right \nnow, and they are watching and they are going around with spray cans \nand spraying circles around undetonated IEDs so that our troops don't \nget into them. This is the type of cooperation we have not seen before.\n  This is what the President asked for on January 10. I think anything \nprior to our legal timeline of September 15 and getting an ultimate \nreport from General Petraeus would be a great disservice to our \nfighters over there as well as to Iraqis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland for allowing me to go ahead of him to deliver some remarks on \nthe general Department of Defense authorization bill. Senator Reed has \nnot only been a strong supporter of our military, but he has an \nunderstanding that is unique for somebody who is a West Point graduate. \nAs we move forward with this debate on Iraq, his understanding of Iraq \nis second to none, given the fact that he has been with this issue from \nthe beginning. He has made 10 trips into Iraq to understand the \nsituation on the ground. We very much look forward to his continuing \nleadership and contribution to the debate.\n  Today, I rise because I want to praise the work of Chairman Levin, \nSenator Warner, Senator McCain, Senator Reed, Senator Nelson, and the \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee for developing a very good, \nexcellent product for us to consider in the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  As the Senate debates this week on the keystone issue of our time \nwith respect to U.S. involvement in Iraq, we must not lose sight of the \nimportance of maintaining a strong national defense. That strong \nnational defense is what is at the heart of the 2008 Department of \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  The bill is a strong statement of support for our men and women in \nuniform. It gives our military the tools it needs to confront an \nincreasingly complex and dynamic set of threats that we face around the \nworld. It is a bill that will help assure our military remains the best \nequipped, the best trained, and the best led fighting force in the \nworld. Today, our men and women in uniform are serving honorably around \nthe world. In the mountains of Afghanistan, they are tracking and \nkilling al-Qaida and resurgent Taliban operatives who are resisting the \nmove toward democracy. In Iraq, they are confronting the monumental \ntask of stabilizing and rebuilding a country that is caught in the \nmiddle of sectarian violence and a spiraling, what many of us have \nconcluded is an intractable civil war. In the horn of Africa, in the \nBalkans, and elsewhere, they are looking to bring peace, hope, and \nsecurity to those war-torn areas of the world.\n  I am immensely proud of the work of our troops both abroad and at \nhome, for our National Guard, Reserve, and Active-Duty troops protect \nour homeland and help us respond to the threats of hurricanes, fires, \nand floods. I know all my colleagues share the appreciation I have for \nthe work of our military, and I know this shared appreciation gives us \nmuch common ground from which to work. We all agree that our military \nmust remain the strongest and best equipped in the world, that our \nNation's defense is the Federal Government's top priority, and that our \nmilitary families and our veterans deserve the best our Nation can \nprovide. Because we agree on these principles, this bill rests on a \nsolid, bipartisan foundation, and it is a bill we\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\nmust pass in Congress and let it be signed by the President. \nUnfortunately, in the press you won't hear much about many of the \nprovisions that are in this bill, and we won't hear much about where we \ndo see eye to eye and what we have a consensus on with respect to the \nDOD bill. You probably won't hear much about how we agree we need to \nexpand our military, that our troops need to have more MRAPs, Strykers, \nand other equipment in the field immediately; that more resources are \nneeded to protect our troops from IEDs; that our assets in space are \ntoo vulnerable to disruption or attack; that we need to continue to \nbolster our military warning and defense system, and so on. We won't \nhear much of that in the debate here in the week ahead.\n\n  But the fact is this bill comes to us at a critical time in our \nNation and it is one of the largest steps this body has ever taken \ntoward strengthening our defense, refurbishing our military--which is \nunder so much strain in these times--and making good on our promises to \ncare for our military families and our veterans.\n  I want to briefly illustrate the impact this bill will have by \nbriefly describing how it will help our troops and their families in my \nState of Colorado. We in Colorado are proud to be the home of some of \nthe crown jewels of our Nation's defense and homeland security. Fort \nCarson, Peterson Air Force Base, Buckley Air Force Base, Schriever Air \nForce Base, Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, and the Air Force Academy \nare all in my home State of Colorado, as are the headquarters for Air \nForce Space Command and Northern Command.\n  I have spent a lot of time at those bases meeting with our military \nleaders, and the commanders there are clear about their needs and their \npriorities. I am pleased to report to them that the Armed Services \nCommittee, in the bill now being considered by this Chamber, has \ntransferred many of their priorities into the bill and will make them a \nreality if we can get this bill signed by the President of the United \nStates. Those priorities include: military construction, equipment, \nweapon systems, and health care--those things that are important to \nmake our military strong.\n  The military construction authorization in this bill will help us \nkeep on track with BRAC realignments and needed infrastructure \nimprovements. At Fort Carson in Colorado we are in the midst of a very \nsignificant BRAC-directed expansion that will almost double the size of \nthe Mountain Post. Two additional brigades are coming to Colorado \nSprings, and we are doing all we can as a community to welcome these \nsoldiers and their families to Colorado.\n  The bill includes $470 million in authorization for military \nconstruction at Fort Carson, some of which will go to the construction \nof a new headquarters for the 4th Infantry Division and a new brigade \ncomplex for the 1st Brigade, and new barracks for our soldiers.\n  For the Colorado National Guard at Buckley Air Force Base in Denver, \nCO, we have added an authorization for $7.3 million for a squadron \noperations facility to replace an outdated structure that houses the F-\n16s of the 140th Air Wing of the Colorado National Guard.\n  On the equipment side, this bill responds to the rapidly growing \nneeds of the services to refurbish, replace, and modernize equipment \nthat is being worn out in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recognizing that the \nPresident's request for equipment for our troops was not sufficient, \nthis bill expands the authority for war-related procurement by over $12 \nbillion. I am particularly encouraged with the bill's inclusion of $4.1 \nbillion to fulfill the military services' unfunded requirements for \nMRAP vehicles, whose V-shaped hulls are proving invaluable in reducing \ncasualties from IEDs. This builds on an effort Senator Biden led in \nMarch to include $1.5 billion in the emergency supplemental. Fort \nCarson soldiers told me how invaluable these MRAPs are, and this \nfunding will see to it that we get more of those vehicles into the \nfield as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I see the majority leader on the floor, and I would be \nhappy to yield to him, if he so chooses.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the distinguished leader will yield for \na minute, I want to thank our colleague. I listened to his presentation \nand thank him for his reflections about the committee's work under the \nleadership of Senator Levin and Senator McCain on the underlying bill. \nEventually, I presume, we will focus more attention on that, but it is \nimportant to the Senator's State.\n  The State of Colorado is one of the rocks in our overall defense \nsystem of this country, and I wish more people knew how important \nColorado's citizens are in giving their support to our men and women of \nthe Armed Forces who proudly serve us from that State. I thank the \nSenator for his contribution.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Virginia leaves, I \nnote that 40 percent of the State of Nevada is restricted military \nairspace--40 percent of it. It is all controlled by the military.\n  Mr. WARNER. Amazing.\n  Mr. REID. We have Nellis Air Force Base which, as you know, is such a \ngreat facility for training our fighter pilots. That is for the Air \nForce. In the northern part of the State, as you know, we have the \nNaval Air Training Center, which is for the Navy. If you want to be a \nNavy pilot, you have to go to Fallon to get your Ph.D. The same as if \nyou are an Air Force pilot, you have to go to Nellis to get your \ntraining. It takes so much of Nevada's land to fly over to become the \nPh.Ds in fighter training.\n  Mr. WARNER. The citizens of your State have given 100 percent support \nto these military people all these years. They may miss a little bit of \nthat airspace, but they are proud to have them there.\n\n  Mr. REID. I wanted to brag about Nevada a little bit.\n  You know, the interesting thing, I say to my friend from Virginia, \nNellis Air Force Base--when it was started during the Second World War, \nit was known as the Las Vegas Gunnery School, and then it became Nellis \nAir Force Base--named after someone from Searchlight, NV, by the way, \nBill Nellis--was on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Now it is in the middle \nof Las Vegas. But the people of Las Vegas support that base. They \nprotect that base. Nobody criticizes an airplane being a little too \nloud. We love Nellis Air Force Base.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Nellis Air Force Base is well cared for in \nthe current authorization bill before this body.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin \namendment No. 2252 be withdrawn; that the McConnell amendment No. 2241 \nbe agreed to; and that the Cornyn amendment No. 2100 be agreed to; and \nthat the motions to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  Before there is acceptance or rejection, let me say this, Mr. \nPresident. We have read the Cornyn amendment. We believe it should have \na 50-vote margin, like all other amendments, but we are even willing to \ngo a step further with this amendment. We will just accept it, and that \nis what the consent is all about. We accept the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we, under \nour leadership of Senator McConnell, have a request for a rollcall vote \non the Cornyn language. We would object to a unanimous consent request \nto agree to the amendment because there is a desire, a strong desire, \nto have a recorded vote on this important issue; that every Senator \nexpress his or her desire on this amendment.\n  Having said that, we also want to check with the sponsor of the \namendment to see if he wanted to make further comments prior to a vote. \nAgain, we are confident we would be prepared to set that vote for a \nreasonable time tomorrow after we consult with the proponent.\n  Therefore, I object to the request, and I propose we revisit this in \nthe morning to see if we can find a time certain for a vote on the \nCornyn language.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we would be happy to revisit this in the \nmorning. We agreed to a reasonable time agreement on this and to have \nan up-or-down vote. We are in favor of that, a recorded vote. We will \ntake a recorded vote or we will take a voice vote--\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\nwhatever the sponsor of the legislation and the Republican leadership \nwants.\n  I say, however, that there is an effort to delay this matter. It \nappears very clear that the purpose of the Republican minority is to \nobstruct what we are trying to do, and that is complete work on this \nDefense authorization bill, including an up-or-down vote on Levin-Reed. \nBut I appreciate the opportunity to revisit this in the morning, and I \nlook forward to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader for his \nunderstanding and the representation that we can resolve this issue \ntomorrow, and I know our leader is anxious to hopefully get through the \nvarious procedural matters relating to the underlying authorization \nbill so that can move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I have about 5 more minutes to complete \nmy presentation, and then I know Senator Jack Reed has probably about \n20 minutes as well to speak on the issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I be heard briefly. I so apologize to my \nfriend from Colorado for interrupting his speech. He was gracious. I \ndidn't hear him yielding the floor to recognize me. I thought he was \nfinished. I apologize. This is very typical of the Senator from \nColorado to think of others before he thinks of himself. I apologize \nfor not recognizing his courtesy.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nstatement. Frankly, it was not great interruption. He had major \nprocedural business to bring before the floor of the Senate and I very \nmuch understand.\n  The budget authority for the Air Force is equally robust, putting \nadditional money behind some of our key space and missile defense \nprograms. Many of our communications, intelligence, and missile \ndetection satellites--a large number of which are flown by the 50th \nSpace Wing out of Buckley--are reaching the end of their lifespan. \nEvery day, though, they grow more and more central to troops on the \nground.\n  The bill provides important investments in our space assets, \nincluding $126.7 million for the Space-Based Infrared Satellite System \nto replace outdated missile detection satellites, and another $300 \nmillion to improve our space situational awareness, to help address \nconcerns raised as a result of the Chinese antisatellite test earlier \nthis year. Ask the space professionals, as I have at Schriever, \nBuckley, or Peterson Air Force Base, and they will tell you how much \nthese investments are needed.\n  Beyond the funding for equipment and facilities in the bill, however, \nthere are several key quality-of-life provisions in this legislation \nthat the Armed Services Committee has brought before us. Supporting our \ntroops, after all, means we support them in the field and we support \nthem at home. We should help them be successful not just as soldiers \nbut as mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, husbands, and wives. Part of \nour support includes passing the Dignified Treatment for Wounded \nWarriors Act, which we passed last week. The bill requires the \nSecretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to create a comprehensive \npolicy for servicemembers who are transitioning from the DOD health \nsystem to the VA system. As evidenced by Walter Reed, the current \nsystem is not up to the standards that any of us would want for our men \nand women who have served our country so proudly.\n  I am also pleased that the underlying bill includes a 3\\1/2\\ percent \npay raise for our military personnel, it rejects the administration's \nproposal to raise TRICARE fees, and requires the DOD to develop a plan \nto address the findings of an internal assessment of the well-being of \nsoldiers and marines in Iraq. These steps are all important for the \nquality of life and health of the servicemembers of our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, I again thank Chairman Levin, Ranking Member  McCain, \nSenator Reid, Senator Nelson, and others who have been involved in \ntaking such a large step forward for our Nation's defenses, and which \nprovides so much common ground from which we can work. It is a solid \nbill. It is a solid bill which I hope will be further strengthened by \nthe time it passes this Chamber.\n  I want to very briefly speak about four amendments that I have filed. \nFirst, I have filed an amendment with Senator Alexander to implement \nthe recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, and I look forward to the \ndebate on that amendment in more detail later this week. We need to \nfind common ground on how we move forward with the United States policy \nin Iraq.\n  Second, Senator McConnell, Senator Allard, Senator Bunning, and I \nhave filed an amendment, amendment No. 2061, to set 2017 as a hard \ndeadline for chemical weapons destruction and to increase funding for \nthe weapons destruction programs at Pueblo, CO, and in Bluegrass, KY. \nOur amendment adds $44 million for MilCon, military construction, \nfunding at these sites.\n  Third, amendment No. 2110; that will help the Department of Defense \nprotect military installations against encroaching development. My \namendment builds on recently released DOD and RAND Corporation reports \nand pushes the Department to allocate additional resources, provide \nadditional staff, and more aggressively implement the authorities \nCongress provided to confront the encroachment challenges at many of \nour bases. Fort Carson, in my State of Colorado, is a prime example of \nhow an effective DOD encroachment program can make sure the military \ntraining at the facility is not compromised by development. At other \nplaces and other bases in my State--Buckley Air Force Base, Schriever, \nand Peterson--the Air Force and we in the Congress have a lot more to \ndo to make sure we don't compromise the military training mission of \nthose facilities.\n  Finally, Senator Sessions and I have filed an amendment to provide \nbetter support for the Paralympic programs that serve our \nservicemembers and veterans. My amendment will allow the Office of \nSpecial Events at the Department of Defense to provide transportation, \nlogistical support or funding for the Paralympic Military Program and \nfor certain national and international Paralympic competitions. The \nParalympic program is invaluable to wounded warriors who are recovering \nfrom injuries, and DOD should be allowed to assist with the program \nwhen it benefits our servicemembers and veterans.\n  Again, I thank the leadership of the Armed Services Committee and all \nits members for bringing forward a bill that is truly a very solid, \nexcellent bill.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Reed, for his indulgence in letting me \nprecede him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I ask the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader, I believe that business for today is concluded with \nrespect to consents from the other side. Am I not correct on that? We \nwill have the benefit of the remarks of the distinguished Senator Reed, \nand then he will wrap up, including two resolutions which we have on \nthis side; am I correct in that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Virginia, I am not aware \nof any other business to come before the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is that the understanding?\n  Mr. REED. That is my understanding. I have no knowledge of any.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am told by the floor staff there will be no request for \nconsents tonight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate the assurances of the assistant leader.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we are facing a critical juncture \nregarding our operations in Iraq. We can continue with a policy that is \nstraining our military, putting excruciating strain on our military and \ntheir families, which is diminishing our standing in the international \ncommunity and which is rapidly losing the support of the American \npublic--in sum, a policy that cannot be sustained--or we can change, we \ncan make a transition of this mission to focus on objectives that are \nfeasible, to begin a reduction in our forces which will relieve the \nstress on our military and their families, to initiate complementary \nand comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic efforts to engage \nIraq's neighbors and the rest of the world in bringing a degree of \nstability to that country.\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\n  I believe it is time for such a change. That is why I have joined \nmany of my colleagues, particularly Senator Levin, to propose an \namendment to do that. This amendment would first call for a beginning \nof a reduction of American military forces 120 days after the passage \nof the legislation. It would give the President the flexibility to pick \nthe precise moment and the precise number of forces and to develop a \ntimetable for their departure. Then it would call for the transition to \nspecific missions by next spring, and those missions would include \ncounterterrorism operations, since we can never give up in our attempts \nto preemptively attack and destroy terrorist cells--not just in Iraq \nbut in, unfortunately, many other parts of the world.\n  Second, it would allow the American forces to continue to train Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  Third, it would clearly state we will protect our forces wherever \nthey are, particularly in Iraq.\n  It also talks about a very comprehensive diplomatic effort. One of \nthe dramatic failings of this administration has been a one-dimensional \npolicy--military force alone, in most cases unilateral military force. \nThat one-dimensional policy defies strategy, it defies the operational \ntechniques of counterinsurgency, and effectively, I think, has led us, \nin large part, to Iraq today where we are in a very difficult \nsituation.\n  As all of our commanders have said persistently over the course of \nthis entire conflict: Military operations alone will not lead to \nsuccess. They will buy time, they might provide some political space, \nbut they will not lead to success. They are merely a complement and a \nprelude to the economic, to the political, to the nonmilitary forces \nthat are essential to prevail in a counterinsurgency, stabilize a \ncountry, and to ultimately prevail in the type of operation we are \nwitnessing in Iraq.\n  I believe the President had an opportunity last January to chart a \nnew course. The American people spoke very clearly in the November \nelections. They wanted change. The Iraqi Study Group, a combination of \nsome of the most gifted minds on both sides of the aisle with respect \nto foreign policy, gave a framework that talked about and hoped for a \nredeployment of American forces and significant engagement in \ndiplomatic activities. All of this was at the hands of the President. \nHe essentially said, no, we are going to do a lot more of the same--or \na little more of the same. I think at that point, frankly, the American \npeople understood the President wasn't listening or, if he was, it was \nnot getting through.\n  As a result, I think they began to become very much disenchanted with \nthe course of action of this administration. I don't have to tell \nanyone in this Chamber or across the globe that this is a decisive \nturning point in their demands that we act, that this Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives take significant action. We are trying to \nrespond to that legitimate concern of the American people by the Levin-\nReed amendment that we have proposed.\n  The President said the goals for the surge were to support Iraqi \nefforts to quell sectarian violence, ensure territorial integrity and \ncounter Iranian and Syrian activity, encourage strong democratic \ninstitutions, and foster the conditions for Iraqi national \nreconciliation.\n  The heart of it, as he suggested and others have, was to give the \nIraqi leaders the ability to make tough political decisions which were \nessential to their future and to our continued engagement in Iraq.\n  Principally among them was to jump start the reconciliation process, \nbring the Sunni community into government and the civic life of Iraq, \nto pass legislation to fairly distribute the proceeds of oil revenue, \nthe major source of revenue in that country, and to take other steps--\nincluding provincial elections. None of that has been effectively \naccomplished.\n  So if the premise of the surge was to create tactical momentum for \npolitical progress, some tactical momentum may be there but very \nlittle, if any, political progress. That, I believe, is the reality.\n  These goals, this effort was difficult for an extra 30,000 troops to \naccomplish. But it was made much more difficult because of a series of \nfundamental operational mistakes and strategic flaws that this \nadministration has been engaged in since the beginning of their \noperations in Iraq. We know that soon after we arrived in Baghdad, \nafter a very successful conventional attack, there were insufficient \nforces to occupy the country and chaos broke out. The Coalition \nProvisional Authority, the CPA, embarked on a debaathification program \nthat denied employment and livelihood and, in a sense, hope to \nthousands of individuals--teachers, bureaucrats--who had been part of \nthe prior regime, mostly because it was the only way they could hold \ntheir jobs, and left, particularly the Sunni community, in a situation \nwhere they questioned whether there was a place for them in the new, \nemerging government.\n\n  The CPA disestablished the Army; 500,000 individuals with training \nsuddenly found themselves without a future and very quickly many of \nthem found themselves in the insurgency, for many reasons. The \nGovernment, the administration, failed to garner support from regional \npowers to help.\n  Then the administration embarked on a series of elections. These \nelections demonstrated the procedure of democracy. But what they failed \nto grasp, the administration particularly, is that elections alone are \ninsufficient unless there is a governmental capacity to translate those \nelections into an effective government that serves the needs of its \ncitizens. So we have demonstrations of thousands of Iraqis, hundreds of \nthousands, millions going to the polls. But what happened is they \ndidn't elect a functioning government. They became even more frustrated \nwhen they recognized that the Government in Baghdad today doesn't work \nfor them.\n  All of this was summed up, I think very accurately, by former \nSecretary of Defense William Perry, on January 25, before the Armed \nServices Committee, where he stated:\n\n       We may never know whether our goal of achieving a \n     democratic stable government in Iraq was in fact feasible, \n     since the administration's attempts to do so were so burdened \n     with strategic errors.\n\n  So we start now in a real strategic deficit. Unfortunately, I think \nthe President continues in that vein. The President announced the surge \nin January: 30,000, roughly, additional forces. It took them many \nmonths finally to get in place. The administration claims that since \nJune 15 they have been in place. This was not a surge in the classic \nmilitary sense of overwhelming force applied rapidly. It was a slow, \ngradual escalation of a limited force because our force structure \nlimits what we could do. From the very beginning, the ability of this \nforce, deployed in a slow manner, to decisively influence the action on \nthe ground was highly questionable.\n  I had the opportunity a few days ago to go to Iraq. Many of my \ncolleagues have gone. I was able to travel not only into Baghdad but to \nget into the countryside to visit forward-operating bases, patrol \nbases, company-sized bases that are the new disposition of our forces.\n  First, let me say, as always, I was impressed with the extraordinary \nprofessionalism and commitment of the soldiers and marines, the sailors \nand the airmen who serve us so well. They are doing a superb job. But \nmy conclusion, after spending these 2 brief days in the field, was \ntheir tactical momentum, changing the nature of the battlefield, has \nnot, as I said, translated into the political progress needed to truly \nbring security and stability to Iraq.\n  And then something else too, the nonrebuttable fact that I see \nconstantly; that is, this surge will come to an end later next spring, \nnot because we have succeeded, not because we have achieved our \nobjectives, but simply because we cannot continue to deploy 160,000 \ntroops in that country. That is a function of our limited forces. \nUnless the President is prepared to adopt Draconian personnel policies, \nnot 14- to 15-month tours but 18- to 20-month tours; unless he wants to \ncontinue to rely upon significant stop-loss, where individuals who are \nable to leave the service are prevented from doing so; unless he is \nprepared to do those things, then by next spring the surge ends.\n  So I think it is appropriate, if we are seeing a situation where just \nmonths from now we are going to lower our forces, that we should start \nthinking\n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\nright now of how we do it in a way which will enhance the security of \nthe United States, which will represent to the American people a new \ndirection which they are clamoring for, and which can be sustained, not \nonly in terms of material and personnel but in terms of the support of \nthe American people.\n  In my opportunity to visit Iraq, I had a chance to sit down with \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. They have suggested that they \nconsciously recognize the limitations of our overall infrastructure. \nThey also indicated that they were ready, probably sooner than \nSeptember, to make a declaration of their advice to the President. I do \nnot think we should wait, either. I think this debate is timely, the \nlegislation is timely, and we should move forward.\n  Now, we received additional information just a few days ago in the \nnature of the interim report with respect to the status of the \nbenchmarks. There is an appearance that the military situation in terms \nof the reliability of Iraqi Army units is encouraging to a degree. But \nthere is still a great deal of work to do with the police force, which \nis a major component of any type of stable society.\n  In addition, I think if you drill down below the superficial, there \nis still the nagging question of the reliability, the political \nreliability, the professional reliability, of these forces, \nparticularly their leadership. That is something which I think is still \nin great doubt.\n  But if you look at most of the political area, there is a string of \nunsatisfactory grades. The President's report found unsatisfactory \nprogress of enacting and implementing legislation on debaathification \nreform. Essentially, what we are seeing is a huge conflict between the \nSunni and Shia communities, and this conflict is not being abated by \nthe wise action of the Government, a Shia government, to allow Sunnis \nfuller participation in the civic life and the political life of Iraq.\n  We are seeing unsatisfactory progress on enacting and implementing \nmajor legislation to ensure equitable hydrocarbon resources, \ndistribution of oil and petroleum proceeds. We are seeing \nunsatisfactory progress on establishing a provincial election law, \nestablishing provincial council authority, and setting a date for \nprovincial elections.\n  One of the problems that has been nagging in the election process for \nthe last several years in Iraq is that the Sunni community did not \nparticipate in significant elections, and therefore they are not \nadequately represented in certain areas. So, as a result, they haven't \ngot this sense of participation of ownership that is so necessary. \nUntil we have provincial elections, this will continue and further \nprovide excuses, if not real reasons, for Sunnis not to participate \nfully and not to cooperate fully with the Government and with our \nforces in the field.\n  The report also talked about unsatisfactory progress toward providing \nIraqi commanders with all authorities to make tactical and operational \ndecisions in consultation with U.S. commanders without political \nintervention, to include the authority to pursue all extremists, \nincluding Sunni insurgents and Shia militias. Here is that very-\ndifficult-to-measure factor about the subjective quality of these \ncommanders and leaders--whether they can operate without political \ninterference or whether they are wittingly or unwittingly extensions of \nthe political party.\n  Just today, if you saw the New York Times, there was an interesting \narticle about how our American forces in Anbar Province were making \nprogress with Sunni tribes, previously our enemies, our opponents, who \nnow were rallying, not necessarily because they agree with us but \nbecause they recognize how ruthless and how much al-Qaida is targeting \nthem in going after them. Now, that is progress we should recognize.\n  But what is disconcerting is the report that the regular Iraqi \nbrigade in that region, primarily Shia, is actually trying to \ninterfere, even in some cases suggest an attack on those Sunnis \ntribespeople because they see this as a force that will threaten them \nas they go forward--another example of this Sunni-Shia divide, which is \na very difficult political chasm to try to bridge in a short period of \ntime, and that is what we face today in many parts of Iraq.\n  We also saw unsatisfactory progress in ensuring the Iraqi security \nforces are providing evenhanded enforcement of the law and \nunsatisfactory progress as far as limiting militia control of local \nsecurity. It is a very difficult situation in many respects.\n  Now, military operations--our military operations are critically \nimportant, but here is another reality that I think escapes so many \npeople. Ultimately, only the Iraqis can provide a solution to these \npolitical problems, to these sectarian divides. We can suggest what \nthey should do, but unless they do it, these divides will continue to \nparalyze this country and continue to undermine our efforts to help \nthem stabilize their own country.\n  I don't think, given the fundamental nature of those issues, that the \nnext 6 weeks until September 15 will make a profound difference. It has \nbeen suggested by many commentators that the ability of the Iraqi \nGovernment to function--even participate over the next several weeks is \nlimited. So for those people, my colleagues, who call: Wait for \nSeptember 15, I don't believe or hope that they are suggesting that \nthose profound political problems will be somehow miraculously cured in \nthe next 6 weeks.\n\n  As I said before, the inescapable fact, to me, is that by next April, \nwe won't be able to generate 160,000, that somehow our military, sooner \nrather than later, will have to declare that there is a new strategy \nthat rests not on the surge but on a much smaller force or at least a \nsmaller force, and that force has to deal with these problems or has to \ndeal in a way which the American people will support their continued \npresence in Iraq. That signal is today for a change in policy, not in \nSeptember, not next spring, but today.\n  Now, I alluded to the lack of public support. Some would suggest, \nwell, that is not important. You know, tough leaders have been in \nsituations where the public did not support them. Well, the reality \nthat I learned a long time ago, serving in the military, going to West \nPoint, is that public support is a critical and necessary element of \nany national security strategy; you can only go so far and so long \nwithout it.\n  We are reaching a point where the American public is clearly \ndeclaring that they are deeply concerned about what is going on, deeply \ndistrustful of the President's policy, and my fear, frankly, is unless \nwe take prudent action today, unless the President takes prudent \naction, that their tolerance for any significant engagement might erode \ncompletely by next spring, leaving us with fewer options then than we \nhave today.\n  A July 6 through 8 Gallup poll found 62 percent of Americans felt the \nUnited States made a mistake in sending troops to Iraq. A July 11, \n2007, Newsweek poll found that 68 percent of Americans disapproved of \nthe way President Bush was handling the situation in Iraq. This is \nsignificant because I suggest it undercuts the necessary ingredient of \npublic support for any major military strategic policy. As the \nPresident continues to be intransigent and as many of our colleagues \ngive him the luxury of that intransigence, I fear that the American \npublic becomes increasingly disheartened, increasingly desperate, and \nincreasingly unwilling to listen to policies that will provide for a \nphased and orderly transition of our mission in Iraq.\n  We also understand the huge cost of this war. We have appropriated \n$450 billion. As many of my colleagues point out, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that we are spending about $10 billion a month. \nThat, too, is very difficult to sustain because most of this is being \nfinanced, if not all of it, through deficit spending, which means we \nare passing on to the next generation of Americans a huge bill.\n  But, also, these are real opportunity costs. How are we going to \nreestablish, in a very narrow vein, our military, in terms of the \npersonnel, their equipment, when the effort is essentially completed \none way or the other? How are we going to provide for the next \ngeneration of military equipment, the next generation of military \ntactics and techniques and support personnel if our budget is in such \ndisarray as it is now? I am not even beginning to comment on the huge \ncosts that are unmet in this society in terms of health care, in terms \nof education, in terms of those forces and those ingredients of \nnational\n\n[[Page S9258]]\n\npower, broad national power that are so essential.\n  As I said earlier, these operations are posing an excruciating stress \nand strain on military forces. The high operational tempo is really \ntaking its toll on the troops and on their families. Since 2002, 1.4 \nmillion troops have served in Iraq or Afghanistan. Nearly every \nnondeployed combat brigade in the Active-Duty Army has reported that \nthey are not ready to complete their assigned war mission. These are \nthe troops who have come back from Iraq, from Afghanistan. They are not \nready to perform their mission.\n  We all can remember--I can, at least--Governor Bush talking up before \na large crowd in his election campaign and criticizing the Clinton \nadministration because two divisions, as he said, were not--if they \nwere asked to report, they would say: Not ready for duty, sir, to the \nPresident. That pales in comparison to the lack of readiness we see \ntoday in our military forces. Nearly 9 out of every 10 Army National \nGuard forces that are not in Iraq or Afghanistan have less than half of \nthe equipment needed to do their job. Their job now is to provide \nsupport for Governors in disasters, in problems that are related to \ntheir home States.\n  As I said again and again, military planners do not see how we can \nsustain 160,000 troops beyond next April. We also recognize that our \npolicies of go-it-alone, our policies of virtually unilateral action \nare increasingly alienating opinion throughout the world. Once again, \nto accomplish anything significant, to rally diplomatic forces, to \nrally all of the forces throughout the world to help us achieve our \nend, you have to start on the basis of at least understanding and \nsupport. We have seen that deteriorate.\n  We have seen also the situation where, because of our concentration \nin Iraq, al-Qaida now is resurgent. That is the conclusion of the \nNational Intelligence Estimate that was talked about in the press just \nlast week. We are seeing a situation where Iran is increasing its \nstrategic power. One major factor is the fact that we are tied down \nwith 160,000 troops in Iraq. We are tied down in a way in which many of \nthe individuals in the Iraqi Government whom we depend upon to do and \ntake the actions where it is essential to our success have close \npersonal and political ties to the Iranians. They talk to them on a \nweekly basis. They take certain directions from them. We are in a \nsituation where our position in Iraq--unwittingly, perhaps--has \nstrengthened the Iranians. We cannot effectively talk about another \nmajor military operation when we are having a very difficult time \nsupplying and supporting this operation.\n  We have effectively taken out two of their traditional opponents in \nthe region, and most difficult and dangerous opponent, the Taliban \nregime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. They now have \nstrategic space. They are using it. They are using it to encourage \nHezbollah and Hamas. They are using it to try to achieve nuclear fuel \ncycles and, on many days we all feel, perhaps, even a nuclear weapon. \nSo what we have seen also is that as these developments take place, the \nworld's opinion is rapidly turning against us.\n  We are seeing disturbing events in Pakistan and elsewhere where there \nis a concentration of al-Qaida leadership. I, like so many of my \ncolleagues, was most disturbed a few weeks ago when American news \nbroadcasters were showing films of a graduation ceremony of hundreds of \nindividuals somewhere in Pakistan who were leaving to go off and pursue \ntheir jihadist terrorist activities around the world. That is a \nfrightening but real situation.\n  As a result, Senator Levin and I have worked with our colleagues and \nhave proposed an amendment that responds to these different issues and \ndifferent threats and also the reality of the situation at home and in \nIraq. I am pleased we are supported in our efforts by so many, \nincluding our colleagues, Senators Hagel, Smith, and Senator Snowe. \nThis is a bipartisan amendment. It recognizes what the American people \nare demanding, a change in direction, and what the status on the ground \nand the status of the military require also, a change in direction. It \ncalls for protecting U.S. and coalition forces, continuing our fight \nagainst terrorism, and training Iraqi security forces to step up and \ndischarge their responsibilities. It calls for a beginning of a phased \nreduction of forces, 120 days after enactment of the legislation. It \nalso calls upon us to begin to take up the issue of real proactive, \ncomplimentary diplomatic, and political action that is so necessary to \nstability in the operation.\n  One of the factors the President talked about last January, and was \nalluded to by the Secretary of State and others, was the civilian surge \nto match the military surge--a surge in advisers, technicians, those \npeople who can help the Iraqis organize their political processes at \nthe city level, the provincial level, and their economic processes. \nThat is not taking place as rapidly as necessary. We are at a critical \nmoment, a moment not to delay but to take appropriate action, a moment \nto change the direction in Iraq, not simply to wait and wait and wait \nuntil events dictate we have to draw down forces. I hope we can prevail \nour colleagues to support our efforts. I will have more to say. I \nbelieve many of my colleagues will have much more to say tomorrow.\n  I urge passage of the Levin-Reed amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9258-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, we should all be so fortunate as to live a \nworthy life and at the moment of our passing have a person with the \ntalent of Bill Moyers memorialize our time on Earth. On Saturday, Bill \nMoyers, the PBS journalist who served as special assistant to President \nLyndon Johnson from 1963 to 1978, delivered a eulogy at Lady Bird \nJohnson's funeral service Saturday. He read from a text which I will \nnow have printed in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From statesman.com, July 15, 2007]\n\n               Bill Moyers's Eulogy for Lady Bird Johnson\n\n       Bill Moyers, the PBS journalist who served as special \n     assistant to President Lyndon Johnson from 1963 to 1967, \n     delivered a eulogy at Lady Bird Johnson's funeral service \n     Saturday. He read from this text:\n       It is unthinkable to me that Lady Bird is gone.\n       She was so much a part of the landscape, so much a part of \n     our lives and our times, so much a part of our country for so \n     long that I began to imagine her with us always. Now, \n     although the fields of purple, orange, and blue will long \n     evoke her gifts to us, that vibrant presence has departed, \n     and we are left to mourn our loss of her even as we celebrate \n     her life.\n       Some people arriving earlier today were asked, ``Are you \n     sitting with the family?'' I looked around at this throng and \n     said to myself, ``Everyone here is sitting with the family. \n     That's how she would treat us.'' All of us.\n       When I arrived in Washington in 1954, to work in the LBJ \n     mailroom between my sophomore and junior years, I didn't know \n     a single person in town--not even the Johnsons, whom I only \n     met that first week. She soon recognized the weekends were \n     especially lonesome for me, and she called one day to ask me \n     over for Sunday brunch.\n       I had never even heard of Sunday brunch, must less been to \n     one; for all I knew, it was an Episcopalian sacrament. When I \n     arrived at 30th Place the family was there--the little girls, \n     Lady Bird and himself. But so were Richard Russell and Sam \n     Rayburn and J. Edgar Hoover--didn't look like Episcopal \n     priests to me. They were sitting around the smallish room \n     reading the newspaper--except for LBJ, who was on the phone. \n     If this is their idea of a sacrament, I thought, I'll just \n     stay a Baptist. But Mrs. Johnson knew something about the \n     bachelors she had invited there, including the kid fresh up \n     from her native East Texas. On a Sunday morning they needed a \n     family, and she had offered us communion at her table. In a \n     way, it was a sacrament.\n       It was also very good politics. She told me something that \n     summer that would make a difference in my life. She was shy, \n     and in the presence of powerful men, she usually kept her \n     counsel. Sensing that I was shy, too, and aware I had no \n     experience to enforce any opinions, she said: Don't worry. If \n     you are unsure of what to say, just ask questions, and I \n     promise you that when they leave, they will think you were \n     the smartest one in the\n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\n     room, just for listening to them. Word will get around, she \n     said.\n       She knew the ways of the world, and how they could be made \n     to work for you, even when you didn't fully understand what \n     was going on. She told me once, years later, that she didn't \n     even understand everything about the man she married--nor did \n     she want to, she said, as long as he needed her.\n       Oh, he needed her, alright. You know the famous incident. \n     Once, trying to locate her in a crowded room, he growled \n     aloud: ``Where's Lady Bird?'' And she replied: ``Right behind \n     you, darling, where I've always been.''\n       ``Whoever loves, believes the impossible,'' Elizabeth \n     Browning wrote. Lady Bird truly loved this man she often \n     found impossible. ``I'm no more bewildered by Lyndon than he \n     is bewildered by himself,'' she once told me.\n       Like everyone he loved, she often found herself in the path \n     of his Vesuvian eruptions. During the campaign of 1960 I \n     slept in the bed in their basement when we returned from the \n     road for sessions of the Senate. She knew I was lonesome for \n     Judith and our six-month-old son who were back in Texas. She \n     would often come down the two flights of stairs to ask if I \n     was doing alright. One night the Senator and I got home even \n     later than usual. And he brought with him an unresolved \n     dispute from the Senate cloakroom. At midnight I could still \n     hear him upstairs, carrying on as if he were about to purge \n     the Democratic caucus. Pretty soon I heard her footsteps on \n     the stairs and I called out: ``Mrs. Johnson, you don't need \n     to check up on me. I'm alright.'' And she called back, \n     ``Well, I was coming down to tell you I'm alright, too.''\n       She seemed to grow calmer as the world around her became \n     more furious.\n       Thunderstorms struck in her life so often, you had to \n     wonder why the Gods on Olympus kept testing her.\n       She lost her mother in an accident when she was five. She \n     was two cars behind JFK in Dallas. She was in the White House \n     when Martin Luther King was shot and Washington burned. She \n     grieved for the family of Robert Kennedy, and for the lives \n     lost in Vietnam.\n       Early in the White House, a well-meaning editor up from \n     Texas said, ``You poor thing, having to follow Jackie \n     Kennedy.'' Mrs. Johnson's mouth dropped open, in amazed \n     disbelief. And she said, ``Oh, no, don't pity for me. Weep \n     for Mrs. Kennedy. She lost her husband. I still have my \n     Lyndon.''\n       She aimed for the consolation and comfort of others. It was \n     not only her talent at negotiating the civil war waged in his \n     nature. It was not just the way she remained unconscripted by \n     the factions into which family, friends, and advisers \n     inevitably divide around a powerful figure. She kept open all \n     the roads to reconciliation.\n       Like her beloved flowers in the field, she was a woman of \n     many hues. A strong manager, a canny investor, a shrewd judge \n     of people, friend and foe--and she never confused the two. \n     Deliberate in coming to judgment, she was sure in conclusion.\n       But let me speak especially of the one quality that most \n     captured my admiration and affection, her courage.\n       It is the fall of 1960. We're in Dallas, where neither \n     Kennedy nor Johnson are local heroes. We start across the \n     street from the Adolphus to the Baker Hotel. The reactionary \n     congressman from Dallas has organized a demonstration of \n     women--pretty women, in costumes of red, white, and blue, \n     waving little American flags above their cowboy hats. At \n     first I take them to be cheerleaders having a good time. But \n     suddenly they are an angry mob, snarling, salivating, \n     spitting.\n       A roar--a primal terrifying roar swells around us--my first \n     experience with collective hate roused to a fever pitch. I'm \n     right behind the Johnsons. She's taken his arm and as she \n     turns left and right, nodding to the mob, I can see she is \n     smiling. And I see in the eyes of some of those women a \n     confusion--what I take to be the realization that this is \n     them at their most uncivil, confronting a woman who is the \n     triumph of civility. So help me, her very demeanor creates a \n     small zone of grace in the midst of that tumultuous throng. \n     And they move back a little, and again a little, Mrs. Johnson \n     continuing to nod and smile, until we're inside the Baker and \n     upstairs in the suite.\n       Now LBJ is smiling--he knows that Texas was up for grabs \n     until this moment, and the backlash will decide it for us. \n     But Mrs. Johnson has pulled back the curtains and is looking \n     down that street as the mob disperses. She has seen a dark \n     and disturbing omen. Still holding the curtain back, as if \n     she were peering into the future, she says, ``Things will \n     never be the same again.''\n       Now it is 1964. The disinherited descendants of slavery, \n     still denied their rights as citizens after a century of \n     segregation, have resolved to claim for themselves the \n     American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \n     happiness. President Johnson has thrown the full power of his \n     office to their side, and he has just signed the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964--the greatest single sword of justice raised for \n     equality since the Emancipation Proclamation. A few weeks \n     later, both Johnsons plunge into his campaign for election in \n     his own right. He has more or less given up on the South, \n     after that legislation, but she will not. These were her \n     people, here were her roots. And she is not ready to sever \n     them. So she sets out on a whistle stop journey of nearly \n     seventeen hundred miles through the heart of her past. She is \n     on her own now--campaigning independently--across the Mason-\n     Dixon line down the buckle of the Bible Belt all the way down \n     to New Orleans. I cannot all these years later do justice to \n     what she faced: The boos, the jeers, the hecklers, the crude \n     signs and cruder gestures, the insults and the threats. This \n     is the land still ruled by Jim Crow and John Birch, who \n     controls the law with the cross and club to enforce it. 1964, \n     and bathroom signs still read: ``White Ladies'' and Colored \n     Women.''\n       In Richmond, she is greeted with signs that read: ``Fly \n     away, Lady Bird.'' In Charleston, ``Blackbird Go Home.'' \n     Children planted in front rows hold up signs: ``Johnson is a \n     Nigger Lover.'' In Savannah they curse her daughter. The air \n     has become so menacing we run a separate engine fifteen \n     minutes ahead of her in case of a bomb; she later said, \n     ``People were concerned for me, but the engineer in the train \n     ahead of us was in far greater danger.'' Rumors spread of \n     snipers, and in the Panhandle of Florida the threats are so \n     ominous the FBI orders a yard-by-yard sweep of a seven-mile \n     bridge that her train would cross.\n       She never flinches. Up to forty times a day from the \n     platform of the caboose she will speak, sometimes raising a \n     single white-gloved hand to punctuate her words--always the \n     lady. When the insults grew so raucous in South Carolina, she \n     tells the crowd the ugly words were coming ``not from the \n     good people of South Carolina but from the state of \n     confusion.'' In Columbia she answers hecklers with what one \n     observer called ``a maternal bark.'' And she says, ``This is \n     a country of many viewpoints. I respect your right to express \n     your own. Now is my turn to express mine.''\n       An advance man called me back at the White House from the \n     pay phone at a local train depot. He was choking back the \n     tears. ``As long as I live,'' he said, in a voice breaking \n     with emotion, ``I will thank God I was here today, so that I \n     can tell my children the difference courage makes.''\n       Yes, she planted flowers, and wanted and worked for \n     highways and parks and vistas that opened us to the \n     technicolor splendors of our world. Walk this weekend among \n     the paths and trails and flowers and see the beauty she \n     loved. But as you do, remember--she also loved democracy, and \n     saw a beauty in it--rough though the ground may be, hard and \n     stony, as tangled and as threatened with blight as nature \n     itself. And remember that this shy little girl from Karnack, \n     Texas--with eyes as wistful as cypress and manners as soft as \n     the whispering pine--grew up to show us how to cultivate the \n     beauty in democracy: The voice raised against the mob. . . \n     the courage to overcome fear with convictions as true as \n     steel.\n       Claudia Alta Taylor--Lady Bird Johnson--served the beauty \n     in nature and the beauty in us--and right down to the end of \n     her long and bountiful life, she inspired us to serve them, \n     too.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those of us who were fortunate enough to \nknow Mr. Moyers understand what an extraordinary person he is. I hope \nthose who read the remarks he made about Lady Bird Johnson will come to \nappreciate so much more the contributions she made in her life. She was \na gracious and caring person. Bill Moyers' eulogy reminds us she was \nalso a person of exceptional courage.\n  I join America in extending condolences to Lady Bird Johnson's \nfamily, to the family of our former colleague, Senator Charles and \nLynda Robb, and to all those who mourn her passing, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me associate myself with the \ncomments of Senator Durbin about Lady Bird Johnson. I had the privilege \nand pleasure for many years of knowing a dear friend of their family, \nmy dear friend, Warrie\n  Price and her family. She was there in Austin for the services.\n  Also, I had the privilege of serving with Senator Chuck Robb and \nknowing Lynda. I thank the Senator for recognizing those comments by \nBill Moyers. When I spoke to my friend, Warrie Price, she said she had \nnever heard anything as moving and as evocative and as fitting as the \ntribute by Bill Moyers.\n  I thank the Senator for including that in the Record for the American \npeople to consider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9259-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9259-S9260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INDEPENDENCE DAY IN CAPE VERDE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today with my colleagues in the Senate, I \ncelebrate the anniversary of Cape Verde's independence on behalf of all \nAmerica. This small African country of 400,000 deserves our \nrecognition, particularly as it one of democracy's few success stories \nin the African continent.\n  The existence of Cape Verde's islands was first acknowledged by the \nRomans. But it was not until 1456 that the uninhabited islands were \nrediscovered by the Portuguese under the command\n\n[[Page S9260]]\n\nof Henry the Navigator. Six years later, Cape Verde was inhabited and \nincorporated as a colony of the Portuguese Empire. Its prosperity \nduring the height of European colonialism was so great as to be the \nobject of looting pirates, such as the infamous Sir Francis Drake. \nHowever, because of recurring droughts and the decline of the slave \ntrade near the end of the 18th century, many Cape Verdeans emigrated \nfrom the islands to New England, many becoming productive members of \nAmerica's whaling commerce.\n  In the 20th century, Cape Verde was affected by growing nationalism, \nfomented by disastrous economic circumstances during the Second World \nWar. The tiny nation was subsequently suppressed by the authoritarian \nPortuguese regime. But in 1974 the Carnation Revolution in Portugal not \nonly brought about the world's third wave of democracy but also meant \nindependence for Cape Verde. On July 5, 1975, Cape Verde received its \nindependence from Portugal.\n  Cape Verde's road to full democracy has been gradual, but \nnevertheless Cape Verde can now boast a prolific and fair government \nthat received a perfect score in the Freedom House ratings for both \npolitical rights and civil liberties, the only African country with \nsuch an honor. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in wishing \nthe 350,000 Cape Verdean-Americans a happy Independence Day this Fifth \nof July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9260-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VISIT OF POLISH PRESIDENT LECH KACZYNSKI\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to welcome Polish President Lech \nKaczynski to Washington. Recognizing the rich history of cooperation \nbetween our two countries, I am happy to say, Witam Serdecznie w \nWashingtonie, Welcome to Washington.\n  The Polish President's visit reminds us that for the last 200 years \nAmerica and Poland have been linked in the struggle for freedom. Today \nthere is a strong legacy of sacrifice between the two nations--\nsacrifice for the cause of American and Polish freedom alike.\n  As early as the Revolutionary War, Polish patriots like Casimir \nPulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko fought alongside American patriots--from \nGermantown to Saratoga--to help win our country's independence.\n  During World War I, Ignacy Paderewski, an unparalleled musician, \nhelped lead the fight for a free and independent Poland. He became \nPrime Minister after the war, only to be forced into exile by the Nazi \nOccupation. After he died in exile in the United States, America gave \nthis great friend of freedom a place alongside our honored dead in \nArlington National Cemetery. There he would rest, in the words of \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt, ``until Poland would be free.''\n  It was a moving sight when, in 1992, President George H. W. Bush \nescorted Paderewski's ashes home to Poland. No one will forget seeing \nthousands of Poles lining the streets over the miles from the airport \nto the city center, waiting to see the horse drawn carriage.\n  It was the world's good fortune that a Pole infused with this same \ndedication to freedom and the dignity of all people was elected Pope at \nsuch a critical time. Polish Americans were thrilled at the election of \nKarol Wojtyla as Pope, a man who kept the faith when faith was \nforbidden.\n  At the same time, American Polonia's dedication to freedom in their \nnative Poland was vital in ensuring that Soviet totalitarianism would \nnot succeed. Millions of personal packages were sent to friends and \nfamily back home, and each package was a message of hope in dark days \nlike--the imposition of martial law in 1981--of the Soviet Union.\n  The razing of the Iron Curtain provided opportunities to renew the \nlinkage between Poland and America. Two centuries after the deaths of \nPulaski and Kosciuszko, Poland and America became formal allies in \nNATO, institutionalizing the faith in freedom our countries have shared \nfor centuries.\n  Since joining NATO in 1997, Poland has become one of America's most \nimportant strategic partners, dedicating troops and resources to our \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  We now have an opportunity to build on this long and deep \nrelationship. Here is how we can:\n  Renew the unity of purpose of the Transatlantic Relationship. The \nBush administration's policy of splitting Europe into ``old'' and \n``new'' was not just wrong, it was counterproductive. Poland should not \nhave to choose between its vital interest in closer integration with \nEurope and its alliance with the United States. America must repair its \nrelationship with Europe as a whole, so that Poland and our other \nCentral European allies are never put in that position again.\n  Finish building a Europe whole and free. Poland has been a steadfast \nchampion of liberty in the countries to its east. America and Poland \nshould stand together to help Ukraine build a strong and stable \ndemocracy, and to help the people of Belarus regain their human rights. \nWe also share an interest in working with Russia to meet common \nsecurity threats and to encourage Russia's integration into Western \ninstitutions. But we should also embrace, not abandon, those in Russia \nworking to preserve their hard won liberty, and draw clear lines \nagainst Russia's intimidation of its neighbors. Mr. President, 21st \ncentury Europe cannot be divided into 19th century spheres of \ninfluence.\n  Meet global challenges together. Not long ago, we looked to Poland as \na country that needed American help in its own efforts to be free and \nsecure; now we look to Poland as a critical partner in building a \nsafer, freer world. We should work with Poland to secure more European \ntroops, with stronger rules of engagement, to stabilize Afghanistan. \nAnd we should work together to send an unmistakable signal to Iran that \nits insistence in pursuing a nuclear weapons program is a profound \nmistake.\n  Energize the alliance to confront new challenges. From Poland to the \nUnited States, we are facing a new kind of threat in the form of energy \ninsecurity and climate change. The North Atlantic community has always \njoined forces to confront and defeat new challenges, and we should be \ndoing the same now by, among other things, sharing best practices on \nenergy conservation, inviting India and China to join the International \nEnergy Agency, and dedicating our significant resources to establishing \na global cap and trade on greenhouse gas pollution.\n  Prudently but decisively prepare for emerging threats. The Bush \nadministration has been developing plans to deploy interceptors and \nradar systems in Poland and the Czech Republic as part of a missile \ndefense system designed to protect against the potential threat of \nIranian nuclear armed missiles. If we can responsibly deploy missile \ndefenses that would protect us and our allies we should--but only when \nthe system works. We need to make sure any missile defense system would \nbe effective before deployment. The Bush administration has in the past \nexaggerated missile defense capabilities and rushed deployments for \npolitical purposes. The Bush administration has also done a poor job of \nconsulting its NATO allies about the deployment of a missile defense \nsystem that has major implications for all of them. We must not allow \nthis issue to divide ``new Europe'' and ``old Europe,'' as the Bush \nadministration tried to do over Iraq.\n  Invite Poland to join the Visa Waiver Program. We should work to \ninclude countries like Poland that are members of both the EU and NATO \ninto the Visa Waiver Program. Today's visa regime reflects neither the \ncurrent strategic relationship nor the close historic bonds between our \npeoples, and is out of date.\n  These are important steps and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to implement them.\n  It is wonderful to welcome the Polish President at a time in which \nAmerica and Poland share the same freedom. Our two nations share a \ncommon legacy and destiny, and I am honored to welcome President \nKaczynski to Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/16/senate-section/article/S9260-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9260-S9261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its clerks, announced that the House has passed \nthe following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2608.

REPORT ON CONTROL OF THE BROWN TREE SNAKE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), an invasive \n     species, is found in significant numbers on military \n     installations and in other areas on Guam, and constitutes a \n     serious threat to the ecology of Guam.\n       (2) If introduced into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States, \n     the brown tree snake would pose an immediate and serious \n     economic and ecological threat.\n       (3) The most probable vector for the introduction of the \n     brown tree snake into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States is \n     the movement from Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and \n     cargo, including the household goods of military personnel.\n       (4) It is probable that the movement of military aircraft, \n     personnel, and cargo, including the household goods of \n     military personnel, from Guam to Hawaii, the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United \n     States will increase significantly coincident with the \n     increase in the number of military units and personnel \n     stationed on Guam,\n       (5) Current policies, programs, procedures, and dedicated \n     resources of the Department of Defense and of other \n     departments and agencies of the United States may not be \n     sufficient to adequately address the increasing threat of the \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a \n     report on the following:\n       (1) The actions currently being taken (including the \n     resources being made available) by the Department of Defense \n     to control, and to develop new or existing techniques to \n     control, the brown tree snake on Guam and to ensure that the \n     brown tree snake is not introduced into Hawaii, the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island, or the \n     continental United States as a result of the movement from \n     Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and cargo, including \n     the household goods of military personnel.\n       (2) Current plans for enhanced future actions, policies, \n     and procedures and increased levels of resources in order to \n     ensure that the projected increase of military personnel \n     stationed on Guam does not increase the threat of \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2212.

We are \n     working on this, but I believe that the threat is outrunning \n     our response.''.\n       (4) Existing programs intended to secure, monitor, and \n     reduce nuclear stockpiles, redirect nuclear scientists, and \n     interdict nuclear smuggling have made substantial progress, \n     but additional efforts are needed to reduce the threat of \n     nuclear terrorism as much as possible.\n       (5) Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has \n     said that a nuclear terror attack ``would not only cause \n     widespread death and destruction, but would stagger the world \n     economy and thrust tens of millions of people into dire \n     poverty''.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) \n     reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with \n     the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international \n     peace and security caused by terrorist acts, and directs all \n     countries, in accordance with their national procedures, to \n     adopt and enforce effective laws that prohibit any non-state \n     actor from manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, developing, \n     transporting, transferring, or using nuclear, chemical, or \n     biological weapons and their means of delivery, in particular \n     for terrorist purposes, and to prohibit attempts to engage in \n     any of the foregoing activities, participate in them as an \n     accomplice, or assist or finance them.\n       (7) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei, has said that it is a ``race \n     against time'' to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear \n     weapon.\n       (8) The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital \n     role in coordinating efforts to protect nuclear materials and \n     to combat nuclear smuggling.\n       (9) Legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar, Senator \n     Pete Domenici, and former Senator Sam Nunn has resulted in \n     groundbreaking programs to secure nuclear weapons and \n     materials and to help ensure that such weapons and materials \n     do not fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\n     SEC. 3133. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should make the prevention of a nuclear \n     terrorist attack on the United States of the highest \n     priority;\n       (2) the President should accelerate programs, requesting \n     additional funding as appropriate, to prevent nuclear \n     terrorism, including combating nuclear smuggling, securing \n     and accounting for nuclear weapons, and eliminating, \n     removing, or securing and accounting for formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material wherever such \n     quantities may be;\n       (3) the United States, together with the international \n     community, should take a comprehensive approach to reducing \n     the danger of nuclear terrorism, including by making \n     additional efforts to identify and eliminate terrorist groups \n     that aim to acquire nuclear weapons, to ensure that nuclear \n     weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that \n     formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material \n     worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted \n     for to a degree sufficient to defeat the threat that \n     terrorists and criminals have shown they can pose, and to \n     increase the ability to find and stop terrorist efforts to \n     manufacture nuclear explosives or to transport nuclear \n     explosives and materials anywhere in the world;\n       (4) within such a comprehensive approach, a high priority \n     must be placed on ensuring that all nuclear weapons worldwide \n     are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are \n     eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for; and\n       (5) the International Atomic Energy Agency should be funded \n     appropriately to fulfill its role in coordinating \n     international efforts to protect nuclear material and to \n     combat nuclear smuggling.\n\n     SEC. 3134.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF A \n                   FAILED STATE IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are \n     determined to attack the United States and United States \n     allies.\n       (2) The Iraq Study Group report found that ``[a] chaotic \n     Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally''.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Al Qaeda will portray \n     any failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant \n     victory that will be featured prominently as they recruit for \n     their cause in the region and around the world''.\n       (4) A National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the \n     consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq would be \n     that--\n       (A) Al Qaeda would attempt to use Anbar province to plan \n     further attacks outside of Iraq;\n       (B) neighboring countries would consider actively \n     intervening in Iraq; and\n       (C) sectarian violence would significantly increase in \n     Iraq, accompanied by massive civilian casualties and \n     displacement.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group found that ``a premature American \n     departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater \n     sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions. . \n     . . The near-term results would be a significant power \n     vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, \n     and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our \n     withdrawal as a historic victory.''\n       (6) A failed state in Iraq could lead to broader regional \n     conflict, possibly involving Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \n     Turkey.\n       (7) The Iraq Study group noted that ``Turkey could send \n     troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdistan from declaring \n     independence''.\n       (8) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Iran could send \n     troops to restore stability in southern Iraq and perhaps gain \n     control of oil fields. The regional influence of Iran could \n     rise at a time when that country is on a path to producing \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       (9) A failed state in Iraq would lead to massive \n     humanitarian suffering, including widespread ethnic cleansing \n     and countless refugees and internally displaced persons, many \n     of whom will be tortured and killed for having assisted \n     Coalition forces.\n       (10) A recent editorial in the New York Times stated, \n     ``Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around \n     it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans \n     leave. There could be reprisals against those who worked with \n     American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. \n     Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and \n     Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power \n     grabs.''\n       (11) The Iraq Study Group found that ``[i]f we leave and \n     Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could \n     eventually require the United States to return''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should commit itself to a strategy that will \n     not leave a failed state in Iraq; and\n       (2) the Senate should not pass legislation that will \n     undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in \n     Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2242.

POLICY AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT \n                   BASES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to a September 2006 poll conducted by the \n     Program for International Policy Attitudes at the University \n     of Maryland, 97 percent of Sunni Arabs and 77 percent of all \n     Iraqis believe that the United States intends to maintain \n     permanent bases in Iraq.\n       (2) General John Abizaid testified before Congress in March \n     2006 that the United States ``must make clear to the people \n     of the region we have no designs on their territory or \n     resources''.\n       (3) Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, in an April 13, \n     2007, interview with al-Arabiya Television, said, ``When we \n     see that our forces are built, and that we are prepared to \n     take full responsibility for the security issue, we will ask \n     the international forces to leave the country.''\n       (4) The Iraq Study Group recommended that ``the United \n     States can begin to shape a positive climate for its \n     diplomatic efforts, internationally and within Iraq, through \n     public statements by President Bush that reject the notion \n     that the United States seeks to control Iraq's oil, or seeks \n     permanent military bases within Iraq''.\n       (5) President George W. Bush has not adequately publicly \n     stated that the United\n\n[[Page S9283]]\n\n     States does not seek permanent military bases in Iraq.\n       (6) A declaration that the United States does not seek \n     permanent military bases in Iraq should not be taken as a \n     sign of a precipitous military redeployment from Iraq.\n       (7) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004) \n     resolves that United States and Coalition forces in Iraq are \n     present at the request of the Government of Iraq and that the \n     mandate of these forces shall be reviewed at least every 12 \n     months and will terminate at the request of the Government of \n     Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The Senate calls upon the \n     President--\n       (1) to communicate a message to the people of Iraq that the \n     United States neither seeks to control Iraq's oil resources \n     nor seeks permanent United States military bases in Iraq; and\n       (2) to direct the United States Permanent Representative to \n     the United Nations to work with other Members of the Security \n     Council and the Government of Iraq to craft in a timely \n     manner a Security Council Resolution to update the mandate of \n     the Multi-National Force-Iraq.\n       (c) Reports.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter until \n     January 1, 2009, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     Congress an unclassified report, with classified annexes as \n     necessary, on the status of United States military \n     installations in Iraq, which shall include the following \n     elements:\n       (1) Information on military installations that have been \n     transferred to Iraqi control, that remain under United States \n     control, and that have been decommissioned.\n       (2) A schedule on plans to turn over the remaining military \n     installations to Iraqi control.\n       (3) Information on negotiations towards a status of forces \n     agreement between the United States and the Government of \n     Iraq.\n       (4) Specific information on the following military \n     installations:\n       (A) Camp Al Asad (Anbar governorate).\n       (B) Logistics Support Area Anaconda (Salah ad Din \n     governorate).\n       (C) Contingency Operating Base Speicher - Al Sahra Airfield \n     (Salah ad Din governorate).\n       (D) Camp Victory (Anbar governorate).\n       (E) Camp Adder at Tallil Airbase (Dhi Qar governorate).\n       (F) Camp Korean Village at Al-Walid Airbase (Anbar \n     governorate).\n       (G) Forward Operating Base Endurance at Qayyarah Airbase \n     West (Ninewah governorate).\n       (H) Convoy Support Center Scania (Qadisiyah governorate).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2243.
