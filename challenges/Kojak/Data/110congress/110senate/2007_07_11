If we end up in the position of filing \ncloture on every amendment, it is going to be quite a lengthy process \nand considerably inconvenient to both sides.\n  I hope after the vote this morning, we will get back to the way we \nhave dealt with these issues in the past, which is through concurrence \nand agreement. A series of votes, obviously, with a 60-vote threshold--\nthis is the Senate; that is the way we have done it all year--would be \nfair to both sides and give both sides an opportunity to express \nthemselves on the most important issue of our national defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S8967-10", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8967-S8968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WEBB AMENDMENT 2012\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to my good friend, \nthe distinguished Republican leader, a 60-vote threshold on everything \nis something that is new as a result of a minority that is forcing us \nto have cloture on virtually everything we do. If we go back and look \nat the Defense bill last year, there were no cloture votes except on \nfinal passage of the bill. All amendments were simple majorities, and a \nsignificant number of them dealt with Iraq. The 60-vote requirement is \nsomething that is new and has been brought about by this new minority. \nIt is something we didn't do last year. We shouldn't do it this year.\n  The Webb amendment is a simple amendment. It says that if you are in \ncountry--let's say a soldier is in Iraq for 15 months. He has to come \nhome\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\nand rest for 15 months, train for 15 months. The way it is happening \nnow, they are being rotated very quickly. This isn't the first time \nthis has happened.\n  The Senate has constitutional authority to act. Take for example the \nKorean war. We were rushing people over to Korea with inadequate \ntraining. Congress stepped in and passed a law saying they needed 120 \ndays of training before they could go to Korea. The Webb amendment is \nin keeping with what the American people want; that is, to change \ncourse in Iraq. This helps do that by dictating that our Guard and \nReserve and our Active military have time to come home and retrain and \nrelax before being sent into battle. Statistics show that the second \nand third and fourth tours of duty are literally deadly. People are \ngetting killed more regularly on the second and third and fourth tours \nof duty than they are on the first tour for obvious reasons.\n  The obvious reason, first, is fighting is becoming more fierce, and \nit is more dangerous in Iraq, but also the soldiers are tired. I called \na family in Las Vegas whose son was killed. He went back for his fourth \ntour of duty and he told everyone there: I won't come back. He didn't. \nHe was killed. That is what this amendment is all about. A simple \nmajority of the Senate should be able to respond to that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sure the majority leader and I will debate the \nsubstance of this later this morning. The Webb amendment is a clear \ninterference with the President's authority to deploy troops, the \nauthority of the Secretary of Defense, and the authority of the \ngenerals. Suffice it to say, getting 60 votes for a measure is not \nunusual in the Senate. It certainly has been the case with regard to \ncontroversial issues like Iraq all year long. That will continue to be \nthe case on this bill throughout its consideration.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Republican leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I won't, only because I have a meeting \nin my office. But I look forward to engaging the majority whip later in \nthe morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S8968-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am sorry the Republican leader would not \nyield for a question. My question would have been, the 60-vote \nrequirement for this amendment so that our troops have time to rest \nbefore they are redeployed into combat, this 60-vote requirement which \nthe Republican leader says is routine and normal, I was going to ask \nthe Republican leader, in the two previous Defense authorization bills \nbrought to the floor of the Senate, how many times did we impose a 60-\nvote requirement on amendments to that bill? The answer is none, never. \nIt was always a majority vote. Now the Republican side has said: We \ninsist on 60 votes for every amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill. Those following this debate, watching it either in the galleries \nor on C-SPAN, may wonder what is the big deal. Why? What is the \ndifference?\n  The difference is obvious. We are about to consider a debate on the \nwar in Iraq. This Senate is evenly divided. With Senator Johnson \nrecuperating, it is a 50/49 Senate with 50 Democrats and 49 Republicans \non the issue of Iraq. One of the Democratic Senators votes on the other \nside. So on any given issue, it is 49 to 50, closely divided. Now the \nranks on the Republican side are breaking and changing. We now have \nRepublican Senators who are stepping out and publicly saying they \ndisagree with the President. At least five of them have publicly said \nwe need to change the direction of our policy in Iraq. Do the math. If \nwe start with 49 and pick up 5 Republicans, we have 54. That is a \nmajority. We could start carrying amendments to change the policy of \nthe war in Iraq. The Republican leader knows that. So how does he \nprotect the President's position? How does he stop the will of the \nSenate? By imposing a new standard of 60 votes. Now it takes 60 votes, \nnot just a majority. For the last 2 years, a majority was good enough \nwhen it came to every amendment on the Defense authorization bill, \nincluding amendments about the war policy in Iraq. But not this time. \nThis time, Senator McConnell has come up with a new McConnell standard \nwhen it comes to the Iraq war policy, that it takes 60 votes in the \nSenate.\n\n  The Republican leader can come up with procedural obstacles also. He \ncan make it more difficult. He can continue to slow down the debate on \nethics reform. He can slow down the debate when it comes to the war in \nIraq. But there are a lot of Senators on this floor on both sides who \nare going to stick to this task. We are not going to give up that \neasily. We understand what is at stake. We have lost over 3,600 of our \nbest and bravest American soldiers. For us to prolong this debate, to \nset up these artificial obstacles in order to perpetuate a policy which \nis taking the lives of our men and women in uniform, is unacceptable.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, of course, has his rights under Senate \nrules. I respect that. But to impose this new standard of 60 votes and \nthen to say on the floor that this is routine and normal is not a fact. \nThat is why I wanted to ask him that question. In the last 2 years, a \nmajority vote was what was used on the Senate floor over and over again \nwhen it came to these important issues. We should return to that same \nmajority standard.\n  I would say to the Senator from Kentucky who tried to defend the \nPresident's position, he should go back to his State, as all of us \nhave, and speak to the families of the soldiers, understand what they \nare going through. Of course, every family of a soldier overseas is \nlost in prayer and worry every single day about their loved one in \nbattle. But this administration, this President sends these soldiers \nover again and over again without rest, without retraining, without the \nequipment they need in battle. That is unacceptable. That is not a \nstandard we should allow when it comes to our defense of America.\n  Senator Jim Webb, who has offered this amendment, is a ground-combat \nveteran of Vietnam, as is Senator Hagel, another cosponsor of this \namendment. They and Senator Inouye, a veteran of World War II, know \nwhat it is like to put on that uniform and risk your life in battle. \nWhat they are asking for is time for these soldiers to come home and \nhave a chance to be with their families, to rebuild their lives, to \nrest, try to put their lives back together, reassociate themselves with \ntheir families, retrain, and be ready if they are called again. What I \nhear from the Senator from Kentucky is: That is unacceptable. This is \nthe President's call. He can keep sending these men and women over \nagain and again, even though it is more dangerous every time they are \nsent into battle without appropriate rest and training.\n  When it comes to the vote, the Senator from Kentucky tells us a \nmajority of the Senate is not enough; we need 60 votes to give our \nsoldiers an opportunity to get the rest and retraining they deserve. \nThat is unfortunate. It is part of the obstructionism we are now seeing \nevery single day from the Republican side of the aisle. That isn't why \nwe were sent to Washington. If five or six Republican Senators want to \njoin the Democrats in trying to change the policy in Iraq, they should \nbe given that chance. Using these procedural obstacles is unfortunate \nfor this country and certainly unfortunate for the soldiers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I relish this opportunity. We have before \nus in the Senate this week, and probably next week, Department of \nDefense reauthorization, a reauthorization that is critically important \nbecause our men and women are deployed around the world carrying out \ncritical missions.\n  The Department of Defense reauthorization does some interesting and \nsome good things: an across-the-board 3.5-percent increase in the pay \nfor our men and women in the Armed Forces; an increase in our manning \ndocument for the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army to increase our \nauthorized levels; an important increase in funding and capital for \nthose bases and those States and those communities affected by the most \nrecent BRAC, which it is critically important to see to it, as we \nreposition our military domestically, that those communities that are \naffected have the capital and the resources to improve their \ninfrastructure to meet that pressure. Equally important is legislation \nincluded that was introduced by Senator Chambliss of Georgia, \ncosponsored by myself, to accelerate retirement benefits for Guardsmen \nand Reservists deployed in combat, to let their deployments, as they \nincrease, accelerate the time in which they become eligible for their \nretirement. These are all great benefits.\n  Unfortunately, we have no debate on the benefits, nor the need. We \ncontinue to debate a question that was on the floor most of the month \nof May when we did the Iraq emergency supplemental, a debate that is \nscheduled following the report of General Petraeus in September. But \nfor a reason not sure to me, except political, we debate today \nsomething we have already debated once before and will debate again in \n60 days and that is the issue of whether we do a precipitous, \ndangerous, scheduled withdrawal from the overall battle in Iraq today.\n  I wish to address the Levin-Reed amendment from two perspectives. \nFirst is the role of Iraq and its battle in the overall global war on \nterror, and secondly, the consequences of a scheduled, timed, \nprecipitous withdrawal from that battle. First of all, in terms of \nbeginning to withdraw in 120 days and being out by April, you send the \nclear signal to those we are in combat with today, which is al-Qaida \nand the insurgencies in Iraq--the enemies of freedom and liberty around \nthe world--you have scheduled the fact that we, in fact, are leaving. \nYou have offered them the opportunity, which they will seize, to \ndeclare victory. In the end, the danger to America and the free world \nis far greater following that than it is carrying out the tough battle \nwe have today.\n  I am reluctant to quote anything Osama bin Laden would ever say, but \nin one of his speeches following the declared fatwah against freedom in \nthe West and America, he said simply: People will follow the strong \nhorse. That is exactly what they will do if we retreat. We may, in \nfact, have to change our strategy. We may, in fact, reposition \nourselves, but we owe it to ourselves to do it when our generals have \nreported back on their scheduled time. We do it on our timetable and \nnot as a retreat but as a strategy change. We did it earlier this year \nand are now in the early stages of its implementation.\n  From a historical perspective, I wish to remind all of us what \nhappened in the last 50 years of the last century. Two great \nPresidents, one a Republican and one a Democrat, both were confronted \nwith difficult times that threatened America and democracy as we know \nit: John Kennedy, when the Soviet Union put missiles on the Cuban \nisland and, secondly, when the Iranians took our people as hostages, \ncommunism was flourishing and Ronald Reagan was elected and had the \nwill and the courage to confront both. The results of the Cuban Missile \nCrisis were we did not blink. President Kennedy blockaded the island of \nCuba, Khrushchev threatened, but he blinked and they withdrew and \nmissiles are not 90 miles off our shore today. In the case of Iran, and \ntheir taking our hostages, and in the case of the Soviet Union, \nPresident Reagan stood before the world and said: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear \ndown this wall.'' Then he had the intestinal fortitude, through the \nappropriations, to build up our military and the proposal of a mutually \nshared defense of the United States of America and the free world to \nfinally get the Soviet Union to back away from communism, back down \nfrom the Cold War, and today we have a much safer world.\n  The enemy we face today in the terrorists is no less a threat; they \nare greater. The policy change our President made in 2001, 9 days after \nthe attack on 9/11, to change it from a reaction to a preemption was \nprecisely right, and the global war on terror and its central battle in \nIraq which has been declared so by al-Qaida is, in fact, a necessary \npreemption in terms of terrorism.\n  The second point is the consequences of withdrawing precipitously and \non a posted schedule. No. 1, before the Foreign Relations Committee, \nevery expert from a Democrat to a Republican, Colin Powell to Madeleine \nAlbright; every institute, every think tank, every foreign Middle \nEastern expert said the following: We don't know if the surge will work \nor what its success will be, but we will tell you this: if the United \nStates withdraws, there will be an outright civil war in the Middle \nEast, hundreds of thousands may die and, quite frankly, millions could, \nin an uncontrolled, difficult time. If there is one place in the world \nwhere that type of turmoil threatens the security of all freedom and \nall mankind, it is the Middle East. Withdrawal in that case is \nabsolutely the wrong thing to do.\n  Secondly, when the Mujahedin and terrorists ran the Russians out of \nAfghanistan, they created a safe haven for terror from which the \nultimate 9/11 attack came at America 20 years later. We should not \nthink for a minute that if we leave Iraq, left to the insurgency and \nthe terrorists, the same would not happen. But it wouldn't be 20 years \nbefore the attack came against America; it might be a matter of months. \nIt is important for us to continue to pursue the goals of the surge, \ngive the President the chance to make the report this Thursday, General \nPetraeus the chance to make the report this September, and then have a \ndebate; not in advance of the facts but after we know the facts as they \nstand. This is too important. This is too important for America.\n  September 15 is an important date for us to judge the success of our \nbrave men and women who are carrying out the surge today. To declare a \nretreat today on a timed, precipitous schedule is wrong for America, it \nis wrong for our effort in the war on terror, and it strikes a dagger \nin the heart of our new found policy of preemption.\n  So I appreciate the time the Senate has afforded me this morning. In \nclosing, I ask unanimous consent that a column on this very issue \nwritten by Tony Blankley and appearing around the United States today, \nbeing syndicated, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From MDJOnline.com, Jul. 11, 2007]\n\n      Senate Fails To Address the Real Question About War in Iraq\n\n       The Senate is emitting an embarrassing level of emotional \n     policy twitching on the topic of Iraq. Sen. Harry Reid can't \n     take the war anymore. He ``knows'' it is lost. Sen. Olympia \n     Snowe has just about had it with the Iraqi government. If \n     they don't meet her benchmarks--that's it. Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell thinks ``that the handwriting is on the wall that \n     we are going in a different direction in the fall, and I \n     expect the president to lead it.'' Who authored that wall \n     graffiti, he doesn't say. After talking with grieving family \n     members of one of our fallen warriors, Sen. Pete Domenici \n     ``wants a new strategy for Iraq.''\n       I haven't seen such uncritical thinking since I hid under \n     my bedsheets to get away from the monsters back when I was 3 \n     years old.\n       Whether they are talking about war weariness, grief over \n     casualties, fear of their upcoming elections, disappointment \n     with the current Iraqi government or general irritation with \n     the incumbent president: What in the world do such misgivings \n     of U.S. senators have to do with whether we should continue \n     to advance our vital national security interests?\n       None of these senators have even addressed the question of \n     whether the United States is\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\n     safer if we leave Iraq than if we stay. Isn't that the key \n     question? The question is not whether the Iraqi government \n     deserves American sacrifice on their behalf.\n       Our sons and daughters are not fighting, being grievously \n     wounded and dying for Iraq--but for American vital interests. \n     If this were just about Iraqi democracy, I might join the \n     screaming for a quick exit.\n       But if al Qaeda can plausibly claim they drove America out \n     of Iraq (just as they drove the Soviet Union out of \n     Afghanistan), they will gain literally millions of new \n     adherents in their struggle to destroy America and the West. \n     We will then pay in blood, treasure and future wars vastly \n     more than we are paying today to manage and eventually win \n     our struggle in Iraq.\n       Our staying power, unflinching persistence in the face of \n     adversity, muscular capacity to impose order on chaos and \n     eventual slaughtering of terrorists who are trying to drive \n     us out will do more to win the ``hearts and minds'' of \n     potentially radical Islamists around the world than all the \n     little sermons about our belief in Islam as the religion of \n     peace. As bin Laden once famously observed--people follow the \n     strong horse.\n       We have two choices: Use our vast resources to prove we are \n     the strong horse or get ready to be taken to the glue \n     factory.\n       Even Bush's war critics who specialize in Middle East \n     affairs (such as the Brookings Institute) believe that the \n     immediate chaos in the Middle East that will follow our \n     premature departure would likely involve not only regional \n     war there, a new base for al Qaeda, but also a nuclear arms \n     race that would quickly result in the world's most unstable \n     region--which possesses the world's oil supply--armed with \n     nuclear weapons on a hair trigger.\n       But the debate today in Washington is about none of these \n     strategic concerns. It is exclusively about Washington's \n     political timetable and when the president will bend to such \n     political necessity. For self-admitted politics--rather than \n     national security--to be driving decision making in wartime \n     Washington is not only an unpatriotic disgrace--it is a \n     national menace.\n       Imagine the following fanciful discussion in April 1943:\n       FDR: ``Ike, you're going to have to get the Normandy \n     Invasion completed by June this year.''\n       Ike: ``But I need at least another year to assemble troops \n     and materiel, establish logistics and strategy and train the \n     men for the battle.''\n       FDR: ``Sorry. Several senators are feeling very \n     uncomfortable with the war. Frankly, they have just had it. \n     And several of them are worried about their re-election.''\n       Ike: ``My men are fighting and dying for yards in Italy \n     right now--and even so, they can't wait to take the war to \n     Hitler next year in France. Tell those pantywaisted senators \n     to unloosen their girdles, take an aspirin and go to bed--and \n     leave the fighting to my men.''\n       FDR: ``But we could lose the Senate.''\n       Ike:'' Better to lose the Senate than the war.''\n       FDR: ``I'm with you, Ike. You beat Hitler, and let me beat \n     the Senate.''\n       Ike:'' My men thank you, Mr. President.''\n       Of course, it is an absurdity to imagine such a \n     conversation would have been possible during WWII. And it is \n     a tragedy and disgrace that we are, in fact, having precisely \n     such a conversation today.\n       But the worm will surely turn. And senators who today \n     proudly call for retreat will then be hiding their faces in \n     shame. And deservedly so. And the public will remember.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I so greatly admire the Senator from \nGeorgia, and his words are so well spoken, I hope people will take them \nto heart. I also wish to rise on this issue. Before I do that, I wish \nto speak briefly on the issue pending, which is the cloture motion on \nthe amendment from the Senator from Virginia, Senator Webb. I haven't \ndecided how to vote on the amendment of the Senator from Virginia. I \nhave an immense amount of respect for the Senator, the former Secretary \nof the Navy, whom I greatly admire for his service to this country, but \nI am deeply concerned by the process which is being used.\n  It has always been the tradition of this Senate that there would be \nside-by-side votes. It used to be, when I first arrived, that there \nwere actually second-degree votes, and then we got to a position where \neverybody knew if you had a second degree, you could always get to the \nfirst-degree vote, so you gave people side-by-side votes. Unless the \nissue is on the fundamental question of an overriding bill, the use of \ncloture for the purposes of cutting off the debate to that amendment \nhas not occurred around here. This is an attempt to basically make the \nSenate operate as if it had the autocratic Rules Committee of the \nHouse, and it is wrong. It is just plain wrong.\n  The minority should be afforded the right--and has the right--to \nassert an amendment to an amendment offered on this floor. It has the \nright to a second degree if it wishes to, and then the author of the \nfirst degree has the right to position himself or herself so he or she \ncan bring that amendment back up. As an alternative to that, the offer \nof a side by side is the way you resolve the issue. That offer was made \nto allow a side by side on the amendment of the Senator from Virginia. \nIt was rejected, as I understand it. That is what this cloture vote, \nfor me, is about. It is not about the credibility--not the \ncredibility--it is not about the appropriateness or the correctness of \nthe underlying amendment of the Senator from Virginia; it is about \nwhether the minority has the procedural right to assert its standing as \na functioning entity within the body and, therefore, the ability to \namend or at least have a side-by-side amendment when amendments are \nbrought to the floor on which there may be other views.\n  So that is why I intend to vote against cloture. It is not to extend \nthe debate; it is not to, in some way, undermine the bill or even to \nundermine the amendment; it is to make sure that the rights of the \nminority are protected in this institution where the rights of the \nminority are the essence of the way this institution functions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S8970-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8970-S8971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ\n\n  Mr. GREGG. On the question of Iraq, and specifically as I have my own \namendment which I will be offering--it is not my amendment; I have an \namendment in which I am joined by other Members, including Senator \nSalazar, on how to proceed in Iraq, and we will be talking about that \nlater--maybe even later today--I wish to speak briefly on an amendment \nbeing offered by Senator Reid and Senator Levin which fixes a timeframe \nfor withdrawal that is arbitrary and which is condensed. That \ntimeframe, as I understand it, would occur within 6 months, when there \nwould be a withdrawal. There are no underlying policy proposals which \nsay that the Government of Iraq has to be a functioning government and \nhas to have the capacity to secure itself and has to have the capacity \nto maintain stability in order for the withdrawal to occur; the \nwithdrawal simply is going to occur. I think the practical implications \nfor that are pretty staggering and not constructive to the process, \nquite honestly. I think a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq, which has \nno underlying policy and which leaves behind a stable government or \nattempts to leave behind a stable government, will inevitably lead to a \ndesperate government, which will, in turn, lead to chaos, and chaos in \nIraq is not in our national interests.\n  We have to remember what the stakes are. Our purpose of being in Iraq \nis fundamentally to protect ourselves as a nation. The people who wish \nto do us harm--and they have made it clear they intend to do us harm \nand they have done us harm--intend to use their ability to attack the \nUnited States as the essence of their war on us. The way you keep them \nfrom attacking our Nation is to find them where they are and attack \nthem and to make it very difficult for them to have a safe haven and to \ndisrupt their activities and to find them before they can attack us. \nThat is our philosophy. It is a philosophy which is totally appropriate \nto the war that we now find ourselves engaged in.\n  This is not a conventional situation. We are not fighting a nation \nstate. We are fighting individuals who subscribe to a philosophy which \nsays they will have a better afterlife if they destroy Western culture \nand specifically kill Americans and destroy America. That is their \npurpose. They have said that and they have done it. Let's not be naive \nabout this. Let's not look at this through rose-colored glasses and say \nthey wish some other outcome and if we are nice to them they will go \naway; that if we ignore them, they will ignore us. That is not the \ncase.\n  So we have pursued a policy in Iraq and across the world of finding \nthem before they find us. If Iraq, because of a precipitous withdrawal \nwhich leaves no stability behind, is allowed to devolve into chaos, it \nis very obvious what is going to happen. Besides a civil\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\nwar, which is obviously already going on, to some degree, which will be \nexpanded radically with many thousands of people, more thousands of \npeople dying, there will undoubtedly occur within Iraq the creation of \na client state for Iran, and Iran has made it very clear what their \nintentions are. Their intentions are to develop a nuclear weapon and \nproduce hegemony throughout the Islamic world.\n  Secondly, it will become a safe haven for al-Qaida and give them a \nbase of operation which will represent a clear and present threat to us \nas a nation.\n\n  So that type of course of action, although it obviously looks \nattractive because it gets our troops out of immediate harm's way, and \neverybody wants to do that to the fullest extent possible, will have \nthe exact opposite effect on our national security. It will actually \nput us at greater risk.\n  There has to be an underscoring of the withdrawal, or the drawdown, \nwhich I think is the more appropriate term, because even the most \nstrident people on the other side of the aisle who wish to withdraw \nrecognize there is going to have to be some residual force left for the \npurpose of protecting American assets, such as our embassies, and \ntraining, hopefully, troops of the Iraqi Government. But any process \nfor the drawdown really has to be done in the context of leaving behind \nas stable a government as we can possibly create, or participate in \nhelping to create. That is why I have become a sponsor of and \nparticipating in the effort to put in place the proposals of the Iraq \nStudy Group, which essentially outlines a series of steps that can be \ntaken which will, hopefully, lead us toward a drawdown of American \ntroops which is tied to leaving behind a stable government.\n  The Reed-Levin amendment abandons all of that. It abandons the Iraq \nStudy Group proposal. It abandons the effort to try to leave in place a \nstable government. It essentially says: Here is the date; we are going \nto leave by that date. And it is a date certain.\n  That has two effects. It means the Government of Iraq will inevitably \nbe in desperate shape and potentially collapse, which will lead to \nchaos, and, more importantly, it means our troops who are on the ground \nwill, during that period leading up to that date, be under significant \nstress because their morale will be at serious issue because they will \nknow when they get to that date, they are leaving and they are leaving \nbehind a mess and, more importantly, they will be pursuing a mission, \nwhich they will have been told by the other side of the aisle at least, \nhas no viability. And how can you ask somebody to go out and walk the \nstreets of Baghdad and participate in ``the surge and the clear and \nhold and hopefully pass on stability'' exercise that is going on there \nif you have the other side of the aisle saying: I am sorry, that \nmission is irrelevant. You are out there, we don't believe in what you \nare doing, we have no faith in that effort.\n  Yes, everyone has total commitment to our troops, but we also have to \nhave a commitment that when we send the troops out on the street, and \nthey put their lives at risk, they know there is a policy behind that \neffort which is supported. In this case, what is being said is that \npolicy isn't being supported and their efforts on the streets in \nBaghdad and other places are not going to have support.\n  It is a very dangerous message to send, first, to our enemies who \nhave a specific date and can ratchet up the violence radically to force \nthat date on us; second, to our troops on the ground; and thirdly, to \nthe long-term stability of a region which is critical to our national \ninterests and which plays a major role in whether we are going to be \nsuccessful in keeping our homeland, America, from being attacked.\n  A precipitous withdrawal without a game plan will lead to a \ndysfunctional and disorganized and possibly collapse of the Government \nof Iraq, and it will lead to chaos. Therefore, I think it is a very \nintemperate policy to pursue.\n  There is also a certain cynicism about it, when you get right down to \nit, and this bothers me. The people promoting this amendment have \nconstituencies who are truly and sincerely, I am sure, committed to \ngetting us out of Iraq as soon as possible, and they are trying to \nrespond to those constituencies. We see those constituencies all the \ntime, and their intensity is huge; especially in the Democratic Party \nthey have great sway. But the amendment itself is almost a free pass in \nthat everybody knows it cannot pass, and that is the irony. It is a \nfree pass that cannot pass. It cannot pass the Senate because it cannot \nget 60 votes. If it did pass the Senate, and it did pass the House, it \nwould be vetoed by the President and, clearly, would not go into \neffect.\n  So, essentially, what is happening is a policy is being put forward \nwhich has serious political implications on the ground and substantive \nimplications on the ground in Iraq but has maybe a political upside in \nthe United States for people who are speaking to that constituency \nwhich wants to immediately get us out of Iraq but has no viability \nbehind it, has no expectation of success behind it, and therefore is, \nto a certain degree--a considerable degree--a rather cynical strategy.\n  The losers in this effort, quite honestly, are our troops on the \nground because they are seeing this debate going forward, and they are \nscratching their heads saying: Why am I being asked to go out on the \nstreets? Why am I being asked to do this mission when they trying to \npass legislation in the Senate which says they don't support the \nmission, and they know for sure that is not going to become law?\n\n  It is not good to pursue this type of an approach on an issue of such \nimportance, of such significance to our Nation, and especially to the \nmen and women who defend us.\n  I have serious reservations about not only the substance of the \nproposal but about the politics behind the proposal, knowing that the \nproposal has no capacity to become law, that it would be put forward in \nsuch a way that basically creates false claims, in my opinion, or false \nopportunities, or alleged opportunities.\n  This is an immensely serious issue, we all know that. What we need, \nquite honestly, is some sort of approach that has a little bit of \nbipartisanship to it, where both sides say: OK, we know we have a \ndifficult situation, an extremely frustrating situation in Iraq. Let's \ncome up with something that is a united policy, a bipartisan policy. \nThat is why the suggestion which is being put forward--to put in place \nthe Iraq Study Group as the blueprint for how we proceed there--is one \nwhich I think has some vitality to it.\n  Is it the perfect answer? Obviously not. There is no perfect answer. \nIn fact, I was interested in hearing Lee Hamilton say there are no good \nsolutions to this situation. It was a very forthright statement that I \nthink resonates strongly.\n  The fact is, this little gambit--not a little gambit--this \nsignificant gambit of putting forward a proposal that speaks to a \nconstituency, but everyone knows is not going to become law, is not \nconstructive for the process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Webb amendment. I \nknow there will be many speakers. Like everything I do, I want to seize \nthe day and talk about what I think about the Webb amendment.\n  It is almost 10:30 in the morning in Washington. It is 6:30 in the \nevening in Baghdad. Yesterday, in Washington it was 98 degrees, and \neverybody was complaining about the heat wave. They couldn't wait until \nthey got into air-conditioning. Well, it was 115 degrees in Baghdad \nand, boy, would I like to get our troops in air-conditioning--in air-\nconditioning back home.\n  I check the temperature every single day in Baghdad because I want to \nthink about our troops. I want to try to envision what they are going \nthrough. I think about those men and women out there carrying over 100\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\npounds of body armor in brutal heat, being shot at, being attacked by \nbrutal IEDs. Yes, it is hot in Baghdad, and it is hot in more ways than \none.\n  We need to care about our troops, and we need to care for our troops. \nWe all say we support our troops. Well, let's support them, all 100 of \nus, all 100 Senators. Regardless of party and how we voted on the war, \nlet's say we support our troops. Then if we really do support them, \nlet's support the Webb amendment.\n  The Webb amendment does support our troops and our families and also \nthe employers of those in the Guard and Reserve. But it supports our \ntroops. The Webb amendment gives our troops a breather, and if the \nPentagon will not do it, Congress needs to do it. That is why I support \nthe Webb amendment.\n  I salute the Senator from Virginia. Senator Webb is a freshman \nSenator, but he is no stranger to war. He is a warrior's warrior, a \ncombat veteran. He also was the Secretary of the Navy. He knows full \nwell the stresses the men and women in our military are facing and \ntheir families are facing.\n  The Webb amendment is simple and straightforward. It supports our \ntroops by giving them more time at home between deployments. It deals \nwith troop fatigue. It deals with troop exhaustion. For our men and \nwomen in the military, if you are in the full-time military, the all-\nvolunteer military, your time at home would be at least as long as the \nlength of your last deployment. For the Guard and the Reserve, no one \nwould be redeployed within three times of their previous deployment.\n  Why is this important? Our military is overstretched, and our troops \nare exhausted. Their families are also living with tremendous stress. \nEvery time they hear a news report about another attack, they wonder \nhow their loved one is and if they are surviving. They have an \nunending, agonizing fear of a strange car pulling up to their home with \nunbearable news. Whether you are a spouse, a mom, or a dad, or \nchildren, you are bearing the stress of this war. The Webb amendment \ngives our troops a breather and some relief to our families.\n  This current President says the struggle in Iraq will be long and \nwill require continued sacrifice. Sacrifice from whom? There is no \nshared sacrifice. The sacrifice is falling on our troops now serving in \nIraq and Afghanistan. The sacrifice has been made by those who died in \nIraq, by the 85 Marylanders who died in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, you are from Maryland. You know that some of the men \nand women who died came from our service academies--West Point, the \nNaval Academy. Some came from renowned schools and universities. Some \nof our kids came from the school of hard knocks. One, named Kendall \nFrederick, only had a green card. He died when a bomb hit his convoy \nwhen he was driving to get his fingerprints taken so that he could \nbecome an American citizen. Thousands of others are wounded.\n  Some say we are micromanaging the war. You know what. I am for \nmicromanaging the war. Maybe if we micromanaged the war, it would not \nbe costing us $12 billion a month, and maybe we wouldn't be going it \nalone. So no matter how one feels about deadlines or benchmarks, we \nmust support our troops. And I believe this is the way to do it.\n  I conclude by saying this: While our troops are out there every day \nin 115-degree heat, let's see what the Iraq Parliament is doing. Our \nguys are fighting for a military solution. Let's see what they are \ndoing for a political solution.\n  The Iraqi Parliament cannot even reach a quorum. Mr. President, 12 \nmembers of the Iraqi 38-Member Parliament no longer attend Cabinet \nmeetings. So one-third of the Cabinet doesn't show up for meetings. \nSeventy-five Members of the Iraqi Parliament are boycotting, refusing \nto do any work at all so that the very Parliament cannot get a quorum. \nWhile the Iraqi Parliament doesn't show up and stays home in its air-\nconditioning, our guys and gals are out there patrolling Baghdad in \n115-degree heat with 100 pounds of equipment and body armor. Listen, if \nyou support the troops, support Webb.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S8972-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am comfortable with the Senator from \nArizona beginning the discussion. We are waiting for the chairman to \narrive.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well then, Mr. President, I will go ahead.\n  I understand there is 20 minutes equally divided; is that correct, \nMr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona controls \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will yield myself just 4 minutes and \nthen save some of the remaining time.\n  Mr. President, this amendment calls for a congressionally mandated \nfence that would surround every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine and \nevery military unit in the Armed Forces. If their days at home don't \nequal the days deployed, these soldiers, by law, could not be deployed \nin support of operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. It is quite a \nrestriction.\n  I have done some research recently, since I heard about this \namendment, and it is certainly without precedent in wartime, and we are \nin wars, both in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather than get into the debate \nabout the length of the war in Iraq again, I think most people \nappreciate the fact that the war or the conflict in Afghanistan will be \nwith us for a long time. I mention that because I have yet to see a \ncongressional proposal to end our engagement in Afghanistan where we \nwere successful in ousting the Taliban, but, obviously, there are more \nchallenges we have to meet in the future.\n  In the Defense authorization bill, we have provisions to increase the \nsize of the Marine Corps and the Army, which I hope will alleviate some \nof the enormous strain that has been placed on our Guard, Reserve, and \nActive-Duty Forces. I understand the deep concern of the Senator from \nVirginia about this issue. Our Guard and Reserve are being stressed in \na way that is unprecedented, probably since World War II, when \neverybody was called to serve, just about, and I certainly understand \nthe concerns raised here. I share them with Guard members and members \nof the Reserve all the time.\n  We have called people back to active duty in an almost unprecedented \nfashion, so I understand the intent of this amendment. But if we put \nsuch a requirement into law in wartime, I think it would be bad \ncongressional micromanagement. It would be a precedent that no \nPresident could live with and an expression of distrust in military \nleaders, particularly of the Secretary\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nof Defense, Mr. Gates, who promptly established dwell-time policies on \nassuming office and is doing his utmost to enforce them.\n  Senator Webb has expressed his belief that this amendment would do no \nharm. Well, those whom we charge with the responsibilities--both the \nDepartment of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff--have indicated \nthat if enacted, the amendment would have immediate adverse effects on \ntheir ability to accomplish their military missions.\n  The Joint Staff told us this amendment would ``eliminate the \nflexibility of the services to manage and mitigate exceptions to dwell \ntime planning goals'' and that ``future support to IAF/OEF may be \nseverely impacted.''\n  The Joint Staff went on to say, ``The requirements will result in \nfuture capability gaps in combat and combat support forces both in IAF \nand OEF units.'' For reservists, the requirement will ``exacerbate the \nstress on the current force, providing sourcing challenges and creating \nshortfalls.''\n  The Department of Defense stated, ``In emergency situations, where \nforces are needed quickly, the waiver process could affect the war \nfight itself by delaying forces needed in theater.'' And they went on \nto say, ``The proposed language stipulates minimum periods between \ndeployments in both units and individuals. The requirement to meet both \ncriteria for units and individuals before deployment could severely \nlimit options for sourcing rotations.''\n  That is the view of the people we entrust with the responsibilities \nto defend our Nation, and I do not diminish the responsibility of the \nCongress as well. This amendment could--and according to military \nplanners, would--do harm. And it shouldn't be a surprise.\n  So the amendment has a Presidential waiver provision, which I am sure \nwill be emphasized in the course of this discussion, but it doesn't \nmake the amendment better. Attempts at using it would only lead to \nendless delays and bickering about whether deployment ``meets an \noperational emergency posing a vital threat to national security \ninterests.'' Those kinds of decisions should clearly be made by the \nPresident of the United States. That is what the Constitution says when \nit outlines specifically that the President of the United States shall \nserve as Commander in Chief.\n\n  Now, the Congress, as they have in the past, has the power of the \npurse, and if we don't like what the President--the Commander in \nChief--is doing, then we can cut off those appropriations. Sometimes we \nhave done that, much to our dismay in afterthought. For example, I \nreferred earlier--yesterday--to a decision to cut off any military \nassistance or any kind of assistance to Cambodia, and we watched \nhelplessly as 3 million people were slaughtered in a genocide of \nproportions almost unmatched in the 20th century. I say ``almost.'' So \nI believe this kind of decision should be made by the Commander in \nChief.\n  I wish to assure my colleague from Virginia that I will work with him \nin every way to get this legislation passed, which increases the size \nof our Marine Corps and Army, and we should continue, just as quickly \nas we can, to recruit these brave individuals and to maintain the \nstandards we think are important in order to have this highly qualified \nAll-Volunteer Force.\n  I would also again point out that there are men and women who want to \ngo back to Iraq. There are men and women who want to serve again in \nAfghanistan. There are men and women who feel a sense of urgency and a \ndesire to serve. Would the amendment of the Senator from Virginia \npreclude them from additional service? I don't know.\n  So I hope we can continue to work together on this issue, and I hope \nwe can turn down this amendment, even though I certainly agree with the \nsentiments and the concern of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield a moment first to Senator Webb \nto comment on the question which Senator McCain just raised about \nwhether people can voluntarily go back before the dwell time period is \nover, and then I will yield myself 8 minutes, after which I will yield \nthe remainder of my time to the control of Senator Webb.\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator for yielding for a factual reference on \nthe one point the Senator from Arizona raised, and I will reserve the \nremainder of my time for later on.\n  There is a waiver provision in this amendment that allows anyone who \nwants to return to duty in Iraq or Afghanistan to do so and without \naffecting the rights of other people to be deployed, according to the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is ample evidence that 4 years of war \nhas stressed our Armed Forces to the breaking point. Our Army and \nMarine Corps are stretched dangerously thin. They are wearing out. \nEarlier this year, we watched as they scrambled and pulled together the \npersonnel, equipment, and training to meet the surge of additional \nforces to Iraq. They will continue to struggle to sustain this higher \nsurge force level if it extends beyond this fall.\n  Unit rotations into and out of an overseas mission has been a fixture \nof U.S. military operations for many years. However, unit-rotation \nschemes have significant strategic risks, and risks are increased when \ndeployed force levels spike or drop as our military strategy changes in \nthe political or security environment, such as was done for past \nelections or the recent surge.\n  Short-notice deployment accelerations and extensions are inherently \nrisky and complicate unit preparation and operations on the ground. \nRisks increase when we do not have sufficient ground forces overall to \naccomplish what we are asking them to do and still allow time for \nnondeployed units and individuals to fully recover from their last or \nprepare for their next deployment.\n  Multiple deployments with insufficient dwell time contribute to \nseveral problems among our troops: Insufficient dwell time increases \noperational risk as troops and units deploy without the time necessary \nto fully man, equip, and train before they leave their home station. \nInsufficient dwell time between rotations contributes to the retention \nproblems we are seeing, especially among midgrade officers and \nsergeants. Insufficient time between rotations creates higher rates of \nmental health issues among troops with multiple and extended \ndeployments. Insufficient dwell time puts much higher stress on our \nmilitary families, resulting in higher than normal levels of divorce or \nabuse.\n  Last January, the Secretary of Defense announced a new approach to \nunit rotation. Among our Active component forces, he wanted to \nimmediately achieve a minimum 1-to-1 deployed to at home or dwell time, \non the way to achieving a goal of 1-to-2 or greater dwell time. Our \nGuard and Reserve forces would deploy for no longer than 12 months from \nstart to finish, with a goal of no less than 5 years between \ndeployments.\n  Well, the Webb amendment reflects those policy goals. The Webb \namendment mandates that for each day deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, \nan Active-Duty servicemember will spend 1 day at home, and it mandates \nthat our Guard and Reserves get a minimum of 3 years between \ndeployments. It is essential that as we vote we understand that the \namendment provides waiver authorities to the President and service \nchiefs to ensure the flexibility to respond to any emergency the Nation \nmay face in the future, and those decisions are left to the President.\n  Mr. President, there is precedent for the Webb amendment. Congress \ntook action in 1999 to relieve some of the deployment burden our forces \nwere facing at that time and to drive the Department of Defense to a \nmore precise management system that would take better care of troops \nand their families. It is true that Congress has the power of the \npurse, but under that same Constitution, we also have the power to \nregulate the Armed Forces by law, and that is what the Webb amendment \nseeks to do.\n  Congress established in law an annual deployment threshold for Active \nand Reserve forces above which servicemembers are entitled to special \npay. We put that in law as part of our constitutional authority to \nregulate the Army and the Navy. The Secretary of Defense exercised his \nnational security waiver authority of that requirement right after 9/\n11. It is not unusual to\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\nhave a waiver authority in law. It is not unusual for the executive to \nuse that waiver authority, as they have done before.\n  Due to the deployment management standards of this earlier \nlegislation, the services have in place the systems necessary to plan \nand execute the requirements of this amendment, and so it has served \nits purpose, and this one will as well.\n  It is a very useful amendment. The Defense Department will have to \nmake earlier strategic and operational decisions, which will allow \ngreater precision in planning unit and individual rotations, and that \nwill result in greater predictability and stability for our troops and \ntheir families.\n  The Webb amendment promotes the health of our troops, ensuring time \nfor post-deployment evaluation and recovery. The Webb amendment also \npromotes readiness, ensuring that units and personnel have the time--\nthe most precious of resources--to man, equip, and train for any future \nmission.\n  I hope the Senate will adopt the Webb amendment. It will be a useful \ncontribution to the readiness and well-being of our Armed Forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, however the Senator from Michigan wants to \nhandle it--I have 12 minutes remaining. I wish to yield to the Senator \nfrom South Carolina for 5 minutes, the Senator from Georgia for 5 \nminutes, and I will take the remaining 2 minutes. If the Senator from \nMichigan or the Senator from Virginia wants to intervene between those \ntwo, that will be fine.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina and, following \nwhatever remarks on the other side, the Senator from Georgia for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as to the effect of this amendment, \nwhether it is good or bad, I am here to say I think it is a terrible \nidea. I don't think it is remotely a good idea. The intent of the \namendment is to take care of the troops. I don't question anybody's \nintent or motivation. If you want to take care of the troops, let them \nwin. What we are about to do with this amendment is something we have \nnever done in the history of this country. We are about to go down the \nroad where the Congress steps into military operations and creates \ncongressional mandates that will basically change the relationship \nbetween the commander--the executive branch--and the congressional \nbranch in a way that I think is very ill-suited to winning the next \nwar. It is a dangerous precedent to allow troop rotations to be \ngoverned by politicians who are looking for the next election.\n  Commanders do not get elected. They make decisions in the national \nsecurity interest apart from the next political election. The moment \nyou put politicians in the role of making troop deployments, then you \nare allowing the political moment to determine what the outcome of the \nwar will be. Not only is this constitutionally ill-advised and \nunfounded, politically it is a disaster in the making, to allow any \nCongress during any war to step in and say troops can only go here and \nthey can't go there, they have to stay home this much--it basically \ndestroys the ability of commanders in the field to get the resources \nthey need to fight and win the wars we send them to fight and win.\n  The easy way to do this, the right way to do it, is to stop the war. \nThe consequences of this amendment are devastating, in terms of a \nconstitutional relationship between the branches. It interjects \npolitics into military decisions in a way that will come back to haunt \nthis country. The effect of this amendment on the surge will be to kill \nit. Why don't you say you want to kill it? Why create a situation, \nthrough troop rotations, that will have the effect of making sure the \nsurge cannot go forward, because the ripple effect of this ever \nbecoming law would be to stop the surge at a time when the additional \ntroops do matter and are making a difference when it comes to defeating \nal-Qaida.\n  The waiver provision--the President of the United States is not going \nto begin to entertain this. No President would. No President could sit \non the sidelines and watch the authority of the Commander in Chief be \ntaken over by the political moment. The relationship this amendment \nwould create between future Commanders in Chief and the Congress and \nthe military is a dangerous precedent because it would allow the \npolitical moment to take over troop deployments. The needs of the war \nat the time would become no greater than the poll for the moment. We \ncannot win a war that way.\n  In World War II you were in for the duration--and it is tough. My \nLord, the troops need to be praised. They need to be paid more. They \nneed to have better benefits. Their families need more services. But \nthe last thing in the world we should do, in the name of helping them, \nis to put 535 people in charge of where they go and how they go--\nbecause we are not exactly visionary. I don't think we have risen to \nthe level in this Congress of being able to say we are visionary \nleaders for this country. I think what we have done is reinforced at \nevery turn that this is about the political moment.\n  Congress is at 20-something percent for a reason. What I can't \nunderstand is what the 20 percent see and like.\n  I ask my colleagues not to make a mistake for the ages. Not in the \nname of taking care of the troops should we fundamentally put politics \nin military decisions, as we have never done before. In the name of \nprotecting the troops we should not destroy a surge the troops are \ninvolved in that is beginning to defeat the most vicious enemy known to \nthe planet, al-Qaida. The effect of this amendment, regardless of its \nintent, is to destroy a strategy that we sent General Petraeus off to \nexecute, in a back-door way, and to fundamentally put politics in \ndecisions in a way that will haunt this country forever, so I urge a \nresounding ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Webb \namendment and urge my colleagues to vote against the cloture motion. \nThis amendment is about restricting the President and his military \nleaders' ability to prosecute a war that we have asked them to execute, \nand for which we unanimously confirmed General Petraeus to carry out. \nIt is an unwise and harmful effort to limit the ability of the \nPresident and his military leaders and handicap their use of personnel \nand resources available to them.\n  Senator Webb's amendment would preclude ``deployment'' of certain \nactive and reserve forces based on the number of days they have spent \nat home. Keep in mind these restrictions would apply to the Nation's \nmost experienced and capable troops during a time of war when we face \nan unpredictable and highly adaptive enemy.\n  Keep in mind that during World War II and other wars of this country, \nservicemembers participating in those wars deployed for 3 and 4 years \nwith little or no break. With this in mind the current proposal by \nSenator Webb seems out of step with history and what it has taken to \nwin the wars of this country. I can think of no way in which the Webb \namendment will help our Nation succeed in Iraq.\n  This amendment ignores the fact that we are at war and that \nartificial conditions imposed by Congress on the use of troops are not \nhelpful. Senator Webb is not alone in worrying about the effects of \nthis war on the readiness of the Armed Forces, on the soldiers and \nmarines and their loved ones, and on the ability of our all volunteer \nforce to continue to perform under this demanding schedule of \nrotations. Senator Webb's amendment, however, is not a solution to any \nof these problems. Senator Webb stated that his amendment ``does not \nmicromanage the military nor does it tie the hands of our operational \ncommanders in theater.'' The Pentagon disagrees. The Pentagon has said \nthat if the Webb amendment passes, operations and plans would need to \nbe significantly altered. Units or individuals without sufficient \n``dwell time'' would need a waiver to deploy based on threat. This \nwaiver process adds time, cost, and uncertainty to deployment planning.\n  In emergency situations the waiver process could affect the war fight \nitself by delaying forces needed in theater. Units would need to be \nselected for deployment based on dwell criteria that may in fact cause \nsignificant disruption to needed reset, planned transformation or unit \ntraining schedules.\n  And from the Joint Staff: For fiscal year 2008, four Army brigade \ncombat\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\nteams are projected to incur ``dwell violations;'' gaps in manning \nwould be seen in aviation, intelligence, engineer, medical and military \npolice; gaps would be seen in high demand units, specifically EOD, \nsecurity forces, forces supporting detainee operations, and mobility \naircrews. For individual members: ``anticipate high operational impact \ndue to breakdowns in unit cohesion and problems in filling individual \nshortfalls in tasked units.''\n  Public approval ratings for the President and for Congress may be at \nall time lows, but the admiration of the American people for our \nmilitary only gets higher. Why? Well, one reason is they take their \nresponsibilities seriously and they train, prepare, and plan to win. \nAnd we should let them win--not legislate a recipe for failure which \nthe amendment clearly does.\n  The power of the Congress under article 1 of the Constitution to \n``make rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval \nforces'' is well understood, as is the President's authority under \narticle 2 to command our military forces as Commander in Chief. This \namendment, however, is an unprecedented wartime attempt to limit the \nauthority of the President and the military leaders by declaring \nsubstantial numbers of troops and units ``unavailable.''\n  Putting aside all concerns about potential contingencies that might \narise, this amendment is unworkable and will make the task of \ngenerating cohesive units for rotations impossible. Here is the Joint \nStaff's bottom line on the Webb amendment: If a 1:1 dwell policy is \ncodified in law, eliminating the flexibility of the services to manage \nand mitigate exceptions to the dwell planning goals, future support to \nOIF/OEF may be severely impacted. Specifically, the requirement to \nprovide 15 months of dwell for Army units scheduled to execute \nforthcoming planned 15 month deployments will result in future \ncapability gaps in both OIF and OEF unless the force requirements are \nsimultaneously reduced to a substantial degree. The same will apply to \nMarine Corps units.\n  I am also concerned by the provision in the amendment that would \nallow individual members to ``volunteer'' to forego their ``dwell time \nto deployment'' ratio and seek a waiver from the Chief of Staff, CNO or \nCommandant of the Marine Corps to allow them to--voluntarily--return to \nthe combat zone. I don't think it could be more clear that this \nprovision in the amendment would undermine unit cohesion and readiness \nby encouraging debate in the ranks about when to deploy next. It would \npit one soldier against another, leaders against those led, and \nencourage the kind of ``cross leveling'' that has been called ``evil \nand corrosive'' by our Reserve and Guard leaders. This notion in \nthe amendment would introduce a whole new meaning to the concept of an \n``All Volunteer'' military force: volunteerism instead of duty. It \nwould drive wedges between soldiers and between marines, and could only \nhurt discipline and undermine the effectiveness of troops in the field.\n\n  I would like to take a step back and talk more generally about our \nongoing debate on Iraq and reflect on some of the dialogue that has \ntranspired over the past few days and weeks, both in this body and \nelsewhere. I am very concerned that so many of my colleagues, and \nobservers elsewhere, are declaring the President's change in strategy \nfor Iraq--which he embarked on this past January--a failure when all \nthe troops to implement that strategy have only been in Iraq for 3 \nweeks.\n  In my opinion, leaders--particularly in elected offices--should do \nwhat the word implies, and that is ``lead.'' It does not take a leader \nto follow opinion polls, which is what I am afraid that many of my \ncolleagues are doing.\n  Our commanders and ambassador do not believe that the war is lost. \nAsked whether the U.S. could win in Iraq and leave behind a stable \ngovernment, GEN David Petraeus said, ``If I didn't believe that I \nwouldn't be here.''\n  We have seen promising indicators since the President announced the \nnew strategy in January. While al-Qaida and other extremists have \nconducted a counter-surge resulting in numerous horrific mass-casualty \nterrorist attacks, and while it is too early to declare the surge a \nsuccess or failure, we have seen: A substantial drop in sectarian \nmurders in Baghdad since January; arms caches found at more than three \ntimes the rate of a year ago; attacks in Anbar at a 2-year low; total \ncar bombings and suicide attacks down in May and June; signs of \nnormalcy in Baghdad, like professional soccer leagues, amusement parks, \nand vibrant markets; recruiting for Iraqi police forces drawing \nthousands of candidates; young Sunnis signing up for the army and \npolice and more Shia rejecting militias.\n  Some believe that setting a timeline and pulling troops out of Iraq \nregardless of conditions on the ground would be a responsible end to \nthe conflict and/or would put needed pressure on Iraq's government. The \ncollective judgment of our intelligence community is that this would \nincrease, not decrease, the violence and hinder national \nreconciliation. In fact, a rapid withdrawal would almost certainly lead \nto a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict \nin Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have \nadverse consequences for national reconciliation.\n  Some have said that General Petraeus does not believe the U.S. \nmilitary can make a difference in Iraq. While General Petraeus has \nindeed said the ultimate solution to Iraq's problems is a political \none, he has consistently argued that such a solution can only come with \nthe improvements in security he is trying to achieve.\n  I was last in Iraq in early May and learned several things during my \ntrip that have convinced me that the President's plan deserves a chance \nto work and that a change in strategy now is the wrong course. For \nexample: There has been a significant reduction of sectarian murders \nand assassinations in Baghdad; attacks in Ramadi have eased by 74 \npercent in the past 3 months; there have been 263 weapons cache \ndiscoveries in the past 3 months, a 192 percent increase; over the past \n6 weeks, daily attacks in Ramadi have dropped from an average of 20-25 \na day to less then 3 per day. Last year, only two tribal areas were \nviewed as cooperative with U.S. forces and 17 were uncooperative. \nToday, all 23 tribal areas in Ramadi are cooperating with U.S. forces \nto fight al-Qaida militants. There are no uncooperative tribes. Iraqis \nare now volunteering by the thousands to join local police and army \nforces. At the end of March, there were over 1,200 army recruits in \njust 2 days.\n  Also from my trip to Iraq I learned that there are still issues that \nwe and the Iraqis need to work on and watch closely. There are several \npolitical issues the Iraqis need to address, including passing a \nhydrocarbon law, continuing reconciliation efforts, debaathification, \nand holding provincial elections. These are keys to political progress.\n  We need to work to emplace additional provisional reconstruction \nteams--PRTs--in Iraq to help with reconstruction.\n  However, the foundation for these political issues being resolved and \nfor the Iraqi Government continuing to mature and take responsibility \nis improved security throughout the country. That is the approach the \nPresident has taken, that General Petraeus is executing, and that is \nshowing signs of progress. We should not abandon it because we live in \nan impatient society that wants to see results before the President's \nstrategy is even fully implemented. We should stick with the plan, give \nit a chance to work, and listen to our military and civilian leaders \nwhen they report back on the strategies progress in the coming months.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Arizona wanted to \nhave 2 minutes. Does he want to take it now?\n  Mr. McCAIN. We retain the balance of time, Mr. President. I withhold \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He will take his time later.\n  Mr. WEBB. How much time does the Republican side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side only has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WEBB. I wish to reserve 2 minutes for our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I will notify the Senator when 2 minutes \nremains.\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, first I say I think there is a lot of \nmisunderstanding and misrepresentation that has been made over the past \ncouple of days with respect to this amendment.\n  Before I get into the amendment, I wish also to express, again, my \nadmiration for the Senator from Arizona--we have been friends for many \nyears--and my appreciation for his service. I watched his comments \nyesterday with respect to the end of the time in Southeast Asia. I \nthink he knows I still adamantly support what we attempted to do in \nVietnam and I have written about those days with some frequency and \nclarity over the years. In my view, this is not about the situation in \nSoutheast Asia.\n  I warned against what I believe is the strategic blundering of going \ninto Iraq in the first place, but I will set that aside today. There \nwas a lot of talk this morning and yesterday, some of it about \nprocess--the Senator from New Hampshire mentioning he wanted to see \nside by side, that he was going to oppose this amendment based on the \ncloture process itself.\n  The Senator from South Carolina--I want to address some of the things \nhe said. He keeps talking about the political moment here. I don't \nthink there is a political moment in this issue. There may be on other \nissues. I approach this issue from the perspective, among others, as \nsomeone who served 3 years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, where I \nwas responsible for dealing with mobilization issues and was required \nto learn with a great deal of detail what they used to call war maps. \nThose are manpower flow issues.\n  I also point out, because of the some of the other comments that were \njust made, that the Commandant of the Marine Corps, when he took \noffice, mentioned that his ultimate goal was to see a 2:1 rotational \ncycle with respect to deployment of marines. I point that out because \nthis amendment sets out a bare minimum floor for the use of American \ntroops of 1:1. If you have been gone a year, you should get a year \nback. If you have been gone 7 months, you should get 7 months back. If \nwe were arguing optimal scenarios, I would understand a little bit more \nthe pushback we are getting from the other side. We are not trying to \nput optimal historical scenarios on the table here. We are trying to \nget a bare minimum floor that will protect the well-being of our \ntroops.\n  We have data that has been shown--we don't need to go over it today--\nabout how this is affecting the retention of high-quality people, how \nit is affecting emotional difficulties people are having. We need to \nstep forward and act responsibly.\n  Some Republicans have questioned the constitutionality of this \namendment. There is no issue here. Article I section 8 says the \nCongress has the power to make rules for government and regulation of \nthe land and naval forces, and we have done so many times in the past. \nSome say this is meddling in the President's warmaking authority. To \nthe contrary, the Congress has the power and the duty to place proper \nrestraints on executive authority, particularly when it comes to the \nwell-being of our troops. We did that in Korea in 1951.\n\n  It was not, as the Senator from South Carolina might allege, meddling \nin the Korean war. It was a situation where the Department of Defense \nwas sending soldiers overseas before they had been fully trained. We \nstepped in, the Congress, our predecessors, stepped in. They put a law \ninto place saying you cannot deploy anybody until they have been in the \nmilitary at least 120 days. This is what we are doing, only on the \nother end of it.\n  We are saying: After 4 years of a ground occupation in Iraq, we have \na responsibility to get some stability into the operational tempo. \nYesterday my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, warned that the \namendment would, in his words, alter the traditional power of the \nPresident as it relates to all future wars, any war now, or series of \nwars in the future.\n  My friend, I hope, will reread my amendment carefully. He will find \nthat this amendment applies to Iraq, Afghanistan, and certain NATO-\nsponsored activities. Senator Sessions also stated his concerns, as he \nput it, that this is another amendment trying to set another strategy \nwritten by a group sitting in air-conditioned offices.\n  I would like to emphasize a few points. The first is, this amendment \ndoes not represent strategy. It is an amendment that protects the well-\nbeing of our troops by setting a bare minimum floor on how they are \nbeing used no matter what strategy is in place.\n  Second, the experiences that led some of us to this conclusion did \nnot come from sitting in air-conditioned offices. I would like to point \nout, as far as I can determine, Senator Chuck Hagel is the only ground \ncombat veteran on the other side of the aisle. He certainly is the only \nground combat veteran from Vietnam on the other side of the aisle. He \nis a lead cosponsor of this amendment.\n  On this side of the aisle, all the ground combat veterans are \ncosponsors, along with 35 Members of the Senate. I believe, if I may \nsay, we collectively understand a truth acquired the hard way and a \ntruth that transcends politics. We are trying in all good faith to do \nsomething about it.\n  Finally, I would like to point out, again, this amendment has the \nfull support of the Military Officers Association of America. This is \nthe largest association of military officers in the country, 368,000 \nmembers. And these are officers who are not restrained from speaking \ntheir opinions by having to serve inside today's political process.\n  VADM Norbert Ryan wrote a letter--I will quote one paragraph of it--a \nletter supporting the necessity of this amendment. He pointed out his \nassociation is very concerned that steps must be taken to protect our \nmost precious military asset, the All-Volunteer Force, from having to \nbear such a disproportionate share of national wartime sacrifice.\n  He also said, and I think this is vital to the decision we are making \non this amendment:\n\n       If we are not better stewards of our troops and their \n     families in the future than we have been in the recent past, \n     our organization believes strongly that we will be putting \n     the all-volunteer force at unacceptable risk.\n\n  These officers, 368,000, are joining us in a very real concern; that \nunder current policy many of our ground forces are actually spending \nmore time in Iraq than they are at home. This is 4 years into an \noccupation. There is not a strategic justification for this at this \npoint in our commitment in Iraq. And there is no political reason, in \nmy view, to oppose an amendment that places proper restraints on this \nsort of conduct by the executive branch.\n  This amendment recognizes that the Congress has a duty to exercise \nleadership when it comes to the well-being of our men and women in \nuniform. In the words of Admiral Ryan, it is a recognition that we have \na responsibility to become better stewards of our troops and their \nfamilies than we have been in the recent past.\n  I will say to my colleagues, as I did yesterday, the American people \nare watching us. They are watching us closely with the expectation that \nwe will finally take some sort of positive action that might stabilize \nthe operational environment in which our troops are being sent again \nand again.\n  They are tired of the posturing that is giving the Congress such a \nbad reputation. They are tired of the procedural strategies designed to \nprotect politicians from accountability and to protect this \nadministration from accountability. They are looking for concrete \naction that will protect the well-being of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  So the question in this amendment is not whether you support this war \nor whether you don't, it is not whether you want to wait until July or \nSeptember to see whether one particular set of opinions or benchmarks \nor summaries might be coming in. The question is, more than 4 years \ninto the ground operations in Iraq, that we owe stability and a \nreasonable cycle of deployment to the men and women who are carrying \nour Nation's burden. That is the question. That is the purpose of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 2 minutes, and the \nDemocratic side has 3 minutes 36 seconds.\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for the remaining \ntime.\n  Very briefly, I have made my comments about this amendment. America \nhas been engaged in other wars at other times, and we have not put time \nlimitations on the periods that they would be in rotation. I think it \nis clearly executive branch decisionmaking, which is clearly pointed \nout in the Constitution.\n  I just want to add, while my friend from Michigan is on the floor of \nthe Senate, we are probably not going to get cloture on this amendment. \nThen it will be a decision of the majority leader as to whether we go \nforward. If there is another amendment that will be brought up, I fully \nexpect to have the same right that has been extended to the minority \nover the 20 years that I have been here as a Member of Congress; that \nis, that I be allowed to propose an amendment from our side.\n  I have managed many bills on the Senate floor. I have never \nprevented--I have never prevented--an amendment from being proposed. I \nhope the Senator from Michigan will extend me that same courtesy.\n  By the way, we now are finding significant criticism about our \ninsistence on the 60 votes in side by sides, something that was a \nstandard procedure when the other side was in the minority. So history \nclearly indicates that is the way we have been doing business. Whether \nit is correct or not, and whether it causes gridlock is another \nsubject. But to criticize this side because we are insisting on the \nsame parliamentary procedures as were insisted upon by the other side \nwhen they were in the minority, it seems to me, is a bit inconsistent.\n  I hope I would be able to, if the Webb amendment is disposed of, \npropose an amendment from my side as has been the custom all of the \nyears that I have been here; otherwise, I think we may spend some time \nin a parliamentary situation. I am not ready to give up that right of \nthe minority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would just particularly like to, again, \nemphasize that there are no constitutional issues here. There is no \nissue of moving units around or micromanagement in the way that the \nSenator from South Carolina was alleging. This is a very simple \namendment, and I am ready to proceed to a vote.\n  I yield the floor\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, am I correct the leaders have reserved the \nfinal 20 minutes before the vote on cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Their time begins in 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is the Senator from Michigan correct that \nif cloture is not invoked, the pending amendment would remain the Webb \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me first respond to the question \nearlier in the day of my good friend, the majority whip, about whether \nvotes at the 60-vote level are somehow a new addition to debates of \nDefense authorization bills. Of course, the answer is emphatically no. \nThe question is, frankly, almost laughable. A quick review of the \nCongressional Record shows, contrary to Senator Durbin's assertion, the \nRepublican majority agreed to a 60-vote threshold on the Kennedy \namendment during last year's Defense authorization debate.\n  Indeed, the Kennedy amendment was part of a UC agreement that set up \nside-by-side votes on the Enzi and Kennedy amendments. Both, of course, \nwere given 60-vote thresholds, the same exact format that we offered on \nthe Webb and Graham amendments yesterday.\n  Senator Durbin said there was never a 60-vote threshold. He was \nwrong. What Republicans are asking for is not unprecedented. It is not \neven uncommon. It is there for the distinguished majority whip to \nreview online. But I certainly appreciate him asking the question.\n  We are just a couple of days into this debate. But a familiar and \ntroubling pattern is already beginning to emerge. We could have voted \non the Webb amendment yesterday. The Republicans were willing to move \nforward with votes on the side-by-side amendments. We said so at the \ntime. Yet the Democratic majority insisted on a cloture filing instead \nthat had no other effect than to simply slow things down. We are about \nto have that same vote with the same threshold and the same result that \nwe could have had yesterday, all for no apparent reason.\n  Two days into this debate, we are already heading down the same \nfruitless road we went down with the emergency supplemental bill when \nthe Democratic majority delayed the delivery of funds for our troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan for more than 3 months.\n  The bill we finally sent to the President's desk was guaranteed to \ndraw a veto, so the Democratic majority delayed it some more. In the \nend, they gave the President the bill he asked for. They wasted 3 \nmonths of the Senate's time fussing and fighting over the original \nrequest and then gave him what he wanted in the first place. It was a \ntotal and complete waste of time.\n  Now, here we go again. Two days into this debate, we are already \nwasting time on an amendment we know the President will veto. The Webb \namendment contains many good things that Republicans strongly support. \nBut it also limits the President's authority as Commander in Chief, and \ncombined with other objectionable provisions in this bill will provoke, \nof course, a veto.\n  The President vetoed the emergency supplemental because it carried \nrestrictions on his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. He \nwill do it on this bill too. We know that for a fact. No one here \ndisagrees with the idea that our forces should be rested, trained, and \nwell-equipped. Republicans showed yesterday that we are committed to \ngiving our soldiers and marines everything they need. That is why the \nunderlying bill begins the expansion of the Army and Marine Corps. That \nis why Republicans offered a side-by-side amendment yesterday that \nwould have given our men and women in the field all of these things \nwithout language that would draw a Presidential veto.\n  If the Democratic majority would have allowed us a vote on the Graham \namendment, we could have stood here today and told the troops that \nrest, training, and equipment are on the way. But, instead, we are \ngoing to dangle all of these things in front of them knowing they won't \nbe delivered. The Democratic majority is trying to force us to make a \nfalse choice between these two options, to pit the troops against their \nCommander in Chief. This is not just foolish, it is wrong. By putting \nlimits on the President's authority to control forces in the field, the \nWebb amendment also amounts to a back-door effort to hamstring the \nPetraeus plan. It is the first vote on a strategy that has not been \nfully manned for just about a month. Every Senator in this Chamber \nknows we will get a progress report on General Petraeus's strategy in \nSeptember, 2 months from now. We should wait for that assessment before \nrushing to judgment.\n  A Democratic-led Senate sent General Petraeus to Iraq, confirmed his \nnomination unanimously. He has a plan. He is executing it. We need to \nlet him do his work. Let me say again, the Webb amendment contains a \npolicy objective that Republicans enthusiastically share. What we do \nnot share is the belief that the President's constitutional powers as \nCommander in Chief should be eroded by politicians in Washington in a \ntime of war as this debate proceeds.\n  We will debate a number of amendments that seek to limit the \nPresident's authority and dictate operational plans for the war in \nIraq. I expect that at least some of them will seek to order an \nimmediate withdrawal of our combat forces. These amendments would \nprovide a direct way to end our involvement in Iraq, and the Senate \nwill consider them in due course. But the Webb amendment is\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\ndifferent. It would curtail the deployment of reinforcements to Iraq, \ndenying our military commanders the ability to sustain current force \nlevels in Iraq, especially in Anbar Province, where most agree there \nhas been considerable evidence of success. The Defense Department \nestablishes dwell times through policies that have been developed over \ntime by our commanders and leaders. Those leaders in turn respond to \nthe requests of commanders in the field. The waiver contained in the \nWebb amendment sets an unreasonably high bar.\n  Republicans, meanwhile, will insist on amendments that protect the \nNation's ability to defeat terrorists and wage war against al-Qaida. \nTherefore, I urge a ``no'' vote against the Webb amendment as it seeks \nto limit the President's authority as Commander in Chief and will deny \nour field commanders operational forces. I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Before yielding the floor, I wish to go back a minute to the 60-vote \nthreshold issue with which I began my remarks. The suggestion has been \nmade from the other side that somehow it is unusual to have a 60-vote \nthreshold. Let's take a look at some of the votes we have had on Iraq \nproposals this very year. We agreed to a 60-vote threshold on the Gregg \nand Murray amendments as side by sides which answered the all-important \nquestion of whether to fund the troops. We have had 60-vote thresholds \non vote No. 43, the Biden resolution; vote No. 44, the Levin \nresolution; vote No. 51, the Reid resolution; vote No. 74, the Reid \nresolution; vote No. 117, the supplemental funding bill; vote No. 167, \nthe Feingold amendment; vote No. 168, the Warner amendment; vote No. \n169, the Cochran amendment; and vote No. 171, the Reid amendment. On \nall of these controversial Iraq proposals, we didn't have a simple \nmajority threshold but a 60-vote threshold. So the notion that is being \nspun on the other side that this is somehow an unusual event is absurd \non its face. All you have to do is look at the record this year and, \nnot to mention, be reasonably alert to the way the Senate has operated. \nFor most of the time since I have been here, controversial measures, we \nknow, require 60 votes. Let me explain the reason for that.\n  Any one of the hundred Senators can object to a time agreement that \nwould allow a matter to be dealt with, with under 60 votes. That is an \noption frequently exercised in this body on both sides of the aisle. \nWhat we have done, as a practical matter in dealing with the Iraq \ndebates this year, is recognize the obvious, which is that it would be \ndifficult on these controversial measures for the leaders of either \nparty to produce an up-or-down vote. Therefore, we have simply agreed \nto have a 60-vote vote, and it considerably expedites consideration of \nmeasures and prevents having to file cloture, running the risk that if \ncloture is invoked, somebody will require that we use 30 more hours in \naddition to that. In short, there is a sensible way to move forward on \nthis bill. I hope we will adopt it later this afternoon and move on \nthrough with this very important measure for the defense of our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was in college a number of years ago. One \nof the things we studied was George Orwell's ``1984,'' which is a \nclassic. It is a classic because George Orwell points out a futuristic \nsociety as he sees it. One of the things that has become known as \nOrwellian thought is where someone says something and the opposite is \ntrue. That is what George Orwell's book was all about. What we have \nheard now from my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, is \nOrwellian. His words were: Democrats are slowing things down. I mean, \nif there were ever anything in the world that is Orwellian, referring \nback to the book ``1984,'' it is that Democrats are slowing things \ndown.\n  As a result of the envy of Republicans for losing the elections last \nNovember, they have done everything they can to slow this body down so \nwe would look bad. We have had to file cloture many times, 43 times. \nNever, ever in the past history of this country has that been done. I \nhave been in the minority, and I have held leadership positions in the \nminority. For years past, people picked their fights on relatively few \nissues where cloture would have to be filed. Not with the Republicans--\non everything we have done. They are filibustering things they support \nnow. So ladies and gentlemen of the jury, which is America, understand, \nwe have heard Orwellian speak here this morning: Democrats are slowing \nthings down.\n  Yesterday marked 6 months from the day that President Bush introduced \nhis temporary troop escalation plan to the American people. Six months \nago President Bush implicitly acknowledged the Iraq policy he had been \npursuing for nearly 4 years had failed. He asked the American people to \noverlook those 4 years of failure and trust his new plan to place tens \nof thousands of additional American troops in the middle of an \nintractable civil war, and it would bring about success. Six months \nago, nearly 4 years after taking us into a war based on deception and \nfalsification, including there being no weapons of mass destruction, \nthe President asked us for trust. Despite his failure to convince other \ncountries to share the burden of war with us, forcing our own brave \ntroops to shoulder the burden of war virtually alone, he asked us for \ntrust.\n\n  After nearly 4 years of strategic blunders and tragic mismanagement \nthat left our troops without either the equipment they needed or the \nstrategy for success they deserved, he asked us for trust. At a time \nwhen more than 3,000 American lives have already been lost, tens of \nthousands more wounded, and Iraq in flames, President Bush asked us for \nmore trust so he could put tens of thousands of additional American \ntroops in harm's way. Since then, 6 months, 600 more dead Americans, \nand $60 billion, that is where we are. Sectarian violence has not \ndiminished. Importantly, the Iraq Government has failed to take \nmeaningful steps to begin taking responsibility for its own country's \nfuture. Still, President Bush and his Republican allies ask us for more \npatience, more trust, more time.\n  They say that after more than 4 years of incompetence and \nmismanagement, they finally think they are entitled to more trust. I \ndon't think so. That is akin to a quarterback throwing three \ninterceptions--one, two, three interceptions--comes to the coach and \nsays: Coach, trust me. I am not going to change anything, but trust me. \nLeave me in the game.\n  There is no evidence that the escalation is working. They refer to \nAnbar Province, and there are some good things happening there, but \neverybody knows that the bubble is being squeezed and terrible things \nare happening in other places. They are no longer bombing police \nstations only and health clinics and markets. They are now destroying \nvillages. Three days ago they set off a 5-ton bomb and blew up a town. \nThe town is gone.\n  Conditions are deteriorating and more lives are being lost every day. \nThe days of trust have long since passed. Some would rather wait until \nSeptember before forcing the President to change course. If there were \nreal signs of progress or real reason for hope, that might make sense. \nIf the real costs being borne by our troops and their families were not \nso high, perhaps we could afford more patience and more trust. If we \nwait until September, more Americans will die, more Americans will be \nwounded; a third of the troops being wounded are wounded grievously; \nour treasure will be more depleted; and the Middle East will become \never more destabilized. Our efforts to focus on the real war on terror \nwill be impeded.\n  What do we have in the Middle East now? We have a civil war raging in \nLebanon. The Palestinians are fighting among themselves. There is civil \nwar. We have ignored Israel. We have Iran thumbing their nose at us and \na conflagration in Iraq.\n  If the real costs being borne by our troops and their families were \nnot so high, we could afford more patience and more trust. But the \ncosts are high. Waiting until September is not the answer. Holding out \nhope, blind hope, blind trust that progress will appear out of thin air \nfor reasons no one is able to articulate is not the answer. This \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill and the amendments that will \nbe offered to it are the next chance we have to chart a responsible new \ncourse\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\nout of Iraq. The American people demand the new course. Democrats \ndemand it. Republicans demand it. Independents demand it. They deserve \nit.\n  Our brave men and women in uniform also deserve it. They deserve more \nthan speeches expressing disapproval or dismay with the current course. \nOur votes, not our voices, will determine whether we heed the call for \na new course. Our votes, not our voices, will demonstrate whether we \nreject President Bush's failed policy. Our votes, not our voices, will \nprove whether our resolve is firm and whether we are prepared to lead.\n  We will work hard this week and next week to pass a Defense \nauthorization bill that reflects a resolve to pursue a responsible and \nbinding new policy. That is going to require Republican support. \nAlready we are seeing some Republicans speak out against the \nPresident's Iraq policy. We hope that they and other Republicans will \nput their words into action by not just saying the right things but \nvoting the right way. That can start today. We have an amendment before \nus that is critical for the strength of our military and the well-being \nof our troops. Regardless of where we stand on this ill-advised war, I \nwould hope we stand as one in our commitment to keeping our military \nthe strongest in the world. We should all agree we can't sustain that \nstrength if our men and women in uniform are not being given the \nprotection and care they need.\n  That is not a Democratic talking point or a Republican talking point. \nIt is common sense. That is why I rise to support the amendment offered \nby my friend and colleague, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, and \ncosponsored by dozens of others. It is also why I am so surprised the \nRepublican leadership has decided to block this amendment, and that is \nwhat they are doing. They are blocking the amendment, once again, to \nstand for obstruction and stand against progress. I fear it is a sign \nof what is to come from the minority party in the tough votes ahead.\n  In the Roll Call publication this morning, the Republican leader is \nquoted as saying there will be a 60-vote requirement on anything we do \non this bill.\n  Senator Webb's readiness amendment begins the critical and long \noverdue process of rebuilding our badly overburdened military. Who \nbetter to offer this amendment than the top two cosponsors: Senator Jim \nWebb of Virginia. I say to these young people who are pages, you are \nseeing on the Senate floor a real American hero, a Marine captain at \nage 23, a Naval Academy graduate about whom books have been written for \nhis heroism, two Bronze stars, a couple Purple Hearts, Silver Star, \nNavy Cross.\n  Chuck Hagel is the other cosponsor. One of the great stories I have \nheard in my life is a story of Chuck Hagel and his brother. You go to \nhis office and there is a picture of Chuck Hagel and his brother in \nVietnam, arm in arm, as soldiers. Chuck Hagel saved his brother's life \nin Vietnam.\n  These are the two cosponsors of this amendment. Do they know what it \nmeans to go to battle, do they know what it means to go to battle \nunprepared and unrested? Yes, they do.\n  Also, Senator Webb has another little niche I would like to talk \nabout, and that is his son Jimmy is also a Marine who just got back \nfrom fighting in Iraq. The Marine Jim Webb knows the consequences of \noverburdening the military and knows that ours is stretched nearly to \nthe breaking point. Senator Jim Webb knows the consequences of \noverburdening the military, and he knows that ours is stretched nearly \nto the breaking point. So does Chuck Hagel.\n\n  Here are a few signs--and there are many--of that burden: Among the \nArmy's 44 active combat brigades, all but one has served at least one \ntour in Afghanistan. Thirty-one of them have had two or more tours. \nAmong the National Guard and Reserves, more than 80 percent have been \ndeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, with an average of 18 months per \ndeployment.\n  This week, the Army announced that recruitment has fallen short by 15 \npercent for the second month in a row. The qualifications they are \nlooking for have been so written down. Now you do not have to graduate \nfrom high school. Now you can have committed crimes before joining the \nmilitary.\n  Last year, the active Army was 3,000 officers short, and that is only \nprojected to increase. So much of the equipment and supplies meant for \nGuard and Reserve use here at home has been sent to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and now only about 30 percent of essential equipment \nremains. That shortfall is costing an estimated $36 billion--just one \nof many hidden costs of this war.\n  We have all heard of the heavy personal costs this overburdening of \nthe military is causing: higher rates of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. Eighty percent of the married men and women coming home from \nIraq are divorcing.\n  Our troops are not machines. They are human beings. They are parents \nmissing Little League games, spouses missing anniversaries, children of \nmothers and fathers who wait and worry for their safety. These \nhonorable men and women wearing our uniform need and deserve time off \nfrom the trauma of war. War is trauma, and no war has been more \ntraumatic than this war, where there is a faceless enemy blowing up \nstreets.\n  Could we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senate will come to order. \nPlease take your conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. REID. These gallant men and women need time off from the trauma \nof war, as I said, to see their families and reconnect to their normal \nlives.\n  The Webb amendment is simple. It states if a member of the active \nmilitary is deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, they are entitled to the \nsame length of time back home before they can be redeployed.\n  It also states that members of the Reserves may not be redeployed \nwithin 3 years of their original deployment, which will not only give \nthem time to recover from deployment, but will restore our Reserve \nforces to respond to emergencies here at home.\n  Mr. President, I am going to use my leader time right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Anyone who watched the tornadoes in Kansas and other \nStates' emergencies knows how crucial a well-maintained and supported \nReserve force is to our domestic safety. Some have tried to confuse \nthis issue by calling it an infringement of Presidential authority. \nThis is not true. It is false.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution empowers Congress to ``make \nrules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.'' \nThat is in our Constitution. And this amendment provides ample \nPresidential waivers in the case of an emergency that threatens our \nnational security.\n  The Webb amendment sets a standard and binding policy, but it does \nnot tie the President's and Congress's hands to respond to an \nemergency.\n  If we are committed to building a military that is fully equipped and \nprepared to address the challenges we face throughout the world--and I \nknow we are--then we must support this amendment.\n  If we are committed to repaying in some small measure the sacrifices \nour brave troops are making every day--and I know we are--then we must \nsupport this amendment.\n  I am discouraged that the Republican leadership chose to block this \ntroop readiness amendment. If Republicans oppose troop readiness, they \nare entitled to vote against it. If Republicans do not believe our \ncourageous men and women in uniform deserve more rest, including mental \nhealth downtime, they can vote ``no'' on this amendment. If they do not \nagree that constant redeployments and recruiting shortages are \nstraining our Armed Forces, they can vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  But to block this amendment--to not even give it an up-or-down vote--\nshows that some of my Republican colleagues are protecting their \nPresident rather than protecting our troops. But just because some in \nthe minority party are choosing obstruction does not mean all \nRepublicans must follow in lockstep.\n  I think it should alarm everybody to read the New York Times \nnewspaper today. On the front page of the newspaper, it talks about \nwhat this administration does to people who they appoint to high-\nranking positions. This one was a Surgeon General of the United States. \nTo show how this administration is directing its employees\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\nto act--and I am afraid leaking over into the legislative branch of \nGovernment--listen to some of the things the Surgeon General was \ndirected to do.\n\n  Dr. Carmona said the administration ``would not allow him to speak or \nissue reports about stem cells, emergency contraception, sex education, \nor prison, mental and global health issues.''\n  ``Dr. Carmona said he was ordered''--now, listen to this one--``he \nwas ordered to mention President Bush three times on every page of his \nspeeches.'' Any time he gave a speech, he had to mention President \nBush's name three times or he could not give the speech.\n\n       . . . administration officials even discouraged him from \n     attending the Special Olympics because, he said, of that \n     charitable organization's long-time ties to a ``prominent \n     family''. . . .\n\n  Now, we know that President Kennedy's sister got this started many \nyears ago. He could not even attend the event.\n\n       ``I was specifically told by a senior person, `Why would \n     you want to help those people?' ''. . . .\n\n  We are Senators. We have the ability, by virtue of our constitutional \nduties, to have a say in what goes on in this country. We are separate \nand equal branches of Government. My Republican colleagues must speak \nout against what the administration is directing this Congress to do. \nWe need to stop protecting the President and start protecting our \ntroops. That is what this amendment is all about. And to think that \nthis administration is getting down into the weeds of things by saying \nhow many times you have to mention his name in a speech speaks volumes \nof what is going on here in the Senate.\n  I urge all my colleagues who believe we need a new course to support \nthis amendment, to vote for cloture. It is a crucial first step on the \npath toward a responsible end to this war.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Webb, et \n     al., amendment No. 2012, to H.R. 1585, Department of Defense \n     Authorization, 2008.\n         Jim Webb, Richard J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 2012, offered by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, \nshall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, our intention, after discussing this with \nthe ranking member, is that we will now set aside these amendments and \nthen the Republican side would designate another amendment that would \nthen be offered. We understand it relates to Iran. That is our \nintention.

If the Senator from Massachusetts is ready, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized and \nafterward the Senator from Connecticut be recognized--if that is the \nintent of the ranking member.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, perhaps the Senator from Connecticut could have his \namendment pending, and then the Senator from Massachusetts could speak \nin morning business. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, for planning \npurposes--and I know he is traditionally and characteristically brief--\nI wonder how long he might be.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. With the persuasion of my friend from Arizona, I expect \nto be 20 to 25 minutes. I am glad to do it at any time. I would like to \nspeak on the amendment that has been offered. I understand that \ngenerally the authors of the amendment are usually recognized first. I \nam prepared to wait my turn. I would like to talk for 20, 25 minutes \nafter that.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on support provided by the Government of \n           Iran for attacks against coalition forces in Iraq)\n\n       At the end of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. REPORT ON SUPPORT FROM IRAN FOR ATTACKS AGAINST \n                   COALITION FORCES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since January 19, 1984, the Secretary of State has \n     designated the Islamic Republic of Iran as a ``state sponsor \n     of terrorism,'' one of only five countries in the world at \n     present so designated.\n       (2) The Department of State, in its most recent ``Country \n     Reports on Terrorism,'' stated that ``Iran remained the most \n     active state sponsor of terrorism'' in 2006.\n       (3) The most recent Country Reports on Terrorism report \n     further stated, ``Iran continued [in 2006] to play a \n     destabilizing role in Iraq . . . Iran provided guidance and \n     training to select Iraqi Shia political groups, and weapons \n     and training to Shia militant groups to enable anti-Coalition \n     attacks. Iranian government forces have been responsible for \n     at least some of the increasing lethality of anti-Coalition \n     attacks by providing Shia militants with the capability to \n     build IEDs with explosively formed projectiles similar to \n     those developed by Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard was linked to armor-piercing explosives \n     that resulted in the deaths of Coalition Forces.''\n       (4) In an interview published on June 7, 2006, Zalmay \n     Khalilzad, then-United States ambassador to Iraq, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We can say \n     with certainty that they support groups that are attacking \n     coalition troops. These groups are using the same ammunition \n     to destroy armored vehicles that the Iranians are supplying \n     to Hezbollah in Lebanon. They pay money to Shiite militias \n     and they train some of the groups. We can't say whether \n     Teheran is supporting Al Qaeda, but we do know that Al Qaeda \n     people come here from Pakistan through Iran. And Ansar al \n     Sunna, a partner organization of Zarqawi's network, has a \n     base in northwest Iran.''\n       (5) On April 26, 2007, General David Petraeus, commander of \n     Multi-National Force-Iraq, said of Iranian support for \n     extremist activity in Iraq, ``The level of financing, the \n     level of training on Iranian soil, the level of equipping \n     some sophisticated technologies . . . even advice in some \n     cases, has been very, very substantial and very harmful.''\n       (6) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus also said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We know \n     that it goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is \n     the head of the Qods Force. . . . We believe that he works \n     directly for the supreme leader of the country.''\n       (7) On May 27, 2007, then-Major General William Caldwell, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, said, ``What we \n     do know is that the Iranian intelligence services, the Qods \n     Force, is in fact both training, equipping, and funding Shia \n     extremist groups . . . both in Iraq and also in Iran. . . . \n     We have in detention now people that we have captured that, \n     in fact, are Sunni extremist-related that have, in fact, \n     received both some funding and training from the Iranian \n     intelligence services, the Qods Force.''\n       (8) On February 27, 2007, in testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Lieutenant General Michael \n     Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We believe \n     Hezbollah is involved in the training as well.''\n       (9) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Kevin Bergner, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, stated, ``The \n     Iranian Qods Force is using Lebanese Hezbollah essentially as \n     a proxy, as a surrogate in Iraq.''\n       (10) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner detailed \n     the capture in southern Iraq by coalition forces of Ali Musa \n     Daqdaq, whom the United States military believes to be a 24-\n     year veteran of Lebanese Hezbollah involved in the training \n     of Iraqi extremists in Iraq and Iran.\n       (11) The Department of State designates Hezbollah a foreign \n     terrorist organization.\n       (12) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the Iranian Qods Force operates three camps near Teheran \n     where it trains Iraqi extremists in cooperation with Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, stating, ``The Qods Force, along with Hezbollah \n     instructors, train approximately 20 to 60 Iraqis at a time, \n     sending them back to Iraq organized into these special \n     groups. They are being taught how to use EPFs [explosively \n     formed penetrators], mortars, rockets, as well as \n     intelligence, sniper, and kidnapping operations.''\n       (13) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     Iraqi extremists receive between $750,000 and $3,000,000 \n     every month from Iranian sources.\n       (14) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     ``[o]ur intelligence reveals that senior leadership in Iran \n     is aware of this activity'' and that it would be ``hard to \n     imagine'' that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of \n     Iran, is unaware of it.\n       (15) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated, \n     ``There does not seem to be any follow-through on the \n     commitments that Iran has made to work with Iraq in \n     addressing the destabilizing security issues here in Iraq.''\n       (16) On February 11, 2007, the United States military held \n     a briefing in Baghdad at which its representatives stated \n     that at least 170 members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have been killed, and at least 620 wounded, by weapons tied \n     to Iran.\n       (17) On January 20, 2007, a sophisticated attack was \n     launched by insurgents at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center in Iraq, resulting in the murder of five \n     American soldiers, four of whom were first abducted.\n       (18) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus stated that the \n     so-called Qazali network was responsible for the attack on \n     the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center and that \n     ``there's no question that the Qazali network is directly \n     connected to the Iranian Qods force [and has] received money, \n     training, arms, ammunition, and at some points in time even \n     advice and assistance and direction''.\n       (19) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the United States Armed Forces possesses documentary evidence \n     that the Qods Force had developed detailed information on the \n     United States position at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center ``regarding our soldiers' activities, \n     shift changes, and defenses, and this information was shared \n     with the attackers''.\n       (20) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated of \n     the January 20 Karbala attackers, ``[They] could not have \n     conducted this complex operation without the support and \n     direction of the Qods Force.''\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable and \n     unacceptable act of hostility against the United States by \n     the foreign government in question; and\n       (2) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran must \n     take immediate action to end all training, arming, equipping, \n     funding, advising, and any other forms of support that it or \n     its agents are providing, and have provided, to Iraqi \n     militias and insurgents, who are contributing to the \n     destabilization of Iraq and are responsible for the murder of \n     members of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 60 days thereafter, the \n     Commander, Multi-National Forces Iraq and the United States \n     Ambassador to Iraq shall jointly submit to Congress a report \n     describing and assessing in detail--\n       (A) the external support or direction provided to anti-\n     coalition forces by the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran or its agents;\n       (B) the strategy and ambitions in Iraq of the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       (C) any counter-strategy or efforts by the United States \n     Government to counter the activities of agents of the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Iraq.\n       (2) Form.--Each report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     be in unclassified form, but may contain a classified annex.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senate resumes debate on Iraq, our \nheartfelt support and appreciation go to our troops in harm's way. All \nAmericans support our troops. They have fought bravely and continue to \ndo so under extraordinary circumstances. They have answered the call to \nservice. Many are on their third or fourth tour of duty in Iraq, \nseparated from their families and loved ones for years. They have borne \na great burden, and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.\n  History will write, however, that the President has repeatedly failed \nthem by failing to have a policy worthy of their sacrifice. The \nPresident failed our troops from the outset by sending them into this \nmisguided war without a plan to win the peace and by refusing to send \nsufficient troops to keep the peace.\n  Who can forget the words of GEN Eric Shinseki, who warned that \nAmerica would need several hundred thousand troops to secure Baghdad? \nWho can forget the way the administration shunted him aside, ignored \nhis advice, and allowed the looting and violence to spiral out of \ncontrol? The administration's insistence that a small rapid force could \nachieve regional change and maintain a stable Iraq was utterly wrong, \nand chaos took the place of peace.\n  The President also failed our troops by repeatedly sending them into \nbattle without proper equipment. Secretary Rumsfeld's callous comments \nthat ``stuff happens'' and his mindless assertion that you go to war \nwith the Army you have, not the Army you might want or wish to have at \na later time still ring loud and clear in this Chamber, a constant \nreminder of the failure of leadership at the highest levels of the \nPentagon.\n  The President failed our troops by relying for too long on a military \nsolution to politically inspired violence and failing to engage in \nsustained regional diplomacy. We have been behind the curve every step \nof the way rather than leading, reaching out, and working to find \nsolutions with Iraq's neighbors.\n  The President has also failed our returning troops home. Who can \nforget the horror we felt over the reports of our injured soldiers \nbeing housed in mold-infested rooms at Walter Reed Hospital? The \nservices and medical care our troops need and deserve have fallen far \nshort of meeting our responsibility.\n  We have given this President every opportunity. He has failed our \ntroops by clinging to an unworkable policy that delivers less and less \nfor our military and our mission in Iraq and stands no chance of \nsucceeding now, in September, or ever.\n  The best way to honor our troops is to bring America's involvement in \nthis misguided war to an end, not to pour more and more American lives \ninto the endless black hole of our failed policy in Iraq.\n  The American people know this war is wrong. Voting against it was the \nproudest vote of my entire career in the Senate. It is wrong to \nabdicate our responsibility by allowing this failed war to drag on and \non and allowing casualties to mount higher and higher. We don't need to \nwait until September to know that the surge will prove to be no better \nthan the surges and failed strategies that preceded it.\n  President Bush keeps trying to buy more time for his failed policy by \npromising yet again that hope and change is around the corner. But \nafter more than 4 years of such smoke and mirrors, Congress and the \nAmerican people have lost faith in the President's competence in \nmanaging the war.\n  The American people have heard these new pleas before from the \nPresident. The death of Saddam's sons was supposed to have quelled the \nviolence. It didn't. Capturing Saddam and bringing him to justice was \nsupposed to stop the violence. It didn't. Three elections and a new \nIraqi Constitution were supposed to have brought stability. They \ndidn't. At every critical step, the administration has promised calm, \nbut there is no calm. Our soldiers have constantly been faced with an \nincreasingly violent and lethal insurgency.\n  The promise of success around the corner through the surge is no \ndifferent. Initially, the administration told the American people the \nsurge would add 21,000 troops to Iraq, but they didn't reveal the fact \nthat there would be a wave after the surge, and we ended up sending \nnearly 30,000 troops.\n  In January, Secretary Gates said:\n\n       It's viewed as a temporary surge.\n\n  In February, Secretary Gates told the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee:\n\n       I think General Petraeus believes that we will have a \n     pretty good idea whether this surge and whether this strategy \n     is working, probably by early summer.\n\n  In April, Secretary Gates told us more time would be needed. He said:\n\n       I think it's been General Petraeus' view all along that . . \n     . some time, at some point during the summer, mid to late \n     summer, perhaps, he has thought that he would be in a \n     position to evaluate whether the plan was working so far.\n\n  In May, President Bush said even more time would be necessary. He \ntold us:\n\n       As General Petraeus has said, it will be at least the end \n     of the summer before we can assess the impact of this \n     operation. Congress ought to give General Petraeus' plan a \n     chance to work.\n\n  A week later, Secretary Gates said the administration would ``make \ntheir evaluation of the situation and the surge in September.''\n  Temporary surge, early summer, mid to late summer, at least the end \nof the summer, September--these are the administration's desperate \nefforts to hide its failure just a little longer. I have no doubt that \nin September the administration will ask for yet another chance, but \nthere are no more chances. Time is up. It is wrong to ask the American \npeople and our military to cling to the false hope that September will \nbring change. It is wrong to ask our troops to bear the brunt of a \nfailed policy. It is past the time to acknowledge that the \nadministration's policy has failed and adopt a new course now to begin \nto withdraw our troops from Iraq. The facts are clear.\n\n  President Bush argued that the surge would bring security, create an \nopportunity for political reconciliation, and enable reconstruction to \nmake progress. When he announced the surge last January, the President \nsaid:\n\n       America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry \n     out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring \n     security to the people of Baghdad.\n\n  Yet, more than 6 months later, the violence continues unabated in \nBaghdad.\n  The Pentagon's own June report on Iraq, which covered the months of \nFebruary through May, stated:\n\n       Violence against coalition and Iraqi security forces \n     remained consistent with previous levels.\n\n  Unidentified bodies continue to be found in Baghdad at an alarming \nrate. Press reports say that in April, 411 unidentified bodies were \nfound. In May, 726 bodies were found. In the first 6 days of June \nalone, 167 bodies were found. Many showed signs of torture and \nexecution. Some have been beheaded. U.S. casualties have also increased \nin Baghdad during the surge. Our troop losses in Baghdad this year\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\nhave more than doubled over the same period as last year. The number of \nAmericans killed in Baghdad from January through June in 2006 was 96, \nbut the number from January through June of 2007 was 250--2\\1/2\\ times \nhigher.\n  The presence of additional U.S. troops in Baghdad has also resulted \nin the spread of violence outside the city. The Pentagon's June report \nconfirmed this trend. It said:\n\n       Many insurgents and extremists have moved operations to \n     Diyala, Ninewa, and the outlying areas of Baghdad Province . \n     . .\n\n  American soldiers are bearing the brunt of the violence, and they \nunderstand this trend as well. From January through June of this year, \nwe lost 86 troops in Diyala--more than four times the number of troops \nkilled there in all of 2006.\n  Attacks against Iraqi civilians are spreading across the country as \nwell. According to the Associated Press, nearly 1,900 Iraqis have been \nkilled in suicide attacks in 2007 and more than 4,400 have been \nwounded.\n  Our troops continue to be attacked and killed at a higher rate than \never across Iraq. Every month in 2007, American casualties have been \nhigher than the same month in 2006. In January of this year, 83 of our \nsoldiers were killed, compared to 62 the same month a year ago. In \nFebruary of this year, 80 of our soldiers were killed, compared to 55 \nin the same month a year ago. In March of this year, we lost 81 of our \nsoldiers, compared to 31 in March a year ago. In April of this year, \n104 of our soldiers were killed, compared to 76 in the same month a \nyear ago. In May of this year, 126 of our soldiers were killed, \ncompared to 69 in the same month a year ago. In June of this year, 100 \nof our soldiers were killed, compared to 61 in the same month a year \nago.\n  We don't need to wait until September to conclude that the surge has \nled to greater violence, not less, and that the time has come to bring \nour troops home.\n  Political progress has been nonexistent. In announcing the surge in \nJanuary, President Bush told the American people that it would \nfacilitate reconciliation. He said:\n\n       Most of Iraq's Sunni and Shia want to live together in \n     peace--and reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make \n     reconciliation possible.\n\n  In fact, it has not happened.\n  In December 2006, the Iraq Study Group outlined a list of commitments \nmade by the Iraqi Government and stated that by the end of 2006 or \nearly 2007, Iraqis would need to approve a provincial election law, set \nan election date, approve a petroleum law, approve a debaathification \nlaw, and approve a militia law. In fact, none of the dates have been \nmet and none of the crucial Iraqi legislation so essential to \nreconciliation has been approved.\n  The Pentagon's report in June made this point bluntly. It said:\n\n       Key legislative or reconciliation actions--such as the \n     Hydrocarbon Law, de-Ba'athification reform, and Article 140 \n     (Kirkuk)--were not completed during this reporting period.\n\n  The Pentagon's June report also addressed the problem more generally. \nIt said:\n\n       Reconciliation remains a serious unfulfilled objective.\n\n  It said:\n\n       Mass-casualty attacks on Shi'a targets and the April 2, \n2007 attack on the Council of Representatives have made the Shi'a wary \nof reconciliation.\n\n  It said:\n\n       There is also significant evidence of violence against \n     Sunni Arabs, sometimes involving government security forces, \n     that undermines reconciliation efforts.\n\n  It said:\n\n       Public perceptions of violence have adversely affected \n     reconciliation.\n\n  As long as the commitment of our troops continues to be open ended, \nthere is unlikely to be progress on reconciliation. It won't be until \nthe Iraqis know our troops will not fight their civil war indefinitely \nthat they will begin to make the hard political choices necessary to \nachieve reconciliation.\n  Importantly, the surge has not even been able to deliver on the \nPresident's goal of enabling reconstruction to go forward and fulfill \nits promise of a better standard of living for the Iraqi people.\n  On the fundamental issue of providing basic services for the Iraqi \npeople, the Pentagon report in June said:\n\n       The Iraqi government has made little progress.\n\n  Despite the billions and billions of dollars our Government has spent \non reconstruction, the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction found that Iraq is still plagued by power outages, \ninadequate oil production, and shortages of clean water and health \ncare. Electricity levels in Baghdad are half of what they were before \nthe invasion. At the Baghdad International Airport, almost $12 million \nwas spent on electrical generators, but more than half the money \ninvested has been wasted.\n  Problems with reconstruction are not limited to Baghdad. Of eight \nreconstruction projects that the United States had declared a success 6 \nmonths to a year earlier, the special inspector general found that \nseven of them were no longer operating as designed because of plumbing \nand electrical failures, lack of proper maintenance, or apparent \nlooting. Of the 142 primary health care clinics planned for Iraq, only \n15 have been built, and of those 15, only 8 are open to the public. Mr. \nPresident, 800 schools have been built and thousands of teachers have \nbeen trained, but less than a third of the Iraqi students attend class.\n  No one in this administration can tell the American people in good \nfaith and good conscience that we are making progress in Iraq. Bringing \nthis war to an end will not destroy the administration's policy. The \npolicy has already self-destructed. Nothing good will come of staying \non the same perilous failed course.\n  Iraq is sliding deeper and deeper into civil war. Instead of solving \nthe problem, the open-ended presence of our military is only making it \nworse.\n  The choice is clear: Do we continue to put our trust in those who \nhave led us astray, or do we end this failed policy and begin a new \ncourse in Iraq?\n  Finally, the cost in precious American lives for this failed mission \nis reason enough to end this mistaken and misguided war. But the costs \nhere at home hit us again this week when our Congressional Research \nService raised the estimate of what we are spending in Iraq from $8 \nbillion to $10 billion a month. With the passage of this latest Defense \nspending bill, we will have spent $450 billion on the war.\n  We know where this money comes from. It comes from America's \nfamilies, and it means that urgent domestic priorities at home are \ngoing unmet because they are starved of funds.\n  We know we must deal with the soaring cost of health care and finding \na way to cover the millions of Americans who have no health insurance \nat all. This festering crisis is a major worry for families across \nAmerica, and we owe it to our people to address it.\n  Six million uninsured children in America should be enrolled in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, but there is not enough money to \ndo that. For the cost of 6 weeks in Iraq, we could cover every one of \nthese children.\n  For less than the cost of 1 month in Iraq, we could double the budget \nfor the Centers for Disease Control to keep American families safe from \nbioterrorism and other deadly epidemics.\n  For the cost of 2 weeks in Iraq, we could double the funding for the \nNational Cancer Institute, which is vital to finding a cure for that \ndeadly disease.\n  For the cost of 1 day in Iraq, we could double the ability of the \nFood and Drug Administration to protect Americans from unsafe foods by \nincreasing inspections, upgrading facilities, and hiring more safety \npersonnel. For less than the cost of a day in Iraq, we could allow a \nmillion uninsured Americans to be served by community health centers.\n\n  In education, the price of Iraq is also very high. Each year, \n400,000--400,000--high school graduates do not go to 4-year colleges \nbecause they cannot afford it. For the cost of less than a week in \nIraq, every one of those students--every one--could receive the \nassistance they need to go to college.\n  We know that early education programs, such as Head Start, make an \nenormous difference to a child's future. But Head Start now serves only \nhalf of the millions of children who are eligible for the program. For \nthe cost of 3 weeks in Iraq, we could serve every eligible child and \nfamily in the Nation.\n  The administration has failed to fund the No Child Left Behind Act by \n$56\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\nbillion since its enactment in 2002. For the cost of less than 6 months \nin Iraq, we could make our public schools whole by providing all the \nfunding they have been denied over the past 5 years. For the cost of \nonly 49 days in Iraq, we could fully fund this important program for \nevery public school in this country.\n  The war in Iraq is also denying urgently needed resources for the \nfirst responders and emergency personnel who are keeping us safe at \nhome in all 50 States. For the cost of 1 month in Iraq we could provide \n3 million portable radios to our first responders, enabling them to \ncommunicate during a natural disaster or terrorist attack. We could \nprovide our heroic firefighters with 12 million additional units of \nbreathing gear or 40,000 new firefighting vehicles.\n  The list goes on and on and on. Countless high-priority items at home \nmust go underfunded or unfunded because the war in Iraq is draining \nvast amounts of resources. In the days ahead, the Senate will debate \nthese all important issues. For the sake of our men and women in \nuniform, for the sake of our values and our ideals, we must adopt a new \ncourse and bring our troops home to the heroes welcome they have so \nclearly earned and get about the business of putting America back on \ntrack.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2073\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, a short while ago, I called up \namendment No. 2073, which would require a report on support provided by \nthe Government of Iran for attacks against coalition forces, American \nforces, in Iraq.\n  I am going to speak about this now at some length, but let me say at \nthe beginning that I offered this amendment in the hope that it will \nbring forth a strong, unified statement by the Senate that we have \nnoted the evidence presented by our military of the involvement of the \nIranian forces in the training and equipping of Iraqi terrorists, who \nhave then gone back to Iraq and are responsible for the murder of \nhundreds of American soldiers there, and, I would say, thousands of \nIraqi soldiers and civilians as well. So in the midst of the \ncontroversy that exists in our country, and as reflected in the Senate \nover the war in Iraq in general, I am hopeful this amendment will offer \nan opportunity for us to come together to accept the evidence our \nmilitary has given us of Iran's involvement in the murder of hundreds \nof American soldiers and together to stand and say to the Iranians that \nthis must stop. Here is the evidence. We know what you are doing. This \nmust stop.\n\n  Then, in an operational clause of the resolution, to ask, finally, \nwithin 30 days after enactment of the act and every 60 days thereafter, \nthe commander of multinational forces in Iraq and the U.S. Ambassador \nto Iraq shall jointly submit to Congress a report describing and \nassessing in detail external support or direction provided to \nanticoalition forces by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \nor its agents.\n  There are some other points in that which I will get to in a minute.\n  Whether you are pro-war in Iraq or antiwar in Iraq, whether you think \nwe ought to mandate a withdrawal of some or all of our troops or you \ndisagree with that, it seems to me every Member of this Chamber ought \nto come together around the evidence that our military has provided of \nwhat the Iranians are doing to kill our soldiers and to tell them we \nknow it and we want them to stop it.\n  Yesterday I came to the floor to speak at the beginning of the debate \nabout what I thought was involved. I quoted our colleague and friend \nfrom Indiana, Senator Lugar, who made a very thoughtful speech with \nwhich I agree in large part, disagree with in small part. I cited with \nappreciation Senator Lugar's statement in his remarks. Again, \nobviously, we all know Senator Lugar is a skeptic when it comes to the \nstrategy we are following in Iraq or the course that it has taken or \nthe concern about the political timetable here in Washington. We are \nnot talking about that, but to acknowledge for the record that I know \nSenator Lugar is skeptical about where we are now. Nevertheless, he had \na very strong statement in that speech he made here on the Senate floor \nwith which I agree totally in which he outlined the national security \ninterests of the United States in how the war in Iraq ends. One of them \nwas to prevent Iran from dominating parts of Iraq. Another was to \npreserve our credibility in the region, in the Middle East, the \ncredibility that has been so important in attempting over decades, now, \nto maintain some minimal level of stability in the Middle East--clearly \na region of the world that is important to us in many ways. In the most \ndirect way, unfortunately, because of our failure to adopt an \nindependent energy policy, we continue to depend too much on oil and \ngas that comes from the Middle East so we have an interest in keeping \nit stable. Obviously we have tremendous spiritual ties to the Middle \nEast as well as more broadly political and economic ties.\n  I mention this because Senator Lugar did talk about Iran and the \nimportance of maintaining American credibility in the region. To me, \nnothing illustrates the stakes here and the larger conflict we are \ndealing with in the Middle East more clearly than the deadly and \ndestabilizing role that is being played today by the Government of the \nIslamic Republic of Iran and its agents in Iraq.\n  The fact is that for months and months now, our military commanders \nand diplomats have been telling us about a proxy war the Iranians have \nbeen waging against our soldiers, other coalition forces, and our \nallies in Iraq. GEN David Petraeus, the commander of multinational \nforces, and others, have spoken bluntly and publicly and I would say \nrepeatedly about how the Iranian Quds Force, an elite unit of the \nIranian Guard Force, has been training, arming, funding, equipping, and \ndirecting the extremists in Iraq, terrorists who then go back into Iraq \nand attack our troops. This past February, senior military officials of \nours in Baghdad described forensic evidence that implicated Iran at \nthat time in the deaths of at least 170 American servicemembers, and \none may assume that the number has gone up significantly since then. \nThat is 170 American servicemembers killed as a result of the \ninvolvement of Iran through Iraqi terrorist allies in Iraq; lost lives \nof Americans as a result of what Iran and its proxies are doing.\n  Last week, the United States military spokesman for the Multi-\nNational Force Iraq, BG Kevin Bergner, presented new and I think \nstunning details about Iran's complicity in deadly attacks against our \nservicemembers. I present this resolution to say to our military, at \nthe beginning: We hear you, but also say to the Iranians: We see what \nyou are doing and we are simply not going to accept it.\n  The fact is, the previous warnings that have been given, and \ndisclosures given by our military about Iranian involvement in Iraq, in \nsome sense have drifted up into the media air which is so cluttered \nwith so much else from the Middle East, from Iraq--so much controversy \nthat it seems to not have settled into the collective consciousness of \nMembers of Congress, let alone the American people, about what Iran is \ndoing to our soldiers, our sons and daughters, our husbands and wives, \nour friends, our neighbors.\n  It is time for the Senate to say to Iran: We know what you are doing. \nIt is time for you to stop it.\n  Last Monday, according to General Bergner--he made the statement last \nMonday--he said Iran has been using its territory--this is more \nspecific than has ever been said publicly by the American military \nbefore--Iran has been using its territory to train and organize Iraqi \nterrorists who then go back and kill Americans in Iraq.\n\n  General Bergner said groups of up to 60 Iraqi militants at a time \nhave been taken to three training camps near Tehran--again, more \nspecific information than ever has come out before publicly--three \ntraining camps operated by the Quds Force near Tehran, where these \nextremists from Iraq have received instruction in the use of mortars, \nrockets, improvised explosive devices, bombs used by suicide bombers, \nor those set off in sophisticated ways from a distance, and other \ndeadly tools\n\n[[Page S8985]]\n\nof warfare that they then use against our troops in Iraq.\n  Iran is also, General Bergner pointed out--and this I thought was \nstunning and should not be allowed to fade after a day's news cycle \naway--Iran is using the Lebanese Islamist terrorist group Hezbollah as \na surrogate to help build up its terrorist allies in Iraq. That is what \nGeneral Bergner, our general, our spokesperson in Baghdad, said. So \nthey are bringing their Hezbollah terrorist clients from Lebanon, which \nis threatening and fighting the established Seniora Government in \nBeirut, which is our ally, a moderate government, an ally of ours--the \nIranians are bringing Hezbollah from Lebanon to Iraq and Iran, to train \nIraqis to kill Americans and Iraqis. We know this in part, General \nBergner made clear, because our forces have captured one of the \nHezbollah leaders, Ali Moussa Dakdouk, inside Iraq. He was captured, a \nLebanese Hezbollah Islamist terrorist leader captured inside Iraq. \nDocuments were recovered attendant to that, that detailed the \nrelationship between the Iranian regime and the extremist groups that \nthey are sponsoring in Iraq. So said BG Kevin Bergner, spokesperson for \nour forces in Iraq.\n  General Bergner also reported last Monday that the U.S. military has \nconcluded that the senior leadership--that is a quote, ``the senior \nleadership''--in Iran is aware of the activities of the Quds Force in \nsponsoring attacks against our soldiers in Iraq and that, in his words, \nit is ``hard to imagine'' that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah \nAli Khamenei, does not know of them.\n  These are very serious statements, very serious charges by a \nrespected and authoritative spokesperson for the U.S. military.\n  Those who follow the complicated inner world of Iranian Government \nknow, to the best of our ability to follow it, that this elite \nmilitary/terrorist group, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC, \nand the Quds Force that is part of it--their leadership is selected and \nreports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, \nnot to President Ahmadinejad.\n  So there is plenty of basis in the evidence that we have, in the \ninvolvement of the Quds Force and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps, which we know reports to the Supreme Leader of Iran, that the \nSupreme Leader of Iran knows what they are doing and presumably has \napproved it. If he didn't know what they were doing, he certainly does \nnow because the American military has been telling the world. They are \nprobably wondering whether anybody has been listening, for months and \nmonths now, that this is exactly what Iran has been doing.\n  It goes without saying, but I want to say it, that no one in this \nChamber is looking for a fight with Iran. But that does nothing to \nalter the fact that Iran has, through its proxies, initiated a fight \nagainst us. That is a reality we no longer have the luxury of ignoring. \nIt is a reality we must confront in the defense of the men and women \nwho wear the uniform, the proud uniform of the United States of America \nin battle in Iraq today. Iran's actions in Iraq fit squarely within a \nlarger pattern of expansionist, extremist behavior by the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran in the Middle East over all the years, more than a \nquarter of a century now, since 1979 when the revolution occurred in \nIran, when the American Embassy was seized, when the hostages were held \nin an outrageous act for more than a year.\n  We know the Iranian Government has used radical Islamist groups \nthroughout the years since then as its regional proxies. We know these \nproxies have been dispatched to attack and murder American soldiers and \ncitizens in the past.\n  What am I speaking of? I am speaking of the Marine Corps barracks \nbombing in Beirut in 1983, 24 years ago, which killed 241, I believe, \nAmerican marines. All the evidence that was gathered after that to me \nmakes a compelling case that that attack was carried out by Hezbollah, \nwhich is sponsored, supported, equipped, trained, directed by Iran.\n  Then there was the Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia in 1996, \nwhere American military and other personnel lived. Again, American \nblood on the hands of Iran from all the evidence that I have seen about \nthe cause of that attack, the perpetrators being agents of the Iranian \nGovernment.\n  We know these proxies who have worked aggressively and consistently \non behalf of the extremist regime in Tehran to undermine moderate \ngovernments in the region, to extend Iranian influence. It is happening \nnow in a way that seems to me to be more concerted, more aggressive \nthan ever before. You can pick your reason for it. You can say the \nSupreme Leader Khamenei, President Ahmadi-Nejad, fanatics, anti-\nAmericans shouting, urging their followers by the thousands to shout: \nDeath to America. Death to America. They have been doing that since \n1979, continue to do it. You can't take it as a meaningless chant. We \nhave to take extremists at their word because we have seen too often in \nour history, most recently with all that Osama bin Laden was telling us \nhe would do to us in the 1990s, that in fact he did it, most tragically \non 9/11.\n  But some would say that this move throughout the region by Iran is to \ntake the mind of the unhappy Iranian majority off the failure of the \nAhmadi-Nejad Government to help make the economy go. Others would say \nthat this is the moment when the Iranians think that American and other \npowers who have kept the balance and stability in the region will not \nrespond to their aggression. Whatever. We have to open our eyes and see \nwhat is happening in the Middle East today. In addition to sponsoring \nattacks on Americans and Iraqis in Iraq, Tehran is also training, \nfunding, and equipping radical terrorist groups that are working to \ndestabilize Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and Afghanistan. \nAfghanistan is a fascinating example because there they are now, by all \nthe evidence our military has, the U.S. military, Iran is now \nsupporting the Taliban, which historically has been its enemy. The \nTaliban now, according to what our military tells us, appears to be \nreceiving Iranian weapons in their ongoing war against the Government \nof President Hamid Karzai, our ally, the hope for a new Afghanistan, \nand the American and NATO forces there.\n  In fact, in one sense, it makes perfect sense that Iran is using \nHezbollah to aid extremists in Iraq. The fact is, each of the seemingly \nseparate conflicts I have described in the Middle East has a \nconnection. They are part of a larger regional war that we are involved \nin, but so are so many of our allies in the region. Israel, obviously; \nbut also broadly in the Arab world. If you have been to the Middle \nEast, as I have recently, within a month, you find the level of \nanxiety--beyond concern, anxiety--in the Arab world among our allies \nabout the movements and intentions of Iran is palpable.\n  The fear, of course, is that Iran is moving to establish itself as \nthe dominant power in the region and to establish its own brand of \nIslamist extremism as the dominant ideology-theology in the region. In \nsome sense, this is an undeclared war, but it is nonetheless very real. \nThis is a fight the Iranians want to wage in the shadows, I suppose so \nthey can escape some responsibility for blood on their hands. But it is \nalso evident, as the American military and Governments of Lebanon and \nAfghanistan and Palestinian Authority have themselves made clear.\n  In debating this bill, which is the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, our first and foremost responsibility--in fact, it \nexpresses itself so many ways in the language of this bill, which was \nunanimously reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nwhich I am honored to be a member--our first and foremost \nresponsibility is to protect our national security and to protect our \ntroops who are protecting our national security.\n  If we do not respond to the evidence that has been presented to us \nabout the acts of the Iranian Government and their agents, I fear--I \nconclude--we will have failed on both counts. Our troops are being \nattacked and killed by the agents of Iran. The very least that we in \nthis Chamber can do is to send a clear and unmistakable message to the \nGovernment in Iran that we know what you are doing and we insist that \nyou stop.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment today to the Defense \nAuthorization Act. I hope my colleagues will see it as a commonsense, \ncommon-ground amendment that confronts the Government of the Islamic \nRepublic of\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\nIran with the evidence of its attacks on American soldiers in Iraq.\n  The amendment details the evidence already in the public record that \nhas been put forward over the past year by General Petraeus and other \nsenior U.S. officials about Iran's involvement in violence and \ndestabilizing activities in Iraq.\n  I repeat what I said at the outset. Whether you are for or against \nthe war in Iraq, whether you are for or against an amendment mandating \na deadline or a timeline for withdrawing our troops, I hope we all can \nfind common ground in making this statement, that we see the evidence \nof Iran's complicity in the deaths of American soldiers and we insist \nthey stop. This amendment is not a call for war against Iran. I--as do \nall the Members of this Chamber, I am sure--always favor diplomacy \nfirst.\n  But this is a call to defend our troops and our vital interests which \nare under attack by Iran. It is a call for all of us to wake up to the \noutrageous actions that are being undertaken by the extremist \nGovernment in Tehran. It is important that we no longer deceive \nourselves. If Iran can get away with the murder of American soldiers \nand pay no price, it will do it again and again and again. We cannot \nallow Iran to have a license to wantonly and deliberately murder our \ntroops.\n\n  For if we sit silently by while this is happening, they will continue \nto take actions that are hostile to us, and the chances of us achieving \nwhat I think everybody in this Chamber would want us to achieve, which \nis to stop the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons, will simply be \nimpossible.\n  The choice we face with Iran is not a choice between war and peace, \nit is at this moment a choice between turning a blind eye to the murder \nof our troops and confronting those who are murdering them. It is a \nchoice between sending a message of determination and deterrence, which \nhopefully will end this action by the Iranians and sending a message of \nweakness and appeasement.\n  Just as our men and women in uniform are serving in Iraq to protect \nand defend all of us, they respond to what their Nation asks them to \ndo, so too do we in this Chamber have a responsibility that I know we \nall acknowledge. It comes out of this Department of Defense \nauthorization bill loudly and clearly. We accept our responsibility to \ndo everything in our power to defend the men and women in uniform who \nserve us.\n  Support our troops I know is not just a bumper sticker, it is a \nsolemn pledge of this Government, and everyone who serves it, including \nthose of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate.\n  I hope this resolution can form the foundation for a larger, longer \nconversation that we in Congress need to have about the struggle we are \nin with Iran regionally, the threat its Government possesses to the \nsecurity not just of our soldiers whom I have talked about but to our \nallies in that region whom I have talked about, and, ultimately, I fear \nto our country, the United States of America, and the way our policy \nmust take account of that reality.\n  The threat posed by Iran to our soldiers' lives, our security as a \nnation and our allies in the Middle East is a truth that cannot be \nwished or waved away, it must be confronted. This amendment gives the \nSenate the opportunity to do that. So let us then with one voice tell \nthe fanatical, anti-American leaders of the Government in Tehran, who I \nbelieve do not represent the majority of the Iranian people, that they \ncannot attack our troops without consequence. Let us with one voice \ntell our brave soldiers in Iraq, that Iran's assault on them will not \ngo unnoticed or unanswered by this Senate. The regime in Iran, I fear, \nis betting that our political disunity about Iraq will constrain us in \nresponding to its attacks. I do not believe that.\n  For the sake of our Nation's security, for the sake of our soldiers, \nwe must--and I am confident will--prove them wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from \nConnecticut for his amendment. There is an awfully important message \nthat is in that amendment about the threatening activities of Iranians \nagainst us in a number of parts of the world but more specifically in \nIraq. This amendment is intended to capture some of the problems which \nare created by those activities of Iranians in Iraq particularly.\n  What we are trying to work out with the Senator from Connecticut, and \nagain I commend him on his initiative, I think it is a very important \none and I think it is possible the Senate can speak with one voice and \nwe should speak with one voice on this issue.\n  There are language modifications which we are suggesting and which I \nhave already had a chance to talk to my good friend from Connecticut \nabout. I think if we either can have a brief quorum call or if anybody \nelse who is here wishes to address the Senate on this or other \nsubjects, they could be recognized at this point. But in the absence of \nthat if I note----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to respond to my friend from \nMichigan, to thank him for his general expression of support for the \namendment I offer and also for some of the suggestions he has made to \nme. Our staffs are working now.\n  Again, I wish this to be a clear statement, but I wish it to be a \nunified statement. I believe that, together, we can achieve that \nresult. So I thank him. I will continue to work on it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the Senate is once again debating future \nU.S. policy in Iraq. I, like others, have long advocated a new \ndirection for our policy. I will continue to vote in a manner \nconsistent with changing course in Iraq. However, today I rise not to \nspeak about policy, tactics, or strategy. I will speak today only about \nour troops and their families.\n  First, the numbers are important. At last count, 3,609 Americans have \nlost their lives in Iraq, including 169 from Pennsylvania, the third \nhighest death toll in the Nation. Over 25,000 have been wounded in \nIraq, including more than 1,100 from Pennsylvania. Approximately \n156,000 Americans, both Active-Duty and Reserve forces, are currently \nserving in Iraq, including more than 8,000 from Pennsylvania.\n  Certainly, numbers don't tell the whole story, especially when we \nconsider the traumatic effect this war has had on individual families. \nThese fighting men and women were born into families, not divisions and \nbrigades. They are sons and daughters, wives and husbands, brothers and \nsisters, and, of course, fathers and mothers. Their love for their \nfamilies is matched only by their devotion to our Nation. This war has \nimpacted these families in many different ways.\n  We remember today and every day with gratitude and reverence those \nmore than 3,600 soldiers and marines who have died, who gave, as \nPresident Lincoln said, the last full measure of devotion to their \ncountry. Their families have loved and lost, and the sharp pain of that \nloss may, we pray, diminish over time, but certainly the ache and the \nhurt will long endure because someone they loved, someone whose strong, \nwarm embrace gave them comfort, will no longer be there for them. In \nfact, that person in the family is missing.\n  Some families have a loved one who served in Iraq and returned home, \nthank God, but, like 25,000 others, was wounded in Iraq. These families \nhave paid a terrible price for the courage and dedication of their \nfamily members.\n  Today, we remember the bravery of our fighting men and women. Their \nbravery is so inspiring to all of us. I met one of them in March who \nrepresents so many across this land of the brave, this country we call \nAmerica, our America. His name is Joshua Humberger, of Grapeville, \nWestmoreland County, PA, 20 years old from a small town, like many of \nour fighting men and women from small communities across America, in \nthis case southwestern Pennsylvania. Joshua is in the Army National \nGuard. He received a Purple Heart and other commendations after he was \nwounded when\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\nthe vehicle he was riding in was hit by a bomb, killing his commander, \nSFC Daniel Brozovich of Greenville, PA, way up in Mercer County near \nthe Ohio border. Two others, Ryan Griffin and Robert Kaminiski, both of \nAllegheny County, were injured as well in the attack.\n  To say that Joshua was injured in this attack is an understatement. \nHere is what one news article said about his injuries:\n\n       His left leg was amputated at the knee. His stomach was \n     pierced by shrapnel and surgeons had to remove part of his \n     lower bowel.\n\n  Despite all of the pain he and his wife Jessica have endured, he said \nduring my visit: I want to go back. I want to go back to continue \nserving.\n  Where do these young men and women find the strength? We have to ask \nthat. I have to say I don't know because it is hard for me to fully \nappreciate or comprehend such courage. They must be finding this \ncourage from a reservoir of faith, love for and from their family, and \nan abiding allegiance to this Nation.\n  We know other families have loved ones who are in Iraq now or have \nhad family members there for a long time. But even if a soldier returns \nhome from Iraq and is not killed or wounded, even if that is the case, \nin a family, they are still missing while they are there, even if the \nLord keeps them safe.\n  Today, we think of a lot of expressions of how to talk about this. \nOne of them that comes to mind is from the great rock music icon Bruce \nSpringsteen, who has roots in New Jersey, the Presiding Officer's \nState. I know he is proud of that. His words come to mind today. \nWritten in the aftermath of 9/11, they help explain what our families \nhave endured during this war. Bruce Springsteen's song ``You're \nMissing'' says in part:\n\n       Your house is waiting. Your house is waiting for you to \n     walk in. But you're missing. You're missing when I shut out \n     the lights. You're missing when I close my eyes. You're \n     missing when I see the sun rise. You're missing. Children are \n     asking if it's alright. Will you be in our arms tonight?\n\n  We ask that question as well, Mr. President.\n  To pay small tribute to those who are missing from their homes and \nfamilies because they lost their lives far away on a battlefield in \nIraq, I wish to take a few moments to read the names and hometowns of \nthe 169 Pennsylvanians killed in action:\n  Shawn M.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to reassert \nmy support for a change of course in Iraq and to briefly address some \nof the\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\namendments we are going to consider in the next few weeks concerning \nIraq policy.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the honor of experiencing firsthand one of the \nmore memorable events to occur in this Senate in the 6 months since I \nhave been here. It was late on a Monday evening, and just as you are \nright now, Mr. President, I was sitting in the Presiding Officer's \nchair. It was around 10 o'clock at night, and I was thinking that maybe \nthe day's events had been about concluded. Well, OK, I was thinking \nmaybe I was the only Senator left at the Capitol and that it was time \nto go home. Then onto the floor came Senator Lugar.\n  In my short time in the Senate, I have come to know the senior \nSenator from Indiana as a man with the deepest respect both from and \nfor his colleagues, a leader who always puts principle above politics, \nand a Senator who earned the right to speak and be heard long before I \ncame to Washington.\n  For the next 15 minutes, I listened to Senator Lugar--standing right \nover there--as he delivered a poignant, pragmatic assessment of our \nNation's position in Iraq. Rising far above the partisan crossfire that \ntoo often fills this Chamber, the Senator from Indiana urged his fellow \nMembers of Congress and members of the administration to suspend their \nparty differences and to come together.\n  As he said that night:\n\n       In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the \n     current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be \n     achieved. Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy \n     will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of \n     protecting our vital interests over the long term.\n\n  I hope all of my colleagues will recognize that our current strategy \nin Iraq is not working, that a new strategy based on the drawing down \nof U.S. forces is necessary, and that this strategy must be implemented \nnow.\n  After 4 years, over 3,600 American soldiers have been killed; over \n25,000 have been wounded; and almost $450 billion has been spent. We \ncannot wait until next year or even next month to change strategy.\n  After 4 years, we cannot wait for the Iraqi Government to demonstrate \nprogress before we begin bringing our soldiers home, when it has shown \nno indication of a commitment to compromise and reconciliation.\n  And after 4 years, we cannot ask our men and women in the field to \ncontinue to risk life and limb indefinitely in pursuit of a policy that \nis not working.\n  As Senator Lugar said that night:\n\n       A course change should happen now, while there is still \n     some possibility of constructing a sustainable bipartisan \n     strategy in Iraq.\n\n  Well, certainly, what we saw today on the floor of the Senate did not \ndemonstrate that kind of bipartisan strategy. I personally thought it \nwas obstructionism that we were not allowed to at least continue the \ndebate and to vote on Senator Webb's amendment. I believe we have to \nhave a change of course.\n  Our troops have done what we have asked them to do. They deposed an \nevil dictator. They guaranteed free elections in the country of Iraq. \nThey gave the Iraqi people the opportunity to vote and to establish a \nnew government.\n  We all know there can be no purely military solution in Iraq. This \nhas been agreed on by so many military commanders, experts, and Members \nof this body on both sides of the aisle that it does not need to be \nargued anymore. And we all recognize true stability in Iraq will only \ncome through political and economic compromises between Iraq's main \nethnic groups, and only the Iraqis themselves can reach these \ncompromises.\n  Given this, shouldn't our strategy be focused on transitioning to \nIraqi authority now, not at some undefined time in the future?\n  We must push the Iraqi Government to assume the duties it was elected \nto perform and to lead the process of meaningful negotiation and \ndealmaking. Our open-ended commitment is impeding this process and \ninhibiting the will and the ability of the Iraqi people to stand up and \ntake responsibility for their own country.\n  Nine months ago, the Iraq Study Group proposed a pragmatic change of \ncourse that focused on political and economic initiatives, intense \nregional and international diplomacy to tie all nations with an \ninterest in Iraq together, and the beginning of a phased redeployment \nof U.S. forces from Iraq.\n  Since the issuance of the Iraq Study Group report, some conditions on \nthe ground have remained the same, and a number have gotten worse. In \nthe last 3 months, more U.S. troops were killed than in any other 3-\nmonth period during the entire war.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside differences, to forget about past \ndisagreements or voting records, and to focus on what is best for our \ntroops in the field going forward. We owe it to these brave men and \nwomen in the field to get this policy right.\n  I believe the best thing we can do--for our troops, for our national \ninterest, and for the Iraqis themselves--is to begin bringing our \ntroops home and to remove the bulk of the U.S. combat forces by the \nspring of next year. We would still maintain a presence capable of \nprotecting U.S. personnel, training Iraqi forces, and conducting \ncounterterrorism and other specific operations.\n  Keeping the 150,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq is undermining our ability \nto achieve our objectives there and in the region. We need to start \nbringing them home. As Senator Lugar said that night:\n\n       A diplomatic offensive is likely to be easier in the \n     context of a tactical drawdown of U.S. troops in Iraq. A \n     drawdown would increase the chances of stimulating greater \n     economic and diplomatic assistance for Iraq from multi-\n     lateral organizations and European allies, who have sought to \n     limit their association with an unpopular war.\n\n  In March, I visited Baghdad and Fallujah and saw, firsthand, the \nbravery and commitment of our troops. Of the 22,000 troops involved in \nthe surge, 3,000 of them are from my State of Minnesota. I met a number \nof these troops. Some of them just came up to me in cafeterias or on \nthe street, and they were from Minnesota. I can tell you that they did \nnot complain. They did not complain about their tour extensions. Some \nof them--in fact, nearly all of them--had been set to come home in \nJanuary. They did not complain about that. They did not complain about \ntheir equipment. They did not complain about the heat. All they asked \nme was--first of all--what was the score of the State high school \nhockey tournament, and then they asked me if I would call their mom and \ndad, and if I would call their husband or wife when I got home to tell \nthem they were OK.\n  My most lasting memory of that trip was standing on the tarmac at the \nBaghdad Airport, when nine Duluth firefighters called me over to stand \nwith them. And they were there in front of their firetruck for one \npurpose, and that was to salute as six caskets, each draped with the \nAmerican flag, were loaded on a plane.\n  They did not know who the brave soldiers were who died, but they knew \nwhen they were sent home, and when their families were there to meet \nthem, their families' lives would never be the same. And they were \nthere to show their respect.\n  Whenever I speak with the moms or dads or husbands or wives of \nsoldiers who were killed, I always ask them how they are doing. When I \nasked this question of a mom recently from western Minnesota, she said: \nYou know, people keep asking me that. They keep asking me how I am \ndoing. And, you know, I really don't know what to say. She said: Do you \nhave any ideas about what I should say? And I told her: Well, I can \ntell you what the other mothers have been saying. They have been saying \nthat they wake up every morning, and they try so hard to hang together \nfor their family, and then something happens--they see a picture or \nthey remember something--and they are never the same for the rest of \nthe day. And they have their good moments, but their lives will never \nbe the same.\n  We owe it to these families to honor the sacrifices their sons and \ndaughters have made and to begin bringing our troops in Iraq home so \nthat other families do not experience similar anguish.\n  This is a different kind of war we are fighting. It has made demands \non the National Guard that are unprecedented. At times, up to 40 \npercent of the troops fighting in Iraq have been members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves. In many respects, this war has involved a \ndifferent kind of soldier.\n  In Vietnam, the average age of an American soldier was 19 years old. \nIn\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\nIraq and Afghanistan, the average age of Active-Duty soldiers is 27, \nand the average age of National Guard members over there is 33 years \nold.\n  Three-fourths of all soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have \nfamilies of their own, and fully one-half of those who have been killed \nhave left families behind.\n  Almost 22 percent of all Reserve and Guard members have had multiple \ndeployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I have met some of these families. \nWhen I was up in Duluth, I met a brother and a sister--teenagers. Both \nof their parents had been in Iraq, and they were both going back again.\n  For 4 years, these citizen soldiers have gone above and beyond the \ncall of duty and made extraordinary sacrifices. It is time to begin \nbringing them home.\n  We are finally starting to see some of our National Guard and Reserve \nmembers in Minnesota coming back, just as others across the country are \ntaking their place. These men and women from Minnesota are completing \none of the longest deployments of any U.S. military unit since the war \nbegan. They were originally scheduled to return home at the beginning \nof this year, only to find out weeks before they expected to ship back \nhome that their tours had been extended as part of the President's \nsurge strategy. Already a few hundred of these Guard members have been \nreunited with their loved ones, and by August the entire unit should be \nback in Minnesota, reconnecting with friends and family, beginning the \nprocess of transitioning to normal life. Having served and sacrificed \nfor 16 months, these men and women have earned their rest and the right \nto live their lives in peace.\n  That is why I cosponsored and voted for the amendment offered by my \nfriend from Virginia, Senator Webb, also cosponsored by Senator Hagel. \nThis amendment, as my colleagues know, would require regular units \ndeployed to Iraq and Afghanistan to remain at home at least as long as \nthey were deployed and give Guard and Reserve members 3 years at home \nfor every 1 year they are deployed.\n  The President's policies have placed unprecedented demands on our \nmilitary in the 4 years of this war. Our forces are exhausted and \noverstressed. It is critical, both for morale and for operational \nsafety, that units be given proper time to rest, recuperate, and \nretrain before redeploying. America's Armed Forces have a proud history \nand tradition that is unparalleled in the world, but when their ability \nto function properly is in danger, Congress must step in and address \nthis situation.\n  I am disappointed that most of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle chose to block this responsible proposal rather than allowing a \nsimple majority vote. This amendment would begin the process of \nrepairing and rebuilding our military, while maintaining our Nation's \nability to meet any threat to our Nation's security. We owe this to the \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve and to their fellow soldiers \nacross the country.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I have joined many of my colleagues \non countless occasions in asking when this war's supporters would \npublicly acknowledge the realities on the ground and finally allow a \nchange of course that begins bringing our forces home. Each time we ask \nthis question, we are told to be patient, that progress is just around \nthe corner, and that it would be counterproductive to establish a \ntimetable for withdrawal. After my trip to Iraq, I met with the \nPresident with three other Senators, and I talked to him about this. He \nsaid he supported the Iraq Study Group, but he didn't believe in the \ntimetables. He didn't want the deadlines. Again, we were told it will \nbe counterproductive to establish a timetable for withdrawal.\n  Now we have reached a point where the patience of many of even the \nmost loyal supporters of this war--and I am someone who opposed this \nwar from the beginning--but the patience of even the most loyal \nsupporters of this war has been exhausted.\n  We have reached a point where Senators who have dedicated their lives \nto serving our national interests cannot stand silent as America's \nstrength and standing in the world is continually undermined. We have \nreached a point where the necessary changes in our strategies in Iraq \nmay finally be possible. I urge my colleagues to vote for these \nchanges. We simply cannot wait any longer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Levin-\nReed amendment has been laid down. I wish to say a few words about it \nand the situation in Iraq in general.\n  Once again, the Senate is confronted with a series of votes over the \nfuture of Iraq. These votes present a very simple choice: Continue with \nmore of the same, or change course. To me, the choice is crystal clear. \nThe United States should and must change course in Iraq. We must begin \nto redeploy our forces and reevaluate what is truly in our national \ninterests.\n  This is not the first time we have been confronted with such a \nchoice. Many of us have voted over and over and over again for change, \nyet this President has refused to listen. He has worn blinders. He has \nignored the views of Congress and the American people. Majorities in \nboth the Senate and the House have voted to redeploy our forces from \nIraq, but the President vetoed the legislation and there were not the \nvotes to override, so we are back again facing many of the same \nquestions. Will the President listen this time?\n  In this current debate new voices have emerged, raising significant \nconcerns about the progress of the war. This includes Senator Lugar, \nthe deeply respected Senator from Indiana, who said in a very eloquent \nspeech before this body--and I have had the privilege of reading it in \ndetail and I wish to quote him:\n\n       In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the \n     current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be \n     achieved.\n\n  This includes Senator Warner, who has said that waiting until \nSeptember is too long. This includes Senator Voinovich, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Smith, and Senator Snowe, who have questioned the current path. \nWill this President listen?\n\n  Moving from the Halls of Congress to the streets of Baghdad, it is \nclear to see that this is not a rhetorical game. It is about facts on \nthe ground, and the facts are this: It has been 4\\1/2\\ years since U.S. \nforces entered Iraq. That is longer than we conducted World War II. \nYet, the nation remains in chaos. Violence continues unabated. The \ninsurgency is as strong as ever. The internecine fighting between Shia \nand Sunni is strong. Every day, there are more bombings, more IEDs, \nmore deaths. In total, we have lost 3,600 brave men and women, almost \n500 since this surge began 5 months ago. On average, four U.S. troops \nare being killed every day in Iraq.\n  Has the surge worked? Five months into it, it is clear that the surge \nhas failed to stop the violence. Fatalities and sectarian attacks are \non the rise. At no period in the war have we lost as many American \ntroops as in the last 3 months. If the trend continues, 2007 will be \nthe deadliest since the war began.\n  The promise of the surge was not that it would solve all of Iraq's \nproblems, but that it would increase security and stability so that \nIraq's government could confront the difficult political questions. So \nwe must ask the question: Has it? But in this area too, there has been \nno progress; no progress on passing an oil revenue-sharing law; no \nprogress on reforming the de-Baathification system which, to a great \nextent, was responsible for this insurgency in the first place; no \nprogress in holding provincial elections, and no substantial progress \non any other benchmark.\n  In fact, the Maliki government seems to be under siege. Sectarian \ntensions are mounting, and there have been calls for a no-confidence \nvote in the Prime Minister. So the vaunted surge has not worked and \nthere has been no political progress. Yet, this President has asked for \nmore time and more resources, and he gives no hints that he\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\nnow recognizes how dire the situation is. He gives no indication that \nhe believes the course must be changed. He provides the American people \nwith no exit strategy. To me, this represents a major failure of \nleadership.\n  I believe America's continued mission in Iraq is counterproductive. \nTherefore, the time has come for a change of course. I believe that \nwithin 120 days, we must begin to redeploy our combat troops. The goal \nwould be to transition the majority of U.S. troops out of Iraq by April \n2008, and that is exactly what the Levin-Reed amendment does. A small \nsupporting force would remain in Iraq for the purposes of training, \ncounterterrorism, border security, and force protection. This would \nmove the vast majority of our troops out of harm's way.\n  Just as importantly, moving out of Iraq would open the door to a \nreevaluation of our national security interests in the region. Our \nNation faces major challenges, and the primary focus on Iraq has \nallowed these problems to fester unaddressed. These include preventing \nterrorists from gaining safe haven in Afghanistan or, yes, Iraq. That \nis an abiding national security interest of this country. Senator Lugar \nalluded to it in his remarks. I certainly agree. To prevent Iraq from \nbecoming a safe harbor for terrorists should remain a national security \ngoal of the United States.\n  Secondly, preventing the violence from spreading throughout the \nMiddle East, Afghanistan, and the cities of Europe.\n  Third, thwarting Iranian domination of the region, and persuading the \nIranian government that continued development of nuclear weapons is not \nin its best interests. This can't be done by not talking with Iran; it \ncan only be done by talking with Iran. This is what we should be doing.\n  Fourth, pursuing an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement. Yesterday \nafternoon, I met with the Foreign Minister of Egypt and he agreed. This \nis a window of opportunity to move toward a peace settlement between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. To once again overlook that \nopportunity is a big mistake.\n  Finally, containing the damage done to our credibility around the \nworld. Our credibility has suffered. The war has spawned terror. Over \nthis past weekend, I happened to hear Peter Bergin, the distinguished \nexpert on Osama bin Laden, speaking on CNN. He estimated that terrorism \nhas increased sevenfold because of our involvement in Iraq.\n  Many people say if we leave Iraq, the Middle East collapses. I don't \nbelieve that. If we leave Iraq, we leave Shia and Sunni to come to \ngrips with the problems between them, without the United States being a \nbuffer and creating the point of attack for terrorists and insurgents.\n  I say remove that point of attack and begin to solve some of the \nproblems. The simple truth is that none of these initiatives can be \npursued adequately so long as we are bogged down in Iraq. So I believe \nthe time has come to change course. We are 4 years and $450 billion \ninto the war. Costs are increasing at $10 billion a month. We are \nlosing 100 soldiers a month. Our Armed Forces are stretched thin, \nequipment is worn, recruiting is down, and no one can estimate what the \nimpact will be come next April, when forces will be unable to meet the \nrotations.\n  We will be paying the costs of this war for decades to come. Thanks \nto medical science and battlefield medicine, many soldiers ordinarily \nwould have died, but they have been saved. Some have egregious \ninjuries. We have all seen the people with traumatic brain injury, \namputees--single, double, quadruple amputees, people who will need care \nfor the rest of their lives.\n  We have a choice: more of the same or change course. The Levin-Reed \namendment represents a change of course. It represents this Senate \nstanding up and saying forcefully we want our people out. We want \nredeployment within 120 days, and we want us off the streets, no longer \nto be that point of attack between Shia and Sunni. So the choice could \nnot be clearer. It is time to act. I am very much in support of a \nLevin-Reed amendment. I very much hope we will have a chance to vote on \nthe substance of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, and I don't intend to \nobject, I ask my colleague from Kentucky if he would amend his request \nto have myself recognized after he finishes speaking.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I so amend the request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my strong \nfeelings about our dialog in Congress on the war in Iraq. I am \nconcerned not only with the defeatist message some of us are sending \nour brave men and women in our Armed Forces on a daily basis but also \nwith the message being sent to terrorists and those who wish to harm \nus. Instead of focusing our attention this week on how to provide our \nArmed Forces with the best equipment possible to complete their \nmission, many in this body continue to play political games with the \nwar. This political game is deflating troop morale and strengthening \nour enemies.\n  Some of our colleagues believe they know the situation on the ground \nin Iraq better than my friend General Petraeus, the commander of the \nmultinational force in Iraq. They believe we should begin a withdrawal \nof our troops from Iraq. The people who are best qualified to decide \nour troop levels are the commanders on the ground, not the politicians \nin Washington, DC.\n  I wish to talk specifically to the Democrats who want to immediately \nwithdraw. Contrary to what the base of the Democratic Party may think, \nthis war is not a Republican war and it is not just a President Bush \nwar; it is an American war. When we vote to send troops into battle, \nthey fight under the American flag. If we win or lose in Iraq, the \nUnited States of America wins or loses--not the Republican Party and \nnot just President Bush.\n  I saw yesterday the Democratic Senatorial Committee is now running \nads in selected States asking Republican Senators to vote to \nimmediately bring our troops home from Iraq. I watched the ads. I \nplayed them on my television, and I played them on the computers in my \noffice. Not surprisingly, they did not mention once what would happen \nif American forces withdrew quickly from Iraq. Nor did they mention \nthat the head of the DSCC and the Senate majority leader voted to \nauthorize the war. There is a shocker.\n  If we take the advice of the political arm of the Senate Democrats \nand pull out of Iraq, chaos will rule the day in Iraq and spread \nthroughout the Middle East, in spite of what some of our colleagues on \nthe other side have said.\n  That is why many of the Democrats who want to bring our troops home \nnow don't talk about the harsh consequences of pulling out. This is \nprecisely why we should not politicize war in 30-second sound bites.\n  I also wish to briefly address my Republican colleagues who may be \nfeeling the political pressure back home as we debate this war. Our \nconstituents sent us to Washington, DC, to make tough decisions, not to \ncast votes based on public opinion polls. Many of you know the \nconsequences of pulling out of Iraq. I know because we have talked \nabout it in our conferences. But stay strong enough until September, \nwhen General Petraeus will brief us on the effects of the change in \nstrategy. Let us all then reevaluate the changes we made. The changes \nwe made have only been fully implemented for less than a month. I \nacknowledge that the signs of success have been slow and, yes, many \nmistakes have been made with past strategies. But that is how war is. \nMistakes sometimes are made. We learned from our mistakes and we moved \nforward with a new strategy. This new strategy is now in place.\n  General Petraeus is working, with the increase of thousands of \nAmerican troops, to bring safety and stability to Baghdad and Anbar \nProvince, putting insurgents on the run. The partnership between the \nUnited States and Iraqi forces against terrorist insurgents is \nincreasing. Last month, more than 10,000 Iraqi tribes in the Baghdad \narea reached agreements with the United\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\nStates and Iraqi forces for the first time to oppose al-Qaida. These \ntribe members fought alongside al-Qaida in the past, and they are now \nproviding our troops with information about their former allies.\n\n  We are at a critical point in our fight against al-Qaida and the \nextreme terrorist insurgents. I urge my colleagues to look at the long-\nterm consequences of prematurely abandoning our mission in Iraq. Anyone \nwho believes we can bring an abrupt end to our involvement in this \nconflict and still conduct successful counterterrorism operations in \nIraq is wrong. Defeat in Iraq will come with a hefty price that will be \npaid by future generations of Americans. If the United States leaves, \nthere will be a regional explosion of Islamic terrorism and extremism \nthat will throw the entire Middle East into greater upheaval. The Iraqi \nGovernment may well collapse and throw the country into a state of \nchaos. Iran will dominate the Middle East, and our national security \nwill be severely compromised.\n  It is because of these consequences that we should allow General \nPetraeus and the troop surge the opportunity to succeed. We cannot pull \nthe rug out from underneath him right after we give him more tools to \ntry to succeed in his mission. That would be both irresponsible and \nunfair. We promised to give him until September to report back with the \nprogress on the surge, and we should hold true to this promise. That is \n2 months from now--2 months from now.\n  Finally, I also wish to address the efforts made by some of my \ncolleagues across the aisle to overturn effective policies that we have \nin place to fight against terrorism.\n  I oppose changing the 2006 Military Commissions Act to give legal \nrights to suspected terrorists. Detained enemy combatants are not \nordinary criminal defendants and are not entitled to a trial in a \ncivilian court, or to habeas corpus review.\n  Make no mistake about it, these terrorists are at war with us and we \nshould treat them like it. We already have the mechanisms in place for \ndetainees to challenge their enemy combatant status. These procedures \nare more protective of detainees' rights than any military commission \nin American history.\n  I find it ridiculous that we are faced with debating this issue \nagain. The Senate has already voted on four separate occasions in the \npast 2 years to ensure that suspected terrorists do not have automatic \naccess to Federal courts to challenge the legality of their detention.\n  How many more times are we going to be forced to vote on this issue? \nLet me be clear. I oppose weakening our current procedures. The changes \nbeing proposed will only end up strengthening the rights of terrorists.\n  I also oppose efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo \nBay, Cuba. I realize there have been several negative reports and \nstories in the media in the past about this facility.\n  Let me set the record straight. The vision of Guantanamo Bay the \nmedia tries to portray to the American people is very different from \nthe reality of the facility. I have personally visited the facility at \nGuantanamo Bay and found it to be nothing like what is described in the \nmedia. The facility includes air-conditioning, good meals, religious \nworship areas, and a top-notch hospital and health care facility. The \nterrorists there are treated with dignity while they show contempt for \nour troops. Don't forget that these terrorists are the worst of the \nworst. They are all extremely dangerous.\n  The job our troops do there is critical to our war effort. If those \nterrorists stay locked up there, they cannot harm us and they cannot \nbomb and do all the things that are being done presently more \neffectively in Iraq by being detained in Guantanamo Bay. And they do \nprovide us with intelligence.\n  I applaud our troops for their efforts. They are working very hard to \nsecure our freedom. It is thanks to their efforts and those made in the \nwar in Iraq and the war on terrorism that our Nation's freedoms remain \nprotected. The brave men and women of our Armed Forces and their \nfamilies sacrifice on a daily basis for our freedoms because they \nbelieve their mission is too great to fail. I ask my colleagues: Are we \nreally ready to declare their mission already lost? Are we really ready \nto do that when we finally have discovered a new method of attack?\n  I, for one, am ready to stand behind our troops and stand side by \nside with General Petraeus. I will vote against any amendments that \nrestrict the flexibility of our military commanders to run this war or \nhurt our fight to end terrorism. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  The Chair advises the Senator from Virginia that under a previous \nunanimous consent agreement, the Senator from New Jersey is to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I wonder if my colleague will yield for \nthe purpose of a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl, be recognized for a period of 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out once again \nagainst the war in Iraq and in support of our troops. Today, we had an \nopportunity to do just that--to support the troops, troops such as \nthese who are pictured here who actually have been serving our country \nand recently became U.S. citizens.\n  ``Support the troops''--how many times have we heard that said on the \nfloor of the Senate? We have heard that refrain time and time again \nfrom the very people who earlier today voted against the very essence \nof what it is to support the troops.\n  From the beginning of the Iraq war, we have heard its supporters say \nthat somehow supporting the war equals supporting the troops. But from \nthe beginning of this fiasco, it has been clear that the troops have \nbeen a secondary consideration for those who were bent on rushing into \nan ill-conceived war. Going to war without a postwar plan to stabilize \nIraq, is that supporting the troops? Refusing to listen to generals \nabout the troop levels needed to win the peace, is that about \nsupporting the troops? Sending our soldiers into a war zone without the \nappropriate bulletproof vests, without the appropriate vehicles, with \ninferior equipment, is that supporting the troops? Letting Walter \nReed's conditions worsen, is that supporting the troops? Extending \ntours of duty without regard to the consequences to our soldiers and \ntheir families, is that supporting the troops? Giving our soldiers only \na brief stop at home before shipping them back in to a civil war in \nIraq, is that supporting the troops?\n  It seems to me that the very least we can do for our brave men and \nwomen who carry out their orders with exquisite skill and bravery in an \nunimaginable situation in Iraq is to give them enough time to catch \ntheir breath before they are sent back.\n  Clearly, never have so few been asked to do so much in these \ncontinuing deployments. If one thinks about it, the number of men and \nwomen who are presently deployed and have been deployed compared to 300 \nmillion people in this country, how is it so few have been asked to do \nand sacrifice so much.\n  Today, the Republican leadership wouldn't even let them have the \nright opportunity for the respite they need in between these continuing \ndeployments, deployments that are taking our troops and virtually \ngrilling them into the ground. A Republican minority stopped a majority \nof the Senate and overwhelmingly the will of the American people in \nsupporting the troops through a procedural roadblock. This should not \nhave been a partisan effort by Republicans. It should not have been. In \nessence, those who put those roadblocks up have voted once again to \nstay the course, no change to the President's failed war policy, no \nalteration to this dead-end course, not even to give our troops some \nwell-deserved rest.\n  I applaud my colleague from Virginia, Senator Webb, as well as my \ncolleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel,\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\nboth decorated combat veterans who stood up for our troops in their \namendment. They know personally--this is not esoteric for them--they \nknow personally of the sacrifice our soldiers make each and every day \nfor the country they love, the country we all love. But they are not \npawns. They are the best and bravest, and they deserve better than what \nthe Senate did today.\n  I hope the American people speak out in support of our troops. I ask \nthose Senators who oppose giving them the appropriate recess between \ndeployment, the appropriate time so that they, even having to go back \ninto the war, could have the appropriate time, as the military itself \ndevises and has as goals as to what it should be, that at least for \nwhatever time they are deployed abroad, that they have that time back \nhere at home, back here with their families, back here to be able to \nrejuvenate themselves and go back to do the mission which they \nwillfully do, could we not do that much for them? I hope the American \npeople will speak out with an incredibly loud voice to our colleagues \nwho don't believe they deserve that much, who used a procedural \nroadblock.\n  Mr. President, I am outraged.\n  As someone who voted against the war, I am outraged that 4 years \nafter the start of an elective and unnecessary war which we were led \ninto based on false premises and false promises, we have not yet ended \nit.\n  I am outraged that every delay in moving toward a transition out of \nIraq and ending the war in Iraq means more American lives lost.\n  I am outraged that we have spent $450 billion on this war and that \nfor each additional month we continue to be engaged in Iraq under the \npresent course, we spend another $10 billion a month.\n  I am outraged that the President's war has cost us our prestige and \ninfluence abroad and has undermined our security around the world.\n  I am outraged that the war in Iraq has kept our focus away from the \nwar in Afghanistan, the birthplace of the Taliban, home to al-Qaida, \nthe land of Osama bin Laden, and the place where the attacks of \nSeptember 11 were planned.\n  I am outraged that we always hear the same story and the same \npromises from this administration.\n  As I listen to some of my colleagues, as well as the administration, \nfear should not be the basis for our policy. But that is what the \nadministration and its supporters in the Senate offer each time--fear. \nThe Bush administration always says that change is just around the \ncorner, that we should wait just a little longer for success. The Bush \nadministration always has a new plan with new benchmarks and new \ndeadlines, but they never meet those benchmarks or those deadlines, so \nthey just change them. The Bush administration always says we are \nmaking progress on the ground. Yet the facts contradict them.\n  The truth is that we still haven't stopped the insurgency, that \nhundreds of Iraqis are still being killed each day, and that the Iraqi \nGovernment still hasn't acted on key benchmarks. The truth is that we \nare being driven down a dead-end street by an administration without a \nroadmap for a lasting peace.\n  So I say, as Senator Robert Kennedy did in March of 1968 in a speech \nabout Vietnam:\n\n       We are entitled to ask--we are required to ask how many \n     more men, how many more lives, how much more destruction will \n     be asked, to provide the military victory that is always just \n     around the corner, to pour into this bottomless pit of our \n     dreams?\n       But this question the administration does not and cannot \n     answer. It has no answer--none, but the ever-expanding use of \n     military force and the lives of our brave soldiers, in a \n     conflict where military force has failed to solve anything in \n     the past.\n\n  Those were his words then. I believe they ring true today. Today, we \nare living with the consequences of the administration's failed policy. \nOver 3,600 American troops have been killed in Iraq since the beginning \nof this war, including 87 servicemembers with ties to my home State of \nNew Jersey. April and May was the deadliest 2-month period of the war \nfor U.S. troops, with 230 servicemembers killed. We have now spent over \n$400 billion on the war in Iraq. We continue a burn rate of about $10 \nbillion a month. Frankly, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I \nnever believed the administration's estimate that the so-called surge \nwould cost only $5.6 billion, and these new numbers prove once again \nthat we have been misled.\n  This was a terrible weekend, with over 250 people killed in Iraq, \nincluding 150 Iraqis who perished in a bombing that the New York Times \ndescribed as ``one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest'' single \nbombing since the start of the war. Suicide attacks have more than \ndoubled across Iraq, from 26 in January to 58 in April.\n\n  In terms of reconstruction, oil production in Iraq is still lower \nthan it was before the war 4 years ago. Baghdad is getting under 6 \nhours of electricity a day, significantly less than before the war. And \nthe President's escalation plan, the so-called surge, simply isn't \nachieving the results we were promised.\n  Imagine that, another broken promise. Just like when we were told: We \nknow where the weapons of mass destruction are. Just like we were told \nabout the yellow cake uranium from Niger, when the President came \nbefore the Congress in his State of the Union speech and used that term \nto engender support for his war policy. We found out it wasn't true, \nand that ended up having a CIA agent outed because her husband, a \nformer United States Ambassador, proved that, in fact, that wasn't \ntrue. If that had been under any other administration, it would have \nbeen called treason. Just like we were told: We will be greeted as \nliberators. Just as the President landed on the aircraft carrier with a \nbig banner behind him saying ``Mission Accomplished.'' How many lives \nhave been lost since mission accomplished? Just like ``the insurgency \nis in its last throes.'' We have heard that so many times.\n  Well, it is about time to add the surge to that infamous list. I \nthink we all knew that the strategy to secure Baghdad would simply lead \ninsurgents to move into other areas, and that is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  As Anthony Cordesman from the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies said in recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee:\n\n       The U.S. is having to expand its counterinsurgency \n     operations broadly outside Baghdad. Limited tactical \n     successes really don't matter unless such casualties include \n     substantial cadres of leaders and experts that cannot be \n     easily and rapidly replaced. The insurgents can simply \n     disperse, stand down, and regroup.\n\n  Now, I know the administration likes to tout victories in individual \nIraqi provinces or cities as markers of success, but I believe all we \nare seeing is what is sometimes called the balloon effect. We clamp \ndown on insurgents in one area, they spring up in another. We never \nactually solve the problem.\n  Let's be frank about the status of the Iraqi Government. The New York \nTimes describes the Iraqi Parliament and Cabinet as ``barely able to \nfunction.'' Apparently, 12 Cabinet members aren't even attending \nCabinet meetings anymore; 74 out of the 275 Members of Parliament are \nboycotting the Parliament. And numerous others don't attend anyway.\n  We have heard a lot about benchmarks. They keep changing, of course. \nIt is now clear to anyone and should be to everyone that the Iraqi \nGovernment will not meet any of the much-touted benchmarks the Bush \nadministration has outlined. I believe we are engaged in a ceaseless \nact of repetitive denial by this administration.\n  In fact, the Bush administration is shortly going to try to present a \ncompletely new set of ``accomplishments'' and downplay their previous \nbenchmarks. A recent Washington Post article notes:\n\n       Those achievements are markedly different from the \n     benchmarks Bush set when he announced his decision to send \n     tens of thousands of additional American troops to Iraq.\n\n  Let's take a look at the benchmarks the Bush administration told us \nwould be met.\n  We were told that by the end of 2006 a provincial election law would \nbe approved and new election laws would be put in place. It is the \nmiddle of 2007. That benchmark has not been met.\n  We were told the Iraqis would approve a law for debaathification. But \nthat benchmark has not been met.\n  We were told the Iraqis would create a law to help restrain sectarian \nmilitias. That benchmark has not been met.\n  We were told the Iraqis would establish a law to regulate the oil \nindustry\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\nand share revenues. That benchmark has not been met.\n  We were told by March the Iraqi Government was supposed to hold a \nreferendum on constitutional amendments. But, again, that benchmark has \nnot been met.\n  As I have said time and time again, benchmarks without consequences \nare just aspirations. And I am sick and tired of hearing about goals \nthat are never met. Yet despite this lack of results, the \nadministration refuses to admit their strategy has failed. Instead, \nthey want to move the goalpost. They just want to alter their \nperception of reality.\n  Finally, I cannot close without discussing the cost of the war in \nIraq. Our expenditures in Iraq saddle our Nation's finances and our \nchildren's future. We spend approximately $10 billion a month in Iraq. \nWe spend $2.5 billion a week in Iraq. We spend more than $328 million \nevery day in Iraq. And we spend more than $13.5 million an hour--an \nhour--in Iraq.\n  Let me just put our Iraq spending in perspective. For what we spend \nin a month and a half in Iraq, we could fully fund No Child Left Behind \nnext year, ensuring that every school district in the United States has \nthe funds promised to them to meet the goals of the law for a quality \neducation for every child. Just for what we spend in 1\\1/2\\ months, we \ncould meet all of that goal next year.\n  For what we spend in approximately 3 days in Iraq, and with an \nadditional $1 billion, we could substantially improve security at our \nNation's ports, including increased scanning of cargo containers. I \nrepresent one of the largest ports on the eastern seaboard, clearly one \nof our huge gaping holes to our domestic security.\n  For what we spend in just over 2 months in Iraq, we could pay the $21 \nbillion cost of implementing the remaining 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations to secure our homeland, implementations that would \ntruly make our country, its communities, and its families far more \nsecure. Yet we need to look beyond the economic cost of the war at its \ntrue cost: 3,609 American lives. That has no price to it. It is \ninvaluable. These are the sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, \nbrothers and sisters, husbands and wives of fellow Americans, and we \nnow have more than 26,695 sons and daughters of America who are wounded \nin ways that will affect their lives forever. I hope a grateful nation \nremembers them now and in the future.\n  In conclusion, I ask, Mr. President, how many more deadlines will be \nmissed? How many more benchmarks will be set, not met, and then \nforgotten? How many more times will we be told to wait just a few more \nmonths? How many more times will the administration say that change \nwill happen soon, 4 years later? How many more broken promises? And how \nmany lives must be lost in the meantime? How long will this \nadministration wait to come to the inevitable conclusion that we must \ntransition out of this war?\n\n  Mr. President, it is over. Your failed strategy, your ill-conceived \nwar must come to an end before more damage is done, before more lives \nare lost, before more national treasure is squandered. Let's get our \ntroops home so we can start the hard work of meeting our domestic \nhomeland security challenges, of meeting our security challenges \nelsewhere in the world--for which we have real challenges--of \nstrengthening our foreign policy and mending our international \nrelations.\n  I know as I visit back in New Jersey, so many of my constituents say \nto me: Why is it that you all in the Senate cannot just simply put an \nend and seek the transition to this war? To do that, we truly need \nprofiles in courage in the Senate. We need bipartisan support. \nDemocrats do not have the 60 votes in the Senate to stop a filibuster, \nthe procedural process by which the Republican minority thwarts the \nwill of a majority of the Senate and the American people, nor do we \nhave the 67 votes needed to override a Presidential veto. It will take \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to meet that challenge.\n  I challenge my Republican colleagues, who now say they are dismayed \nand have a different view than the President--and I applaud them for \ncoming to that conclusion. And I say it is time to back their words \nwith meaningful votes here on the floor of the Senate--now, before we \nlose more lives and national treasure. Now is the time, not tomorrow. \nNow is the time, not next month. Now is the time, not next year.\n  I will end today by reminding all of us of what Senator Robert \nKennedy said about the war in Vietnam. He said:\n\n       Past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation. Tragedy \n     is a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which \n     to live. Now, as ever, we do ourselves best justice when we \n     measure ourselves against ancient tests, as in the Antigone \n     of Sophocles, where he said, ``All men make mistakes, but a \n     good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and \n     repairs the evil. The only sin is pride.''\n\n  The only sin is pride. The only sin is pride. Let's not allow pride \nto be the obstacle to changing our course in Iraq, to making sure we \nsave more lives of the men and women who bravely answer the call of the \nNation's trumpets. Let's make sure ultimately we strengthen our \nsecurity by having the resources both at home and abroad to meet our \nreal challenges. Let's change the course. And over the next week, we \nwill have that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the remarks of \nmy colleague, the junior Senator from New Jersey, and among the things \nhe said are that he is outraged that we haven't ended this war. And he \nsaid, speaking to the President of the United States: Your ill-\nconceived war should come to an end before more lives are lost. He \nconcluded by saying: Now is the time, not next month, not next year.\n  Mr. President, while my colleague is still on the Senate floor, it \nseems to me that we should talk a little bit about what the obligations \nare of someone who has those feelings. It seems to me that anybody \noutraged that we haven't ended the war now has an obligation to offer \nan amendment before this body to do so. When he says now, before more \nlives are lost, that should suggest the only thing the Senate can do \nand the House can do is to cut off the funding for the war. But that is \na way to end the war, it seems to me, instead of arguing about the \namount of deployment time, the time of rest between deployments for our \nsoldiers, if that is the state of the situation, that the Senator \nbelieves we ought to be getting right to the bottom line before any \nmore lives are lost and cut off the war.\n  My own view is not as pessimistic, not as defeatist. My own view is \nthat General Petraeus is right; that there is an opportunity for us to \nsucceed in our mission. And when I talk about supporting the troops, \nand I think about when General Petraeus talks about supporting the \ntroops, the best way to support the troops is to support the troops, \nmeaning to not only provide what they need to succeed in their mission \nin a material sense but to provide the political and moral support they \nneed to continue their mission.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I will in a moment. Since I addressed the Senator's remarks, \nI will be happy to yield to him.\n  But that support is critical to the success of their mission. They \ndon't think they have lost this war, contrary to some on the other side \nof the aisle here. They don't think they have lost, and they believe \nthey can succeed in their mission. The kind of defeatist talk I have \nheard here, unfortunately, it seems to me, leads to the notion that it \nis a question of which one of them, which one of these brave soldiers \nor marines or airmen or sailors are going to be the last one to die in \na failed cause.\n  That is not the message we should be sending from the Senate. It is \nnot the message the political leaders, who should be supporting these \ntroops, should be sending--not just to the troops and to their families \nbut also to our allies and our enemies.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I don't know whether \nhe voted for cloture on the amendment offered by Senator Webb and \nSenator Hagel. But when we talk about supporting the troops, here are \ntwo Members of this body who are distinguished, decorated combat \nveterans who know what it is to fight a war, and they both, as well as \nothers, said it is critical for our troops to have a rotational cycle\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\nthat gives them some respite equal to the time they are deployed. I \ndon't know why we couldn't have had a straight up-or-down vote. That \nwould be about supporting the troops.\n  Last, I say to my distinguished friend, we can have differences on \nthe war. I believe that, in fact, having these blinders in which we \ncontinue to say ``stay the course regardless of consequences'' is \nultimately leading us down a road that is not in the best interests of \nthe United States and its security. So we differ.\n  I hope you will consider voting for the Levin-Reed amendment. That \nwill give us an opportunity to begin the end of the war and transition \nout in a way that ultimately will secure the United States.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the comments of my colleague. Let me reiterate, \nit seems to me if one is outraged, and if one believes the war should \nend now, before another life is lost, instead of arguing about how many \nmonths there are between troop deployments and making that the \nattempted argument here, that you ought to get right to the bottom line \nand decide to cut off the money for the war.\n  I have a different point of view. Of course, I am not going to vote \nfor that amendment because I believe that General Petraeus, having been \nunanimously confirmed, has an opportunity and basically the right to \nexpect our support in carrying out the mission which we have sent him \nto achieve and which we have sent all these soldiers and marines and \nothers to achieve as well.\n  We undercut that mission by cutting it short, by cutting off our \nsupport. It is not a matter of giving it more time. The last brigade of \nthe five brigades that were brought in on the surge just got into \ntheater. This surge has just gotten underway in its full form and \nGeneral Petraeus has said he is going to come back in September and \ngive us a report on how he thinks it is going. Obviously, it will be an \ninterim report. One couldn't expect necessarily that all the results \ncould be achieved in the short period of time between now and \nSeptember. But, nonetheless, that will be a time when he can come back \nand give us a report.\n  I suggest we ought to at least wait until we receive that report \nbefore concluding that all is lost and that we have to bring the troops \nhome and that that is the best way to support them. They don't believe \nthat. I have spoken to the troops in Iraq. They believe they are \nwinning and that they can win. Early reports from this surge suggest \nthey are right.\n  I am not going to prejudge it, however. All I ask of my colleagues is \nthat they not prejudge it either, that they not come in here with a \ndefeatist attitude and say all is lost, it can't work, we should bring \neverybody home, and it doesn't matter whether General Petraeus has just \ngotten started, it doesn't matter that we have confirmed him \nunanimously and that we have sent him into harm's way to accomplish \nthis mission. None of that matters. Our political judgment is all that \nmatters and we ought to begin a withdrawal.\n  That is fundamentally wrong, and I am glad my colleagues will defeat \nthese amendments which would have the effect of undercutting our \nmission and, as I said, the mission and morale of our troops.\n  I wished to speak briefly to the amendment of Senator Lieberman, who \nhas been a stalwart and steadfast beacon of truth--truth that needs to \nbe spoken to the kind of threats this country faces, especially with \nrespect to the overall terrorist threat, both as it emanates from \nterrorist groups and also as it is supported by state sponsors of this \nterrorism. That is what his amendment goes to. It goes to the state \nsponsorship of terrorism by the state of Iran.\n  It is an excellent amendment which needs to be adopted by this body, \nin my view. As he has noted, Iran has a long history of supporting \nterrorism and it continues to develop a nuclear capability. It is \nactively undermining our efforts in Iraq. It is responsible for the \ndeath of Americans, and it needs to be confronted.\n  Senator Lieberman's amendment documents many of Iran's dangerous \nactions in Iraq and it directs, in its conclusion, a regular report to \nCongress to better inform us and the American people of the destructive \nand intolerable role of Iran. We need this information to help \nformulate our policies as well as to mobilize public opinion to support \nthem.\n  Let me discuss a few of the items that are in his proposal and why it \nneeds to be supported by this body. We know that Iran has become the \nprimary ideological, financial, and logistical supporter of terrorists \nseeking to attack the West and one of the major financial supporters. \nWe know because the U.S. Department of State has listed Iran as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. It is one of only five countries in the world to \nbe so designated.\n\n  The State Department's most recent report stated: ``Iran remains the \nmost significant state sponsor of terrorism.''\n  This is not in doubt. It provides significant financial backing to \nterrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad in an \norganized effort to undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace as well as \nour efforts throughout the Middle East. It is trying to undermine \nmoderate regimes throughout the Middle East, to establish itself as the \ndominant regional power--this, by the way, being considered a matter of \ngreat concern by other nations in the region. It wants to reshape the \nregion in its own ideological image.\n  Iranian-sponsored terrorism has caused the death of Americans, for \nexample, in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, where 19 \nU.S. servicemembers were killed. It provided assistance to al-Qaida. \nAccording to the 9/11 Commission report, in late 1991 and 1992, \ndiscussion in Sudan between al-Qaida and Iranian operatives led to an \ninformal agreement to cooperate and provide support, even if only \ntraining for actions carried out primarily against Israel and the \nUnited States. Not long afterward, senior al-Qaida operatives and \ntrainers traveled to Iran to receive training in explosives.\n  Iran has continued its relations with al-Qaida. At least eight of the \n9/11 hijackers traveled through Iran between October of 2000 and \nFebruary of 2001. Its aggressive sponsorship of terrorism is a vital \nnational security threat to the United States.\n  Let me mention its nuclear capability. It continues to defy the \ninternational community by developing its nuclear capability. Nuclear \nweapons in the hands of the most significant state sponsor of terrorism \nis a risk to the United States, and we have to do everything we can to \nprevent that. The most recent evidence includes the apparent \nconstruction of a new tunnel complex near one of Iran's major nuclear \nsites. A former United Nations weapons inspector, David Albright, noted \nIran built a tunnel complex near the Isfahan uranium conversion plant \nin order to protect a range of nuclear-related equipment and that Iran \nmay be construct a similar facility near Natanz, fearing that the \nunderground halls at Natanz are vulnerable to destruction by military \nattack.\n  I support the administration's commitment to pursuing a diplomatic \nsolution to this danger, but although the United Nations has imposed \nsanctions on Iran, nothing has come of this. If Iran continues to \ndevelop its nuclear capability, obviously we maintain the right to take \nappropriate action, and I therefore will continue to support efforts to \nmarginalize this threat that Iran poses to the West and to the United \nStates.\n  Finally, let me make a comment about the undermining of our efforts \nin Iraq. This is the most immediate threat from Iran, and it is a \nsignificant focus of the amendment of Senator Lieberman. The most \nrecent Country Reports on Terrorism from the State Department states:\n\n       Iran . . . continues to threaten its neighbors and \n     destabilize Iraq by providing weapons, training, advice and \n     funding to select Iraqi Shia militants.\n\n  Then-Ambassador to Iraq Khalilzad stated last year:\n\n       We can say with certainty that they support groups that are \n     attacking coalition troops. These groups are using the same \n     ammunition to destroy armored vehicles that the Iranians are \n     supplying to Hezbollah in Lebanon. They provide money to \n     Shiite militias and they train some of the groups. We can't \n     say whether Tehran is supporting al-Qaida but we do know that \n     al-Qaida people come here from Pakistan through Iran. Ansar \n     al-Sunna, a partner organization of Zarqawi's network, has a \n     base in northwest Iran.\n\n\n[[Page S8995]]\n\n\n  General Petraeus recently stated:\n\n       The level of financing, the level of training on Iranian \n     soil, the level of equipping some sophisticated technologies \n     with explosives and so forth, even advice in some cases, has \n     been very, very substantial and very harmful.\n\n  Iranian interference in Iraq is not the rogue actions of low-level \npersonnel. Here is what General Petraeus recently stated, which I think \nis critical:\n\n       We know that it goes as high as Brigadier General Qassem \n     Suleimani, who is the head of . . . the Qods Force . . . of \n     the Iranian Guards Corps. That is quite high level. We \n     believe he works directly for the supreme leader of the \n     country.\n\n  This support is material and is leading directly to the deaths of \nAmerican servicemembers.\n  Brigadier General Bergner, spokesman for the Multi-National Force in \nIraq, recently stated that the Quds Force operates three camps near \nTehran and that:\n\n       [The] Qods Force, along with Hezbollah instructors, train \n     approximately 20 to 60 Iraqis at a time, sending them back to \n     Iraq organized into these special groups. They are being \n     taught how to use [Explosively Formed Penetrators], mortars, \n     rockets, as well as intelligence, sniper and kidnapping \n     operations. In addition to training, the Qods Force also \n     supplies the special groups with weapons and funding of \n     $750,000 to $3 million U.S. a month.\n\n  In February, the U.S. military reported that at least 170 deaths of \ncoalition troops could be attributed to weapons with ties to Iran.\n  Iranian actions are killing Americans and undermining our efforts in \nIraq. The Congress needs to take this threat seriously and begin to \ntake appropriate actions to deal with it. Senator Lieberman's amendment \nis an important step in dealing with the threat that Iran is imposing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed, written by \nSenator Lieberman and carried in the Wall Street Journal on July 6, \n2007, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 6, 2007]\n\n                            Iran's Proxy War\n\n       Earlier this week, the U.S. military made public new land \n     disturbing information about the proxy war that Iran is \n     waging against American soldiers and our allies in Iraq.\n       According to Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner, the U.S. military \n     spokesman in Baghdad, the Iranian government has been using \n     the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah to train and organize \n     Iraqi extremists, who are responsible in turn for the murder \n     of American service members.\n       Gen. Bergner also revealed that the Quds Force--a special \n     unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps whose mission \n     is to finance, arm and equip foreign Islamist terrorist \n     movements--has taken groups of up to 60 Iraqi insurgents at a \n     time and brought them to three camps near Tehran, where they \n     have [received instruction in the use of mortars, rockets, \n     improvised explosive devices and other deadly tools of \n     guerrilla warfare that they use against our troops. Iran has \n     also funded its Iraqi proxies generously, to the tune of $3 \n     million a month.\n       Based on the interrogation of captured extremist leaders--\n     including a 24-year veteran of Hezbollah, apparently \n     dispatched to Iraq by his patrons in Tehran--Gen. Bergner \n     also reported on Monday that the U.S. military has concluded \n     that ``the senior leadership'' in Iran is aware of these \n     terrorist activities. He said it is ``hard to imagine'' \n     Ayatollah Ali Khamenei--Iran's supreme leader--does not know \n     of them.\n       These latest revelations should be a painful wakeup call to \n     the American people, and to the U.S. Congress. They also \n     expand on a steady stream of public statements over the past \n     six months by David Petraeus, the commanding general of our \n     coalition in Iraq, as well as other senior American military \n     and civilian officials about Iran's hostile and violent role \n     in Iraq. In February, for instance, the U.S. military stated \n     that forensic evidence has implicated Iran in the death of at \n     least 170 U.S. soldiers.\n       Iran's actions in Iraq fit a larger pattern of \n     expansionist, extremist behavior across the Middle East \n     today. In addition to sponsoring insurgents in Iraq, Tehran \n     is training, funding and equipping radical Islamist groups in \n     Lebanon, Palestine and Afghanistan--where the Taliban now \n     appear to be receiving Iranian help in their war against the \n     government of President Hamid Karzai and its NATO defenders.\n       While some will no doubt claim that Iran is only attacking \n     U.S. soldiers in Iraq because they are deployed there--and \n     that the solution, therefore, is to withdraw them--Iran's \n     parallel proxy attacks against moderate Palestinians, Afghans \n     and Lebanese directly rebut such claims.\n       Iran is acting aggressively and consistently to undermine \n     moderate regimes in the Middle East, establish itself as the \n     dominant regional power and reshape the region in its own \n     ideological image. The involvement of Hezbollah in Iraq, just \n     revealed by Gen. Bergner, illustrates precisely how \n     interconnected are the different threats and challenges we \n     face in the region. The fanatical government of Iran is the \n     common denominator that links them together.\n       No responsible leader in Washington desires conflict with \n     Iran. But every leader has a responsibility to acknowledge \n     the evidence that the U.S. military has now put before us: \n     The Iranian government, by its actions, has all but declared \n     war on us and our allies in the Middle East.\n       America now has a solemn responsibility to utilize the \n     instruments of our national power to convince Tehran to \n     change its behavior, including the immediate cessation of its \n     training and equipping extremists who are killing our troops.\n       Most of this work must be done by our diplomats, military \n     and intelligence operatives in the field. But Iran's \n     increasingly brazen behavior also presents a test of our \n     political leadership here at home. When Congress reconvenes \n     next week, all of us who are privileged to serve there should \n     set aside whatever partisan or ideological differences divide \n     us to send a clear, strong and unified message to Tehran that \n     it must stop everything it is doing to bring about the death \n     of American service members in Iraq.\n       It is of course everyone's hope that diplomacy alone can \n     achieve this goal. Iran's activities inside Iraq were the \n     central issue raised by the U.S. ambassador to Iraq in his \n     historic meeting with Iranian representatives in Baghdad this \n     May. However, as Gen. Bergner said on Monday, ``There does \n     not seem to be any follow-through on the commitments that \n     Iran has made to work with Iraq in addressing the \n     destabilizing security issues here.'' The fact is, any \n     diplomacy with Iran is more likely to be effective if it is \n     backed by a credible threat of force--credible in the dual \n     sense that we mean it, and the Iranians believe it.\n       Our objective here is deterrence. The fanatical regime in \n     Tehran has concluded that it can use proxies to strike at us \n     and our friends in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Palestine \n     without fear of retaliation. It is time to restore that fear, \n     and to inject greater doubt into the decision-making of \n     Iranian leaders about the risks they are now running.\n       I hope the new revelations about Iran's behavior will also \n     temper the enthusiasm of some of those in Congress who are \n     advocating the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. \n     Iran's purpose in sponsoring attacks on American soldiers, \n     after all, is clear: It hopes to push the U.S. out of Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, so that its proxies can then dominate these \n     states. Tehran knows that an American retreat under fire \n     would send an unmistakable message throughout the region that \n     Iran is on the rise and America is on the run. That would be \n     a disaster for the region and the U.S.\n       The threat posed by Iran to our soldiers' lives, our \n     security as a nation and our allies in the Middle East is a \n     truth that cannot be wished or waved away. It must be \n     confronted head-on. The regime in Iran is betting that our \n     political disunity in Washington will constrain us in \n     responding to its attacks. For the sake of our nation's \n     security, we must unite and prove them wrong.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Connecticut. The amendment puts Iran on notice that \nwe in the Congress are aware of actions taken by Tehran that have \nresulted in the deaths of U.S. service personnel. We are aware of it, \nand we must do everything we can to stop it as quickly as possible.\n  While my colleagues and I may have legitimate differences over our \npolicy in Iraq, we stand firmly united against those individuals and \nregimes that would seek to harm our troops. For some time now, American \ndiplomats and military officers have suspected that key Iranian \nGovernment elements are actively engaged in supporting individuals and \ngroups seeking to destabilize the Iraqi Government and who are \ndeliberately targeting American troops for attack. There is a body of \nevidence, a body of reporting on Iranian material support to Shia \nmilitias, reports that suggest that Iranian support for the most lethal \nof the improvised explosive devices and for armor-piercing explosively \nformed projectiles. Together, these weapons account for a high \npercentage of American casualties in Iraq.\n  But the evidence of Iranian activity in Iraq does not end there. In \norder to increase its influence in Iraq, bleed the United States and \ndisrupt our efforts in Iraq, Iran has engaged in numerous specific \nacts. A few of the publicly available reports include:\n  In February of this year, our military confirmed that at least 170 \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces have\n\n[[Page S8996]]\n\nbeen killed and at least 620 wounded by weapons tied to Iran.\n  On May 27, then-MG William Caldwell, spokesperson for the Multi-\nNational Force in Iraq, said:\n\n       What we do know is that the Iranian intelligence services, \n     the Qods Force, is in fact training, equipping, and funding \n     Shia groups . . . both in Iraq and in Iran. . . . We have in \n     detention now, people that we have captured that, in fact, \n     are Sunni extremist-related that have, in fact, received both \n     some funding and training from the Iranian intelligence \n     services, the Qods Force.\n\n  On April 26, General Petraeus stated that the Qazali network, a \nnetwork directly connected to the Iranian Quds Force, was responsible \nfor the sophisticated attack against the Karbala Provincial Joint \nCoordination Center in Iraq, which resulted in the murder of five \nAmerican soldiers, four of whom were first abducted.\n  Last week Brigadier General Bergner, current spokesman for Multi-\nNational Force Iraq, stated the following:\n\n       The Iranian Quds Force is using Lebanese Hezbollah \n     essentially as a proxy, as a surrogate in Iraq.\n       Coalition forces have captured Ali Musa Daqdaq, whom the \n     U.S. believes to be a 24-year veteran of Lebanese Hezbollah \n     involved in the training of Iraqi extremists in Iraq and \n     Iran.\n       The Iranian Quds Force operates three camps near Tehran \n     where it trains Iraqi extremists in cooperation with Lebanese \n     Hezbollah. The Quds Force, along with Hezbollah instructors, \n     train approximately 20 to 60 Iraqis at a time, sending them \n     back to Iraq organized into these special groups. They are \n     being taught how to use EFPs, mortars, rockets, as well as \n     intelligence, sniper, and kidnapping operations.\n       Iraqi extremists receive between $750,000 and $3 million \n     every month from Iranian sources.\n        . . . our intelligence reveals that senior leadership in \n     Iran is aware of this activity and that it would be hard to \n     imagine that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of \n     Iran, is unaware of it.\n\n  Let me be clear. This amendment is not a call for war. However, it is \na clear message that America stands by our troops and our interests in \nIraq and that all Americans are united against those who would do them \nharm.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us in sending this message. If the \nGovernment of Iran wishes to prevent further international isolation \nand increased tension with the United States, it must take immediate \naction to end all training, arming, equipping, funding, advising, and \nany other forms of support for those who are destabilizing Iraq and \nkilling American troops. That is about as simple as it gets. I would \nhope that however divided we may be on other questions of policy, we \ncan all agree on that.\n  As my friend from Connecticut says, this amendment is a quite \ncommonsense, common-ground proposal that would send a clear message on \nbehalf of America, our interests, and those who risk everything to \nprotect it.\n  I remind my colleagues of several quotes made by various Iranian \nleaders, including the Iranian President Ahmadinejad, who said:\n\n       Israel is a tyrannical regime that will one day be \n     destroyed.\n\n  He said on another occasion:\n\n       Israel is a rotten dry tree that will be annihilated in one \n     storm.\n\n  Another time he said:\n\n       The skirmishes in the occupied land are part of a war of \n     destiny. Israel must be wiped off the map.\n\n  Those are not the words of the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, any one of our enemies, but the elected leader of the \nState of Iran, who has said on numerous occasions that Israel must be \nwiped off the map.\n  So it is not just what the Iranian Government is doing in Iraq, it is \nthe continued threat to the State of Israel. The Iranians, along with \nthe Syrians, continue to arm Hezbollah. They are in the process of \nreplacing the rockets expended in the battle in southern Lebanon as a \nresult of the attack of Hezbollah on Israeli forces, the capture of \nIsraeli servicemen. It is clear that the United Nation's Security \nCouncil resolution calling for the disarmament of Hezbollah in southern \nLebanon is not in any way, sense, or form being enforced. In fact, \nHezbollah is being rearmed rather than disarmed.\n  There is no doubt that the Iranian Government is attempting to \nrealize an age-old dream of Persian influence and superiority in the \nMiddle East. This is a real and serious threat.\n  I haven't even talked about the nuclear weapons development. It is \nwell known to most of my colleagues here--all of them, as a matter of \nfact. As they continue to progress down the path to acquisition of a \nnuclear weapon, I am not concerned--I am concerned, but I am not as \nconcerned about the fact that Iran develops a nuclear weapon and puts \nit on a missile aimed at Israel. I am far more concerned about the \nIranians acquiring a nuclear weapon and handing it over to one of the \nterrorist organizations with which they have intimate and close ties.\n  This is a great threat in the region. Even if we are out of Iraq, \nlet's suppose the worst-case scenario happens. I think one of the \ngreatest threats to stability in the region is the insertion of Iran in \na broad variety of ways in Iraq, beginning with southern Iraq, and \ntheir support of continued organizations that practice terror in the \nregion.\n  I also think that obviously you would have some kind of Sunni \ninvolvement sponsored by the Saudis and you would have a number of \nother catastrophic situations, including the Turks not being able to \nwithstand an independent Kurdish state. All of those are subjects for a \ndebate for another day and discussion.\n  But the threat Iran presents, not just to Iraq, not just to the \nregion, but peace in the world, is real. It is extremely urgent that we \naddress it. If we fail to do so, as we have failed to address threats \nof terrorism in various shapes and forms in the past, we will pay a \nvery heavy price. That is why I am very pleased to support the \namendment of my friend from Connecticut.\n  Before I yield, could I also say I think that the Senator from \nMichigan and I and the Senator from Connecticut would be glad to enter \ninto a time for a vote on this amendment at his convenience and that of \nthe leadership's convenience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the distinguished \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, for his strong, clear, \nconvincing, compelling statement to me. I am honored he has signed on \nas a cosponsor of this amendment I have offered, which is specifically \nrelated to the Iranian support, training, equipping of terrorists that \ngo back into Iraq, are responsible for the death of Americans and \nIraqis.\n  He stated the evidence very clearly. It is powerful evidence. This is \nan opportunity, as he said, no matter where you are on whether we ought \nto have a mandatory deadline or a goal or whatever about our policy in \nIraq, to stand together and say, when American soldiers are being \nkilled as the result of a concerted campaign by another government, \nacting through its agents, and our military--not some distant third \nparty--but our military and our intelligence community are telling us \nthat, clearly we are going to stand together here in the Senate and \nsend a united message to Tehran: We know what you are doing. Stop it.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona and Senator Kyl, who spoke before.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nCollins of Maine and Senator Sessions of Alabama as cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lieberman for offering \nthis amendment because it is a very detailed list of activities that \nthe Iranian Government is engaging in.\n  I say the Iranian Government purposefully, because I do believe that \nparts of their Government are deeply involved in trying to undermine \nour activity in Iraq. I hope this is something we can rally behind. I \nhope this is one of the amendments the whole Congress can get behind, \nthe whole Senate can get behind, just as we have with pay raises and \nother things to help the troops.\n  I guess I would ask the question a different way: Do you doubt that \nwhat Senators Lieberman and McCain have just alleged about Iranian \nactivity is true? Does any Member of the Senate question the \naccusations that are being\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\nleveled at the Iranian operatives and Government vis-a-vis their \ninvolvement in Iraq? Is it something we can all agree on?\n  I would say that if you disagree, come to the floor and tell us why \nwe are wrong. As you have just heard from Senators McCain, Lieberman, \nand Kyl, the accusations are very serious and they run deep. The \naccusations basically say that the Iranian Government, through the Quds \norganization, their military revolutionary, their guard component, is \nactively involved in undermining the young democracy in Iraq, and \nactively involved in killing Americans.\n  If you doubt that, if you disagree with that, come and tell us where \nwe are wrong. If you agree with that concept, this a chance to speak up \nand say that is wrong. I hope everyone in this body can muster the \nability to tell the Iranian Government that what you are doing in Iraq \nis wrong and must stop.\n  The question we must ask ourselves as a nation is: Why is Iran doing \nthis? Everyone has a reason for whatever decision they make as a \ngovernmental body. Every organization has a reason for whatever \ndecision they make. Iran has a reason. Can we figure that out? Is it a \nmystery to us? It is not a mystery to me. The reason I think Iran is \ntrying to destabilize Iraq and drive Americans out of Iraq and the \nregion is because Iran's worst nightmare is a functioning democracy on \ntheir border.\n  Iran is a theocracy controlled by some of the most brutal people in \nthe Middle East. The Iranian President is up there in terms of rhetoric \nwith Adolph Hitler. He is saying things in 2005, 2006, and 2007 that \nyou thought were coming out of the 1920s and 1930s. Does he mean it? I \nthink he does.\n  Senator McCain said the second prize would be a missile with a \nnuclear weapon aimed at Israel. That is second prize. First prize for a \nnuclear-armed Iran would be a terrorist organization getting the bomb.\n  Now, does anybody believe Iran is trying to produce power through a \nnuclear program for peaceful purposes? Come here and say so. Do you \nhave any doubt that the Iranian regime is trying to go nuclear for all \nof the wrong reasons? I have no doubt, I have no doubt that they are in \nIraq trying to kill Americans so we will leave. I have no doubt they \nwish the Maliki government and anything like the Maliki government to \nfail. They are not interested in a democracy in their backyard. Neither \nis Syria. The biggest threat they can imagine is to have neighbors who \ncan decide their own fate, to have people next door who can vote for \ntheir own leaders, where Sunnis, Shiahs, and Kurds come together, form \na new economy and a new government. That is a dictator's, a theocracy's \nworst nightmare.\n  I completely understood why Iran is doing what they are doing. What I \ncannot understand is why we are doing what we are about to do. Why \nwould we abandon this infant democracy, even though it is harder than \nwe would like. We have made mistakes that are too numerous to count. \nBut look at our own history. It took us 11 years to write our own \nConstitution. Four years ago the people in Iraq were living under a \nbrutal dictator. Four years ago the police force had one mission: Take \ncare of the dictator. The Army had one goal: Take care of the dictator.\n  Now you have people trying to come together and found a new country \nout of the ashes of a dictatorship. If you look at history, at our own \nhistory, you know how hard it is. But let me tell you the payoffs are \nenormous if we could pull this off. And when I say ``we,'' I mean \nAmericans and the big moderate forces in Iraq. It will transform the \nregion.\n  Look at what happened to Qadhafi when Saddam Hussein went down. \nThings matter. If we fail in Iraq, it matters. And all the momentum \nthat would be built by a successful outcome, which I think is very \npossible, that same--a different type momentum will be created by \nfailure.\n  Who is the biggest winner and loser in Iraq? If Iraq fails, if the \nGovernment collapses and it becomes a chaotic situation, who would win? \nI would argue that at the top of the list would be al-Qaida, because \nal-Qaida would have a place to operate. I am not saying al-Qaida \ndominates all of Iraq. I am saying they will have regions in Iraq where \nthey use fear and intimidation to operate and they will be stronger.\n  I do believe with all of my heart and soul that if Iraq fails and \nthis new democracy is curbed, the biggest winner will be the Iranian \nstate. They will have influence over parts of Iraq that will make them \nstronger.\n  Another big loser would be Turkey, because the Kurdish north will \nbecome incredibly unstable. So I do not think it is a mystery as to \nwhat Iran is up to. They are trying to destroy a force that presents a \ngreat threat to their existence, their existence as a theocracy that \nsuppresses any form of moderation.\n  We have a magic moment in the Middle East to change it for the \nbetter. It is going to be hard, it is going to be tough, and it is \ngoing to take sacrifice, but it will work if we stay with a model that \nhas always worked.\n  What is that model? When people get up and preach the destruction of \ntheir neighbor and they preach genocide and they preach hate and \ndivision, the model that has always worked is for the good people to \nsay no. Every time someone like the President of Iran has come along \nwith his hateful, destructive message and no one checks it, over time \ngood people die. Eventually, the killing gets to be so great and the \ncarnage is so hard to look at, good people rally to stop it. We have a \nchance here to head off what I think is a bloodbath in the making. We \nhave a chance to control an Iranian Government that is up to no good. \nWe have a chance to stand with the forces of moderation and affect the \noutcome in Iraq for the better.\n  Will they become the United States of Iraq overnight? No. But here \nis, indeed, good news, that due to the surge, with additional military \ncapability, there is something going on in Iraq that should be \nencouraging. Al-Qaida flourished under the old strategy. They were able \nto dominate different regions of Iraq. When they had control of those \nregions, they did what every thuggish group has done in history. They \ndid what every ideologically driven, hate-filled group has always done. \nThey overplayed their hand. They have done some vicious, terrible \nthings, and the people who have lived under their thumb have said: I \nhave had enough. This new strategy has empowered these people in the \nSunni areas of Iraq to turn away from al-Qaida and embrace something \nnew. It has been possible because of General Petraeus and our brave men \nand women. Indeed, it is good news.\n  At the end of the day, this war on terror is about choices. Our hopes \nand dreams are that people in the Mideast, if given a choice, will \nreject al-Qaida and find a new way. Our hope and dream is that the \nIranian regime will not get stronger but weaker. The only way to ensure \nthat it will get weaker is to make sure its neighbors are protected \nfrom its vicious behavior. The only way we will ever win this war is \nnot just killing al-Qaida but giving the power to those who say no to \nal-Qaida to control their own destiny. The only way we will ever \ncontrol Iran is to stand up to it, just as we had a chance with Hitler \nand we let many opportunities pass.\n  Do I believe Iran is going to conquer the world? No. But I do believe \nIran unchecked will change the world for the worse. I believe with all \nmy heart and soul that Iranian efforts to get a nuclear weapon are \nreal, and if they are successful, we will have a nightmare on our hands \nbecause I think they would use the weapon or at least empower somebody \nwho would use the weapon. That would create chaos in the Mideast. I \nknow that if I am the Prime Minister of Israel, I am not going to sit \non the sidelines and watch that happen. I believe if Iran gets more out \nof control than they are now, you are going to create a nuclear arms \nrace in the Mideast. I believe if Iraq can push through the hard times \nand we can achieve stability and say no to al-Qaida and contain Iran, \nmomentum will be built for the next generation of those in Iraq and all \nover the Mideast to embrace a form of living we can tolerate.\n  There are plenty of people in Iraq--and I have met them, and you \nhave, too--who are dying for their own freedom. What more can we ask? \nIf you want to be a judge in the United States, you go through a \nconfirmation hearing, and it is pretty awful. If you want to be a judge \nin Iraq, they try to\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\nkill your family. If you want to be a political leader in the United \nStates, it is a pretty tough life, but in Iraq it could end your life.\n  To those who are willing to raise their hand and say: I am willing to \nstand up to al-Qaida, I have had enough, God bless you. May God bless \nyou. May the United States have the courage to stand by you. To those \nwho see Iran as a growing threat, God bless you. May the United States \nhave the courage to stand by you. To the young men and women who are \ngoing for the third and fourth time, God bless you. You see it better \nthan anybody else. You know why you go back. You go back because you \nsee hope where people here see no hope. You see change where we deny \nchange exists. You see the ability to make the world better through \nyour sacrifice, and you see the ability of passing on a better world to \nyour children. You see the ability to affect things for the better so \nyour kids won't have to do what you are doing. God bless you.\n  I hope and pray that this Congress, this Senate, and this country can \nmuster the will to do the things that have always worked in the past. \nWhen you see evil, don't appease it; confront it. When you see hatred \nand bigotry, change it. Be willing to do the hard things now so that \nthere will be a better life for those who come behind.\n  This strategy called the surge has been long overdue. We have paid a \nheavy price for misunderstanding the nature of what was required after \nthe fall of Baghdad. We have been stubborn, and at times we have been \narrogant. But at the end of the day, we are a good people. We stand for \nthe good. The best we have is our men and women in uniform, and they \nare there in large numbers, volunteering to stay and to keep \nreenlisting. Whatever mistakes we have made in the past, let's not \ncompound them.\n\n  I argue to my colleagues that the biggest mistake is yet to come, a \nmistake for the ages. That would be to adopt a policy that will make \nsure Iran wins and this new democracy in Iraq fails, to adopt a policy \nthat will allow al-Qaida to come back stronger than they were before--\nand they will, as surely as I am standing here speaking--and slaughter \nthose who have chosen to say no to them. If that happens, there will be \na whole generation of moderation in the Mideast silenced. That will \nmean the next generation of Americans will be in the Mideast for a \nbigger war to fight. It is really literally up to us, as a \ndemocratically elected body, as to what course we take.\n  I do not question anybody's intent, patriotism, or motivation. But \ndon't be blinded by the mistakes of the past. Don't misunderstand our \nenemy. Our enemy does not want to be misunderstood. Al-Qaida has \nwritten out the script for the world. The script says: Get us out of \nthe Mideast, destroy forms of moderation in the Gulf States, and \ndestroy Israel. They have written it down, just as Hitler wrote it \ndown. I believe it can be stopped, just as Hitler was stopped. The \nIranian leadership is not hiding where they want to go. They are \nchallenging us to stop them. I hope we will rise to the occasion \nbecause we can stop them. The strongest weapon in our arsenal is not \njust the brave men and women who take up arms but the value system of \nour country which is so much superior to the hate-filled demagoguery of \nal-Qaida and to the totalitarian nature of Iran.\n  These are monumental times which I thought I would never live to see. \nI never thought in my lifetime I would see the world go backward \ninstead of forward when it comes to standing up to evil. But such is \nlife, such is fate.\n  To the brave men and women who have reenlisted and gone back for the \nthird and fourth time, here is what I can say about you: History will \njudge you well because when your country needed you the most, you did \nnot follow the political moment; you followed ideals that will last for \na lifetime--truth, justice, and the American way.\n  God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am very appreciative of the remarks of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. His eloquence is both compelling and informative.\n  I thank my friend from Connecticut for his amendment.\n  Mr. President, there has been printed in the Record an article by \nSenator Lieberman of Friday July 6, 2007, that appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  I hope many of my colleagues will find the time to read this piece by \nSenator Lieberman.\n  My friends from South Carolina and from Connecticut have made the \narguments on behalf of the present strategy. One of the aspects of this \ndebate we are in will center to some degree around Iranian influence in \nIraq and the need for, or not, face-to-face talks with Iran. Let me \nmake it clear in the beginning that I think America should be ready to \ntalk to anybody at any time under any circumstances as long as somehow \nit isn't injurious to America's prestige or cause. But I think those \nwho would come to this floor and argue about the need for face-to-face \ntalks with the Iranians and how somehow that is the Rosetta Stone or \nnirvana--something that all we need to do is sit down and talk face to \nface with the Iranians--should be aware of the recent experience we \nhave had with the Iranians. There were talks between Washington and \nTehran last month in Baghdad, and the subject was security issues. Many \nof us were aware of those.\n  I quote the chief military spokesman, BG Kevin Bergner:\n\n       There absolutely is evidence of Iranian operatives holding \n     weapons, training fighters, providing resources, helping plan \n     operations, resourcing secret cells that is destabilizing \n     Iraq.\n       We would like very much to see some action on their part to \n     reduce the level of effort and help contribute to Iraq's \n     security. We have not seen it yet.\n\n  Obviously, we know that tensions between the United States and Iran \nare very high, especially after the United States seized five Iranians \nearlier this year in northern Iraq for which there was clear and \ncompelling evidence they were helping the insurgents. We also know Iran \nhas five U.S. Iranian citizens held on ``security-related charges,'' a \ngross violation of human rights. I am surprised there is not more \noutrage in the United States over this basic kidnapping of American \ncitizens.\n  The important part of this discussion is that our Ambassador to Iraq, \nMr. Ryan Crocker, met with his Iranian counterpart last month in \nBaghdad. I know I share the view of most people who have had interface \nwith Ambassador Crocker that he is one of the finest who has ever \nserved in the Foreign Service as a diplomat and representative of the \nUnited States in all parts of the Middle East. One of the issues \nAmbassador Crocker raised was the type of roadside bomb which cuts \nthrough armor and is most lethal that is being supplied by the \nIranians. Tehran's response last week was that they would study a \nrequest from Baghdad for a second meeting but warned the decision may \ntake weeks.\n  Our No. 2 U.S. diplomat, Daniel Speckhard, said:\n\n       We do not yet have another meeting scheduled for that \n     dialogue with Iraq and Iran.\n\n  He said the first meeting produced general assurances that Tehran had \na common interest in seeing a stable Iraq on its border, but these \nwords had not been matched by deeds.\n  In other words, we have had a meeting with the Iranians. We have had \nvarious representations and representatives approach the Iranians on \nthis issue. We have tried very hard and we will continue to try very \nhard to convince the Iranians that chaos in Iraq is not in their \ninterest. I am not talking about U.S. interest but their interest. But \nit seems, as Daniel Speckhard said, what we have seen during the first \nmeeting is, from our perspective, a sense that their actions were out \nof line with their stated goals and objectives.\n  Relations between the two countries obviously are being strained by \nIran's nuclear program, which, in the minds of most experts, is by no \nmeans peaceful.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, and this will be part of \none of the amendments that is proposed, the United States should engage \nin face-to-face talks with the Iranians. That is fine. As I say, it is \nfine with me as long as it doesn't undermine U.S. prestige and enhance \nthe prestige of a nation that continues to say things such as:\n\n       Anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the \n     Islamic nation's fury.\n       Remove Israel before it is too late and save yourself from \n     the fury of regional nations.\n       Israel is a tyrannical regime that one day will be \n     destroyed.\n\n  We are supposed to sit down in face-to-face negotiations with a \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\nwhose President said, concerning the Holocaust:\n\n       They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and \n     place this above God, religions and the prophets.\n       The real Holocaust is what is happening in Palestine where \n     the Zionists avail themselves of the fairy tale of Holocaust \n     as blackmail and justification for killing children and women \n     and making innocent people homeless.\n\n  That is the rhetoric of the Government of Iran.\n  I hope we can convince them that an al-Qaida-significant presence in \nIraq and increased chaos in the region is not in Iran's long-term \ninterests because we need them. We need them to join with us in trying \nto bring about some kind of stability in the region. I hope that will \nhappen.\n  I note the presence of the deputy Democratic leader on the floor. As \nI have discussed with the Senator from Michigan, the distinguished \nchairman, we are prepared to vote at whatever the leader's convenience \nis. It is my understanding--if I could have the attention of the \nSenator from Michigan--that after that, according to our conversation--\n  Mr. LEVIN. I apologize, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is quite all right--that there would be a pending \nHagel amendment and then a discussion of an amendment by Senators \nSalazar and Alexander, and then there would be made in order probably a \nKyl amendment from this side, in keeping with the back and forth of \namendments, obviously, depending on the good will and agreement of the \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are drafting a unanimous consent request \nto put in place what the Senator from Arizona has just described. But \nwhat it would be is that immediately following the disposition of the \nLieberman amendment, as modified--and the modification is almost \ncompleted--that then there would be a recognition of Senator Hagel, \nwith 2 hours, I believe, equally divided, and then there would be--I \nhave not had a chance to talk with the Senator from Arizona, but it may \nbe preferable to have the Kyl amendment just offered and laid down \ntoday and then the hour for Senators Salazar and Alexander and their \ncosponsors, with a half an hour, as I understand it, for the Senator \nfrom Arizona or his designee, to be recognized after that hour for \nSenators Alexander and Salazar et al. But their hour would be purely \nfor a matter of debate. There is no amendment of theirs that would be \npending at this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I ask the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Michigan? Perhaps an hour for Senators Salazar and Alexander and a \nhalf hour at the same time, so perhaps we could have a back and forth \nand use the hour and a half in its entirety, if that would be \nagreeable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think that would be the intention.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could ask the distinguished managers, \nthis amendment by Messrs. Salazar and Alexander is of considerable \nimportance, and there are some of us who would like to comment on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure. Could I respond?\n  Mr. WARNER. Not as a part of that hour. I think they wish to have an \nhour reserved under the two principals together with their \ndistinguished list of cosponsors. There are some of us who are not \ncosponsors who may have comments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe that this hour they asked for is \nin addition to the discussion of the regular amendment when it comes up \non the floor sometime in the next--\n  Mr. LEVIN. Whenever it comes up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Whenever it comes up. They were seeking unanimous consent \njust to discuss for an hour the merits of their amendment. I had said, \nwell, we should try to also have a half hour and a time limit. \nObviously, all of this is in keeping with the wishes of the majority. \nThe Senator from Michigan and I are trying to--\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, it is simply that I have some concerns about the \nSalazar-Alexander amendment. I do not wish to encroach on such time as \nthey wish, but it would seem to me those of us who may have some \nconcerns should have the opportunity to speak in the proximity of their \ndiscussion so the Members would have the benefit of both views.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that, Senator \nMcCain, actually, I think, was intending to protect that interest in \nthe half hour which he requested. If that is not sufficient, then we \ncould make that an hour.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would perhaps seek to have 10 minutes. \nThat is all.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, why don't we do this: have an hour--and I \nam sure we will not use it--an hour each.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We will have a unanimous consent request. This is being \ncleared on our side. I would also ask that Senator Smith be recognized \nfor 10 minutes between now and the time we will, hopefully, vote on the \nLieberman amendment.\n  Is the modification at the desk? Is that ready?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I say to the Senator, through you, Mr. President, the \nmodification is ready.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Illinois is going \nto be recognized at this point. After he has his colloquy with Senator \nLieberman, I would again seek the floor to put in place that unanimous \nconsent agreement which we have just broadly outlined.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent, \nthrough the Chair, to have a brief colloquy with Senator Lieberman \nabout his pending amendment, as modified, so there is clarification \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, we all acknowledge that Iran is involved in sending deadly \nweapons into Iraq which are threatening the lives of American soldiers \nas well as those who are trying to seek a peaceful and stable Iraq. \nThat is a fact. It is one that the Senator from Connecticut has \ncondemned, and I join him in that condemnation. I think that is a large \npart of his effort with this amendment.\n  Secondly, I might add that Senator Smith of Oregon and I have \nintroduced a resolution relative to the proliferation issue in Iran, \nand we have quite a few cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. We are \nnot calling it on this bill, but we may soon, and to find diplomatic \nways to discourage Iran from developing nuclear weapons, which would be \ndestabilizing and dangerous to the Middle East and the world.\n  But I have a specific question I want to ask of the Senator from \nConnecticut in light of the modification of his amendment. Does this \namendment, now, that the Senator has presented, as modified, authorize \nthe use of military force by the United States against Iran?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, through you, responding to my friend \nfrom Illinois, the direct and short answer is no, it does not. In fact, \nin the modification I will soon send to the desk, we have added a \nsection that says explicitly what was intended implicitly, which is, \n``Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize or otherwise \nspeak to the use of Armed Forces against Iran.''\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, my hope here--in the midst of a \ncontentious debate in which there is division in the Senate--is that no \nmatter where one stands on the issues we are debating, on the facts \nthat the U.S. military has presented about the complicity of Iran and \nits agents in training and equipping terrorists who are then coming in \nand killing Americans and Iraqis, there is agreement. And there is \nagreement also on the ``therefores'' or the ``resolved,'' which is, \nthese are intolerable and unacceptable acts, and we call on the \nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran to take immediate action to \nstop them.\n  Significantly--to me, anyway--we set up an operational procedure \nwhere, in the first 30 days and then every 60 days thereafter, General \nPetraeus or his successor, the Ambassador to Iraq and successor, will \nreport to us on any new evidence about the activities of Iran in Iraq.\n  But because I want very much for this to be a statement that as many \nof the Members here--hopefully, all--could support, I do want to make \nit clear because I understand this is not\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\nmeant as an authorization of the use of force or in any other way to \nspeak to the use of force against Iran.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nthis clarification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I might, at this time I would like \nto send to the desk a series of modifications to this amendment that \nare the result of negotiations, particularly with my friend from \nMichigan, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin.\n  I have been told we are still working on it. I thought we had \nagreement. OK. So I will say we continue to work on these \nmodifications, which the ones I have seen we have approved together.\n  Does the Senator from Michigan have late-breaking news?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the only issue \nis it is not in the proper form. I would urge the Senator to describe \nthat modification. By the time he describes it, and I have had a \ncomment or two, it will be in a form we could send to the desk.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Excellent. Essentially, these are corrections to \nclarify what the intention of myself and the sponsors, such as Senator \nMcCain, were in submitting this. There were some helpful suggestions \nmade, for instance, from the Intelligence Committee that wanted the \nreports done by the commander of the Multi-National Force and our \nAmbassador to Iraq to be done in cooperation with the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  We have added a specific recitation of the fact that on May 28 of \nthis year, Ambassador Crocker met in Baghdad with representatives of \nthe Government of Iran to express concern about Iranian anticoalition \nactivity in Iraq.\n  We call on the Director of National Intelligence to issue the \nNational Intelligence Estimate on Iran that has been promised for some \ntime now without further delay.\n  We indicate that we support diplomacy with the representatives of the \nGovernment of Iran in order to stop any actions by the Iranian \nGovernment or its agents against U.S. servicemembers in Iraq.\n  Again, we hope they will respond to these diplomatic initiatives.\n  And then, finally, the section I referred to in my colloquy with \nSenator Durbin, that this is not intended to authorize or otherwise \nspeak to the use of Armed Forces against Iran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me again thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for these modifications. There are a number of other \nsmaller modifications in the body of the amendment. The only one which \nI will read, make note of here--although there are a number of other \nvery small ones--however, the one I do want to particularly point out, \nfor those who are following this debate, is that the words ``of \nhostility'' are eliminated on line 14, page 7 in order to avoid any \nsuggestion that this--I will give my interpretation, which I think fits \nexactly with what the Senator from Connecticut said--to avoid any \nimplication in the body of the amendment that there is an authorization \nhere for the use of force. And the words ``of hostility,'' in the \ncontext of that line, might have given an impression contrary to what \nis now explicit, that ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to \nauthorize or otherwise speak to the use of Armed Forces against Iran.''\n  Again, I thank our friend from Connecticut for these modifications. I \nsupport the amendment. In fact, I ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas a cosponsor to the amendment, and that Senator Salazar be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With that, Mr. President, we wait for the form, and also \nthe unanimous consent request which--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, maybe we could let Senator Smith proceed \nand then----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as soon as the modification is in proper \nform, it is the stated intention of the Senator from Connecticut to \nsend that to the desk. In the meantime, if the Senator from Oregon \ncould be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I just ask, is it the intention of \nthe Senator from Michigan to call for a vote immediately after Senator \nSmith's 10 minutes, to alert all Members?\n  Mr. LEVIN. To alert all Members, I think we will be ready for a vote \nat 5 minutes to 4 o'clock on the Lieberman amendment.\n  Should we get the yeas and nays on that amendment now? We have to \nwait until after it is modified to get the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to say to the senior Senator from \nArizona how much I admire him. In recent days, because of my difference \nwith Senator McCain on the way forward in Iraq, many members of the \npress, particularly in my home State, have asked me how can I continue \nto support Senator McCain. I would like to answer that publicly for the \nSenate Record.\n  I support Senator McCain for more than just the fact that he is a \ncolleague, for more than just the fact that he is a genuine American \nhero, for more than the fact that he is a man of unbreakable \nprinciple. I support him still because he is my friend. When friends \nhave differences, you don't walk away from a friend. I don't. You \nweather the bumps in the road, and you do what Senator McCain has done \nwith me; and that is to talk civilly and to counsel, and when there is \na disagreement, that it is discussed as gentlemen, that it is discussed \nas friends.\n\n  But I come to the floor to speak for the Levin-Reed amendment. I am \nthe original Republican cosponsor of this proposal. I am proud to \ncosponsor this amendment because it calls for what I have been stating \nfor 7 months. It sets up a timetable to draw down our troops.\n  The amendment instructs the Secretary of Defense to transition U.S. \nforces starting approximately 4 months from the enactment of this \nlegislation through the spring of 2008. Further, this amendment \nexplicitly outlines the role of the U.S. military in Iraq as threefold. \nAn appropriate amount of troops will remain to protect our diplomats, \nour military installations, and infrastructure. We will continue to \ntrain, equip, and provide logistical and intelligence support to the \nIraqi security forces, sharing intelligence with them. Then, the third \nand most important point: We will be there to turn over every rock, \nevery crevice, and seek out every al-Qaida killer who wishes to harm \nAmericans.\n  Al-Qaida is our mortal foe. This is the war on terror, for want of a \nbetter term. It is a war from which we cannot retreat.\n  Over the past 7 months, when I spoke out pleading for a new course in \nIraq, there has been a great cacophony of noise about how to go \nforward. Some of my colleagues have said to just cut off the funding. I \nhave believed that to be dangerous and dishonorable. President Bush has \nsaid stay the course, and I find that troubling. What ``stay the \ncourse'' means is, we will continue to spend $12 billion a month. We \nwill lose roughly three American soldiers a day. In addition to that, \nthere will be countless wounded and maimed for life, for which I don't \nhave a number.\n  Underpinning the current course and the argument of many of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle is the hope, the predicate, that \nat the end of the road there will be an Iraqi government that will \ngovern effectively and democratically. I believe President Bush's \nformulation, that we will stand down when they can stand up, is \nbackwards. I come to that conclusion, based on numerous trips to Iraq, \nthat they will not stand up until we begin standing down.\n  Like Senator McCain and many of my colleagues, I recently was in \nIraq. To be with our troops is to be inspired, to be humbled in their \npresence because of the remarkable work they are doing and the cause \nfor which they are fighting. As inspiring as that is, it is equally \ndepressing, then, to meet with Iraqi political leaders, democratically \nelected, whom we think ought to be focused on reconciliation. What I \nhave found is they are focused on revenge. What I have learned \nfirsthand is that Americans have no comprehension of the complexity, \nthe factionalism, and the intensity of hatred that exists in some parts \nof the Middle East. On top of the factionalism, there are ancient \nsectarian strifes which produced a low-grade civil war that we cannot \nwin, and\n\n[[Page S9001]]\n\nwhich is not ours to win. It is theirs to win.\n  As I said 7 months ago, there is no good option for how we come home, \nbut it does seem to me that Senator Levin and Senator Reed best express \nmy own conclusions. That is why I cosponsored their amendment, and that \nis to recognize al-Qaida is our mortal foe. We must take them on where \nwe can. But, ultimately, we have to get capable and effective Iraqi \npolitical leaders, too, so that they are pressured to do the most basic \nkinds of governing: establishing an oil revenue-sharing law, \ndebaathification, setting up local elections, allowing the processes of \ndemocracy to work, establishing a rule of law that gives people \nconfidence, spending their oil revenue money for the restructuring and \nrebuilding of their own country. All of the money from the oil we are \nhelping them pump sits in bank accounts, stuck by their Parliament.\n  My fear is that what our presence and current posture are doing is \nsimply keeping a civil war at a low-grade level. Civil wars end in one \nof two ways: one side wins and the other loses, or they fight it out \nuntil they figure it out. My fear is that we delay the day for them \nfiguring it out with our current posture. I would love to be proven \nwrong. I pray that President Bush is right. But I believe it is our \nobligation to have this debate to help change the course and the policy \nof the U.S. Government and to help change the course and policy of the \nIraqi Government. We cannot want democracy more for them than they want \nit for themselves, and what they seem bent on is an ethnic cleansing of \ntheir neighborhoods, a religious division. Ultimately, those are their \ndecisions, not ours. But as long as we say we will take the bullet \nfirst, they will let us.\n  I believe the Levin amendment provides a way forward with a \nresponsible division of labor. Let the Iraqi forces that we have \ntrained and equipped handle their security in Baghdad and in other \ncommunities. Let us help them by taking on al-Qaida. The amendment \nenvisions a much smaller American footprint. Our forces are trained and \nequipped in a way to handle that kind of mission, but as we speak, we \nare straining our military capacities and our personnel to a breaking \npoint. I don't believe we should just abandon it, irrespective of \nconsequences. That is why I urge my colleagues to look seriously at the \nLevin amendment, to consider it as the way forward that is both \nresponsible as it relates to the Middle East and effective as it \nrelates to the defense of the American people.\n  So as a Republican, I am for the Levin amendment. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first thank my good friend from \nOregon for his extraordinarily prescient and moving statement. His \nsupport of this amendment has been a matter of great importance to the \nNation, as well as to him personally and to the troops and their \nfamilies. I want to personally tell him how moved I am by his words, \nand I wish everybody in this country could have heard his words. \nHopefully, as many as possible will take a moment to read the words of \nSenator Smith.\n  Mr. President, I believe we will be ready to move to a vote very \nshortly. I think there will be a UC which will set the time for 10 \nminutes after 4, but we will wait for the staff. Can we announce that \nit will be 4:10 for the vote? If I could get the attention of the \nSenator from Arizona, because I am asking for unanimous consent that \nthe vote now be scheduled for 10 minutes after 4.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Whatever the Senator says.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. Between now and then, the \nmodification will, hopefully, be ready. It is at the desk. Does this \nrequire a motion or a unanimous consent or just a request to modify? I \nthink the Senator from Connecticut needs----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has the right to modify the \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--actually, I \ndon't have to ask unanimous consent; it is automatically modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified with the \nchanges that are at the desk.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. REPORT ON SUPPORT FROM IRAN FOR ATTACKS AGAINST \n                   COALITION FORCES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since January 19, 1984, the Secretary of State has \n     designated the Islamic Republic of Iran as a ``state sponsor \n     of terrorism,'' one of only five countries in the world at \n     present so designated.\n       (2) The Department of State, in its most recent ``Country \n     Reports on Terrorism,'' stated that ``Iran remained the most \n     active state sponsor of terrorism'' in 2006.\n       (3) The most recent Country Reports on Terrorism report \n     further stated, ``Iran continued [in 2006] to play a \n     destabilizing role in Iraq. . . Iran provided guidance and \n     training to select Iraqi Shia political groups, and weapons \n     and training to Shia militant groups to enable anti-Coalition \n     attacks. Iranian government forces have been responsible for \n     at least some of the increasing lethality of anti-Coalition \n     attacks by providing Shia militants with the capability to \n     build IEDs with explosively formed projectiles similar to \n     those developed by Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard was linked to armor-piercing explosives \n     that resulted in the deaths of Coalition Forces.''\n       (4) In an interview published on June 7, 2006, Zalmay \n     Khalilzad, then-United States ambassador to Iraq, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We can say \n     with certainty that they support groups that are attacking \n     coalition troops. These groups are using the same ammunition \n     to destroy armored vehicles that the Iranians are supplying \n     to Hezbollah in Lebanon. They pay money to Shiite militias \n     and they train some of the groups. We can't say whether \n     Teheran is supporting Al Qaeda, but we do know that Al Qaeda \n     people come here from Pakistan through Iran. And Ansar al \n     Sunna, a partner organization of Zarqawi's network, has a \n     base in northwest Iran.''\n       (5) On April 26, 2007, General David Petraeus, commander of \n     Multi-National Force-Iraq, said of Iranian support for \n     extremist activity in Iraq, ``The level of financing, the \n     level of training on Iranian soil, the level of equipping \n     some sophisticated technologies . . . even advice in some \n     cases, has been very, very substantial and very harmful.''\n       (6) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus also said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We know \n     that it goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is \n     the head of the Qods Force . . . We believe that he works \n     directly for the supreme leader of the country.''\n       (7) On May 27, 2007, then-Major General William Caldwell, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, said, ``What we \n     do know is that the Iranian intelligence services, the Qods \n     Force, is in fact both training, equipping, and funding Shia \n     extremist groups. . . both in Iraq and also in Iran. . .. We \n     have in detention now people that we have captured that, in \n     fact, are Sunni extremist-related that have, in fact, \n     received both some funding and training from the Iranian \n     intelligence services, the Qods Force.''\n       (8) On February 27, 2007, in testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Lieutenant General Michael \n     Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We believe \n     Hezbollah is involved in the training as well.''\n       (9) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Kevin Bergner, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, stated, ``The \n     Iranian Qods Force is using Lebanese Hezbollah essentially as \n     a proxy, as a surrogate in Iraq.''\n       (10) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner detailed \n     the capture in southern Iraq by coalition forces of Ali Musa \n     Daqdaq, whom the United States military believes to be a 24-\n     year veteran of Lebanese Hezbollah involved in the training \n     of Iraqi extremists in Iraq and Iran.\n       (11) The Department of State designates Hezbollah a foreign \n     terrorist organization.\n       (12) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the Iranian Qods Force operates three camps near Teheran \n     where it trains Iraqi extremists in cooperation with Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, stating, ``The Qods Force, along with Hezbollah \n     instructors, train approximately 20 to 60 Iraqis at a time, \n     sending them back to Iraq organized into these special \n     groups. They are being taught how to use EPFs [explosively \n     formed penetrators], mortars, rockets, as well as \n     intelligence, sniper, and kidnapping operations.''\n       (13) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     Iraqi extremists receive between $750,000 and $3,000,000 \n     every month from Iranian sources.\n       (14) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     ``[o]ur intelligence reveals that senior leadership in Iran \n     is aware of this activity'' and that it would be ``hard to \n     imagine'' that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of \n     Iran, is unaware of it.\n       (15) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated, \n     ``There does not seem to be any follow-through on the \n     commitments that Iran has made to work with Iraq in \n     addressing the destabilizing security issues here in Iraq.''\n       (16) On February 11, 2007, the United States military held \n     a briefing in Baghdad at which its representatives stated \n     that at least 170 members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have been killed, and at least 620 wounded, by weapons tied \n     to Iran.\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\n       (17) On January 20, 2007, a sophisticated attack was \n     launched by insurgents at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center in Iraq, resulting in the murder of five \n     American soldiers, four of whom were first abducted.\n       (18) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus stated that the \n     so-called Qazali network was responsible for the attack on \n     the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center and that \n     ``there's no question that the Qazali network is directly \n     connected to the Iranian Qods force [and has] received money, \n     training, arms, ammunition, and at some points in time even \n     advice and assistance and direction''.\n       (19) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the United States Armed Forces possesses documentary evidence \n     that the Qods Force had developed detailed information on the \n     United States position at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center ``regarding our soldiers' activities, \n     shift changes, and defenses, and this information was shared \n     with the attackers''.\n       (20) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated of \n     the January 20 Karbala attackers, ``[They] could not have \n     conducted this complex operation without the support and \n     direction of the Qods Force.''\n       (21) On May 28, 2007, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     Ryan Crocker, met in Baghdad with representatives of the \n     government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to express U.S. \n     concern about Iranian anti-coalition activity in Iraq;\n       (22) Section 1213(a) of the FY 2007 John Warner National \n     Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 109-364) required that the \n     intelligence community produce an updated National \n     Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable and \n     unacceptable act against the United States by the foreign \n     government in question; and\n       (2) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran must \n     take immediate action to end any training, arming, equipping, \n     funding, advising, and any other forms of support that it or \n     its agents are providing, and have provided, to Iraqi \n     militias and insurgents, who are contributing to the \n     destabilization of Iraq and are responsible for the murder of \n     members of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (3) It is imperative for the executive and legislative \n     branches of the federal government to have accurate \n     intelligence on Iran and therefore the intelligence community \n     should produce the NIE on Iran without further delay;\n       (4) Congress supports U.S. diplomacy with the \n     representatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran in order to stop any actions by the Iranian government \n     or its agents against U.S. service members in Iraq;\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 60 days thereafter, the \n     Commander, Multi-National Forces Iraq and the United States \n     Ambassador to Iraq in coordination with the Director of \n     National Intelligence shall jointly submit to Congress a \n     report describing and assessing in detail--\n       (A) any external support or direction provided to anti-\n     coalition forces by the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran or its agents;\n       (B) the strategy and ambitions in Iraq of the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       (C) any counter-strategy or efforts by the United States \n     Government to counter the activities of agents of the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Iraq.\n       (2) Form.--Each report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     be in unclassified form to the extent practical consistent \n     with the need to protect national security, but may contain a \n     classified annex.\n       (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize \n     or otherwise speak to the use of Armed Forces against Iran.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan. I \nappreciate the fact we will vote in 10 minutes. I think we have an \nopportunity to do something both very important and together, both of \nwhich are important. It is Senators collectively blowing the whistle on \nthe Iranians and telling them we know what they are doing and that we \nknow it is resulting in the death of American soldiers in Iraq, and \nthey better stop it. It is as simple as that. They can read into that \nwhatever else they want. But so far as they may believe in Tehran that \nthey can take advantage of what they view as political differences in \nthe United States or partisan differences, I think this does give us \nthe opportunity, across party lines and every other potential divider, \nincluding our position on the war in Iraq, to say: When we have \nevidence a foreign nation is contributing to the death of American \nsoldiers, we are going to stand together against that.\n  So I appreciate very much the work we have done. I am honored that \nSenator McCain is a cosponsor. I am honored again that Senator Levin \nhas become a cosponsor. I think we have the opportunity now to do \nsomething very united and important.\n  I thank the Chair, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, again, I thank my good friend from \nConnecticut for his cooperation and for his modification of his \namendment. I think it now will command and should command the \noverwhelming vote of the Senate. There is no division when it comes to \nthreats to the troops of the United States. Those troops are threatened \nin many ways in Iraq, and one of the ways they are threatened is by the \nactivities of Iranians.\n  We want to make it very clear to the Government of Iran that we speak \nas one when it comes to protecting those troops from those kinds of \nthreats. I hope that message gets through to the leaders of Iran loudly \nand clearly as a result of the adoption--or the expected adoption--of \nthe Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:10 today \nbe for debate with respect to the Lieberman amendment No. 2073, as \nmodified, with the time equally divided and controlled between Senator \nLieberman and Senator Levin or their designees; that no amendments be \nin order to the Lieberman amendment prior to the vote; and that at \n4:10, without further intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Lieberman amendment, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nLieberman amendment No. 2073, as modified, and the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. \nVitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up the \nHagel-Levin amendment, No. 2032, on troop deployment length, and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], for himself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 2032.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the length of deployment of members of the Armed \n                  Forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XVI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. LIMITATION ON LENGTH OF DEPLOYMENTS FOR OPERATION \n                   IRAQI FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Commencing 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the deployment of a unit or individual \n     of the Armed Forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom shall be \n     limited as follows:\n       (1) In the case of a unit or individual of the Army \n     (including a unit or individual of the Army National Guard or \n     the Army Reserve), the unit or individual may not be \n     deployed, or continued or extended on deployment, for more \n     than 12 consecutive months.\n       (2) In the case of a unit or individual of the Marine Corps \n     (including a unit or individual of the Marine Corps Reserve), \n     the unit or individual may not be deployed, or continued or \n     extended on deployment, for more than 7 consecutive months.\n       (b) Exception.--The limitation in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to designated key command headquarters personnel or \n     other members of the Armed Forces who are required to \n     maintain continuity of mission and situational awareness \n     between rotating forces.\n       (c) Waiver Authority.--The President may waive the \n     applicability of the limitation in subsection (a) in the \n     event of a requirement for the use of military force in time \n     of national emergency following consultation with the \n     congressional defense committees.\n       (d) Deployment Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``deployment'' has the meaning given that term in subsection \n     991(b) of title 10, United States Code.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, this amendment that Senator Levin and I \noffer this afternoon, joined by my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nWebb, Snowe, and Harry Reid, says the following: A unit of the Army, \nincluding the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve, may not be \ndeployed or continued or extended on deployment for more than 12 \nconsecutive months, and a unit of the Marine Corps, including the \nMarine Corps Reserve, may not be deployed or continued or extended on \ndeployment for more than 7 consecutive months.\n  We recognize that some flexibility is required, therefore this \namendment includes an exemption for forces needed to maintain \ncontinuity of mission and situational awareness between rotations.\n  We all recognize we are in a war, and we understand that \nextraordinary circumstances will arise which may require an extended \ndeployment. To that end, this amendment also provides the President of \nthe United States with the authority to waive the provision in times of \nnational emergency.\n  To be clear, this amendment complements but is different from the \nWebb-Hagel amendment that we voted on this morning which sought to \nensure that our troops have a minimum time at home between deployments. \nThe war in Iraq has pushed the U.S. Army to the breaking point. When we \ndeploy our military, we have an obligation to ensure that our troops \nare rested, ready, prepared, fully trained, and fully equipped. Today's \nArmed Forces are being deployed repeatedly for increasing periods of \ntime. This is quickly wearing down the troops and their families, \nimpacting the mental and physical health of our troops.\n  Further, these deployments are affecting the recruiting and retention \nrates of the military. For example, the Army reached only a little over \n80 percent of its recruiting goal for June. This is the second month in \na row that the Army has failed to recruit the number of new soldiers \nneeded to fill the ranks. And this is with large cash bonus incentives. \nOver $1 billion in cash bonus incentives were offered and given last \nyear.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary of Defense Gates declared the intent of \nthe Department of Defense to deploy soldiers for not more than 12 \nmonths, and marines for not more than 7 months at a time. But in April, \nSecretary Gates announced that all Army units would deploy for 15 \nmonths because there were not enough rested forces available for \nredeployment.\n  He said:\n\n       Without this action, we would have had to deploy 5 Army \n     active duty brigades sooner than the 12-month-at-home goal. I \n     believe it is fair to all soldiers that all share the burden \n     equally.\n\n  Let me give an example of an extended, out-of-control deployment that \nrecently hit my home State of Nebraska. Last month, 250 members of the \nNebraska Army National Guard from the First Squadron, 167th Cavalry, \nand First Squadron, 134th Long Range Surveillance Detachment, returned \nto Nebraska from an 18-month deployment to Iraq. Yes, not 12 months, \nnot 15 months--18 months, 18 months in Iraq, away from their families, \ntheir children, and their jobs.\n  Let me remind you again, this is a National Guard unit. That doesn't \neven include the 4 months of pre- and postmobilization training \nstateside.\n  Yesterday's Miami Herald reported the story of an Army reservist--not \na member, again, of the regular Army. This reservist had been ordered \nto report to Iraq for his fifth deployment since we had been there.\n  During a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on June 27, retired \nGEN John Batiste, who commanded the Army's 1st Infantry Division in \nIraq, testified that, in his words:\n\n       Active-duty companies preparing for deployment to Iraq \n     within the next 6 months at less than 50 percent strength, \n     are commanded by young, inexperienced lieutenants [--young \n     NCOs--] and these units are lacking the equipment they need \n     for training.\n\n  General Batiste's testimony before the House 2 weeks ago is not the \nfirst testimony to direct our attention to this reality, this fact. A \nJune 24 article in the New York Times cited the concern of anonymous \nadministration officials, Bush administration officials, who were \nquoted. ``The reality, the [Bush administration] officials said, ``is \nthat starting around April [of next year] the military will simply run \nout of troops to maintain the current effort.''\n  The Bush administration officials continue in this New York Times \nstory by saying, ``By then,'' April of next year, the President ``would \neither have to withdraw roughly one brigade a month or extend the tours \nof troops now in Iraq and shorten their time back home before \nredeployment.''\n  This is on top of the already established policy of 15 months for the \nArmy, in some cases, as we know from my example of the Nebraska \nNational Guard unit, 18 months.\n\n  On June 23, the Washington Post quoted former Army Chief of Staff \nGeneral Gordon Sullivan when he said:\n\n       There isn't much more land power available for use in Iraq \n     or Afghanistan. We are now ``all in.''\n\n  Another U.S. military strategist was quoted in the same article as \nsaying:\n\n       I do not believe we've ever had enough troops to do all the \n     tasks we should be doing in Iraq.\n\n  In February, General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, reported to Congress that there is now, in his words--this is a \nquote--``significant risk that our military will not be able to respond \nto an emerging crisis in another part of the world.''\n  The Army continues to increase its reliance on men and women from the \nNavy and Air Force to fill Army vacancies in theater because we do not \nhave enough soldiers. In April, at a hearing, the Department of Defense \nTask Force on Mental Health found that the military is putting already \nstrained troops at greater risk of mental health problems because of \nrepeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The Mental Health Advisory Team-IV assessment replaced in May found \nthat soldiers who deployed longer than 6 months or had deployed \nmultiple times were far more likely to screen positive for mental \nhealth issues and that deployment length was directly linked to morale \nproblems in the Army.\n  I wish to also note two other recent statements about what is going \non\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\nwithin our force structure. This comes from an April edition of the \nArmy Times.\n\n       The military is so short of equipment that it will take \n     years after the war in Iraq ends to bring it up to authorized \n     levels.\n\n  That was what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Peter Pace, \ntold a House subcommittee.\n  Of course, I think if we review the front page of most newspapers in \nAmerica this morning, we are once again reminded what is going on in \nIraq. I have heard in some of the debate on this issue the arguments \nagainst these amendments, the amendment that Senator Webb and I and \nothers offered this morning, as a number of my colleagues are offering \nthis afternoon that shows this is unconscionable, that somehow we have \nnever done this before.\n  Well, I think we have laid to rest, or I hope we have, the issue of \nthe constitutionality of the Congress of the United States being part \nof setting war policy. I would remind those who have some confliction \nabout this or misunderstanding, that they read article I of the \nConstitution. It is rather clear what the constitutional powers of the \nCongress of the United States are.\n  If it is not our responsibility to deal with these great issues of \nour time--and I might remind all of us once again it is the Congress of \nthe United States the Founders of this Nation entrusted with the sacred \nresponsibility of declaring war. The administration or a President does \nnot have that constitutional authority. It goes beyond that.\n  But I would also say we have never had a war fought in this country \nby American troops that has been an all-volunteer Army, an all-\nvolunteer Army and force structure. So in Vietnam, where some of us \nserved, we did not have a manpower problem. We did not have a manpower \nproblem because we had a draft.\n  Now, we can go back to a draft. But we have to face the reality of \nwhat we are doing to the finest military the world has ever known--the \nbest led, best educated, best equipped, most disciplined, and most \nfocused, most selfless force structure the world has ever known--\nprofessional.\n  So when I hear: Well, we have never done this before, obviously \nCongress did get involved in Korea and all wars. But we have never \nfought two wars with an all-voluntary Army. So obviously we have \nlimitations on force structure.\n  The answer is not to continue to push and force the force structure \nto the breaking point--which we are doing now. And every general will \ntell you the same thing and every senior NCO will tell you the same \nthing, that is what we are doing. We are destroying the finest force \nstructure the world has ever known, which took us, incidentally, 30 \nyears to build because of what we did to it after Vietnam.\n  In addition to that, we have been asking a very few individuals to \nbear all the burden and make all the sacrifices to sustain a war in \nIraq that is now in its fifth year, longer than the entire duration of \nWorld War II. We have a mismatch with capability and manpower and \nmission. We have forces in 140 nations all over the world, but yet we \nhave the smallest standing force since World War II.\n  Something is wrong here. What do we do? Well, we keep going back to \nthe soldiers and the marines: Well, you can do another 3 months, can't \nyou, or 4 months or 5 months? You can do two or three deployments, \ncan't you? You are a volunteer. You are a professional.\n  It will not work. I think we are seeing very clear evidence of that.\n  Who does look out for the rifleman? Who cares about the man and the \nwoman at the bottom who are always the ones who have to do the fighting \nand dying? This is not an abstraction. This not an abstraction to them. \nWe need to address this. We need to address it clearly.\n  Well, for these reasons and others, I am hopeful that our colleagues \nwill take a serious look at this serious amendment because I think it \ndoes address some of our issues, not all of our issues. It is not \nintended to address all of our issues.\n  But we are in a situation where things are not getting better, things \nare getting worse. If we expect these men and women whom we ask to make \nall the sacrifices for all of us, then we owe them at least some \nresponsible policy, policy worthy of them and policy worthy of their \nsacrifice. That is what this amendment addresses.\n  I am grateful for my distinguished colleague and the dear friend, old \nfriend, the junior Senator from Virginia's leadership; certainly the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and others who are cosponsors. \nI might note this is a bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I would like to add my support to the \nSenator's amendment. I would state again my appreciation for his \nservice to our country and for all the tough stands he has been willing \nto take here over the past few years on these vital issues.\n  Before I speak on this amendment, I would like to state briefly it is \nmy understanding that in a press conference after the vote of this \nmorning, when my earlier amendment failed to receive 60 votes, received \n56 votes, there were some comments made by Members of the other party \nabout my mentioning that in my amendment all of the ground combat \nveterans in the Senate were cosponsors of my amendment.\n  In the emotion of the time, apparently it was turned around into an \nassertion that I was trying to make a distinction about quality of \nservice, or that people of one type of military background were being \npitted against another. I say I regret anyone would think that speaking \naffirmatively about service, about service of individuals, was somehow \nspeaking negatively about the service of anyone else or about people \nwho have not served. I think that it is interesting to point out that \nin the amendment I offered, every ground combat veteran who is in the \nSenate cosponsored it. I am grateful for that. I think that does say \nsomething about the experiences that people have had in that \nenvironment, nothing more, nothing less.\n  With respect to the amendment from the Senator from Nebraska, this \nagain is an issue that goes directly to the quality of the environment \nin which people who have stepped forward and served are being offered \nin the U.S. military today. People who step forward to serve do so \nbecause they love their country. They do so because they have family \ntraditions. They do so in many cases because they like to soldier. But \nthey do so looking to us, the national leadership, to place their \nservice in this right context and to address that service with a period \nof stewardship.\n  I was stunned earlier this year when the policy was announced that \nthose in the Army were going to go to 15-month deployments with only a \n12-month dwell time back here after these deployments. This is the \nActive-Duty people. The normal rotation is 2 for 1 historically. If you \nare gone for a year, you are supposed to have 2 years back. Now we are \ndown to less than 1 to 1.\n  I called the Chief of the Staff of the Army. I asked him about it. I \nsaid: How do you do this? He just came back from Iraq. How do you do \nthis to your own people?\n  His comment to me: We have to feed the strategy. We don't articulate \nthe strategy.\n  I had to empathize with the situation he was in. That is one of the \nreasons I developed the motivation to try and help the situation by \naddressing it in the Congress. Senator Hagel has very clearly laid out \nthe facts, the situation we face; that our troops, in many ways, have \nreached the tipping point, and the final tipping point came when we \nwent below this 1-to-1 ratio, which is an absolute minimal floor.\n  The optimal ratio, as I said on the active side, is 2 to 1. We have a \nfailed manpower policy which has placed the well-being and the \navailability of our troops in jeopardy. It is time for us to get to the \nplace, after 4 years as an occupying force in Iraq, where the condition \nand the availability of our troops should drive our operational \npolicies and not the other way around.\n  We are seeing the canary in the coal mine with respect to our \nmilitary people. They have been giving more and more as these policies, \nthose experimental policies, have gone forward. We are seeing a failing \nretention of experienced middle-grade officers and noncommissioned \nofficers. We are seeing an increasing attrition rate against Army \ncompany-grade officers, the most\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\ngraphic example of that being the West Point classes of 2000 and 2001. \nThese are the two most recent classes that have finished their 5-year \nobligation.\n  As of the end of last year, 54 percent of the class of 2000 had left \nthe Army. As of the end of last year, 46 percent of the class of 2001 \nhad already left the Army. This is well above, well above by multiples, \nattrition rates in the previous Iraq environment. The Marines have also \nseen an upward trend from the loss of critical midgrade noncommissioned \nofficers.\n  As Senator Hagel pointed out, we are seeing difficulties in \nrecruitment. With respect to the National Guard in Virginia, we have \nseen, since 2001, nearly 6,000 soldiers of the Virginia National Guard, \nand more than 2,000 members of the Air Guard, entering Federal service \nin support of these different operations.\n  We can be justly proud that all of these people have stepped forward \nto serve. At the same time we need to put a balance into how they are \nbeing used. As I mentioned a minute ago, that balance will be found in \nshaping our operational policies toward the availability of our troops. \nThere is no strategy that should be driving the use of our troops in \nthe way they are being used. For that reason, I support the amendment \nand urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that time is being equally taken \nfrom both sides during the quorum call; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not under controlled time at the \nmoment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate considers the Hagel amendment No. 2032 and the Graham sense-of-\nthe-Congress amendment relating to readiness during today's session, \nthat there be a total of 90 minutes, equally divided, between Senators \nHagel and Graham or their designees, with the amendments being debated \nconcurrently; that no amendments be in order to either amendment prior \nto the vote; that each amendment must receive 60 affirmative votes in \norder for the amendment to be agreed to; that if either or both of the \namendments receive 60 affirmative votes, then the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and tabled; that if neither amendment receives 60 \naffirmative votes, then the amendment be withdrawn; that upon the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nHagel amendment; that upon disposition of the Hagel amendment, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Graham amendment; that there \nbe 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \nthe Graham amendment; following disposition of the Graham amendment, \nSenator McCain or his designee be recognized to offer the next first-\ndegree relevant amendment, to be followed by Senator Levin offering a \nrelevant second-degree amendment; further, that the time for debating \nthe Hagel and Graham amendments be considered to have begun at 4:50 \np.m. and charged according to usage to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the two votes would occur, I ask the chair, at what \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 6:20.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I did not hear the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was just inquiring when we expect the \ntwo votes, and the chair said 6:20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 6:20.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader.\n  Senator McCain and I have had discussions on this, that it was our \nhope we could have majority votes on these matters, but there would \nhave been objection to that.\n  Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Reserving the right to object, did the distinguished chairman mean to \nalso announce that we intend to bring up the wounded warriors amendment \ntomorrow?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. It is my \nintention that I bring up the wounded warriors amendment tomorrow as \nthe amendment referred to here. It is a Levin-McCain et al. amendment. \nIt is a bipartisan amendment. But it is the amendment that I intend, as \nof this moment, to bring up as the amendment referred to in this UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just reserving the right to object to \nclarify one more time, we intend to debate and vote on Graham and Hagel \nside by side. Then I would offer an amendment that would be considered. \nFollowing that, I think, is when the Senator from Michigan, along with \nI think 99 others, would be offering the wounded warriors amendment on \nbehalf of our veterans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend for that clarification.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike a clarification. Does this mean every amendment now to the Defense \nauthorization bill will require 60 votes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would hope that would not be the case and that be \ndecided on a case-by-case basis.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. I think it would be decided case by case and \nprobably not by me.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope that will not be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me clarify something I said. Senator \nMcCain is correct, and I misspoke. The reference to my bringing up the \nwounded warriors legislation is not governed by this UC. It is my \nintention. After the matters that are governed by this UC, that is what \nI would do. I can be recognized by the Chair under the rights of \nrecognition in this body, and that is my intention.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona for that clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just want to make a couple comments about \nthe pending amendment and the amendment Senator Graham and I have filed \nin response to it.\n  Our amendment makes clear that the goal of our Armed Forces is to \nhave the kind of time in theater and dwell times that our military has \nsought to achieve and that are sought to be achieved by the amendment \nbut that it is a goal rather than an absolute fixed requirement that \nbecomes the policy of the U.S. military determined by congressional \naction.\n  The reason for that is twofold. By mandating a certain policy for \ndeployment time or dwell time, the Congress is engaged in the most \nexplicit micromanaging of what is obviously a function for the \nCommander in Chief and military commanders to perform. The\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\ndeployments of troops are clearly Commander in Chief obligations and \nresponsibilities. This is not something Members of Congress are \nknowledgeable about or would have the ability to dictate in any \nresponsible fashion. As a result, for us to adopt a mandatory policy \nhere would be the height of micromanagement.\n  It also, of course, would be unconstitutional. We do have some \nobligation in this body to recognize that there is a difference between \nour legislative responsibilities and the executive responsibilities of \nthe President, which include his responsibilities as Commander in \nChief. Clearly, the dwell times of troops or units or the amount of \ntime in theater for a unit is clearly an obligation of the Commander in \nChief, not something for the Congress to determine. Therefore, \nsecondly, this would represent an unconstitutional action by the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Why would there be a need for us to take that kind of step, literally \nthrowing the gauntlet down in front of the President, when we could, \ninstead, adopt an amendment such as Senator Graham and I have filed, \nwhich recognizes the validity of the goal of the Senator from Nebraska; \nthat is, to have this kind of general dwell time versus Active-Duty \ntime--but does not purport to act, by Congress, in a way that is \nantithetical to the President's responsibilities as Commander in Chief. \nThere is no reason for us to adopt as a Senate policy something which \nthe military already has as its own goal and which the Congress can \nexpress is also, therefore, a goal of the U.S. Congress.\n  This certainly helps to give guidance to the President as Commander \nin Chief. It expresses our views as to what we deem to be desirable, \nbut it does not hamper the President's operation of the war or infringe \non his constitutional authority.\n  So I urge my colleagues to simply reflect for just a moment on the \ntwo reasons why I do not believe adopting the Hagel amendment is a wise \nidea and why we can achieve just as much by adopting the side-by-side \namendment Senator Graham and I have filed, which states this policy as \na goal, as indeed it is, and it is perfectly appropriate as a goal but \ndoes not seek to intrude on the Commander in Chief's authority in this \nregard.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona will yield, I \nsee that Senator Salazar is on the floor of the Senate as well. It is \nour intention--Senator McCain and I have spoken--that after these two \nvotes, we then go into morning business. It is our understanding that \nSenator Salazar, Senator Alexander, and a number of other Senators \nduring that period are going to want to speak relevant to the amendment \nwhich they have filed. The amendment will not be before us. It will \njust be that they will be talking about their amendment.\n  We tried to find a place for that to happen earlier today. It didn't \nhappen. The time that it can happen very readily would be during that \nperiod of morning business that would come after the two votes which \nare presently scheduled. So I just want to put the Senate and, more \nimportantly, Senators Salazar, Alexander, and others on notice about \nthat possibility. For those who also want to comment on that amendment \nperhaps from a different direction, a different degree, opposition, or \nwhatever, they obviously would be free to do so at that time, or at any \nother time, because this is not the time when that amendment is going \nto be offered.\n  Senator McCain is back on the Senate floor. I indicated, I would say \nto the Senator, that during the period of morning business, that group \nof Senators and any other Senator who wants to comment on that \namendment would be more than free to do so. It would not be pending \nbefore the Senate. It would be just for their discussion. But I wanted \nto put them on notice because they tried earlier in the day to have \nthat opportunity.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I could just add to that, the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Warner, was particularly interested in engaging in \nthat discussion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. He was, indeed, and there are others, I know.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if there is no one else to speak to the \namendments that are pending, let me just read one other thing that is \nrelevant to these amendments.\n  We had before us earlier an amendment by the junior Senator from \nVirginia that, in effect, is the flip side of the amendment of the \nSenator from Nebraska. The first amendment dealt with the dwell time \nwhich necessarily had an effect on deployment time. The Senator from \nNebraska focuses on deployment time, which of course would also have an \neffect on so-called dwell time. So they both generally deal with the \nsame subject but go at it from a different perspective.\n  With regard to the first amendment, and this would also be relevant \nto the pending amendment, I wanted to quote three things from the \nStatement of Administration Policy concerning that language. First of \nall, the Statement of Administration Policy on March 19 reads as \nfollows:\n\n       It is unwise to codify in law specific deployment and dwell \n     times since this would artificially limit the flexibility of \n     our commanders to conduct operations in the field and \n     infringe on the President's constitutional authority as \n     Commander in Chief to manage the readiness and availability \n     of the Armed Forces.\n\n  Mr. President, on May 10, the Statement of Administration Policy read \nas follows:\n\n       These provisions could unreasonably burden the President's \n     exercise of his constitutional authorities, including his \n     authority as Commander in Chief and his ability to conduct \n     diplomatic, military, and intelligence activities or \n     supervise the executive branch.\n\n  Then, just by way of example, the Department states that it has \nmanaged deployments by using the dwell ratio of individuals as the \ncriteria for deployment.\n\n       The Department routinely deploys units at less than a 1:1 \n     deployment to dwell ratio if the individuals within a unit \n     meet minimum dwell requirements. The proposed language \n     stipulates minimum periods between deployments for both units \n     and individuals. The requirement to meet both criteria for \n     unit and individuals before deployment could severely limit \n     the options for sourcing rotations.\n\n  Mr. President, this is another way of saying what I said before, \nwhich is that there are reasons at any given time the Commander in \nChief, acting through his military commanders, might deploy a certain \nunit for a certain purpose, and the individuals within that unit may or \nmay not meet the optimal goals. Nevertheless, it is the goal of the \nmilitary and therefore the Commander in Chief to try to meet these \ngoals as much as possible.\n  What we are saying in the Graham-Kyl amendment is that these should \nremain the goals of the Commander in Chief and the military, and the \nCongress is specifically expressing our support for these goals. But \nfor us to actually legislate a specific requirement would not only tie \nthe President's hands and severely restrict his options as this \nstatement verifies, but would also impermissibly intrude on his \nconstitutional authorities.\n  So it is another way of saying what I said before, which is that it \nis a mistake to adopt the amendment as drafted, but we can achieve the \nsame purpose in expressing our intent by the adoption of the Graham-Kyl \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, has amendment No. 2078 been called up, as \nmodified?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 2078, as Modified, to Amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. \n2078, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. Kyl and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 2078.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on length of time between \n              deployments for members of the Armed Forces)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1031. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DWELL TIME BETWEEN \n                   DEPLOYMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the wartime demands placed on the men and women of the \n     Armed Forces, both in the\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\n     regular and reserve components, and upon their families and \n     loved ones, since the terrorist attacks on the United States \n     on September 11, 2001, have required the utmost in honor, \n     courage, commitment, and dedication to duty, and the \n     sacrifices they have made and continue to make in the defense \n     of our nation will forever be remembered and revered;\n       (2) members of the Armed Forces who have completed combat \n     deployments require as much certainty as possible about the \n     amount of time they will be at their home stations before \n     commencing a subsequent extended operational deployment; and\n       (3) the goal, consistent with wartime requirements, for \n     dwell time between extended operational deployments of \n     members of the Armed Forces should be--\n       (A) for members of the regular components of the Armed \n     Forces, no less 12 months between deployments; and\n       (B) for members of the reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces, no less than 5 years between deployments.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, consistent with the unanimous consent \nagreement, I will take some time to talk about the Graham-Kyl \nalternative to Senators Hagel and Webb: No. 1, an observation about \nthis whole debate based on what we did this morning. The author of this \namendment, Senator Hagel, has my deepest respect and admiration. He is \na friend, and I hope he continues in public service for a very long \ntime because he brings a lot of knowledge and wisdom to this body. \nSenator Hagel and Senator Webb have served in uniform. They have served \nin combat. They have my utmost respect. We just disagree. Quite \nfrankly, you could bring Audie Murphy back from the dead, and he \ncouldn't convince me this is a good idea.\n  I am a military lawyer. The only people who ever wanted to do harm to \nme were my own clients. But I have enjoyed being in the military. I \nhave had occasion to serve as a military lawyer for quite a while now.\n  To those in the body, you have gotten here the same way as the rest \nof us. You convinced the citizens of your State that you had good \njudgment and were qualified for the job. I respect everybody in this \nbody, including those who have served in the military in different \ncapacities. But this is really--to be honest, every Senator's judgment \nis just as good as the next when it comes to things like this. I firmly \nbelieve we are making a mistake to try to get the Congress involved in \ndwell time or time on the ground in the way that is being proposed.\n  Do we all find it uncomfortable and disheartening that the Guard and \nReserve and Active-Duty Forces have been stressed? Yes. That is why we \nare trying to increase the military, the Army and the Marine Corps, by \n90,000. We have paid a heavy price for the mistakes of the past--not \nhaving enough people in Iraq, putting too much stress on our military--\nand we are beginning to correct that problem. We have a surge going on \nthat is music to my ears in terms of changing the battle space.\n  What we have done in the past has not worked. The reason it failed in \nthe past is we didn't have enough troops to secure the country, and we \nfinally have gotten around to doing something different. The \n``something different'' has increased combat capability twofold. For \nevery combat soldier we had in Iraq before the surge, we have an \nadditional soldier or marine and combat support person, which has made \na dramatic difference.\n  The idea for Congress to step in at this point in time and say that \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, members of the military--that by \ncongressional mandate they are going to be locked into X amount of time \nin theater, is not only an unwise use of the moment, it is a \nconstitutional problem for the ages.\n  The problem of this war is it is unpopular. I understand. No war is \npopular. I wish mankind could get away from trying to kill each other, \nbut we haven't quite gotten there yet.\n  One thing you can say about this Congress--I think the last couple of \nCongresses I have been involved in--is you can accuse us of a lot, but \nyou can't accuse us of being visionary. I don't think there is much \nvisionary politics going on in the Congress. One of the things I would \nlike to get the body to focus on is what would this amendment mean in \nterms of a constitutional restructuring? If this actually became law, \nwhat would be the effect on military commanders and the ability of \nthose commanders to deploy troops based on military necessity? What \nwould be the change in relationship between the Congress and the \nexecutive branch? It would be fundamental. The last thing we need in \nany war is to have the ability of 535 people who are worried about the \nnext election to be able to micromanage how you fight the war. This is \nnot only micromanagement, this is a constitutional shift of power. This \nis a degrading of military flexibility in a way that will haunt this \ncountry.\n  Now, this will not be the last war. The only thing I can tell you is \nthere will be other wars, and that is sad to say, but it is true. Let's \nnot turn the Constitution upside down and play a role that will impede \nthe ability to win this war and the next war because we are upset with \nPresident Bush or because we made mistakes. The Congress has never done \nthis before.\n  The reason the Congress has never done this before is because it \nwould be a horribly bad idea. When you are at war, the last thing you \nwant to interject in troop movements, how long they stay and where they \ngo, is the political polling of the moment. The effect of this \namendment is not only would it change a constitutional balance that has \nserved us well over time, in regard to the surge it would disrupt \nrotation schedules that have been set.\n  My amendment, along with Senator Kyl, expresses a goal that has been \nexpressed by Secretary Gates. We are trying to make sure that Active-\nDuty Forces are not overutilized, and that their stays in theater are \nno longer than 15 months. We are trying to make sure that our Reserve \nForces are not deployed in theater and activated for more than 1 year \nout of 6. These are goals that will make our military stronger. But we \nfind ourselves at a time when we are adjusting strategy, and the \nstrategy we are moving to is more labor intensive. It would be a \nmistake to use the idea of helping the troops as the reason to change \nthe constitutional balance that will make every other war difficult to \nprosecute.\n  After having been to Iraq numerous times, what most troops want is \nfor us to win. I spent the Fourth of July in Baghdad with Senator \nMcCain. I have had a lot of wonderful experiences as a Member of \nCongress, but I would have to put this up at the top in many ways.\n  Here is the setting: It is the Fourth of July, our Independence Day. \nWe are in Baghdad. General Petraeus is having a ceremony for people who \ndecided to reenlist in theater. It is at a Saddam Hussein palace. It is \nno longer used by Saddam Hussein; it is being used by coalition forces \nto help free the Iraqi people from their brutal oppression. We had over \n600 American military members reenlisting, to do it yet again in \nBaghdad in the middle of a war. It was the largest reenlistment, they \ntell me, in the history of the country in a war zone.\n  Right after that ceremony, there were about 130 green card holders--\nnoncitizens who are members of the military--who became naturalized \ncitizens on that day. To be in their company, to just be around them \nbuoyed my morale. It made be very proud of our military, and it humbled \nme.\n  To my colleagues here, I don't question your motives. We all \nunderstand the stress on the military, and we should support these \ngoals. But we should not at this crucial time in this war make a \ndecision that will fundamentally change the constitutional balance that \nhas kept us free and make a decision that will allow politicians to \ntake away from commanders the ability to deploy troops. The last thing \nwe need is deployment and tour length based on polling. That is exactly \nwhat you would get.\n  Now, in terms of the waiver, I understand you can say: Well, wait a \nminute. The President can waive it. No President would ever accept \nthis. There are people running for President in this body, and I would \nask them: If you were Commander in Chief, would you sit on the \nsidelines and let the Congress take this authority away from you and \nyour military commanders? Would Ronald Reagan? Would any President--you \nfill in the name--sit on the sidelines in any other war and let the \nCongress do what we are about to do? The answer would be no. They \nwouldn't look at the waiver as being a way for them to manage. What \nthey would do is they would say: Wait a minute. I will have to veto \nthis because this is an unconstitutional incursion\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nupon my authority as Commander in Chief.\n  I am going to yield and let Senator Inhofe speak, but I would mention \none thing about the troops. We are meeting our recruiting and retention \ngoals. Three of the four services met or exceeded their goals. People \nwho have served in Iraq and Afghanistan are reenlisting at the highest \nrates of anybody in the military. From the troops' perspective, I wish \nfor one moment we could see the need to win this war in Congress as \nmuch as they see the need to win it in theater.\n  With that, if I am controlling the time, I yield to my good friend \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. It is my \nunderstanding--although I came down here thinking I had a little more \ntime--that we are down to 2\\1/2\\ minutes or something.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thought we had 40 minutes. What time is \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes remain for the Senator from South \nCarolina. Some of the time was allocated previously.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To continue to use our time, I yield what time is left to \nSenator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me, since we don't have the time I \nthought, explain why this is unique. We already voted on the Webb \namendment. I don't see that there is any difference here. There is \nsomething that hasn't been talked about since I mentioned this last \nMonday and that is that this President inherited a situation that was a \npersonnel crisis. We are dealing with that now--a personnel crisis. I \nremember back during the 1990s, we were cutting down--I am not \ncriticizing anybody, but we had this euphoric attitude that the Cold \nWar was over, and we didn't need a military anymore. They cut back our \nmodernization program and our personnel and defense spending.\n  Let's look at this chart. If you look at this and put it into \nperspective as to why we should not try to micromanage this thing and \nlet the military do it, this is where we were. During the early 1990s--\nthe Clinton administration--this black line represents the baseline \nfrom 1993 and where we would be in 2001, or at the end of that 8-year \nperiod, had we spent the amount of money we were spending from the \nbaseline that was established in fiscal year 1993. If you take that and \ntake what the President requested--the red line down here--fortunately, \nwe were able to get some above that, but it still meant we were $313 \nbillion less than we should have been.\n  That is what put us into the position we are in today. It was a \npersonnel crisis. So now we are going to have to get the maximum use. \nWe are not going to be able to have mandated deployments and returns \nand be able to prosecute this or any other war. If we were not in this \nposition, I would still oppose the idea of Congress micromanaging a \nwar. That is what the military chiefs in the field are supposed to do \nand what they are trained to do.\n  This shows you why we have the crisis today, and we are trying at the \nsame time to rebuild a military that was torn down during the 1990s, \nand we should not have found ourselves in this position.\n  This President has done a lot. We increased the number of Active Duty \nin the Army and Marine Corps, reducing the stress on the deployable \nActive-Duty personnel. Help is on the way. The increase would shorten \ndeployment length and give soldiers and marines more dwell time at \nhome, but it is not mandated from us. It is going to come from the \nresources we are expecting and anticipating we will have.\n  While many units are close to a 1-to-1 deployment dwell-time \nschedule, certain units have been extended to 15-month tours. Look, all \nof us have Reserve units at home and Guard units, and we have our \nregular services going. We know the deployments are strained. This is \nwhy they are strained. We are trying to make up for the losses we \nsustained back during the 1990s. If we continue to do what we are doing \nnow, the move we are making will allow the Army to ensure that Active-\nDuty units have at least 12 months at home. We are prepared to do that \nnow. All of the services are rebalancing force structure and cross \ncomponents to ensure they have the right types of units with the right \nskills in the greatest demand.\n  These are some of the actions that have been taken now. If we leave \nthis alone and in the hands of the chiefs, we have right now the great \nGeneral Petraeus in a position where he is trying to get this thing \ndone. I have to tell you that my 14th trip to the AOR showed me that \nthings are working very well. If you remember what the President said \nback on January 10, he said we are going to have to win this war from \nthe bottom up, not from the top down. That is what is happening now. \nThese efforts have gotten the clerics in Iraq into a position where \nthey are no longer having anti-American messages, and we are winning \nthis thing from the bottom up. It is brand new.\n  In all my trips there, I have never seen such a dramatic change as I \ndid prior to this last trip. We actually have people going out now and \ndoing what we do in neighborhood watch programs throughout America. We \nare now getting the Iraqis to do this. We have Iraqi civilians with \nspray paint cans painting circles around the undetonated IEDs. We have \nthem doing these things. We have our troops going out, and instead of \ngoing back to the green zone, they are living with the Iraqi security \nforces in their homes. This is what we call the bottom up. It is \nworking. We have monitored the clerics and what they were doing in \ntheir mosques in their weekly presentations. Prior to January, 85 \npercent of the presentations were anti-American. Since April, we have \nnot had anti-American presentations. What is happening right now is the \nclerics realize we could cut and run on them and then the terrorists \ncould come back in and they will be in control. They don't want that. \nThis is a bottom-up type of support that we have at the present time.\n  We have to continue this. The President said back on January 10 that \nwe had to do this from the bottom up. That is what we intend to do. How \nmuch more time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I wish we were not in the position we are in. I can \nremember coming down here, I bet, every other week during the 1990s and \ntalking about what was happening to the military, saying we cannot make \nthese cuts. There it is on the chart, $313 billion below the baseline, \njust holding what we had together at that time. So now we are paying \nthe price for it. Now we have to get the very most out of the personnel \nwe have. We do have plans to expand that to 92,000 in the next 5 years. \nWe know we are going to do that. Help is on the way.\n  We cannot all of a sudden pull the rug out from under our troops, \nwhich is what we would do now in starting to micromanage this war from \nthe Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I wish to take 5 minutes and address some \nof the issues raised on the other side and speak briefly about the \nGraham set-aside.\n  First, Senator Kyl from Arizona read a communication from the \nadministration expressing its disagreement with the approach Senator \nHagel's amendment is taking. I would like to say, quite obviously, that \none would expect the administration to object to rational acts that \nmight be placing restraints--even proper restraints--on Executive \nauthority.\n  A number of constitutional issues have been raised. There are no \nconstitutional issues in this amendment--any more than they were in the \namendment I offered earlier. This is a proper exercise of authority \nunder article I, section 8 of the Constitution. In fact, to respond to \nwhat Senator Graham said, there have been Presidents who have allowed \nthis congressional authority to take place. The most graphic example \nwas President Truman during the Korean war, when American troops were \nbeing sent overseas without proper training, and the Congress passed a \nrequirement that no troops could be sent overseas unless they had been \ntrained for 120 days. That was the Congress taking measures to protect \nthe well-being of troops being sent into\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\nharm's way. We are doing essentially the same thing.\n  There was a comment about the difficulty that might be had in the \nmilitary with respect to individual troop rotations versus unit-group \nrotations. This is simply not an issue. It has never been an issue. \nEvery troop returning from a combat zone or in the military has in \ntheir record book the date they came back. There are a lot of \nindividuals who have returned from deployments overseas who were being \nput in the units that were getting ready to deploy. That concept is \ncalled backfill. So you can have an individual who has only been back \nfor a few months being put into a unit that arguably has been back for \na year. That is not taking care of the individual.\n  There was a comment by Senator Graham about the Hagel amendment \ncreating down-range constitutional issues--issues that might affect us \nin other wars. This is simply not true. If you read the amendment, it \nis limited to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Finally, there have been comments about the attitude of the U.S. \nmilitary. I think that poll after poll demonstrates that the attitudes \nof our people in military uniform are very directly a mirror of the \nattitudes of the people in the country at large. There is not that much \nof a distinction at all.\n  With respect to this amendment that has been offered, this side by \nside, clearly, it is being offered as cover for people who are going to \nvote against the Hagel amendment and who voted against the amendment I \nproposed. I urge my colleagues not to vote for it.\n  First of all, it is a sense of the Senate. It has no legal authority \nwhatsoever. Second, the goals that are in this amendment are no \ndifferent than current policy. So there is no sense in anyone who wants \nto attempt to help the people who are being sent into harm's way again \nand again with some reasonable timelines to vote for this. It is simply \na statement of existing policy. If you agree with existing policy and \nyou want to vote for a sense of the Senate, you may want to vote for \nthis. I urge my colleagues not to.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I wish to follow along with what my \ndistinguished colleague from Virginia was addressing and that is the \ndifference between the two amendments that are before the Senate. I \nwill address the Graham resolution first. I think therein lies the most \nsignificant difference between the Graham amendment and the Hagel \namendment.\n  The Graham amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The Hagel \namendment is a piece of legislation that, if enacted, would have the \nforce of law.\n  I wish to also address an issue that has developed some credibility \nin this debate in the last 2 days and that is that Congress has no role \nin this. I have heard some of my colleagues talk about micromanaging \nthe war and micromanaging the Defense Department. We do have a \nConstitution. If you look at article I of the Constitution, section 8, \nI will read a sentence or two from that regarding the issue of what the \nrole of the Congress is. Certainly, I think most everybody knows that \nonly the Congress can declare war and raise money for our Armed Forces.\n  More to the point, it says Congress has the responsibility ``to make \nRules for the Government and Regulations of the land and naval \nForces.'' That would certainly include the Army and Marines. ``To \nprovide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union \n. . . ; to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the \nMilitia. . . .'' And it goes on.\n  I hope we can lay to rest this issue of somehow the Congress is \nmucking around in someone else's business. I don't believe so. I \nsuppose we could dispense with congressional action and abolish the \nCongress, and some people would find that more effective and efficient. \nUntil we change the Constitution, I doubt that is going to happen.\n  We do have a responsibility for our Armed Forces. As I said earlier, \nwho does look out for the rifleman, for the men and women whom we ask \nto bear all the burden, make all the sacrifices, do the fighting, and \ndo the dying? They tell me this is an abstraction, that we don't have \nany role here. Come on. A colleague said recently in this debate that \nthe war is unpopular. Of course, it is. Why is it unpopular? Because \nCongress is mucking around in this? No, I think just the opposite. The \nwar is unpopular because our policy is not working in Iraq. We are \nruining our military over Iraq. Just as General Petraeus has said \nbefore our committee, there will be no military solution in Iraq.\n\n  I think most of us understand that only a political accommodation, \nonly a political reconciliation is going to work Iraq toward some sense \nof stability, some sense of security. But yet we keep pushing the \nmilitary out there, pushing the military out there, let them do it, let \nthem do it, as we ruin our military.\n  Of course, the Congress has a very important and significant \nresponsibility and role in this debate. I remind everyone what has \nhappened to our military because of what we are doing.\n  One other point. What is more important in a free society? Is an \nabstract policy more important than our people, more important than our \nmarines and our soldiers? They are our most precious and important \nresource.\n  Our amendment, this bipartisan amendment, gives the President waiver \nauthority if the President believes it is in the national interest, it \nis a national emergency to change this policy. He has that authority. \nWe don't micromanage. We don't tie his hands. If we listen to some of \nthis debate, a 12-month deployment in Iraq is outrageously simple and \neasy and that somehow we are incurring on the President's power and the \npower of the Secretary of Defense to do that. That actually used to be \nthe policy. I know it is outrageous to ask these people to only spend \n12 months, that 15 months, 18 months is better, plus two, three, four \ntours is good. Yes, Congress has a role in this effort and this is what \nour amendment does. We include the Army National Guard. We include the \nArmy Reserve. We include the Marines.\n  In the end, as we look at the full and complete dynamic picture of \nIraq and what we are asking out of these men and women in uniform, then \nsome semblance of common sense, some semblance of decency in how we \ntreat our people is required.\n  Today our force capability does not match our mission. We are \ndestroying our military. We are overburdening our military. We are \nburning out the circuits of our military, not because they are not good \nand professional and doing everything we tell them and ask of them. Of \ncourse, they are. But they can't do this alone. As General Petraeus has \nsaid, there will be no military solution to Iraq. Of course.\n  We need a policy worthy of these men and women whom we ask to fight \nand die for this country. Today this policy is not there. This is \nbeginning to change that policy. I hope our colleagues will look \nseriously at this amendment and understand the very significant \ndifferences between the Hagel-Levin amendment versus the Graham-Kyl \namendment. There are differences.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to ask the sponsor of this \namendment, my recollection is that when the 12-month deployment was \nextended by 3 months, the Secretary of Defense announced it was his \ngoal to bring it back to 12 months; is that correct?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, the distinguished chairman is correct. He \nsaid that in open hearings before the Congress--I believe, in fact, \nbefore the Senator's committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe he said it somewhere publicly; I can't remember. \nOne of the reasons to oppose the Graham amendment, it seems to me, is \nstated here: that the goal should be 15 months, which is worse than the \ncurrent goal. The current deployment fact is 15 months, but the goal is \nto bring it back to 12 months. We want to do more than state a goal, we \nwant to put this in law that it is a goal with a waiver.\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\n  What intrigues me about the Graham amendment is it is worse than the \ncurrent goal. The goal is to bring that back to 12 months, and the \nGraham amendment is listed as being 15 months as the goal. I think it \nought to be opposed on a number of reasons, reasons that have been \nstated, but also because it states as a goal a longer deployment length \nthan what is the current DOD goal, which is 12 months.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, that is another reason the amendments are \nclearly different and the Hagel-Levin amendment is far better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2032.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. \nVitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, not having garnered \n60 votes, the amendment is not agreed to and is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2078\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes evenly divided on \nthe Graham amendment.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the goal here was to try as much as \npossible to achieve a balance between the time individuals and units \nare deployed and the time they have for duty or rest back in the \nStates. That goal is the goal of the military today. It did not have to \nbe mandated by the U.S. Congress, which would not only represent \nmicromanagement of the Commander in Chief's responsibilities but could \narguably even infringe on his constitutional authorities as Commander \nin Chief. We can, however, express that as our general sense, that \nshould be the goal of our military, and I believe the amendment Senator \nGraham and I have, which basically mirrors the language of the Hagel \namendment but expresses it as a goal rather than a mandate, will \nachieve that purpose of expression by this body. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues, if they wish to express that sense, to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator, after he is done, will yield 20 \nseconds to me?\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nmeasure. It is a cover measure. It is a sense of Congress. It has no \nlegal impact. This is a cover amendment because of earlier votes. It \nstates as a goal, a goal that members of the regular components should \nbe deployed for no more than 15 months. The stated goal of the \nDepartment of Defense is 12 months. This is not something people should \nbe voting for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the stated goal of the Department of \nDefense remains 1 year, so this amendment, which says the goal should \nbe 15 months for deployed forces, is harder on the troops than the \ncurrent goal. I am going to read the current goal from Secretary Gates' \nJanuary 12 Armed Services Committee statement:\n\n       The goal for the active force rotation cycle remains 1 year \n     deployed for every 2 years at home station.\n\n  So the Graham amendment goal of 15 months is harder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. \nVitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nRepublican leader be recognized in order to speak regarding an \namendment to be offered at a later time; further, that following those \nremarks, Senator Allard and then Senator Salazar be recognized to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes each on the same subject; and then, that following \nthose remarks, the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each; and then Senator \nSalazar be recognized to control 60 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2061\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there is an old saying that goes: If \nyou want something done right, you have to do it yourself. For years I \nhave led the fight in Congress to push the Department of Defense to \nsafely and efficiently dispose of the deadly chemical\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nweapons stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Madison County, KY, and \nin other facilities across the country. For years, forces burrowed deep \nwithin the middle layers of the DOD bureaucracy have dragged their feet \non this issue and refused to comply with Congress's directions. As a \nresult, for years the people of Madison County have had to live with \n523 tons--523 tons--of chemical weapons right in their midst, including \nVX nerve agent, one of the deadliest nerve agents ever created. Just 10 \nmilligrams of VX is enough to kill a human being, and they have over \n100 tons of it stored just down the road from a schoolhouse.\n  My colleagues and I have had enough, and we have concluded that if \nyou want to do something right, you have to do it yourself. Therefore, \nI rise today to speak about an amendment I filed on Tuesday, amendment \nNo. 2061, that will set a deadline into law for DOD to complete work on \nthe disposal of the chemical weapons at the Blue Grass Army Depot and \nother facilities.\n  The deadline in this amendment will hold DOD to complete work on the \ndisposal within 10 years; that is, no later than 2017. Thanks to years \nof delay and mismanagement, last year the Defense Department formally \nnotified Congress it could not make the deadline set in the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, or CWC, and that deadline, of course, is 2012.\n  The United States has committed itself to that document and therefore \nwill be in violation of its treaty obligations. But now DOD's latest \nprojections would put off the completion of the disposal process at the \nBlue Grass Army Depot until 2023. That is 11 full years past the \noriginal deadline, and that is simply unacceptable.\n  I have documents from DOD that confirm that with sufficient funds, \nthe entire U.S. chemical weapons stockpile could be eliminated by 2017, \nthe deadline set by this amendment about which I am speaking, or maybe \neven sooner. If that goal can be met, then it certainly should be met.\n  Compounding the longstanding mismanagement within DOD on this issue \nis that the Department has consistently failed to request sufficient \nfunds for disposal efforts. For years Congress has had to do the heavy \nlifting by increasing funds and making clear our commitment that these \nweapons be disposed of safely and with dispatch. A formal deadline in \nlaw, along with a regular reporting requirement, should finally push \nDOD to request sufficient funds in the future. That seems to be the \nonly way to get DOD to ask for the funds it needs to get the job done.\n  Authorizers and appropriators of both parties, and in both Houses, \nhave repeatedly expressed frustration at DOD's sluggish response to \nCongress's will. For years, the Department has flouted Congress and \ncontinued business as usual. That simply has got to stop. Passing this \namendment will send a strong signal to the Department of Defense that \nCongress has had enough of their pigheaded stubbornness on this issue, \nand we are not going to take it anymore.\n  To prove we mean business, this amendment will also provide an \nadditional $49.3 million for chemical demilitarization activities at \nBlue Grass Army Depot and a comparable facility at Pueblo Depot in \nColorado. My colleagues from Colorado will be speaking to that \nmomentarily. Those funds are fully offset in the bill. The money will \nbe targeted to the two depots that have the farthest to go to dispose \nof their stockpiles, so this extra funding will help speed up the \nelimination of chemical weapons.\n  Delaying the disposal of chemical weapons in Kentucky and Colorado \nuntil the 2020s would cost the taxpayers an additional $3.3 billion. \nAppropriating $49.3 million and setting a firm deadline in law now will \nsave us that $3.3 billion later.\n  The Department has over 16,000 tons of lethal chemical agents stored \nin military depots across our country. VX nerve gas stolen by a \nterrorist from the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky could have grave \nconsequences for Americans living as far as away as Los Angeles, \nHouston, Miami, or even here in Washington, DC.\n  The risk from these weapons is particularly acute for those who live \nnear these storage facilities. Every risk assessment ever done has \nconcluded that the longer these deadly weapons lie fallow, the more \nunstable and the more dangerous they become.\n  The threat of terrorism posed by our failure to dispose of these \nweapons is not limited to the storage of such materials in the United \nStates. With America soon to be in breach of its treaty obligations \nunder CWC, it will be all the more difficult for us to prod Russia to \ndispose of its outstanding chemical weapons. Storage of Russia's \nchemical weapons is much less secure than our own. The longer these \nweapons continue to sit in storage throughout Russia, the greater the \nopportunity for them to fall into terrorist hands. So at its core, \ncontinued foot-dragging poses a national security and homeland security \nrisk to our country.\n\n  Finally, I note, as I said earlier, this is a bipartisan amendment. \nMy good friend from Colorado, Senator Salazar, joins me, obviously, as \na cosponsor, as well as Senator Allard. This is something that Senator \nBunning, my colleague from Kentucky, also joins as a cosponsor and \nfeels strongly about as well.\n  A vote for this amendment will tell DOD that Congress is fed up, fed \nup, with its intransigence on this issue. A vote for this amendment is \na vote to save the taxpayers $3.3 billion. A vote for this amendment is \na vote to dispose of deadly nerve agents that are just down the street \nfrom our homes, our churches, and our schools.\n  Most importantly, a vote for this amendment is a vote to make the \nAmerican people safer and more secure. When this Congress directs DOD \nto safely and efficiently dispose of these deadly weapons, and when we \nauthorize and appropriate a sufficient amount of money so they can get \nthe job done, that is exactly what we expect them to do. It is a shame \nwe have to place a legally binding deadline on the Department to get \nthem to do this. But if we want this job to be done right, we are going \nto have to step in and set a deadline ourselves.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it is \nsubsequently offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know there is an order that recognizes \nthe Senator from Colorado for 10 minutes, both Senators from Colorado \nfor 10 minutes each, and following that the Senator from Colorado will \nbe recognized for up to 60 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my two friends allow me to speak after \nthey have done their first 10 minutes; that is, 20 minutes, that I be \nallowed to speak for a few minutes before Senator Salazar begins his 60 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Kentucky for \nintroducing this resolution, and his superb leadership on this \nparticular issue. It is always a pleasure to be able to join my \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Salazar, in these efforts to help make \nColorado a better place to live.\n  This is an important issue not only to Kentucky but extremely \nimportant as far as the State of Colorado. I rise today to support the \nMcConnell amendment; that is, amendment No. 2061, and urge my \ncolleagues to join with me as it is debated here on the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The amendment itself is very straightforward. It requires the \nDepartment of Defense to complete destruction of our chemical weapons \nstockpile no later than the year 2017. To that end, additional military \nconstruction funding in fiscal year 2008 is also authorized at the \nPueblo Chemical Depot in Colorado, and the Blue Grass Army Depot in \nKentucky. These additional military construction funds were identified \nby the program manager as necessary to help meet any accelerated \nschedule changes at the two sites.\n  Before I get into the details of why acceleration at these sites is \nnecessary, let me first give a little background about the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  The United States, by ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, was to have disposed of our chemical weapons by 2007; that \nis, this year. In April of 2006, the United States requested a 5-year \nextension allowed by the treaty, which was granted in December last, \n2006.\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n  The extension gives the United States until April 29, 2012 to destroy \nits stockpile. However, in its extension request the United States \nexplicitly noted that. We do not forecast 100 percent destruction by \nthe new deadline, but remains committed to completing its stockpile \ndestruction under international observation as quickly as possible.\n  I voted against the Chemical Weapons Convention when it was before us \nfor ratification. Nevertheless, the United States has signed the \nconvention, and this body voted to ratify it. Therefore, I believe our \nNation has an obligation to comply with the convention. Yet clearly the \nDepartment's budget requests have been insufficient to meet the \nescalating costs of the program for the destruction of our Nation's \nchemical weapons stockpile. I believe the Department should have added \nmoney to its budget request to pay for these new costs. Unfortunately, \nthey have not.\n  This body knows this is not the first time I have joined my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator McConnell, on the Senate floor to discuss \nthese activities. At our urging, the Senate Appropriations Committee \npassed several provisions in the 2005 supplemental appropriations bill \nthat forced the Department of Defense to move forward with the \ndestruction of chemical weapons at the depot in Blue Grass and Pueblo.\n  One provision in particular required the Department to spend $100 \nmillion within 120 days at the destruction sites. I point out this \nprovision because some might be concerned the sites cannot spend more \nthan they already have. This, in fact, is not true. The program \nmanagers at the Pueblo and Blue Grass sites are only limited in their \nschedules by the amount of dollars they receive. The Department of \nDefense has consistently failed to provide sufficient funding for this \nprogram, forcing those who run it to make programmatic decisions that \npit demilitarization sites against each other. The Department of \nDefense has in the past failed to provide adequate program management.\n  Finally, it has repeatedly stopped and restarted design work and \noperations, adding huge startup costs and considerable schedule delays.\n  I also think it is important that my colleagues understand how many \nweapons are stored at these facilities. At Pueblo there are 780,078 \nrounds of chemical warheads being stored. Each one of these rounds is \nfilled with liquid mustard agent. These weapons have been stored at \nPueblo since the 1950s and represent 8.5 percent of the original U.S. \nchemical stockpile. At Blue Grass there are 523 tons of chemical agents \nrepresenting 1.7 percent of the total U.S. stockpile. The complicating \nfactor for Blue Grass is that the stockpile consists of blister and \nnerve agent in projectiles and rockets.\n  Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department \nof Defense recognized that these sites posed a significant risk to the \nlocal communities. With this view in mind, in a memorandum, E.C. \nAldridge, then-Under Secretary of Acquisition, Technology, and \nLogistics, directed that the ACWA program be accelerated for this \nreason. For the surrounding communities, these stockpiles are a \ncontinual reminder of the threat they face. We must accelerate the \ndestruction of these weapons.\n  There is no doubt in Senator McConnell's mind, nor in mine, that the \nDepartment has been inconsistent and unreliable regarding this program. \nOnly by passing this amendment and inserting a legally binding date \nwill the Department make chemical demilitarization a priority. We both \nstrongly believe that it is past time for Congress to intervene.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I thank Senator McConnell for his hard work, as well as Senator \nSalazar for his dedication and effort in helping clean up the depot at \nPueblo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise with my colleagues from \nKentucky, Senators Bunning and McConnell, and especially with my good \nfriend and colleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, to speak in support \nof amendment No. 2061, which will help us get back on track with the \nobligation of the United States to destroy chemical weapons stockpiles \nboth in Kentucky and in Colorado and to do it in a timely and safe way.\n  The Pueblo chemical depot in Colorado and the Blue Grass Army depot \nin Kentucky are home to vast scores of chemical weapons munitions that \nare supposed to be destroyed by 2012. That deadline was mandated by the \ncongressionally ratified Chemical Weapons Convention. Unfortunately, \nthe United States has been woefully behind in fulfilling these \nresponsibilities because of consistent underfunding of a program that \nis essential to our national security and to the safety of nearby \ncommunities.\n  At the Pueblo site, we have 780,000 munitions filled with over 2,600 \ntons of liquid mustard agent, around 8.5 percent of the original U.S. \nchemical stockpile. These are chemical weapons. These munitions sit in \n96 huts in high security as they await disassembly and destruction. But \nthey pose a threat not only to the communities of Pueblo and Colorado \nSprings in my State but to our Nation if, in fact, these chemical \nweapons were to somehow end up in the wrong hands.\n  So the matter we speak about today with this amendment has everything \nto do with creating a strong defense for our Nation and dealing with \nthe threats that we face in homeland security.\n  Every year we have to come into this Chamber and fight to put money \nback into the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives Program. That is \nthe authority that is overseeing the destruction operation both at \nPueblo and Blue Grass. We had been successful in getting the \nadministration to put $55 million back into the budget earlier this \nyear. This, along with our joint efforts last year to keep $131 million \nin this program, has allowed us to actually get moving on construction \nof the facilities where they will destroy this agent.\n  If you visit the Pueblo chemical depot today, you will see the \ncontractors in Pueblo have now begun to lay the utilities and \nfoundations for the processing facility that will treat the agent. It \nis a welcome sight to see the Earth finally moving. Unfortunately, \nthough, continued underfunding is preventing construction from moving \nas quickly as it could and should. Because the funding stream is so \nweak, contractors have to inch along with the construction of the \nbuildings. Even the DOD admits there is a need for an additional $32 \nmillion in fiscal year 2008.\n  With that additional money, they could actually put up the walls and \nclose the building where they will disassemble these very dangerous \nmunitions. They will be able to build a structure where they will \nprocess the mustard agent. They will be able to move ahead with the \ncontrol and support building and finalize the utility building. The \namendment we offer today would fulfill this stated need of the program. \nIt would put $49.3 million back into the program for military \nconstruction, $32 million of which will be used at the Pueblo chemical \nArmy depot.\n  The amendment also holds the Department of Defense's feet to the fire \non destroying these weapons. It is no secret that DOD is going to miss \nthe 2012 treaty deadline for weapons destruction at the Pueblo chemical \nArmy depot. That is what happens when you drag your feet and fail to \nput adequate resources behind a program that is essential to our \nnational security.\n  Our amendment says if we fail to meet the treaty deadline, the \nDepartment of Defense should complete work on the destruction of the \nentire stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions absolutely no \nlater than 2017. That is 10 years from where we are today. Every 6 \nmonths the Department, under our legislation, will have to report to \nCongress on the progress they are making, what resources are needed, \nand how much funding is programmed to fulfill this requirement.\n  For those of us who have been fighting this fight for the Pueblo \nsite, as well as Kentucky Blue Grass, the hard deadline for Pueblo is a \ndramatic improvement. At the current pace and with the current \nadministration's funding projections, destruction activities there are \nexpected to be completed sometime in 2021. That is almost 10 years past \nthe deadline under the treaty that the United States approved for the \ndestruction of these kinds of chemical weapons. This is absurd, \nespecially\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\nwith the DOD's own admission that with higher funding levels they could \ncomplete destruction of Pueblo a full 5 years earlier than that. There \nis not a single advantage to drawing the process out to 2022 or later. \nConstruction costs only rise, and the security risks do not fade.\n  We are obliged not only by treaty but by our responsibility to \ncommunities that neighbor these installations to do a better job.\n  I thank Senator Allard for his leadership on this issue. I thank my \ncolleagues from Kentucky for their hard work and leadership. The \ncitizens of Kentucky and Colorado are watching closely. I am certain \nall Americans would like us to fulfill our treaty obligations by \ndestroying these chemical weapons as quickly and safely as possible.\n  When amendment No. 2061 comes before the Senate for a vote, I \nrespectfully urge my colleagues to join us in support of that \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9013-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LADY BIRD JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, inside this desk is the name Johnson of \nTexas, majority leader. That, of course, is the signature of Lyndon \nJohnson, who was majority leader, Vice President of the United States, \nPresident of the United States. I have the honor of being able to work \nfrom this desk.\n  Lyndon Johnson is a legend from the great State of Texas, the Lone \nStar State. He was a Member of Congress, U.S. Senator, majority leader, \nVice President, and the 36th President of the United States. But just \nas importantly, for those who know anything about Lyndon Johnson, were \nnot these honors that were bestowed upon him by others but the fact \nthat he married a wonderful woman, Lady Bird Johnson,\n  What a name, Lady Bird Johnson. Anytime you read about Lyndon \nJohnson, you have to understand the power of his wife.\n  Caro's book, ``Master of the Senate,'' has a lot in it about Lady \nBird Johnson.\n  My wife understands, I am sure, a little bit what she went through. \nIn the book, it describes how he would bring people home with little \nnotice for dinner, and it was always available. Mr. Rayburn, the \nSpeaker, came to their home at least once a week for dinner, many times \nunannounced except by the President calling at the last minute.\n  Today, America has lost this great woman. The greatest asset Lyndon \nJohnson had was his wife. I join my colleagues and all Americans in \ntribute to this great American woman.\n  I did not have the good fortune to know Lady Bird Johnson. She died \ntoday at age 94. But those who did know her said if you were to look up \nin the dictionary the term ``lady,'' you would find Lady Bird Johnson's \npicture. She truly stereotyped a lady.\n  I believe it is fair to say that you did not have to know Lady Bird \nJohnson--I did not--to admire her for the causes she championed.\n  As I said briefly, I have my own special appreciation for Mrs. \nJohnson because I have some idea of what Landra, my wife, puts up with \nbeing married to the majority leader.\n  He was a domineering personality, her husband. She was, during all of \nthe domination he had--with his poking Senators in the chest and the \nthings he is now legendary to have done--she was always the same \ngraceful woman no matter the situation she found herself in. She was \nthe same person no matter what the situation. She served during \nchallenging, extraordinary times. President Johnson went through some \nvery difficult times. She was always at his side.\n  She did not ask for the role of First Lady, but she embraced that \nrole with grace and dignity.\n  As First Lady, she was instrumental in the Highway Beautification \nAct, which came to be known as ``Lady Bird's bill.'' She had many other \ninitiatives that enhanced our natural world. She was a champion for \nchildren with programs such as Head Start. Later in life, her passion \ncontinued, most notably in her work opening the Lady Bird Johnson \nWildflower Center outside Austin, TX, where she will lie before \nreaching her final resting place at the Johnson family ranch in \nStonewall, TX.\n  I can think of no better tribute to Lady Bird Johnson than to close \nwith her own words. She said once:\n\n       Some may wonder why I chose wildflowers when there is \n     hunger and unemployment and the big bomb in the world.\n       Well, I, for one, think we will survive, and I hope that \n     along the way we can keep alive our experience with the \n     flowering earth. For the bounty of nature is also one of the \n     deep needs of man.\n\n  My thoughts and warm feelings are with her two daughters, Lynda, whom \nI know quite well, and Luci, whom I know of, and, of course, Lynda's \nhusband, our former colleague, Chuck Robb--who served with such dignity \nin the Senate; I had the good fortune of being able to serve with this \nwonderful Senator, great Governor of the State of Virginia, an \nextraordinary, gallant marine--and Ian, Luci's husband, and Lady Bird's \nmany grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom she loved as \nonly a mother and grandmother could love.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to say a word about Lady \nBird Johnson.\n  We have had many graceful First Ladies in the United States, but Lady \nBird Johnson can truly be said to have been the First Lady of America \nthe Beautiful. Her husband used to joke that he would hear rustling in \nthe hall at the White House. It would be, as he would say, Lady Bird \nand Lawrence Rockefeller meeting to work on conservation projects. Her \nlegacy was the Highway Beautification Act of 1965. She understood that \nwe have a great many important issues in our country but that one of \nour great characteristics is the beauty of our country. Italy has its \nart, Egypt has its pyramids, and we have the great American outdoors. \nLady Bird Johnson knew that for everybody--not just the wealthy with \nbig homes and big lawns--the beauty of our country was something to \npreserve. She did that, and she changed our entire national attitude \nabout its importance. She brought out the best in us in terms of \nappreciating the beauty of America.\n  I visited the Wild Flower Garden in Austin, TX, before. I have seen \nthe blue bonnets there in the spring, and I have seen how she \ninfluenced the flowers to grow in the rights-of-way on Texas highways. \nThey even adopted the motto in Texas ``Don't mess with Texas.'' I am \nsure that is a legacy of Lady Bird Johnson as well. But not only did \nflowers begin to grow along the rights-of-way in Texas, they did in \nTennessee and in a lot of other places--in States such as Colorado. \nLady Bird Johnson has made her mark in our country.\n  Our family had the privilege of knowing the Johnsons and especially \nLinda and Luci--Linda married to Chuck Robb, a former Senator. We were \ngood friends. We spent many times together at Governors' conferences, \nand our children know one another. We express to Linda and Luci and \nthat family our sympathies. We know they have great pride in their \nmother as well as their father. But we think of their mother tonight as \nwe think of her as the First Lady of America the Beautiful and remember \nher contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9013-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9013-S9014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Madam President, during the fall of 2006, Mount \nRainier, Olympic, and North Cascades National Parks endured incredible \ndevastation from tremendous wind and rainstorms. Mount Rainier National \nPark received almost 18 inches of rainfall in 36 hours. Rivers and \nstreams all over the park overwhelmed their channels, with floods that \nexceeded anything the park had experienced in its 108-year history. \nOlympic National Park experienced a series of Pacific storms that \nbrought significant road and trail damage. North Cascades National Park \nComplex experienced numerous winter windstorms, which resulted in \nabnormally large numbers of downed trees over trails and floods causing \ndamage to several roads. The National Park Service estimated that \ndamage to roads,\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\ntrails, campgrounds, and buildings in all three parks exceeded $40 \nmillion.\n  Today I recommend to National Park Director Mary Bomar the awarding \nof National Park Service commendations to the entire staff of Mount \nRainier, Olympic and North Cascades National Parks for their commitment \nto repair and restore these parks. Their efforts exemplify the mandate \nof the National Park Service ``to provide for the enjoyment of [the \nparks] in such manner and by which means as will leave them unimpaired \nfor the enjoyment of future generations.''\n  Immediately following the storm, the personnel of these national \nparks worked continuously, often during their days off, to repair \nroads, rebuild trails, clean up campgrounds, and repair facilities. The \ncitizens of Washington have a great interest in ensuring that the \nhealth, public and economic benefits, and welfare of Mount Rainier, \nNorth Cascades, and Olympic National Parks are restored for present and \nfuture generations. Without the extraordinary efforts of Park Service \nemployees, it is likely that the parks would be decades from completing \nrepairs, to the extent that they would be completed at all.\n  It is my honor as a Senator of the State of Washington to recognize \nthe heroic efforts of these men and women and express my gratitude on \nbehalf of my constituents and all Americans that enjoy and treasure \nthese parks as ``sanctuaries of enjoyment, recreation, learning, and \npersonal renewal.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9015-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERNATIONAL PROJECT CITIZEN\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

This interactive education program \npromotes engagement in government by challenging students to identify a \npublic policy issue that is important to them, propose a solution, and \ncreate a political action plan for implementation of their solution. \nThis year's projects addressed a wide range of issues from drug \naddiction to neglected historical monuments.\n  I invite my colleagues to observe these impressive portfolios on \nexhibit Tuesday, July 17, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 7 \np.m. in the Russell Caucus Room.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of countries represented in \nProject Citizen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Student teams from the following locations are expected to \n     participate:\n\n\n                           EUROPE AND EURASIA\n\n     Bosnia and Herzegovina\n     Bulgaria\n     Croatia\n     Czech Republic\n     Estonia\n     Kosovo (under UN administration)\n     Lithuania\n     Montenegro\n     Northern Ireland\n     Russia (East)\n     Russia (West)\n     Slovakia\n     Ukraine\n\n\n                                  ASIA\n\n     China\n     India\n     Indonesia\n     Thailand\n\n\n                               NEAR EAST\n\n     Jordan\n     West Bank and Gaza\n\n\n                                 AFRICA\n\n     Ghana\n     Mali\n     Nigeria\n     Senegal\n     South Africa\n\n\n                    LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN\n\n     Argentina\n     Chile\n     Colombia\n     Costa Rica\n     Dominican Republic\n     Ecuador\n     Panama\n     Peru\n     Venezuela\n\n\n                             UNITED STATES\n\n     Florida\n     Washington\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9015-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING NICHOLE BERNIER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The \ncompetition held at the University of Maryland focused on physics this \nyear and New Mexico had one team from middle school and one team from \nhigh school participating. Every participating team made a Trebuchet, \nor catapult with weight on one end and a projectile on the other. The \nteams were judged on accuracy, distance, and design.\n  Four students from Sarracino Middle School in Socorro won the middle \nschool division of the Jamboree State-wide competition held at the \nUniversity of New Mexico. After winning there, they competed at the \nUniversity of Maryland and took the third place position for all middle \nschool participants at the national MESA USA competition. Sam Hale, \nDaniel Jaramillo, Tyler Lam, and Jordan Vinson, all eighth graders, \nproved with their teamwork that they were a force to be reckoned with.\n  Two Belen High School graduates also represented New Mexico well at \nthe competition. Samantha Huynh and Matthew Swanson won the high school \ndivision of the Jamboree State-wide competition held at the University \nof New Mexico. They, too, participated in the national competition in \nMaryland.\n  I am always proud to learn of students such as these who have taken \ntheir learning in the classroom to another level. These sorts of \ncompetitions allow students to think outside the box and come up with \nnew solutions to old problems. Problem-solving skills, such as these \ndisplayed during the competition, prove to be invaluable for this \nNation's future.\n  Congratulations again.

CARNEY\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today I honor a retiring soldier \nfrom my home state. Colonel Gary B. Carney demonstrated exceptional \nmeritorious service as Commander of McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, \nMCAAP, Oklahoma, the largest U.S. government-owned, government-operated \nexplosive ammunition plant. The plant has a storage capacity of more \nthan six million square feet, and stores more than 700,000 tons of \nammunition valued at more than $65 billion. He skillfully balanced \nmanagement of this significant portion of the total defense ammunition \nstockpile mission with the plant's other mission as the sole Department \nof Defense source for bomb production.\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\n  Colonel Carney effectively managed both manufacturing and depot \noperations stemming from Operating Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. \nDuring his tenure Colonel Carney oversaw an increase in revenue not \nseen since the Vietnam Era, totaling $228.2M. Also during his tenure \nthe plant shipped 32,680 short tons of munitions, the largest tonnage \nshipped to date in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Expansion of the public/private partnership program occurred under \nhis leadership as well. The commercial industry partnership business \nbase at MCAAP increased four-fold under Colonel Carney's leadership. \nAdditionally, MCAAP was selected as the integrator for the Excalibur \nguided projectile in partnership with Raytheon. The Raytheon/MCAAP team \nfielded the Excalibur, the newest and most accurate projectile, three \nmonths ahead of schedule, significantly enhancing our military's \nwarfighting capability.\n  Under his leadership, MCAAP led the way in Lean Six Sigma, LSS, with \nactual/cost avoidance savings of $5.319M. LSS training intensified so \nthat 28 employees received green belt training while 18 received black \nbelt training; 29 completed LSS executive training and 22 more \ncompleted project sponsor/project selection training. All MCAAP \nemployees received Lean Six Sigma awareness training.\n  In 2006 MCAAP's ammunition inventory accountability received an \noverall green rating in 10 out of 10 major functional areas during the \nSupply Depot Operations review. This rating and rapid turn-around is a \nmarked improvement over previous years. This significant achievement \nwas directly orchestrated by Colonel Carney through his initiative, \nleadership, tenacity and ability to motivate the work force.\n  Colonel Carney's business acumen, dedication to duty, vision and \nability to inspire and lead people reflect great credit upon himself, \nthe Joint Munitions Command and the U.S. Army. On behalf of the U.S. \nSenate and a grateful Nation, I would like to wish him congratulations \non a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9016-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR. ED RICHARDSON\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, today I pay tribute to Dr. Ed \nRichardson, who has dedicated over 40 years of his life to improving \nAlabama's public education system. On July 15, 2007, Ed will step down \nas Auburn University's 17th President, and he will leave behind a \nlegacy of achievement unparalled in Alabama.\n  In the 1960s, Dr. Richardson worked in dual roles as a high school \nscience teacher and assistant principal, with the objective of becoming \na scientist for NASA. However, following a tragic accident that claimed \nthe life of the Cloverdale School's principal, Dr. Richardson abandoned \nthat aspiration to assume the role of principal. Taking over this \nposition would propel Dr. Richardson into a long career in education, \nrising to the ranks of local superintendent, superintendent and \nuniversity president.\n  In 1982, Dr. Richardson was named superintendent of Auburn's school \nsystem, a career move that at the time was considered unwise. But he \nhad a vision of excellence that proved the naysayers wrong. Thirteen \nyears after becoming superintendent, Auburn's school system was \nregarded as one of the best in Alabama.\n  Dr. Richardson's success at turning around Auburn's school system \nmade him the ideal candidate for state superintendent. Faced with a \nformidable opponent who had the backing of the Governor and the Alabama \nEducation Association, Dr. Richardson fought a hard campaign and was \nappointed Alabama's state superintendent 1995.\n  While serving in this position, Dr. Richardson oversaw many \nlegislative and policy changes to Alabama's educational system. \nAlthough he may be best known for implementing Alabama's Educational \nAccountability Act, which holds schools responsible for the performance \nof their students, he is also responsible for creating performance \nreport cards for schools and universities.\n  During Dr. Richardson's tenure as Alabama's superintendent, the high \nschool drop out rate fell to historic lows, thanks in large part to his \nefforts to strengthen the State's high school graduation requirements, \nmaking them some of the most rigorous in the Nation. During this time, \nstudent academic performance reached an all-time high.\n  Recognizing the importance of our educators, Dr. Richardson restored \nteacher testing to hold higher education instructors responsible for \ntheir students' performance. He also launched the Alabama Reading \nInitiative and piloted the Alabama Math, Science and Technology \nInitiative to give teachers the training and tools they need to better \nteach these important subjects.\n  In 2004, Governor Bob Riley approached Dr. Richardson to take over as \ninterim president at Auburn University. Following his acceptance of the \nposition, Dr. Richardson wasted no time in taking charge and making \nmuch needed changes in key administrative positions. The culmination of \nhis hard work came in December 2004, when Auburn regained its \naccreditation status.\n  Finally, after serving two and a half years as interim president at \nAuburn University, the board of trustees unanimously named Dr. \nRichardson Auburn University's 17th President. As president of Auburn, \nDr. Richardson pursued an aggressive agenda. He focused on the \ndevelopment of Auburn's research park, improving its airport, effecting \nchanges in the structure of the university's agriculture programs and \nforging a close relationship with Auburn University-Montgomery.\n  As Dr. Richardson, along with his wife Nell, embarks on another phase \nin his life he will remain an inspiration to many and will be \nremembered for his dedication and many contributions to Alabama's \npublic education system. I wish him much luck in his future endeavors \nand I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the \nlife and career of my good friend Ed Richardson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9016-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9016-S9017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING KIDS CROOKED HOUSE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I congratulate Kids Crooked \nHouse, a tremendously innovative small business from my home State of \nMaine, which recently won Yahoo's Ultimate Connection Contest on June \n25. As a result, Yahoo will provide the company with a marketing prize \npackage worth $100,000.\n  The Kids Crooked House of Windham crafts custom playhouses for \nchildren throughout the country. What makes the Kids Crooked House so \nspecial is the attention paid to detail in creating the playhouses. \nThese playhouses are by no means run-of-the-mill: each one is crafted \nbased on the buyer's specification and design, and all are unique. They \nrange from brightly colored houses with twisted roofs and walls to \nplayhouses based on cartoons or movies.\n  Glen Halliday, the owner of Kids Crooked House, opened his business \nin 2004 after facing a typical parental dilemma; namely, how to get \nkids away from the television and computer, and engaged in more outdoor \nactivity. After searching for an affordable, yet original, playhouse \nfor his children, he was unsatisfied. Mr. Halliday decided to take it \nupon himself to create a playhouse with an innovative twist. He \ndesigned a playhouse that was brightly painted, with oddly shaped sides \nand crooked windows. In light of his childrens' delight with the \nplayhouse, Mr. Halliday determined that his product could appeal to \nnumerous other children nationwide. Just last year, Mr. Halliday \nbrought his idea to the Yarmouth Clam Festival in Maine, where the \ncompany received the Directors Choice trophy and garnered first place \nfor the best small business float in the annual parade.\n  Winning Yahoo's Ultimate Connection Contest opens the door for the \nKids Crooked House's expansion. Mr. Halliday and operations manager \nJeff Leighton are meeting with Ivanka Trump, daughter of Donald Trump, \nand several marketing executives for lunch in New York City, where they \nwill be able to discuss the business and gain valuable advice on how to \ngrow in the future. Over the next year, Kids Crooked House will \ncontinue to receive input and consultation from marketing officials.\n  What is most exciting about this opportunity is Mr. Halliday's future \nplans for the company. Mr. Halliday is looking to increase employment \nby adding\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nmore carpenters and to expand sales worldwide after receiving calls \nfrom throughout Europe and as far away as Pakistan. He hopes to begin \nproduction of ``crooked'' dog houses, but his ultimate goal is to build \ncomplete playgrounds for hotels and resorts.\n  Clearly, Kids Crooked House has demonstrated a commitment to quality \ncraftsmanship, which has not gone unnoticed. The company works by a \nmantra of ``If a kid can dream it, we can build it.'' What a wonderful \nperspective.

A bill to improve the use of a grant of a parcel of land to \nthe State of Idaho for use as an agricultural college, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today, with my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig, I rise to introduce a bill to amend the Idaho Admissions \nAct of July 3, 1890, to permit Idaho to administer Morrill Act lands \nand the proceeds there from in accordance with contemporary investment \nstandards.\n  The State of Idaho has been working to update its management of \nendowed assets received as part of statehood from the Federal \nGovernment to ensure the maximum longterm financial return to the \nbeneficiaries. Key to endowment reform is the implementation of \ncontemporary investment principles that require asset diversification \nto reduce the risk of loss and that permit a trustee to deduct \nreasonable costs of administration of the assets normally incurred by a \nprudent fiduciary. Of the Federal grants to Idaho as part of statehood, \nonly the Morrill Act limits investments in bonds of the U.S. or Idaho \nand precludes deducting reasonable administrative expenses incurred by \nthe trustee. This bill would allow the State of Idaho to administer the \nMorrill Act assets under the same fiduciary standards now applicable to \nall of Idaho's other federally granted endowments.\n  Additionally, a broad group of State, Federal, and private interests, \nincluding the University of Idaho College of Agricultural and Life \nSciences, the State of Idaho, United Dairymen of Idaho and Allied \nIndustry, College of Southern Idaho, the Idaho Cattle Association, \nIdaho Wool Growers, the Idaho\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nNational Laboratory, and Federal agencies have joined together in \ndeveloping plans for the Idaho Center for Livestock and Environmental \nStudies to serve as a premier center for research and education in \ndairy and beef science. The important mission of the center is to \nenhance the quality of life for the citizens of Idaho, the pacific \nNorthwest, and the Nation by furthering the educational and scientific \nmission of the University of Idaho and its public/private partners, by \nproviding a state-of-the-art animal research facility capable of large-\nscale research that provides sound scientific results and educational \nopportunities intended to: protect our air, land and water, improve the \nwelfare and productivity of our livestock, encourage the efficient use \nof energy and capital, and enhance workforce and economic development.\n  The University of Idaho, as a partner in the project and beneficiary \nof the Morrill Act endowment, is well positioned to utilize endowment \nassets to both continue to carry out the educational purposes and \nmaintain the underlying real estate endowment while contributing to the \nproject. However, modernization of the management of endowed assets \nneeds to occur in order for such a worthy project to move forward.\n  That is why the legislation Senator Craig and I are introducing today \nwill provide more flexibility while allowing for the allocation of \nmanagement expenses in the same fashion as other State endowments, \nexpand investment authority to match other State endowments, and \nprovide for the use of the earnings from management of the sale of \nendowed lands to be used for the acquisition, construction and \nimprovements for the operation of research farms for teaching and \nresearch purposes.\n  I ask that my colleagues act on this measure in a timely manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Stevens, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1766. A bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the \nproduction and use of energy, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce new legislation to \ntackle the escalating problem of global warming. Together with Senators \nSpecter, Harkin, Stevens, Murkowski, and Akaka, I am introducing a bill \nwe have entitled the ``Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007'' which would \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions that result from the production and use \nof energy in the United States. We do this with the support of many \ninfluential labor organizations and unions, business leaders, concerned \nconservationists, and environmental groups. I believe this legislation \nrepresents an important milestone in the debate on global warming. It \nis the product of over 2 years of deliberation and analysis based on \ncommittee hearings, on stakeholder workshops, on discussions among \nindividual Senate offices.\n  I would like to make three basic points to my colleagues today that I \nhope will persuade them to join us in cosponsoring the Low Carbon \nEconomy Act and to bring about action on global warming in this \nCongress.\n  The first point is that the time for action is now. The second point \nis the most effective approach combines technology research and \ndevelopment and deployments with market incentives to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. And the third point is that effective global action is \nonly possible with leadership from the United States.\n  First, as to the point that the time for action is now, the United \nStates committed in 1992--that was 15 years ago--to participate in a \nframework to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. \nSince that time, what we know about global warming has become more and \nmore alarming. According to the latest scientific findings of our \nworld's leading experts--that is, the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change--the confidence that humans are altering the Earth's \nclimate has reached 90 percent certainty.\n  As scientists have grown more certain and more concerned, so have our \ncitizens. Across the country, Americans are seeing signs of global \nwarming, not as a concern for the distant future, but as having an \nimpact on their lives today. More intense hurricanes in the gulf, \nrecord-breaking wildfires and heat waves in the West, accelerating \nbeach erosion on the eastern seaboard, melting permafrost in Alaska, \nall give us a taste of what climate change could mean. If we do not get \ntogether with other nations to start limiting emissions soon, we will \nhave to expect worse in the future.\n  Across the country, convenience about climate change has motivated \nGovernors, State legislators, and mayors to show that States and cities \nand individuals can help to manage this most important environmental \nproblem of our time. Their motivation has another root, however, and \nthat is frustration. I am talking about frustration that the Federal \nGovernment has failed, so far, to show the leadership and take the \naction necessary to meet this challenge.\n  It is against this backdrop we are introducing this legislation \ntoday, with the support of this historic new coalition. My colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, represents a State that relies \nheavily on manufacturing and coal production--a fossil fuel that is \nresponsible for the emission of greenhouse gases. He has consistently \nfought to protect the economy of his State and of the country. This \nbill we are introducing continues that tradition. It does so with the \nfull backing of labor organizations, such as the AFL-CIO, unions, such \nas the Steelworkers and the United Mine Workers.\n  My colleagues from Alaska, Senators Stevens and Murkowski, represent \na State that is likely to be among those most directly affected by \nglobal warming. Alaska balances a reliance on fossil fuel production \nwith the demands of a unique natural habitat and a long history of \nindigenous cultures that are threatened by the warming climate.\n  My Democratic colleagues from Iowa and Hawaii, Senators Harkin and \nAkaka, have helped bring to the table a way to include the agricultural \ncommunity in greenhouse gas markets and to strengthen our protection of \ncoastal lands and impacts on the poor.\n  This bipartisan coalition also has the support of companies, such as \nPNM, from my home State of New Mexico, Exelon, and American Electric \nPower. We have also worked closely with numerous conservation \norganizations to design provisions in the legislation to ensure that \nAmerica's fish and wildlife can survive the effects of climate change.\n  As a result, 23 major national conservation organizations, \nrepresenting millions of hunters and anglers, have expressed support \nfor this approach we have taken to fish and wildlife conservation. They \nrecognize the enormous threat posed by climate change, and they support \nthe way we have responded to that in this proposed bill.\n  Combined with the support of other labor unions, such as the United \nBrotherhood of Boilermakers, the United Auto Workers, and the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electric Workers, this bill demonstrates \nthat the ground has shifted sufficiently in Washington and we can \nrealistically press for action now in this Congress.\n  My second point is the action we need now is a combination of \ntechnology incentives--both to develop the technology, and to use that \ntechnology, or deploy that technology--and also limits on emissions. \nOnly mandatory limits will create the economy-wide price signal needed \nto spur serious investment and innovation in finding ways to curb \nemissions.\n  The bill we have put together is the product of a long process of \ndeliberation and analysis. In 2005, I put forward a proposal based on \nthe recommendations of the bipartisan National Commission on Energy \nPolicy. In the time that has passed since then, we have worked on this \nissue in the Senate Energy Committee with colleagues to understand the \nbest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We convened hearings and \nwe hosted workshops tailored to learn about key design features of \nmandatory market-based programs and the European experience with these \nprograms.\n\n  I have concluded we need massive investment in technologies that are \nmore efficient and less carbon intensive if we are going to effectively \nconfront global warming. I doubt there is a single\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\nMember of this body who does not believe new options for generating \nelectricity and for fueling our economy are needed, whether it is to \nlimit climate risks or to reduce our oil dependence and enhance our \nenergy security.\n  Where we have come to a standstill has always been in finding the \nresources to make the research and development investments we need and \nto provide the incentives that will get these new technologies widely \nadopted in the marketplace once they are available. This Low Carbon \nEconomy Act provides funding for an unprecedented push to develop and \ndeploy new climate friendly technologies on a massive scale.\n  Specifically, the bill would more than triple the Federal investment \nin low-carbon energy technologies and would ease the transition to a \nglobally competitive, low-carbon economy. In addition, this bill would \nprovide bonuses--worth approximately $100 billion over 30 years--to \nambitious and innovative companies that are willing to take on the \nchallenge of building commercial-scale powerplants that capture and \nsequester carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Implementing the transition to a low-carbon economy is enormously \nimportant and it is also equally challenging. It requires new \ntechnology, new resources, and new policies, but most of all it \nrequires political will. I am confident we can rise to the challenge if \nwe can work together in a bipartisan manner to craft legislation that \nconsiders both our environmental and our economic challenges.\n  This Nation has a longstanding interest in developing clean domestic \nenergy resources--an interest that predates our current concerns about \nclimate change. But the problem has been this interest has waxed and \nwaned in the past, usually in direct relation to the price of oil, \nalong with our commitment and our ability to devote the resources it \ntakes to get the job done.\n  Now, through enactment of this Low Carbon Economy Act, we can spur \nour industries and our universities, our entrepreneurs and our \ninnovators to push the limits of feasibility in ways that have led to \ntechnology breakthroughs in the past. Examples, of course, are the \nspace program, the Internet, and the communications revolution.\n  But voluntary initiatives and incentives alone will not get the job \ndone. Many of my colleagues have expressed a reluctance to tread into \nthe water of climate caps and regulation because they fear that \nburdening the economy before we have the technology available to meet \nthe goals we set out would be unwise. We have concluded that further \ndelay while we wait for technology is not a responsible strategy.\n  We can invest billions of dollars in research on technology, but \nthose technologies will always be more expensive than the current way \nof doing business as long as the current way of doing business allows \ngreenhouse gases to be released to the atmosphere without any charge at \nall. In a competitive market economy, it is unrealistic to expect \ncompanies to do otherwise than to maximize their profits and to look \nout for the bottom line. That means businesses will not implement new \ntechnologies unless those technologies make good financial sense.\n  The truth is, we have many of the technologies we need today to get \nstarted on this problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We can \nbegin deploying them today while we invest in research for newer \ntechnologies for use tomorrow. It is absolutely essential we have a \ncombination of technology incentives and price signals to make both of \nthese things happen.\n  This Low Carbon Economy Act reflects this central premise, generating \nboth the revenue needed to ensure that new technologies are available \nwhen we need them and the price signal needed to spur business to \ninvest in deploying those technologies as soon as possible.\n  My final point is that an approach such as the one that is set out in \nthis Low Carbon Economy Act offers the best hope for reestablishing \nU.S. leadership on the issue of climate change at this point in time. \nPeople will continue to debate the stringency of our proposal--whether \nit is too aggressive or too weak--but the bottom line is that other \nnations are looking to the United States to embrace mandatory action.\n  There has been much focus lately on China's rapidly growing \nemissions, but the fact remains ours is the world's richest economy and \nthe one with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Even if China's \nemissions eclipse ours this year or in the next few years, it is still \nthe case that our historic and ongoing emissions account for a large, \nand some would say, a disproportionate share of the problem.\n  Our continued failure to implement a mandatory program has meant we \nhave not been the driving force we need to be to bring countries \ntogether to resolve this serious issue. Nor has it put us in a position \nto encourage rapidly industrializing nations, such as China, India, and \nBrazil, to pursue a low-carbon pathway as they develop their economies.\n  Make no mistake, our legislation recognizes that all of the large \nemitting countries need to be seriously involved in global efforts to \ncombat climate change and need to participate in good faith. The \nadministration has put forward a program to engage developing countries \nthrough loan guarantees, cost-sharing for demonstration projects, and \ninformation sharing. I support this approach, but I am also convinced \nthat it will only work as part of a broader policy initiative that \nincludes mandatory limits on U.S. emissions.\n  Included in this Low Carbon Economy Act is funding for these programs \nso that the United States can put forth a true effort to make \nsignificant relationships work abroad. But we need to take a more \naggressive step at home while we pursue this strategy abroad. Only \nthrough this leadership can we expect others to see that they too must \ndo their part. Only through this leadership will we be able to rebuild \nthe credibility we need to inspire an effective global response, \nincluding, if necessary, working with other leading countries to apply \npressure on nations that continue to avoid implementing emissions \nlimits. To sum up, we are well aware that the U.S. cannot do this \nalone. But we are equally convinced that others will not do their share \nunless the U.S. leads the way.\n  In conclusion, we ask our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the \nLow Carbon Economy Act. With their help, it is my hope we can bring the \nSenate to take action on this issue by the end of the year. I also hope \nthe President will work with us to work out the details of this \nproposal going forward. Congress cannot do this without the leadership \nof the President. The issue is too significant to be able to make \nprogress without having active and constructive dialog with the \nadministration at every step of the way. Congress must make it known \nthat we intend to forge ahead with or without the administration's help \nand the President's help. I hope the majority leader is able to \nschedule time here on the Senate floor to deal with this issue of \nglobal warming later this year. Only with deadlines and a structured \nprocess will the Senate be able to devote the energy and attention the \nissue needs and deserves.\n  I pledge to work in earnest with my colleagues, including the \nchairman of the Senate Environment Committee, Senator Boxer, and with \nSenators Lieberman and Warner of that committee, who I know are working \non this issue. I hope they and others will see this legislation as a \nframework that will be helpful to them in developing an approach to \nbring to the Senate floor.\n  Ultimately, I am optimistic we can take the best ideas and succeed in \npassing legislation because there is now broad agreement within this \nbody and within the business community and the general public about the \nneed for real progress and action on the issue. Let's not wait any \nlonger, when we know that one course of action we cannot afford and \ncannot defend is continued paralysis.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join Senator \nBingaman, chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, in introducing the Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007. This \nlegislation represents the most comprehensive and responsible approach \nto date in reducing our Nation's greenhouse gas emissions, which \ncontribute to the growing threat of global climate change.\n  The amount and quality of scientific data continue to improve our \nunderstanding of global climate change. This\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\ninformation points toward potentially severe ramifications for Earth's \nclimate, ecosystems, and life as we know it. The most recent assessment \nin February 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \nIPCC, concluded that ``most of the observed increase in globally \naveraged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to \nthe observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.'' \nThis 90 percent likelihood of human impact on the global climate adds \nto the compelling case that action to fight climate change is \nwarranted.\n  Some skeptics of the human contribution to this global problem \nremain, however their voices grow more distant as more information \ncomes to light. Given past uncertainties, I have previously been unable \nto support legislative proposals which have threatened U.S. economic \ninterests without meaningful environmental benefit. The Senate voted \n95-0 in 1997 to overwhelmingly support the Byrd-Hagel resolution, S. \nRes. 98, rejecting the Kyoto protocol for its unequal treatment of \ndeveloped and developing nations, as well as the potential serious harm \nto the U.S. economy. Subsequently, the Senate has twice voted on \nclimate change legislation offered by Senators McCain and Lieberman--\nfailing by votes of 43-55 in 2003 and 38-60 in 2005. As I stated on the \nSenate floor at the time, the McCain-Lieberman bill did not contain \nadequate consideration of the U.S. economy, nor did it adequately \naddress the global nature of the problem.\n  However, due to my increasing concerns about the threats of climate \nchange, in 2005, I joined Senator Bingaman in offering an amendment to \nthe Energy Policy Act, amendment No. 866, which was passed by voice \nvote after an unsuccessful attempt--43-54 vote to table'' or set it \naside. The amendment called on the U.S. Congress to ``enact a \ncomprehensive and effective national program of mandatory, market-based \nlimits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow, stop, \nand reverse the growth of such emissions at a rate and in a manner \nthat: (1) will not significantly harm the United States economy; and \n(2) will encourage comparable action by other nations that are major \ntrading partners and key contributors to global emissions.''\n  In January of this year, Senator Bingaman and I announced a \n``discussion draft'' of legislation to achieve these goals. Today, we \nare introducing a revised bill which has been shaped by a comprehensive \nand inclusive stakeholder process which brought together over 300 \nrepresentatives of consumers, energy producers, manufacturers, workers, \nand environmental advocacy organizations, as well as numerous Senate \noffices.\n  The ``Low Carbon Economy Act'' creates a strong and credible approach \nto reduce U.S. greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions while protecting the U.S. \neconomy and engaging developing countries. The act creates a cap-and-\ntrade program for U.S. GHG emissions that is modeled on the successful \nAcid Rain Program. By setting an annual target and allowing firms to \nbuy, sell, and trade credits to achieve the target, the program is \ndesigned to elicit the most cost-effective reductions across the \neconomy. The target is set to avoid harm to the economy and promote a \ngradual but decisive transition to new, low-carbon technologies.\n  The strategic targets of the act are: reducing U.S. GHG emissions to \n2006 levels by 2020 and 1990 levels by 2030. To limit economic \nuncertainty and price volatility, the government would allow firms to \nmake a payment at a fixed price in lieu of submitting allowances. This \nfee, referred to in the bill as the ``Technology Accelerator \nPayment''--TAP--starts at $12 per metric ton of CO2-\nequivalent in the first year of the program and rises steadily each \nyear thereafter at 5 percent above the rate of inflation. If technology \nimproves rapidly and if additional GHG reduction policies are adopted, \nthe TAP option will never be engaged. Conversely, if technology \nimproves less rapidly than expected and program costs exceed \npredictions, companies could make a payment into the energy technology \ndeployment fund at the TAP price, to cover a portion or all of their \nallowance submission requirement.\n  Under the act, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from \npetroleum and natural gas are regulated ``upstream''--that is, at or \nclose to the point of fuel production. For these fuels, regulated \nentities are required to submit tradable allowances equal to the carbon \ncontent of fuels produced or processed at their facilities. Regulated \nentities that must submit allowances include: petroleum refineries, \nnatural gas processing facilities, fossil fuel importers, large coal-\nconsuming facilities, and producers/importers of non-CO2 \nGHGs. GHG emissions from coal are regulated ``downstream'' at the point \nof fuel consumption.\n  The proposal sets out a detailed methodology for distributing \ntradable emission allowances. At the beginning of the program in 2012, \na majority--53 percent--of allowances are given out for free to the \nprivate sector. This amount is gradually reduced each year after the \nfirst 5 years of the program. In addition, 8 percent of allowances will \nbe set aside annually to create incentives for carbon capture and \nstorage to jump-start these critical technologies; 24 percent of total \nallowances will be auctioned by the government to generate much-needed \nrevenue for the research, development, and deployment of low- and no-\ncarbon technologies, to provide for climate change adaptation measures, \nand to provide assistance to low-income households; 5 percent of \nallowances are reserved to promote agricultural sequestration; and 1 \npercent of the allowances will reward companies that have undertaken \n``early actions'' to reduce emissions before program implementation. \nAnother 9 percent of the allowances are to be distributed directly to \nStates which can use associated revenues at their discretion to address \nregional impacts, promote technology or energy efficiency, and enhance \nenergy security.\n  To effectively engage developing countries, the act would fund joint \nresearch and development partnerships and technology transfer programs \nsimilar to the Asia Pacific Partnership. The bill also calls for a 5-\nyear review process that provides an opportunity to reassess domestic \naction in light of efforts by our major trade partners--and relevant \nscientific and technological developments. If other countries are \ndeemed to be making inadequate efforts, the President could recommend \nto Congress that products imported from such countries must be \naccompanied by allowances--from a separate reserve of allowances--\nsufficient to cover their embedded greenhouse-gas content. If there is \nsufficient international progress in reducing global greenhouse gas \nemissions, the President could recommend changes in the U.S. program \ndesigned to achieve further reductions--e.g., to at least 60 percent \nbelow 2006 levels by 2050.\n  There are many other provisions of this comprehensive legislation \nthat help set the U.S. on the right track in taking meaningful steps to \ncombat global climate change and put our trading partners on notice \nthat we take this issue very seriously. Strong U.S. leadership will go \na long way in moving the Nation and the world toward a cleaner and more \nsustainable future. I am pleased that the legislation we introduce \ntoday has so much support from labor groups, energy companies, and \nconservation and sportsmen organizations. Senator Bingaman and I intend \nto work closely with our colleagues and all interested stakeholders to \nanswer questions and consider feedback on our proposal.\n  I invite my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Low Carbon \nEconomy Act of 2007 and I look forward to a meaningful debate on global \nclimate change and the U.S. role in leading the world in technology \ndevelopment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Lott, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1767. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide an exception to the 60-day limit on Medicare reciprocal billing \narrangements between two physicians during the period in which one of \nthe physicians is ordered to active duty as a member of a reserve \ncomponent of the Armed Forces; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague, Senator \nLott, I am introducing legislation to fix an unforeseen problem that \nunfairly affects the ability of physicians called up to duty in the \nNational Guard and Reserve to maintain their practices while they are \nserving our country.\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\n  Under the Medicare rules, a doctor who is absent from his practice \ncan enter into a reciprocal billing arrangement with another doctor, \nwho cares for the absent physician's patients and bills Medicare \naccordingly. However, these arrangements cannot last longer than 60 \ndays. After 60 days, a second replacement must be found. Failure to \nfind a replacement can mean losing patients to other doctors or \nproviding care that won't be reimbursed by Medicare.\n  For doctors called up to active National Guard or Reserve duty, \nfinding physicians to cover their patients while they are gone is hard \nenough, especially if they have practices in remote and rural areas.\n  Asking these doctors to find replacements every 60 days is just too \nmuch. These folks are already making tremendous sacrifices for all \nAmericans, and there is no good reason to ask them to shoulder this \nadditional burden, along with all the other challenges that they must \nconfront while they are called up to active duty. The least Congress \ncan do is ensure that these brave men and women aren't also asked to \nsacrifice their medical practices.\n  In May, the House of Representatives passed a bill introduced by \nCongressman Mike Thompson, and Congressman Sam Johnson that temporarily \nsuspended the 60 day rule through the end of the year. Senator Lott and \nI are introducing the same piece of legislation today. We are also \nintroducing a bill that will provide a permanent fix to this problem; \nCongressman Thompson and Congressman Johnson are also introducing the \npermanent fix today in the House.\n  I urge the Senate to pass both pieces of legislation as soon as \npossible.

Res. 268\n\n       Whereas all students experience a measurable loss of \n     mathematics and reading skills when they do not engage in \n     educational activities during the summer months;\n       Whereas summer learning loss is greatest for low-income \n     children, who often lack the academic enrichment \n     opportunities available to their more affluent peers;\n       Whereas recent research indicates that \\2/3\\ of the \n     achievement gap between low-income children and their more \n     affluent peers can be explained by unequal access to summer \n     learning opportunities, which results in low-income youth \n     being less likely to graduate from high school or enter \n     college;\n       Whereas recent surveys indicate that low-income parents \n     have considerable difficulty finding available summer \n     opportunities for their children;\n       Whereas structured enrichment and education programs are \n     proven to accelerate learning for students who participate in \n     such programs for several weeks during the summer;\n       Whereas students who participate in the Building Educated \n     Leaders for Life (``BELL'') summer programs gain several \n     months' worth of reading and mathematics skills through \n     summer enrichment, and students who regularly attend the \n     Teach Baltimore Summer Academy for two summers are \\1/2\\ year \n     ahead of their peers in reading skills;\n       Whereas thousands of students in similar programs make \n     measurable gains in academic achievement;\n       Whereas recent research demonstrates that most children, \n     particularly children at high risk of obesity, gain weight \n     more rapidly when they are out of school during the summer;\n       Whereas Summer Learning Day is designed to highlight the \n     need for more young people to be engaged in summer learning \n     activities and to support local summer programs that benefit \n     children, families, and communities;\n       Whereas a wide array of schools, public agencies, nonprofit \n     organizations, universities, museums, libraries, and summer \n     camps in many States across the United States, will celebrate \n     annual Summer Learning Day on July 12, 2007: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 12, 2007, as ``National Summer Learning \n     Day'', in order to raise public awareness about the positive \n     impact of summer learning opportunities on the development \n     and educational success of the children of our Nation;\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to promote summer \n     learning activities, in order to send young people back to \n     school ready to learn, to support working parents and their \n     children, and to keep the children of our Nation safe and \n     healthy during the summer months; and\n       (3) urges communities to celebrate, with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities, the importance of high quality \n     summer learning opportunities in the lives of young students \n     and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9026-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9026-S9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2065.

HATE CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes \n     Prevention Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n     victim poses a serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated \n     by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and \n     the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages \n     the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be \n     selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including the following:\n       (A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, \n     and members of such groups are forced to move across State \n     lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.\n       (B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (E) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, \n     and Indian tribes.\n       (c) Definition of Hate Crime.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``crime of violence'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 16, title 18, United States Code;\n       (2) the term ``hate crime'' has the meaning given such term \n     in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note); and\n       (3) the term ``local'' means a county, city, town, \n     township, parish, village, or other general purpose political \n     subdivision of a State.\n       (d) Support for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions by \n     State, Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement Officials.--\n       (1) Assistance other than financial assistance.--\n       (A) In general.--At the request of State, local, or Tribal \n     law enforcement agency, the Attorney General may provide \n     technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of \n     assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of \n     any crime that--\n       (i) constitutes a crime of violence;\n       (ii) constitutes a felony under the State, local, or Tribal \n     laws;

REPORT ON SUPPORT FROM IRAN FOR ATTACKS AGAINST \n                   COALITION FORCES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since January 19, 1984, the Secretary of State has \n     designated the Islamic Republic of Iran as a ``state sponsor \n     of terrorism,'' one of only five countries in the world at \n     present so designated.\n       (2) The Department of State, in its most recent ``Country \n     Reports on Terrorism,'' stated that ``Iran remained the most \n     active state sponsor of terrorism'' in 2006.\n       (3) The most recent Country Reports on Terrorism report \n     further stated, ``Iran continued [in 2006] to play a \n     destabilizing role in Iraq. . . Iran provided guidance and \n     training to select Iraqi Shia political groups, and weapons \n     and training to Shia militant groups to enable anti-Coalition \n     attacks. Iranian government forces have been responsible for \n     at least some of the increasing lethality of anti-Coalition \n     attacks by providing Shia militants with the capability to \n     build IEDs with explosively formed projectiles similar to \n     those developed by Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard was linked to armor-piercing explosives \n     that resulted in the deaths of Coalition Forces.''\n       (4) In an interview published on June 7, 2006, Zalmay \n     Khalilzad, then-United States ambassador to Iraq, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We can say \n     with certainty that they support groups that are attacking \n     coalition troops. These groups are using the same ammunition \n     to destroy armored vehicles that the Iranians are supplying \n     to Hezbollah in Lebanon. They pay money to Shiite militias \n     and they train some of the groups. We can't say whether \n     Teheran is supporting Al Qaeda, but we do know that Al Qaeda \n     people come here from Pakistan through Iran. And Ansar al \n     Sunna, a partner organization of Zarqawi's network, has a \n     base in northwest Iran.''\n       (5) On April 26, 2007, General David Petraeus, commander of \n     Multi-National Force-Iraq, said of Iranian support for \n     extremist activity in Iraq, ``The level of financing, the \n     level of training on Iranian soil, the level of equipping \n     some sophisticated technologies. . . even advice in some \n     cases, has been very, very substantial and very harmful.''\n       (6) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus also said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We know \n     that it goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is \n     the head of the Qods Force. . .. We believe that he works \n     directly for the supreme leader of the country.''\n       (7) On May 27, 2007, then-Major General William Caldwell, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, said, ``What we \n     do know is that the Iranian intelligence services, the Qods \n     Force, is in fact both training, equipping, and funding Shia \n     extremist groups. . . both in Iraq and also in Iran. . .. We \n     have in detention now people that we have captured that, in \n     fact, are Sunni extremist-related that have, in fact, \n     received both some funding and training from the Iranian \n     intelligence services, the Qods Force.''\n       (8) On February 27, 2007, in testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Lieutenant General Michael \n     Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said of \n     Iranian support for extremist activity in Iraq, ``We believe \n     Hezbollah is involved in the training as well.''\n       (9) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Kevin Bergner, \n     spokesperson for Multi-National Force-Iraq, stated, ``The \n     Iranian Qods Force is using Lebanese Hezbollah essentially as \n     a proxy, as a surrogate in Iraq.''\n       (10) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner detailed \n     the capture in southern Iraq by coalition forces of Ali Musa \n     Daqdaq, whom the United States military believes to be a 24-\n     year veteran of Lebanese Hezbollah involved in the training \n     of Iraqi extremists in Iraq and Iran.\n       (11) The Department of State designates Hezbollah a foreign \n     terrorist organization.\n       (12) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the Iranian Qods Force operates three camps near Teheran \n     where it trains Iraqi extremists in cooperation with Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, stating, ``The Qods Force, along with Hezbollah \n     instructors, train approximately 20 to 60 Iraqis at a time, \n     sending them back to Iraq organized into these special \n     groups. They are being taught how to use EPFs [explosively \n     formed penetrators], mortars, rockets, as well as \n     intelligence, sniper, and kidnapping operations.''\n       (13) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     Iraqi extremists receive between $750,000 and $3,000,000 \n     every month from Iranian sources.\n       (14) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     ``[o]ur intelligence reveals that senior leadership in Iran \n     is aware of this activity'' and that it would be ``hard to \n     imagine'' that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of \n     Iran, is unaware of it.\n       (15) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated, \n     ``There does not seem to be any follow-through on the \n     commitments that Iran has made to work with Iraq in \n     addressing the destabilizing security issues here in Iraq.''\n       (16) On February 11, 2007, the United States military held \n     a briefing in Baghdad at which its representatives stated \n     that at least 170 members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have been killed, and at least 620 wounded, by weapons tied \n     to Iran.\n       (17) On January 20, 2007, a sophisticated attack was \n     launched by insurgents at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center in Iraq, resulting in the murder of five \n     American soldiers, four of whom were first abducted.\n       (18) On April 26, 2007, General Petraeus stated that the \n     so-called Qazali network was responsible for the attack on \n     the Karbala\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\n     Provincial Joint Coordination Center and that ``there's no \n     question that the Qazali network is directly connected to the \n     Iranian Qods force [and has] received money, training, arms, \n     ammunition, and at some points in time even advice and \n     assistance and direction''.\n       (19) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated that \n     the United States Armed Forces possesses documentary evidence \n     that the Qods Force had developed detailed information on the \n     United States position at the Karbala Provincial Joint \n     Coordination Center ``regarding our soldiers' activities, \n     shift changes, and defenses, and this information was shared \n     with the attackers''.\n       (20) On July 2, 2007, Brigadier General Bergner stated of \n     the January 20 Karbala attackers, ``[They] could not have \n     conducted this complex operation without the support and \n     direction of the Qods Force.''\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable and \n     unacceptable act of hostility against the United States by \n     the foreign government in question; and\n       (2) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran must \n     take immediate action to end all training, arming, equipping, \n     funding, advising, and any other forms of support that it or \n     its agents are providing, and have provided, to Iraqi \n     militias and insurgents, who are contributing to the \n     destabilization of Iraq and are responsible for the murder of \n     members of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 60 days thereafter, the \n     Commander, Multi-National Forces Iraq and the United States \n     Ambassador to Iraq shall jointly submit to Congress a report \n     describing and assessing in detail--\n       (A) the external support or direction provided to anti-\n     coalition forces by the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran or its agents;\n       (B) the strategy and ambitions in Iraq of the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       (C) any counter-strategy or efforts by the United States \n     Government to counter the activities of agents of the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Iraq.\n       (2) Form.--Each report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     be in unclassified form, but may contain a classified annex.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2074.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF A \n                   FAILED STATE IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are \n     determined to attack the United States and United States \n     allies.\n       (2) The Iraq Study Group report found that ``[a] chaotic \n     Iraq could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally''.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Al Qaeda will portray \n     any failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant \n     victory that will be featured prominently as they recruit for \n     their cause in the region and around the world''.\n       (4) A National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the \n     consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq would be \n     that--\n       (A) Al Qaeda would attempt to use Anbar province to plan \n     further attacks outside of Iraq;\n       (B) neighboring countries would consider actively \n     intervening in Iraq; and\n       (C) sectarian violence would significantly increase in \n     Iraq, accompanied by massive civilian casualties and \n     displacement.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group found that ``a premature American \n     departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater \n     sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions. . \n     .. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, \n     greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a \n     threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our \n     withdrawal as a historic victory.''\n       (6) A failed state in Iraq could lead to broader regional \n     conflict, possibly involving Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \n     Turkey.\n       (7) The Iraq Study group noted that ``Turkey could send \n     troops into northern Iraq to prevent Kurdistan from declaring \n     independence''.\n       (8) The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Iran could send \n     troops to restore stability in southern Iraq and perhaps gain \n     control of oil fields. The regional influence of Iran could \n     rise at a time when that country is on a path to producing \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       (9) A failed state in Iraq would lead to massive \n     humanitarian suffering, including widespread ethnic cleansing \n     and countless refugees and internally displaced persons, many \n     of whom will be tortured and killed for having assisted \n     Coalition forces.\n       (10) A recent editorial in the New York Times stated, \n     ``Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around \n     it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans \n     leave. There could be reprisals against those who worked with \n     American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. \n     Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and \n     Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power \n     grabs.''\n       (11) The Iraq Study Group found that ``[i]f we leave and \n     Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could \n     eventually require the United States to return''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should commit itself to a strategy that will \n     not leave a failed state in Iraq; and\n       (2) the Senate should not pass legislation that will \n     undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in \n     Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Nuclear Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 3132. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) The term ``Convention on the Physical Protection of \n     Nuclear Material'' means the Convention on the Physical \n     Protection of Nuclear Material, signed at New York and Vienna \n     March 3, 1980.\n\n[[Page S9050]]\n\n       (2) The term ``formula quantities of strategic special \n     nuclear material'' means uranium-235 (contained in uranium \n     enriched to 20 percent or more in the U-235 isotope), \n     uranium-233, or plutonium in any combination in a total \n     quantity of 5,000 grams or more computed by the formula, \n     grams = (grams contained U-235) + 2.5 (grams U-233 + grams \n     plutonium), as set forth in the definitions of ``formula \n     quantity'' and ``strategic special nuclear material'' in \n     section 73.2 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (3) The term ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'' means the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n     force March 5, 1970 (21 UST 483).\n       (4) The term ``nuclear weapon'' means any device utilizing \n     atomic energy, exclusive of the means for transporting or \n     propelling the device (where such means is a separable and \n     divisible part of the device), the principal purpose of which \n     is for use as, or for the development of, a weapon, a weapon \n     prototype, or a weapon test device.\n\n     SEC. 3133. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The possibility that terrorists may acquire and use a \n     nuclear weapon against the United States is the most horrific \n     threat that our Nation faces.\n       (2) The September 2006 ``National Strategy for Combating \n     Terrorism'' issued by the White House states, ``Weapons of \n     mass destruction in the hands of terrorists is one of the \n     gravest threats we face.''\n       (3) Former Senator and cofounder of the Nuclear Threat \n     Initiative Sam Nunn has stated, ``Stockpiles of loosely \n     guarded nuclear weapons material are scattered around the \n     world, offering inviting targets for theft or sale. We are \n     working on this, but I believe that the threat is outrunning \n     our response.''.\n       (4) Existing programs intended to secure, monitor, and \n     reduce nuclear stockpiles, redirect nuclear scientists, and \n     interdict nuclear smuggling have made substantial progress, \n     but additional efforts are needed to reduce the threat of \n     nuclear terrorism as much as possible.\n       (5) Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has \n     said that a nuclear terror attack ``would not only cause \n     widespread death and destruction, but would stagger the world \n     economy and thrust tens of millions of people into dire \n     poverty''.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) \n     reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with \n     the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international \n     peace and security caused by terrorist acts, and directs all \n     countries, in accordance with their national procedures, to \n     adopt and enforce effective laws that prohibit any non-state \n     actor from manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, developing, \n     transporting, transferring, or using nuclear, chemical, or \n     biological weapons and their means of delivery, in particular \n     for terrorist purposes, and to prohibit attempts to engage in \n     any of the foregoing activities, participate in them as an \n     accomplice, or assist or finance them.\n       (7) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei, has said that it is a ``race \n     against time'' to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear \n     weapon.\n       (8) The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital \n     role in coordinating efforts to protect nuclear materials and \n     to combat nuclear smuggling.\n       (9) Legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar, Senator \n     Pete Domenici, and former Senator Sam Nunn has resulted in \n     groundbreaking programs to secure nuclear weapons and \n     materials and to help ensure that such weapons and materials \n     do not fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\n     SEC. 3134. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should make the prevention of a nuclear \n     terrorist attack on the United States of the highest \n     priority;\n       (2) the President should accelerate programs, requesting \n     additional funding as appropriate, to prevent nuclear \n     terrorism, including combating nuclear smuggling, securing \n     and accounting for nuclear weapons, and eliminating, \n     removing, or securing and accounting for formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material wherever such \n     quantities may be;\n       (3) the United States, together with the international \n     community, should take a comprehensive approach to reducing \n     the danger of nuclear terrorism, including by making \n     additional efforts to identify and eliminate terrorist groups \n     that aim to acquire nuclear weapons, to ensure that nuclear \n     weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that \n     formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material \n     worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted \n     for to a degree sufficient to defeat the threat that \n     terrorists and criminals have shown they can pose, and to \n     increase the ability to find and stop terrorist efforts to \n     manufacture nuclear explosives or to transport nuclear \n     explosives and materials anywhere in the world;\n       (4) within such a comprehensive approach, a high priority \n     must be placed on ensuring that all nuclear weapons worldwide \n     are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are \n     eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for; and\n       (5) the International Atomic Energy Agency should be funded \n     appropriately to fulfill its role in coordinating \n     international efforts to protect nuclear material and to \n     combat nuclear smuggling.\n\n     SEC. 3135.

Madam President, let me start by thanking the Senator \nfrom Colorado for his courtesy to me this evening as well as my friend \nfrom Tennessee.\n  I rise today to join my distinguished colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle in discussing a bipartisan way forward on what is the \ngreatest challenge facing our country; that is, the war in Iraq. I \ncommend the two leaders of this effort, Senator Salazar and Senator \nAlexander, for their leadership in crafting a well-grounded strategy \nbased on the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group.\n  I have repeatedly expressed my strong opposition to the President's \nstrategy of sending tens of thousands of additional troops to Iraq. \nDespite that opposition and the opposition of many others, the \nadministration pushed forward with its plan, arguing that the surge \nwould give the Iraqi Government the time and space necessary to make \nthe political compromises that are necessary to end the continued \nsectarian violence. Unfortunately, my initial concerns about the surge \nstrategy have proven to be well-founded.\n  First, there has been a terrible loss of life among our troops over \nthe past few months. In fact, 331 American soldiers were killed from \nApril to June--the highest 3-month level of the war. One such soldier \nwas SGT Joel House, a brave and patriotic Mainer whose funeral I \nattended in Lee, ME, just last week. Our troops have sacrificed so \nmuch.\n  Second, the fact is that the Iraqi Government has utterly failed to \npursue the political reforms necessary to quell the sectarian violence. \nOur troops have done their part, but the fact is virtually all the \nexperts agree that a solution to the sectarian violence is found in \npolitical reforms, not in military action. When you combine the \nincreased sacrifice of our troops and the unwillingness or inability of \nthe Iraqi leaders to act, it is not surprising that more and more \nAmericans are questioning the President's strategy in Iraq.\n  It is clear our country needs a new direction in Iraq. We need a new \nstrategy that will redefine our mission and set the stage for a \nsignificant but gradual withdrawal of our troops over the next year. We \ndo not have to search far and wide for this new policy. It is right \nbefore us. It has already been mapped out in the unanimous \nrecommendations of the bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group. The \nIraq Study Group's recommendations chart the path forward and remain \njust as viable today as they were when they were first released in \nDecember.\n  The Baker-Hamilton report sets forth three core principles for \nsalvaging a measure of stability for Iraq and the surrounding region.\n  First, the report says the United States must shift the primary \nmission of its military forces in Iraq from combat to training, with \nthe goal of removing all combat brigades not necessary for training, \nforce protection, and counterterrorism activities against al-Qaida and \nother foreign jihadists by March of 2008. Shifting the mission of our \ntroops to a new and more defined and narrower set of goals will \nultimately encourage the Iraqi military to step up to the plate while \nlowering U.S. casualty rates, relieving our servicemembers of heavy \ndeployment schedules, and improving the long-term readiness of our \nmilitary.\n  Second, the Iraq Study Group Report states that U.S. support for the \nIraqi Government should be conditioned on Iraq making progress in \nmeeting specific benchmarks.\n  In May, Senator Warner and I authored legislation to require the \nPresident to provide two reports to Congress--one which will be \nreleased tomorrow and the other on September 15--on whether the Iraqis \nare meeting 18 benchmarks essential to achieving political \nreconciliation. Although we have not yet seen the report that is \nscheduled to be released tomorrow, from everything I have heard, the \nIraqi Government is extremely unlikely to have met any of the \nbenchmarks we have laid out. The Warner-Collins proposal also included \na provision to condition the release of reconstruction funds to \nprogress made by the Iraqi Government. Surely, if the Iraqis are not \npassing the political reforms that are necessary, the United States \nshould not continue to provide reconstruction funds. This requirement \nwhich is in the law now is also consistent with the Iraq Study Group's \nrecommendations.\n  Third, the Iraq Study Group says the United States must launch a new \ndiplomatic effort in the region to ensure Iraq's long-term stability, \nor to help ensure its stability. Iraq cannot be addressed effectively \nin isolation from other major regional issues and interests. Both the \ninternational community and Iraq's immediate neighbors are clearly not \ndoing enough to foster its stability, and it is long past time for that \nto change. Senator Salazar and Senator Alexander have incorporated \nthese recommendations into legislation I have cosponsored and into the \namendment we will be offering to the Defense authorization bill. \nHow significant it is that this amendment enjoys widespread, bipartisan \nsupport because it is long past time for a new bipartisan approach to \nthe war in Iraq.\n\n  Iraqi leaders must reach political agreements in order to achieve \nreconciliation, and their failure to do so is unfair to our American \ntroops who are making such grave sacrifices. The responsibility for \nBaghdad's internal security and for halting the sectarian violence must \nrest primarily with the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi security \nforces. At the same time, it is important we continue the mission of \nfighting al-Qaida and the counterterrorism mission. But an open-ended \ncommitment of American forces in Iraq simply does not provide the Iraqi \nGovernment with the incentives it needs to adopt the political reforms \nthat give Iraq the best chance of quelling the sectarian violence. \nUltimately,\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\nresolving the sectarian violence requires a solution in which the Sunni \nminority is more fully integrated into the power structures and oil \nrevenues are more equitably distributed among Iraq's citizens.\n  This war and the way it has been prosecuted has cost our Nation so \nmuch over the past 4 years. It has cost us the lives of our men and \nwomen in uniform, and it has cost us billions of dollars. While our \nNation's Armed Forces have sacrificed gravely, they continue to answer \nthe call of duty. They inspire us, but they have more than done their \npart. Many of our Nation's soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen have \nbeen to Iraq more than once. This, of course, has been so hard on them, \nand it has also been difficult for the families they leave behind.\n  We especially need to thank our National Guard members and our \nreservists. Far too much has been asked of these citizen soldiers, \ntheir families, and employers. Whether they are from Maine or Michigan \nor Minnesota or Mississippi, these citizen soldiers have put their \nlives on the line and their jobs and families aside to answer the call \nof duty. But we as a nation are asking too much of them given the \nfailures of the administration's policies in Iraq.\n  We must chart a new course. Now is the time to demonstrate to these \nservicemembers and their families and to the American people at large \nthat we in Congress can move past politics, partisan politics on the \ncritical issues facing our country as we seek a new direction in Iraq. \nWe must demonstrate that we can build a bipartisan approach to bringing \na responsible conclusion to this war, and that is exactly what the \nSalazar-Alexander amendment would do. It is based on well-thought-out, \ncareful, balanced, bipartisan, and unanimous recommendations of the \nIraq Study Group, and I hope my fellow Senators will join us in \nsupporting this measure.\n  Madam President, again, my thanks to the chief sponsors of this \namendment for accommodating my schedule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, let me first of all say thank you to \nSenator Collins for her work and for her seeking a solution to Iraq and \njoining with the other cosponsors of this legislation. As is so often \nthe case, Susan Collins is part of a group of people in the Senate who \ntry to find a solution to the problems our Nation faces. So I \nappreciate her comments, and I appreciate her being a cosponsor of this \nlegislation as well.\n  I rise tonight in this period of morning business to speak in support \nof amendment No. 2063, which is the amendment to implement the \nrecommendations of the Iraq Study Group. I wish to say first of all \nthat this is probably the most bipartisan amendment we have seen to \ndeal with Iraq. I thank Senator Alexander for his help and his \nleadership in terms of getting this legislation drafted. It is \nlegislation we have been working on for a long period of time with \nmembers of the Baker-Hamilton Commission, with Secretary Baker and Lee \nHamilton, and we will refer to them later on.\n  I wish to say a particular thanks to my colleagues who have joined \nwith us in this effort, including Senator Pryor of Arkansas, Senator \nCasey, Senator Lincoln, Senator Nelson of Florida, Senator Landrieu, \nand Senator McCaskill, all of whom on this side of the aisle have shown \ngreat leadership in trying to find a new way forward in Iraq.\n  I also thank my Republican colleagues, including Senator Lamar \nAlexander, who has worked tirelessly on this effort for the last \nseveral months, as well as Senator Bennett, Senator Gregg, Senator \nCollins, Senator Sununu, and Senator Domenici for being a part of this \neffort, wherein 13 Members of the Senate have come together and have \nsaid that if we deal with what is the most difficult national issue we \nface today--and that is the war in Iraq and foreign policy in the \nMiddle East--and how it is that we move forward to try to put together \nthe Humpty Dumpty that has been created in that part of the world, we \nare going to have to do it in a bipartisan way. It is going to require \nDemocrats and Republicans understanding that we need a new way forward \nin Iraq.\n  Despite all of the debate and rhetoric we have heard on the floor of \nthe Senate and around the country on the issue of Iraq, the truth is \nthat there was only one group that has taken a substantive, in-depth, \ncoherent look at the problem in Iraq and throughout the Middle East and \nhas created a roadmap on how to salvage stability in Iraq and try to do \nour best to create peace in the Middle East. That is the Iraq Study \nGroup, chaired by Lee Hamilton and Jim Baker, along with distinguished \nAmericans who served on that Commission for the last year. Their report \ncame out in December, not long ago. It was the only comprehensive way \nforward that has been laid out in a bipartisan way since we began this \neffort in Iraq now many years ago.\n  Madam President, before I speak more about my amendment, I want to \nsay thank you to Senator Levin and Senator Warner, and others on the \nArmed Services Committee, who worked so hard in bringing the Defense \nauthorization bill to the floor. I admire Senator Levin and the members \nof the committee and the thoughtful leadership they bring to us on \nnational security issues. I have been proud to support Senator Levin in \nhis call for a change in the policy in Iraq. He recognized long ago \nthat we need to chart a new course in our Iraq war policy. Now is the \ntime. This is the place. This is the week, and next week, when we will \nhopefully craft that policy. I share Senator Levin's goal, which is \npeace and stability in the Middle East and the safe return home of our \ntroops who are now in harm's way.\n  As we debate this issue, I hope we will keep in mind the sacrifices \nour soldiers and airmen and sailors and marines are making on the \nground today in Iraq. We must be ever mindful that on these fundamental \nissues of war and peace there ought to be an American way forward. That \nAmerican way forward should not be a Democratic, a Republican, or an \nIndependent way forward; it ought to be an American way forward because \nwe have over 150,000 of our men and women in uniform in harm's way \ntonight as we debate this issue on the Senate floor.\n  It is a personal issue. When we think about what has happened to the \nmen and women who have died in this war in Iraq, we should all think \nabout the weight we have on our shoulders because it is a significant \nweight, but it pales in comparison to the weight and the sacrifice we \nask our men and women in uniform to bear every day in the fields of \nIraq and Afghanistan. So it is to them, who are serving, that we owe \nthe best policy we can develop in the Senate.\n  In Iraq, 3,601 Americans have been killed since the beginning of the \nwar. All of us who have gone to Walter Reed and other hospitals and \nvisited with the brave men and women who have come home without arms \nand legs, those who have suffered from brain injuries and other kinds \nof injuries that will stay with them for the rest of their lives--there \nare almost 27,000 of them who have suffered those kinds of wounds in \nIraq. From my State of Colorado, we have 51 people who have been killed \nin Iraq since the beginning of the war. We have another 443 who have \nbeen wounded. Just from Fort Carson alone, which is the home of many of \nour soldiers who served in Iraq, we have had 215 casualties from Fort \nCarson in El Paso County.\n  It is to these men and women that we have a solemn obligation to make \nsure we develop the kind of policy they deserve to have as they fight \non behalf of a mission for the United States of America. They deserve a \npolicy that changes their role in Iraq from combat to a much more \nlimited role, focused on training and on equipping the Iraqi forces. \nThey deserve a policy that includes a major and new diplomatic \noffensive led by the United States but aimed at gathering all of Iraq's \nneighbors around the table. They deserve a policy that underscores the \nneed for a comprehensive diplomatic approach, which is critical to \ncreating the conditions necessary for a troop withdrawal so that we can \nbring our troops home safely and back to their families. They deserve a \npolicy that conditions U.S. political, economic, and military support \non Iraq's progress in meeting specific benchmarks. The Government of \nIraq simply must take on a greater responsibility for the fate of their \ncountry. It is foremost their responsibility.\n  These are the broad principles which I believe should guide us as we \nconsider\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\nthe various amendments to the bill. I hope we can come together across \nparty lines--Democrats and Republicans--to support a change in strategy \nin Iraq.\n  I have been pleased to join with colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in crafting an amendment that I believe will result in that \nconstructive change. Our amendment is simple. It implements the \nrecommendations of the Iraq Study Group. I believe the work of that \ngroup is a model for how we can come together in good faith. The Iraq \nStudy Group was comprised of our finest and most experienced public \nservants in America, equally drawn from both political parties. They \nworked together for months to reach consensus on a comprehensive set of \nrecommendations as required by the U.S. Congress in legislation that \nfunded and created the Iraq Study Group. I appeal to my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to take a fresh look at the group's report and \nconsider how we can use it as part of the solution in creating a \nsuccessful policy in Iraq.\n  We will have much more to say about our amendment at a later point in \nthe debate. But as we consider Iraq's policy, I hope we can agree that \nwe must change course. I hope we can agree that the brave men and women \nserving in Iraq deserve our best effort to reach common ground. I hope \nwe can agree on a path forward that will create a better future for \nIraq, for the Middle East, and a better and more peaceful future for \nthe United States of America.\n  Madam President, to recap, our bipartisan amendment, which now has 13 \ncosponsors, would essentially do three things.\n  First, it would require a mission change for our country in Iraq. \nThis would be our national policy and our national law if our proposed \nlegislation becomes law and is signed by the President. That change, as \nset forth in the Iraq Study Group Report and in our legislation, would \nremove our troops from a combat mission over to a training mission and \na mission that is specifically defined to chase al-Qaida. That more \nlimited mission is an appropriate one for us here, and that limited \nmission is one that I believe has the bipartisan support of most \nMembers of the Senate.\n  Secondly, this legislation also conditions, for the first time, the \nefforts of the United States of America and Iraq on the progress that \nis made by the Iraqi Government in terms of meeting the benchmarks \nidentified in our legislation. It conditions, for the first time, the \nIraqi Government stepping up to the plate and doing what they should be \ndoing, which is providing the functional government that brings about \nsecurity for their own people. It ought not to be the responsibility of \nthe U.S. Government to be in the middle of policing a civil war in \nIraq.\n\n  Third, the legislation sets forth a comprehensive, diplomatic \napproach to deal with the issues not only in Iraq but also in the \nregion. The fact is, as those of us who have been in that region over \nthe last several years know, there are places in that region--countries \nthat have been sitting on their hands and have not been helping bring \nabout stability in Iraq. We also know Iran and Syria and other \ncountries have been playing a negative role in terms of achieving the \ngoal of stability in Iraq. At the end of the day, it will take an \ninternational effort and a regional peace plan to bring about the \nstability we all want not only for Iraq but for the Middle East.\n  In conclusion, I will say this about the Iraq Study Group and their \nrecommendations. Some Members of the Senate have characterized this \namendment as not doing much. Some Members of the Senate will probably \ncome to the floor at some point in the debate and say this legislation \nis too prescriptive; it tells the President too much what to do. Well, \nwe will handle those particular criticisms.\n  The one I wish to deal with briefly is this sense that we have gotten \nfrom some Members of the Senate that the Iraq Study Group \nrecommendations happened a long time ago and they are no longer \nrelevant today. I know of no one who spent as much time studying these \nissues of Iraq and the challenges we face there than former Congressman \nLee Hamilton, the Chairman of the Commission. This is what Lee Hamilton \nhad to say with respect to this legislation:\n\n       The recommendations of the Iraq Study Group are as timely \n     and urgent today as they were in December.\n\n  Madam President, I hope that my colleagues open their hearts and \ntheir minds to the direction set forth in the Iraq Study Group Report \nand that they join the bipartisan effort with the Presiding Officer and \nthe Senator from Tennessee and other colleagues who are cosponsors of \nthis amendment to this legislation.\n  I know my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, is on the \nfloor. I yield to him.\n  (Mr. SALAZAR assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer, Mr. \nSalazar, the Senator from Colorado, for his impressive leadership in \nhelping our Senate and our Congress and our President and our country \nfind a consensus about where we go from here in Iraq. That is, as he \nsaid, truly our most urgent and difficult issue. It is on the minds of \nevery single Senator every day. It is the first thing on my mind. It \ndeserves to be. Adding up the lives, the dollars--$10 billion a month, \n3,600 lives, and many wounded--it is a difficult situation.\n  Mr. President, the occupant of the chair has said this himself. It \nstruck me that we should spend less time in what we think of as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body lecturing Baghdad about coming up \nwith a political consensus and more time working together ourselves to \ncome up with a political consensus about what to do in Iraq. After all, \nthey are an infant democracy and we are the oldest democracy; we ought \nto be able to do more than make speeches and have partisan votes. Of \ncourse, we respect each other's positions, but at some point, there is \nconsensus about where we go from here.\n  We owe it to our troops fighting there, when they look at Washington, \nnot to see us shouting at one another but saying, yes, we can agree on \nwhy you are there, where we are going to be in a while, what our goals \nare, and say to the rest of the Middle East that we know what we are \ndoing in Iraq, give them a chance to flourish and say we in the U.S. \nhave free debate, but we are capable of coming to a conclusion, \nespecially on our most urgent issue. That is why this report is so \nimportant.\n  When I saw this report in December, what attracted me about it was, \nfirst, the members of this group--Larry Eagleburger, Secretary of State \nfor Bush 1; Vernon Jordan, National Urban League, a close friend of \nPresident Clinton's; Ed Meese, President Reagan's Attorney General; \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor; Leon Panetta, President Clinton's Chief of \nStaff; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Clinton; Chuck Robb, \nformer U.S. Senator; Alan Simpson, the former Republican whip; and, at \none point, Roberts Gates, who is now the Secretary of Defense in this \nadministration. They unanimously agreed, after 9 months, about what to \ndo in Iraq. In 9 months, they unanimously agreed.\n  I thought that perhaps President Bush, in January, in the State of \nthe Union Address, would invite them to sit in the gallery, as \nPresidents often do, and point to them and say: There they are, nine of \nour most distinguished Americans who have been working for 9 months \ntrying to understand where to go on our most difficult issue.\n  They say there is no magic formula. They say it is grave and \ndeteriorating. They say the consequences of the cost, but they have a \nrecommendation and it is a sensible recommendation, and the President \nmight have said it is not my recommendation, it is theirs, but I accept \ntheir recommendation and I invite you to do the same.\n  I think the President would have received a good deal of bipartisan \nsupport in this body had he done that. The President and our country \nneed that. A President's job is to see an urgent need, to develop a \nstrategy to meet it, and to persuade at least half the people he is \nright. Even if President Bush is right about the current strategy, he \nhasn't persuaded a broad enough number of Americans that he is right or \na broad enough number in this body that he is right in order to sustain \nhis policy in Iraq.\n  A part of Presidential leadership is recognizing that adjustments \nhave to be made to take into account the views\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\nof others and then, having done that, to go forward. That is \nPresidential leadership. It is not Presidential weakness. It is what I \nwish President Bush had done in January, and I said so then, and I said \nso in March on the floor of the Senate. I have learned sometimes you \nhave to say things two or three times around here before anybody hears.\n  Senator Salazar heard it. We talked about it and the outgrowth is \nthis legislation that Senator Salazar worked so well on to develop, and \nso expertly, which Secretary Baker and Congressman Hamilton have told \nme accurately represents the recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton \ngroup.\n  Exactly what does Baker-Hamilton do? One, it establishes a long-term \npresence for the United States in Iraq but a limited one. Two, it says \nas soon as security conditions on the ground permit--and it estimates \nthat would be a year--we would move our combat forces out of the combat \nbusiness and into the support, training, and equipment business in \nIraq. And third, it steps up regional and diplomatic efforts to cause \nothers in the region to help Iraq succeed.\n  That is it. Those three things. There are 79 recommendations in this \nbook. I am not sure all of us would agree with all of them. But that is \nnot the point. There is a new direction for the United States in Iraq \nin this book, and if we were to adopt it and the President were to \nagree with it, what our legislation says is the President should \nformulate a comprehensive plan to implement the recommendations of the \nIraq Study Group. That in plain English to me means the President would \ntake all these recommendations, call together his advisers, come up \nwith a plan, and do his best to implement it.\n  Would he be able to implement every provision? I doubt it. Would he \nsay this was recommended in December and I didn't get the law until \nSeptember, so I am going to adjust some timetables? I would expect so. \nWould he have some improvements to make and some suggestions to make? I \nwould guess he would. But he would come up with a comprehensive plan, \nand then he would proceed with it. Then, of course, we would have our \nconstitutional duty to review it. We don't have to approve it under our \nrecommendation, we just review it and we appropriate money and we have \nother things we could do. But what we could say to our troops, the \nworld, and the country is that we have found a common way forward in \nIraq. We know what we are doing, and we are doing it together. And that \nis the job of our Government.\n  The Senator from Colorado dealt with a couple of objections that have \nbeen made. Let me deal with three or four very quickly. We will have \nother time to do that. I see the Senator from Arkansas is here. I am \nlooking forward to what he has to say.\n  One objection that was made was this may be dated. It was December. \nOne Senator said this was a snapshot taken some time ago and times have \nchanged. I don't see this as a snapshot. I see the war in Iraq as more \nlike a movie. You go into it after 15 minutes or you go into it 30 \nminutes after it started and it is the same movie. You see the same \ncharacters. It is the same story. A few adjustments might have to be \nmade, but it is the same story. And as Lee Hamilton said, the \nrecommendations are as relevant today as they were in December. And I \nwould say that February would have been a better time than March to \nadopt the recommendations. April would have been better than March. \nToday is better than last month, and last month would be better than \ntoday. The sooner they are adopted, the better.\n  A second point. One Senator said this doesn't have many teeth in it. \nI used to work in the White House for a wise man named Bryce Harlow 40 \nyears ago. I was an impatient young man. I said: Mr. Harlow, we need to \ndo more of this or more of that. I forget the issue.\n  He said: Lamar, in the White House, just a little tilt here makes a \ngreat big difference out there.\n  That was a very wise statement. If the President of the United States \nand the Congress of this country were to agree this month on a new \ncourse in Iraq that defined a limited long-term role, shifted the \nmission from combat to training, support, and equipment over a period \nof months, subject to unexpected developments on the ground, and \nstepped up our diplomatic and political efforts, that is a major shift \nin strategy.\n\n  Next, I have heard from the other side that it has too many teeth, \ntoo prescriptive on the President. That is not the way I read it. \nSometimes that comes from this side. The White House has some worries \nabout that as well. But that is not the way I read our amendment. It is \nthe sense of the Congress that the President and the Congress should \nagree that the way forward in Iraq is to implement this and the \nPresident should formulate a comprehensive plan to do so.\n  I assume the way the President does that is he gets the law in \nSeptember, and he sits down with his advisers. I suppose the first \nperson he would sit down with is General Petraeus whose advice we are \nall looking forward to. He would ask his advice about the surge, ask \nthe Joint Chiefs what they think, ask a lot of people, and then within \na few weeks, send us his plan. That is what we ask him to do.\n  It is not so prescriptive either about the changes in troops on the \nground because it says in another section, section 1552, that while we \nintend to move our troops out of the combat business into support, \nequipping, and training business--and the goal is within about a year \nto do that--that it is subject to unexpected developments on the \nground.\n  Here is what the report itself actually said:\n\n       By the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected \n     developments in the security situation on the ground, all \n     combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be \n     out of Iraq. At that time, U.S. combat forces in Iraq could \n     be deployed only in units embedded with Iraqi forces, in \n     rapid-reaction and special operations teams, and in training, \n     equipping, advising, force protection, and search and rescue. \n     Intelligence and support efforts would continue. Even after \n     the United States has moved all combat brigades out of Iraq, \n     we would maintain a considerable military presence in the \n     region, with our still significant force in Iraq and with our \n     powerful air, ground, and naval deployments in Kuwait, \n     Bahrain, and Qatar.\n\n  In other words, when we move out of the combat business into these \nother areas, we still have troops there, we still are able to go after \nal-Qaida, we still can protect the troops who are there, and we are \nsending a message to the rest of the Middle East: Stay out, give Iraq a \nchance to flourish.\n  The other thing I have heard, and I say this in conclusion--I thank \nyou, Mr. President, for your time--is that all people hear in the \ndebate in the Senate is discord. I hear another message. It is not as \nloud as the discord, it is not as loud as the partisan votes, but I \nhear a lot of consensus. It may surprise some people to hear me say \nthat. I hear a lot of consensus and the seeds of that consensus are in \nthe Iraq Study Group report.\n  For example, the administration has already begun to act on some of \nthe recommendations in the Iraq Study Group report by increasing the \nnumber of troops embedded in Iraqi forces, using milestones to chart \nprogress, by meeting with Iraq's neighbors, including Iran and Syria. \nThe President's National Security Adviser has pointed to the Iraq Study \nGroup report as valuable. The President himself has spoken well of it.\n  Across the aisle on the Democratic side, where there is a great \ndesire by many Members for a fixed timetable, which is not a part of \nthe Iraq Study Group, the Democratic proposals still have been guided \nby this document. For example, working on milestones for improvement in \nIraq, limiting the role of the United States to one of training and \nequipping and counterterrorism operations and stating as a goal the \ndrawdown of combat forces by a year from now. That is all part of over \nthere. I hear more consensus than I do discord.\n  I guess my message to my colleagues is much the same as the Senator \nfrom Colorado said. We have a responsibility to vote and state our \nconvictions, but we also have a job to do, and our job to do is to look \nfor a way to come to some consensus about where we are going from here \nin Iraq and agree on it so when our troops look back, they know we \nsupport them, we really support them because we know what they are \ndoing. And when the Middle East looks it up, they know to stay out. And \nwhen the rest of the world looks at this great deliberative body, they \nknow occasionally on the foremost issue facing our\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\ntime, we can come to a conclusion, we can join hands with the \nPresident, even though we may debate with him and say, OK, Mr. \nPresident, let's have a new strategy, one on which we agree, we \ntogether, and that we need to do.\n  We have an opportunity that is very rare, and it is impressive to \nhave seven Democratic Senators and six Republican Senators on this \nsubject at this time supporting a comprehensive recommendation. One of \nour former colleagues, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, wrote a book \nabout Boss Plunkitt of Tammany Hall. Since I said some respectful \nadvice to my colleagues about what I thought our job was, I say to the \nPresident respectfully: Mr. President, one of Boss Plunkitt's favorite \nmaxims was: When you seize your opportunities, you take them. This is \nan opportunity for the President to develop bipartisan support for a \nway forward in Iraq that has a long-term presence there, but limited, \nwith a different mission for our combat troops and enhanced political \nand regional support.\n  I respectfully suggest that January would have been the best time to \nseize this opportunity, but today is a much better time than September.\n  I thank the Chair and I congratulate him for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to be on the record as thanking you \nfor your leadership on this legislation. You shared it with me more \nthan a couple of months ago now. I know you worked on it for a number \nof months before that. The Senate and the American people owe Senator \nKen Salazar of Colorado a real debt of gratitude for drafting this \nlegislation and pushing it to the point it has gotten to today.\n  I open by reading the first two paragraphs of the executive summary \nof the Iraq Study Group. This was written 6 months ago. It says:\n\n       The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. There is \n     no path that can guarantee success, but the prospects can be \n     improved.\n       In this report, we make a number of recommendations for \n     actions to be taken in Iraq, the United States, and the \n     region. Our most important recommendations call for new and \n     enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the \n     region, and a change in the primary mission of U.S. forces in \n     Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move its \n     combat forces out of Iraq responsibly. We believe that these \n     two recommendations are equally important and reinforce one \n     another. If they are effectively implemented, and if the \n     Iraqi government moves forward with national reconciliation, \n     Iraqis will have an opportunity for a better future, \n     terrorism will be dealt a blow, stability will be enhanced in \n     an important part of the world, and America's credibility, \n     interests, and values will be protected.\n\nThat was true when it was written 6 months ago, and it is still very \nrelevant today.\n  Today, I want to talk about amendment No. 2063 and encourage my \ncolleagues to consider voting for it and even cosponsoring it. One of \nthe things Senator Salazar did when he drafted this amendment is he \nworked very hard to try to honor the integrity of the findings and the \nrecommendations of the Baker-Hamilton group, and he has done that. You \ncan look at each paragraph of amendment No. 2063 and see that it \nreflects the essence of what the Iraq Study Group was trying to \ncommunicate to us.\n  In fact, we have had a couple of colleagues come to us in the last \nseveral days and say: Well, if you will just change this paragraph or \nthis sentence or this one word, or if we can just work a little bit on \nthis text, then I might be a cosponsor. Well, the problem there is, if \nwe change that, then we would be trying to change what the Iraq Study \nGroup recommended, and we are not going to do that. The purpose of this \namendment is to take this bipartisan commission's work and put it into \nlegislation.\n  Some people ask: Who made up this group? What is so magic about the \nIraq Study Group? Well, let me tell you, it has two former Secretaries \nof State, it has the former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, it has a former Supreme Court Associate Justice, it has a \nformer White House Chief of Staff, it has a former Secretary of \nDefense, and two former United States Senators. This is a group that \ncomes together with a lot of intelligence, with a lot of experience, \nand with a lot of knowledge about the region and international affairs \nand history.\n  I think the Iraq Study Group is the best effort that America has yet \nput forward on a thoughtful, responsible approach to Iraq. One of the \nthings I like about the Iraq study group's recommendations and their \nconclusions is it is not just setting an artificial timetable. I am a \nlittle bit out of sync with some of my Democratic colleagues on wanting \nto set a timetable on Iraq. I don't think we ought to have a public \ntimetable in the law. I know many of my Democratic colleagues disagree \nwith me, and a few of my Republican colleagues do as well. But the \nthing I like about the Iraq Study Group legislation, the Salazar-\nAlexander amendment, is, it is much more comprehensive than simply a \ntimetable. In fact, it is more comprehensive than just military.\n  It tries to take a different approach. It really tries to change \nAmerican policy in Iraq. And it is a multifaceted approach on trying to \ndeal with the issues in Iraq and the region. So what you are looking at \nwith the Iraq Study Group is you are not just looking at a military \nsolution. General Petraeus has said if we just have a military solution \nwe are going to lose. So the Iraq Study Group anticipates that, and it \nsays we need a diplomatic solution, an economic solution, a political \nsolution, and a military solution. I think it is the most comprehensive \napproach that anyone has put forward yet on Iraq.\n  Again, this is a bipartisan group that has come together, and this \namendment is bipartisan. We have seven Democrats and six Republicans. \nBy this time tomorrow we may have seven and seven, or eight and eight, \nor some combination thereof. We don't know exactly the number of \ncosponsors we will end up with, but certainly we hope we will have a \nsolid majority of Senators who will support this amendment when it has \na chance to come up.\n  As Senator Salazar said, and Senator Alexander echoed, part of what \nthis bill does is it gets U.S. forces out of the business of combat and \ninto the business of training and equipping others. And, really, what \nwe are trying to do is stabilize Iraq.\n  One thing I think the Iraq Study Group does over and over, for \nseveral pages in its findings, in its report, on several pages, is it \ntalks about diplomacy and regional diplomacy and how important it is to \nhave the neighborhood, so to speak, around Iraq--people inside Iraq and \naround the region--to have a part in stabilizing Iraq and making the \nregion more stable and stronger.\n  I have heard a couple of criticisms, such as my colleagues mentioned \ntonight, and one is that it is too prescriptive, that our legislation \nis too prescriptive. Another is that it doesn't do anything. And those \nare kind of polar opposite criticisms. In fact, there is an old saying \nthat when you are settling a lawsuit, if both sides are unhappy, maybe \nyou have a good settlement. So I would say in this situation, at least \none way to look at it is both sides are unhappy.\n  We are trying to thread the needle. We are trying to find a \nbipartisan solution on Iraq, a bipartisan consensus in this body. In \nfact, I would say this: With all due respect to my colleagues, and my \nHouse colleagues, and the President, the last thing in the world we \nshould ever have a party-line vote on is Iraq. We have 150,000 troops \nin Iraq. They are getting shot at every day. They are putting their \nlives on the line for this country and for Iraq every single day. There \nare people out there trying to kill them, trying to maim them, trying \nto blow them up--you name it--every day. We should never have a party-\nline vote on Iraq. We just shouldn't do it. And this amendment right \nhere, this is an effort to try to bring the consensus that we need on \nIraq.\n  Senator Alexander told me a couple of months ago, he said: You know, \nwe talk about needing a political consensus in Baghdad. He said: What \nwe really need is a political consensus in Washington, DC, on Iraq. And \nI think he is right. The Salazar-Alexander amendment tries to get to \nthat consensus.\n  I will say this: For the Senators who believe this amendment doesn't \ndo anything, I disagree. I think this is a significant step in a new \ndirection, in a positive direction for Iraq. In fact, you can look at \nthe amendment itself, and it has 13 sections. It is true that 3 of\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\nthe 13 are sense-of-Congress sections--3 out of 13. But that means 10 \nof 13 are binding, 10 of 13 actually change U.S. policy and have \nrequirements that have teeth. I would encourage my colleagues who \nmistakenly believe this amendment doesn't do anything to actually look \nat the language of the amendment and they will see it is a very \nsignificant improvement over our current policy in Iraq.\n  Some people say it is too prescriptive. In other words, it binds the \nPresident's hands too much. I disagree. When you look at the language \nthat Senator Salazar and members of the Iraq Study Group came up with \nwhen they drafted this, really what you are talking about is laying out \nsome very specific things but also giving the President quite a bit of \nflexibility. And I think that is important. He is the Chief Executive. \nHe is the Commander in Chief, and I think Senator Salazar and Senator \nAlexander have found the right balance in drafting this amendment.\n  The last thing I will say in closing, going back to the Iraq Study \nGroup Report that came out this past December, and back to the \nexecutive summary--I started with reading the first two paragraphs of \nthe executive summary, so let me conclude by reading the last two \nparagraphs of the executive summary in the Iraq Study Group Report:\n\n       It is the unanimous view of the Iraq study group that these \n     recommendations offer a new way forward for the United States \n     in Iraq and the region. They are comprehensive and need to be \n     implemented in a coordinated fashion. They should not be \n     separated or carried out in isolation. The dynamics of the \n     region are as important to Iraq as events within Iraq.\n       The challenges are daunting. There will be difficult days \n     ahead. But by pursuing this new way forward, Iraq, the \n     region, and the United States of America can emerge stronger.\n\n  Again, I think those words were true 6 months ago, I think they are \nrelevant today, and I think we need to give the Iraq Study Group \nrecommendations a chance to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I inquire as to the floor? I understand it is \navailable to anyone at this time; no time constraints? I would like to \nspeak for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has been allocated 10 minutes \nunder the previous order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I wish to \ncommend the Presiding Officer for his work, as, indeed, my good friend, \nSenator Alexander, and this colleague.\n  I must state, with a sense of total modesty, that my contribution \ntonight would be just to express some concerns. I have followed the \nwork of your group. Very kindly, the principals on this have invited me \nto join, but I have thus far not done so because I can't find yet the \nanswers to some critical issues I have in mind.\n  First, I say to my colleagues that I had a little to do with starting \nthe group now known as Baker-Hamilton, or the Iraq Study Group. I think \nI worked with my colleague who did the major part of the work, \nCongressman Frank Wolf, and then we engaged a local, highly recognized, \nand well-qualified group in Washington associated with studies to take \non some of the infrastructure. It was a remarkable recruiting of \ntalent, which my colleague recited, and I think they did a very \ncredible and fine job.\n  It was a major contribution at a time in the fall of 2006 when there \nwas a great deal of concern among many of us about the situation in \nIraq. I had returned in that fall from a trip to Iraq and expressed \npublicly my thoughts that the country was just drifting aimlessly \nsideways, and that remark, together with remarks of others of a similar \nnature, sparked the intensity of the administration's undertaking \ntheir, I think, very thorough review leading up to the President's \nremarks when he announced a change in strategy on January 10, 2007.\n  Now, I have referred to the Iraq Study Group work. I think there were \n7, 8, 9 months that they studied, with hearings and so forth. But when \nthey put pen to paper and wrote it, it was a snapshot of the situation \nthat faced this Nation and, indeed, our partners, the coalition forces, \nin Iraq. They made certain assumptions at that time which led to the \nstrategy they outlined.\n  Among those assumptions was that we had reason to believe the Iraqi \nGovernment, freely elected, in place, was going to become a truly \nrepresentative unity government of all factions. They committed a \ncertain number of benchmarks, and it was thought at that time that \nthose benchmarks could be met. That, I think is fair to say, was an \nassumption they had.\n  Our country, together with our coalition partners, had been in \ntraining with the Iraqi forces for some 2 years plus at that time, \nbuilding up their own internal army, national guard, and police force. \nSo the Iraq Study Group, in my judgment, took a snapshot of the \nsituation in the fall of 2006, put it to paper, and it was in the \nPresident's framework of things that were considered when he derived \nhis policy and enunciated it in January.\n  I, together with, I think, the colleagues on the Senate floor \ntonight, said to the President, after his announcement on January 10, \nthat I was concerned that more of the Iraq Study Group concept was not \ninfused into his new strategy. I remember specifically addressing the \nissue of the sectarian violence, now described by some as a civil war \nof some stage, and injecting the American GI, who really had no \nbackground in the complicated culture of the Muslim religion and the \nMuslim people, into that situation.\n  And I am not in any way denigrating that religion or that culture. \nIndeed, it is one of the oldest and, I think, most respected on Earth \ntoday. But, nevertheless, there are among the Muslim religion a few who \nreally are dead set on changing the world--we know all about that--and \nnow they are wreaking utter havoc, primarily in Iraq, and to an extent \nnow in Afghanistan.\n  But that snapshot and those assumptions have not been borne out. We \ndo not have any real evidence before us today, or real basis for much \nhope as to what this Iraqi Government might achieve in the foreseeable \nfuture. The President specifically said on January 10, the Armed Forces \nof Iraq will take the lead. We will be largely in a supporting role. We \nwill embed forces, we will train, we will supply, but they are taking \nmore of the lead. In fact, they have to a limited extent but not to the \nextent that I believe are the hopes and expectations that were raised \nin the President's January 10 framework of remarks. Certainly the \nGovernment has not performed as we had hoped and expected. The Armed \nForces are making a contribution today but not to the degree that was \nanticipated in the fall of 2006.\n  I could go on and recite other concerns I have about this report, \nnamely, can anyone point to where the Department of Defense sat down \nand studied the strategy in this report and has reached conclusions as \nto whether it would work better than the current strategy? Would it \nbring about a greater strength of government? Would it bring about a \ngreater will, simple will among the Iraqi forces, to take on more and \nmore responsibility?\n  I think, before we recommend to this body and, indeed, if it were to \npass and become legislation, to the President, that he consider \nimplementing a major portion, as this amendment describes, of the \nrecommendations of the Iraq Study Group, someone better bring forth a \ncareful military analysis of what might occur given the situation \ntoday--not the situation in the fall of 2006--of what would happen if \nwe made a shift in strategy from the one now employed to this.\n  That is essential, if we are asking Senators to support that. Show us \nsome analytical study of this strategy and how it would bring about \ngreater results than the current strategy being employed.\n  There is great credibility attached to this report, primarily because \nof the extraordinary membership--their experience, their achievements \nin the private and public sector. Do we know for a fact that all \nmembers of that committee are endorsing the concept that now the Senate \nshould lift their report as written and prepared some 8 months ago? Are \nthere not some among that group who might question today whether the \nassumptions that they had that led to their report are still there to \nsupport now a shift of strategy? I don't know. I don't see that \nevidence. I\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\nwish to see something from the members, each one, because I think it \nwould be difficult if we shifted to this Iraq Study Group and one or \nmore of the members of that group got up in the public and said: What \nwe said then is simply not going to work today.\n  I think that is important because you are trading on the credibility \nof men and women of clear conscience, extraordinary backgrounds, who \ndid, I think, a very fine job as best they could based on facts which \nhave largely changed, or facts or assumptions that have not \nmaterialized.\n  We talk about a bipartisan resolution. I think the colleagues tonight \njoined me some weeks ago in putting together a consensus of a \nbipartisan nature, to go forward and to guide this Nation. It was, \nsomewhat to my surprise, taken almost verbatim by the appropriators and \nincluded in the recent appropriations bill--I say recent, it was 6 or 8 \nweeks ago--and is now the law.\n  Part of that report that I wrote together with colleagues here said \nwe ought to have an independent analysis of the Iraqi security forces \nas they exist today and what they might represent 2, 3, 4, 5 months \ninto the future. I must say--I say it with a sense of humility--I \npersuaded a former commandant of the Marine Corps, Jim Jones, a man who \nhas enormous credibility on both sides of the Congress, House and \nSenate, to head that group. I have met with him. He brought in \ndistinguished retired military officers. Tonight, as we are here \ndebating, they are in Iraq, preparing a report for this Congress and \nfor the President as to their best judgment as to the military \nproficiency, the capability and will to fight of the Iraqi forces today \nand what is the likelihood that will improve in the months to come, \nbecause so much of all of our strategy, be it the surge strategy or any \nstrategy, is dependent on that. As the President has said most \neloquently: When they stand up, we will stand down.\n  I believed we needed an independent study, not to criticize the \nDepartment of Defense which for months has provided report after report \nof their analysis, but we ought to get a second opinion. That is now \nbeing prepared and will be brought forth, I think, in large part and \nmade public prior to the President making his September 15 analysis.\n  That report we put together, which was adopted by the appropriators, \nthe bill we had here, required the President to report to the Congress \non or before July 15. I believed it was very important for colleagues \nto have a current analysis by the President, drawing upon the CENTCOM \nCommander, Admiral Fallon, drawing upon General Petraeus and other \nelements of the administration, to provide the Congress with a set of \nfacts so, on the assumption we leave here early in August on a recess, \nwe have a current analysis provided by the executive branch.\n  That report will be forthcoming. I think it is imminent. I happen to \nknow the dates--I think we do--but I am not at liberty to divulge them \ntonight.\n  That report will also analyze the benchmarks, which benchmarks we \nrecited in that bill which was voted on by this Chamber, or adopted by \nover 50 votes. We had to have a 60-vote margin. We couldn't make the 60 \nbut we made it over 50. They will talk about each of the benchmarks and \nwhether the Iraqi Government has made them and, if they have not, what \nthe administration has done to try to encourage the Government to meet \nthose benchmarks.\n  At this point in time there is a lot of conscientious work going on \ndirected at the September timeframe when reports by General Jones and \nhis group will come forth, the President will make another report, I am \nhopeful that the intelligence components of our Government will have an \nupgraded National Intelligence Estimate--so much is to be learned, when \nall this information is brought to the attention of the American public \nand to the Congress in the first weeks of September.\n  It is my urging that colleagues at this time in the debate on this \nbill, the annual authorization bill, try not to preempt and prejudge \nhow this information will be formulated and given to the American \npublic early in September.\n  I will close with a bit of a personal story. In 1951, 1952, I was \nprivileged to serve in the United States Marine Corps. I was with a \nsquadron of fighter bombers in old, cold Korea during that winter. I \nwas a ground officer, a staff officer. I don't claim any fame \nwhatsoever. I was doing my duty. But I watched those aviators as they \nwould take off every day. I had occasion, because of my duties, to go \nup to visit the infantry and watch them.\n\n  At the same time, in the fall of 1951-1952, there was sort of a \nconference going on, largely in Panmunjon and elsewhere, to try to \nbring about peace and resolve that conflict. I remember these \nindividuals who had to go out in harm's way each day, many of them, and \nsaid: I am wondering if I am going to be the last soldier, marine, or \nairman to take the last bullet because next time we may wake up and \nthey have resolved this problem.\n  It dawned on them, but they went on and performed their duties. I say \nthere is some parallel to this situation. Were the Senate to adopt this \npiece of work--about which I say to my colleagues, you have worked hard \non, your hearts are in it--it would send a signal that what the \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are doing today, carrying out \nthe orders of the Commander in Chief, it would put in question that \nstrategy. Their minds would go through that same thought: Well, if they \nare going to change it, why don't we change it right away? Because I \ndon't want to be the last soldier to take the last bullet, if we are \ngoing to change this strategy and this strategy is not achieving the \ngoals that were laid down.\n  It has the possibility of bringing about a great concern of those \nyoung people, so valiantly fighting and giving life and limb to carry \nout the orders of the President.\n  I think we have to pause, reflect on what we say and what we do as we \nare working on this bill. It seems to me the President is Commander in \nChief and has made a decision. He is within, I think, 48 hours going to \nrelease this report and speak to the Nation. Practically speaking, this \namendment I presume will not be brought up--I know as a fact--prior to \nhis statement. But it seems to me we ought to listen carefully to what \nhe has to say and his resolve as to what strategy we should be \nfollowing in the ensuing days and weeks to come. I translate that into \nthe minds of these young people fighting this fight and their families \nhere at home, so worried, understandably, about the welfare of their \nloved ones.\n  I say to my colleagues, have you looked at the intelligence? I have \ntaken it upon myself to go out to the various entities of the \nintelligence part of our community and specifically asked them about \nwhat they think the consequences would be if there were a change to \nthis strategy. I am not at liberty to give their responses but I urge \nyou to access on your own initiative that information and reflect upon \nit as you move forward and you endeavor to persuade other colleagues to \njoin you in this endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to come tonight to \nexpress my views to good friends, friends who worked with me and did \nwork with me on that piece of legislation which eventually became a \npart of the appropriations bill and is now the law of the land. That is \nthe legislation that requires the President in 48 hours to make a \nreport to the Nation and to the Congress and to lay down what his \nintentions are for the weeks to come, until he gives his next report on \nSeptember 15.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that we have another up to 15 \nminutes in morning business, equally divided between myself and Senator \nAlexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the concerns \nand comments from my distinguished friend, the great Senator from \nVirginia. He and I had the opportunity to travel to Iraq and to \nAfghanistan about a year or so ago. There is no one on this Senate \nfloor that I respect any more than the Senator from Virginia. I \nconsider him to be a colleague and a role model in the working \nrelationship that he and the chairman of the Armed Services today, \nSenator Levin, have. It is, I think, an example of how we ought\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nto do things on the Senate floor more often. The fact that we have a \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill, which is a very good bill, in \nfront of the Senate today is a manifestation and a testament to the \ngreat work and the bipartisan spirit of Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin. It is with great respect I offer these comments on some of the \nconcerns that he raised.\n  First, with respect to the Iraq Study Group report being simply a \nsnapshot of what was happening in December, I respectfully disagree \nwith that assessment of what they did. It was not as if on December 15 \nor the day that the Iraq Study Group delivered their recommendations \nthat they said this is a picture of what is happening in Iraq today. \nWhat the Iraq Study Group did is they took a look at the history of \nwhat had happened in Iraq. They took a look at the regional conflicts \nand at the dynamics that were driving the conflicts in that region and \nthey reached a number of different conclusions which were as true in \nDecember as they are today, and which were as true, frankly, a year \nbefore December as they are today.\n  So it was not a snapshot, it was taking an assessment of the historic \nconflict in the region, some of which has gone on not for 4 or 5 years \nbut 10 years, 100 years, 1,000 years, in some cases, in terms of the \nsectarian conflict we see today in Iraq.\n  It was out of that history that they came up with what they perceived \nto be the best way forward for the country in terms of how we dealt not \nonly with the issue of Iraq but the very integrated issue of the Middle \nEast conflict with respect to the whole future of not only Iraq but \nalso the neighbors in that region.\n  So it was not a snapshot, from my point of view. In our dealings with \nboth Congressman Hamilton and Secretary Baker, as we came forward and \nfashioned this legislation, it was their view that this legislation \nwas, in fact, the best way forward. It was written in consultation with \ninput from Senator Alexander. I reached out to both Congressman \nHamilton as well as Secretary Baker. This amendment was written with \ntheir best thoughts in mind on how we could faithfully implement the \nrecommendations of the Iraq Study Group.\n  So I daresay that the characterizations that cochairman of the \ncommission, Hamilton, had to say yesterday about the importance and \ncurrent relevancy of this recommendation of the Iraq Study Group are \nstill as relevant today as they were in December. In fact, Congressman \nHamilton said the Baker-Hamilton Commission recommendations today were, \nin fact, as relevant as they were in December and that the urgency of \nthe implementation of those recommendations, if I may paraphrase him, \nwas even more urgent today than it was back in December as we continue \nto drift sideways, spiral downward frankly, in the conditions in Iraq.\n  I do not argue it was a snapshot. It was a recommendation that came \nout after an indepth study by some of the best experts in the world, \nincluding our military advisers. Secondly, my friend from Virginia also \nsays that circumstances have changed in Iraq, that the Iraqi Government \nmay not be as functional as any of us would want the Iraq Government to \nbe.\n  Well, the fact of the matter is that no one has sent the clear \ndirection by law to the Iraqi Government that support from America to \nthe Iraqi Government and to the Iraqi people is dependent on them \nmaking progress on the ground. This legislation does that specifically, \nas the Iraq Study Group recommends.\n  Thirdly, there were lots of military advisers that were involved in \nproviding advice, counsel, and guidance to the Iraq Study Group. It \nincluded ADM James Ellis, GEN John Keane, GEN Edward Meyer, GEN Joseph \nRalston, LTG Roger Schultz and hundreds of other people who were \nconsulted for their expertise in the formulation of the recommendations \nthat went into the Iraq Study Group.\n  Finally, I would say that of all the debate we have had on Iraq, the \nfundamental reality still remains the same. There is only the one group \nchartered, in part because of the leadership of the Senator from \nVirginia, that took a comprehensive look at the situation in Iraq and \nthe Middle East and came up with a set of recommendations that were \ncomprehensive in nature.\n  When you look at the bipartisan composition of that commission, they \nspoke on what is in the best interests of America based on the best \ninformation they were able to acquire from around the world and the \nbest military and foreign policy experts we have. So, in my view, the \nIraq Study Group recommendations are still as relevant today as they \nwere in December.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join us in this bipartisan effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Virginia for coming back to \nthe floor from another engagement and offering his comments on our \nproposal. He has made an extraordinary effort to do that at a late hour \nin the evening. I am grateful to him for that.\n  I hope he will not mind my saying that I have seen him agonize over \nthis war. We have talked about it privately, going many months back \nbefore many Senators did, about how do we reconcile our national \ninterests with the lives of young men and women from Virginia and \nTennessee, which we have to think about every day.\n  He was one of the first to raise questions about our strategy. \nBecause he did and because of his background as Navy Secretary and his \nservice in World War II and in the Korean War and his senior position \non Armed Services, everyone paid attention when John Warner spoke.\n  We have paid attention to his advice every step of the way. What I \nwould like to say, very briefly, in response to my friend from \nVirginia, is this: I would hope that over the next few days as we \nconsider this, that he will think a little differently about his own \ncontribution to the shift in direction our country needs.\n  His first contribution, in addition to his statement, is the Iraq \nStudy Group report. He was a little too modest about it. He had a major \nrole in getting it started. If he had not, we would not have the kind \nof membership on the Iraq Study Group that we had with Secretary Baker \nand the leaders of so many different administrations.\n  Their recommendations need not be put on the bookshelf as a bookend, \nthey need to be used.\n\n  Having said that, I can understand how he and the President and \nothers might be concerned that if one were to read our proposal too \nprescriptively, they would say: Well, how can we pick up 79 \nrecommendations and say, Mr. President, do all of those things.\n  The way I read our amendment, we do not do that. The way I read our \namendment we say very simply that the President and the Congress agree \nthe way forward in Iraq is to implement this comprehensive set of \nrecommendations, and the President himself should formulate a \ncomprehensive plan to do so.\n  In another part of the amendment, when we get to the part about when \nthe troops come home or when the troops' mission moves from a combat \nmission to a support and equipping mission, that is all subject to \nunexpected developments in the security situation on the ground.\n  So I would say with respect to my colleague from Virginia, that \nanother way--and perhaps I am reading it wrong, but the way I read it, \nanother way to read this is to say: Let's take the wisdom of this group \nof 10 people, one of them who has ended up as Secretary of Defense in \nthis administration, and say: That gives us a framework. We can adopt \nthat together. And then, Mr. President, you take these recommendations \nand you draw up a plan.\n  This is not going to be a plan that the Senator from Colorado and I \ndrew up. The President is the only one authorized to draw it up. As it \naffects troops, it is subject to security developments on the ground; \nthere is no fixed deadline of any kind here.\n  I assume that what the President would do, if he were to receive this \nas a law, which might be September by the time it got all the way \nthrough the conferences, the first person he would sit down with is \nGeneral Petraeus and say: Tell me again about the surge. How are things \non the ground? What is your recommendation?\n  The second thing he might do is sit down with General Jones and say: \nTell me, General, what have you found out about the position of the \nIraqi forces?\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\n  Then I think he would call in the Joint Chiefs and the intelligence \nfolks and say: I have to develop a plan. Give me your advice about what \nworks and what does not work. Then he would present us the plan within \n90 days. But it is not subject to our approval. It is his plan.\n  Now, we can then do what we can do with our constitutional duties \nabout it. But the one thing I am afraid we will miss if we do not move \nto adopt the recommendations now of the Iraq Study Group is the \nbipartisan support that was in that group that the Senator from \nVirginia helped to create and the bipartisan support that is on this \nfloor for those recommendations. The President doesn't have that now. \nWithout that, he cannot sustain a long-term mission in Iraq of any \nkind, I am afraid. I think we have to have one of some kind over a long \ntime.\n  So I think this goes about as far as it can within this group to say \nto the President: Okay. We can agree with you. But now you draw up the \nplan according to these structures.\n  I greatly respect the Senator from Virginia. I will continue to \nlisten to him. I am deeply grateful to him for coming back to the floor \ntonight. I thank him for his direction in helping to make possible the \nIraq Study Group plan, General Jones' study. I know we will have many \nmore discussions. But the one thing I do not want the President to lose \nis the opportunity to borrow for our long-term strategy the bipartisan \nsupport in this document and the bipartisan support on this floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving in \nthis body for 29 years. I have never met a finer gentleman than my \ncolleague from Tennessee. I thank you for your gracious reference to \nthis humble Senator.\n  I simply say that this has been a constructive debate. We have an \nhonest difference of opinion. But I would urge that perhaps you check \ninto some of the analysis that has been performed in certain segments \nof the Government about the current operations and how the benchmarks, \nso to speak--or maybe I withdraw those words--the points of strategy \nthat are in the Iraq Study Group will or will not adopt.\n  I would simply say the obvious to my colleagues, that that report of \nthe Iraq Study Group is still on the President's desk. I do not think \nhe requires the need of the Senate to tell him what is in it. He knows. \nHe looked at it, I have been given that assurance, very carefully \nbefore he devised his January 10 strategy.\n  The concern, the greatest concern I have is sort of sending out a \nsignal we have throughout, that this strategy would be working better \nthan this current strategy. I frankly felt that and expressed that on \nJanuary 10. But I have to accept the fact that he is the Commander in \nChief. He made the decision. He decided not, at this time, to implement \nthe framework of the Baker-Hamilton report but to go ahead with the \nsurge.\n  I am hesitant to criticize him now. I criticized pretty heavily, if \nyou look at the Congressional Record, in January. I urged in several \nspeeches that more of this Iraq Study Group concept be incorporated in \nthe surge strategy. But having done that, I feel obligated now to \nsupport the President because he is committed to follow the law of the \nland as originated in this Chamber in a bill which I sponsored, and I \nbelieve my distinguished colleague from Tennessee did vote for. That \nbill, almost in its entirety, was incorporated into the appropriations \nbill by the conference of the House and the Senate, and it is the law \nof the land.\n  I hope the report that will be forthcoming in 48 hours reflects the \nseriousness of how the President approached the mandates of the \nCongress: Report to us on July 15. I have every reason he will do a \nreport no later than September 15. At that time, he will have the \nbenefit of a surge which is now, as envisioned, fully staffed and \nimplemented by our complement of soldiers, together with such other \nIraqi complements and perhaps some coalition forces, and we will then \nhave been shown, did the surge work.\n  I, frankly, think the surge, if allowed to continue in the September \ntimeframe, will have achieved a measure of what they set out to do. But \nthe corollary obligation of the Iraqi Government to accept an improved \nsecurity situation in Baghdad, created by the sacrifice of soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen, and marines in the surge, and the Iraqi fighters \nwith them, they will not have taken advantage of what was achieved by \nthat enormous sacrifice. That is my great concern. I hope I am wrong.\n  But in the time that remains, I am doubtful the concept that greater \nsecurity in the Baghdad region will translate into greater activity and \naccomplishments by the Iraqi Government.\n  While there may be some military success, I don't see the signs now \nof the success that was anticipated by the Iraqi Government.\n  I close by saying I thank you for the opportunity. I commend you for \nyour hard work and what you believe in. That is important in this \ninstitution, your own personal involvement and will to fight for what \nyou believe. But I do urge you to take a look at what the intelligence \ncommunity is looking at, determine the current military analysis. I say \nto my colleague from Colorado, indeed, there were a number of \nwitnesses, professional retired witnesses with military experience that \ncontributed to this. But again, they were looking at a situation and a \nfactual basis that has substantially changed. I say to my colleagues, \nlook at the intelligence, get some military analysis, and then think \nthrough carefully if the President has this on his desk still, it is \nthere, do we need to pass a bill in the Senate and send a signal that \nwould begin to engender some doubt in what we are doing now as being \nthe best course of action and the risks associated with the men and \nwomen trying to carry forward and respond to the orders of the \nCommander in Chief. That is my fervent plea to you.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/11/senate-section/article/S9066-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
