Mr. President, it is summertime and school is out and \npeople are planning their vacations. Most all the vacations are ones \nwhere people drive. They, of course, go visit relatives, they go to the \nbeaches and the mountains where it is cool, barbecuing with friends, \nbut driving is part of America. If you have traveled in Nevada, which \nmillions of people do by automobile every year, going through Nevada \nand coming to places such as Las Vegas, Reno, and Lake Tahoe, you find \nthe price of gas is very high. But it is that way all over the country, \nnot just Nevada. The record-high price is no accident. It is a result \nof America's addiction to oil.\n  I say again, as I have said many times before, today in America we \nare going to use 21 million barrels of oil; 65 percent of that oil we \nwill import. We will do it from unstable countries and regions. We have \nbeen told with no uncertainty by scientists that we have only 10 to 15 \nyears to do something to dramatically reduce the elements of pollution \nthat cause global warming.\n  This week we are going to continue our debate on energy legislation. \nThis is a bill on which every Senator should agree, but they do not. \nThis is a bill that comes out of the Energy Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis, a bill that comes out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis, a bill that comes out of the Commerce \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis. They were all put together and this is \nwhat is before us, a bipartisan energy bill.\n  The bill addresses both sides of the energy crisis, consumption and \nsupply. That is what it is all about. On the consumption side, this \nbill raises fuel economy standards for cars and trucks and raises \nefficiency standards for light, heat, and water.\n  We now know we have to produce vehicles that get 27 miles to the \ngallon. For people, including our automobile manufacturers, to say: We \ncan't do it, we can't simply in a decade produce vehicles that will be \n35-miles-per-gallon efficient--our country is one of ingenuity, of \ninventing things--certainly we can do that. We have to do that.\n  On the supply side, our legislation invests in renewable fuels that \ncan be produced right here in America. It would sure be good for our \ncountry if we could include an amendment that would diversify power \ngeneration to include at least 15 percent of the energy from renewable \nsources. This will save consumers tens of billions of dollars every \nyear, cut our oil consumption by more than 4 million barrels a day, \nreduce our dependence on oil and foreign energy sources, and take a \ngiant step\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\nforward in the fight against global warming.\n  Raising CAFE standards and implementing a renewable portfolio \nstandard are two of the most crucial parts of this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to stand on the side of the American people by supporting \nthis legislation: CAFE that is in the bill, and the renewable portfolio \nstandard that was introduced by Senator Bingaman.\n  There are some who say we need to produce more oil. Of course we do. \nBut keep in mind, out of 100 percent of the oil in the world, America \ncontrols less than 3 percent of it. This is the world; here we are. We \nhave that much of the oil. We can't produce our way out of the problems \nwe have. But it appears to me that many are saying more of the same: \ndrill, drill, drill, which is similar to what the administration is \nsaying about the war in Iraq, more of the same. That will not work. \nDrill, drill, drill will not work either.\n\n  It is time for our country to stop stonewalling and start supporting \nthe kind of innovation that is already happening across America with \nthe renewable portfolio standard. In the State of Nevada, there is a \nrenewable portfolio standard. American ingenuity is looking at things, \nlike in California where one professor is working on a new technology \nthat can manufacture fuel out of simple plant material in any \nindustrial park in America. I have eminent scientists who visit with me \non this issue. There is wide-ranging support. I had come to my office \none day last week--I was surprised--Paul Newman, the famous actor. He \ncame to talk about this plant material. He is a person who is devoted \nto the environment. He is using his celebrity status to come and tell \nMembers of Congress to do something about it.\n  So we have eminent scientists, we have people of celebrity status \nsuch as Paul Newman, and the rest of Americans who want us to do \nsomething about it.\n  In Pennsylvania, Amish farmers are charging their buggy batteries \nwith solar power. In the State of Nevada, the Southern Nevada Water \nAuthority, which is Las Vegas, is using solar energy at water pumping \nstations to move water uphill, something that in the past would have \nrequired tremendous nonrenewable power. There are things that can be \ndone.\n  I was listening to public radio this morning. They are having a \ndrought in Australia--I believe it was Sidney. I am not sure what the \nname of the city was. But they have had a lot of new people come and \ntheir water supply has dropped by 21 percent, so they are desalinizing \nwater from the ocean. But the people said: We are not going to do that \nby burning fossil fuel. So what they have done is they have wind farms \n60 miles away--I think that is how far it is; quite a ways away--wind \nfarms, producing all the energy which now supplies 20 percent of the \nwater for that city in Australia which needs millions of gallons of \nwater every day.\n  It can be done. We need to lessen our dependence on fossil fuel. That \nkind of innovation is exactly what America does best, and that is what \nthe Government should be investing in, things like I just talked about. \nThe energy crisis will not be solved overnight, but this bill is a \ncrucial first step. So let's take that first step. It is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation; not divided by our political parties but united, \nI hope, by our commitment to a cleaner, safer energy future. We are \ngoing to finish this bill sometime this week unless something goes \nhaywire.\n  Then, when we finish that, we are going to move on to everyone's \nfavorite subject, immigration.\n  I mentioned this last Friday, and I say it again: People who have \nweekend schedules should understand if they are going to be gone from \nthe Senate, they are likely going to miss votes. We cannot get to \nimmigration until Thursday at the earliest. In an effort to finish by \nour Fourth of July recess, we have to take up the bill Thursday, \nprobably late in the day, which will mean votes over the weekend. It is \nalways possible by unanimous consent that may not be necessary, but I \nam telling everybody the odds are tremendous that we will be voting \nthis weekend. And on Monday there will be votes and there will be votes \nbefore 5:30. It is our last weekend before the Fourth of July recess. \nWe have work to do. I hope we don't run into the Fourth of July recess, \nbut we may have to if we can't get things done.\n  I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news regarding the schedule, but \nwe have obligations to complete energy and immigration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/18/senate-section/article/S7802-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am in the Chamber to speak to some \namendments to the Energy bill which the Senate debated last week and is \ncontinuing to debate this week.\n  The first is an amendment I offered last week, along with Senator \nSnowe, where we are joined by many Senators, including Senator \nBingaman, who is managing the bill on the majority side, as well as \nSenator Collins and Senator Coleman, as well as Senators Kerry, Boxer, \nand Carper.\n  There are a number of people supporting this amendment throughout the \nSenate because they understand if we are going to discuss any kind of \nclimate change policy going forward, we at least need to have accurate \ninformation. Other countries are doing this quite successfully.\n  The idea is to have one gathering place for information, and that \nwould be our EPA. The amendment gives them latitude to set this up as \nthey would like, but the idea is to have one place for a carbon \nregistry or, to make it easier, a carbon counter. I figure if Weight \nWatchers can have a calorie counter, we can have a carbon counter.\n  Now, what is interesting about this is the type of business support \nwe have seen for action in this area. Obviously, we have seen action \nacross our States--in places such as my State of Minnesota, in places \nsuch as California and Arizona and New Jersey--all over this country.\n  I have often said the States have taken the lead, that they have been \nmore than the laboratories of democracy, they have been the aggressors. \nOne of our national magazines this week has a picture of Governor \nSchwarzenegger and Mayor Bloomberg on the front cover, and it says: \n``Who Needs Washington?'' Because they are moving so quickly? Well, \nthat cover says it all.\n  We need to be relevant. We need to lead the national energy policy. \nWe need to at least gather the information we need to make good \ndecisions about climate change policy going forward.\n  Now, as for the businesses, in January, it made quite a big splash \nwhen some American businesses came together to form the U.S. Climate \nAction Partnership. They actually urged Congress to fast track a \ngreenhouse gas inventory and registry. They asked it be done by the end \nof this year.\n  With my short time in the Senate, I realize you cannot wait until \nSeptember or December to get this idea passed. If you are actually \ngoing to get it done by the end of the year, you need to get it passed \nnow.\n  Now, let me go through some of the companies that are part of this \nU.S. CAP group that is advocating for change, that is acknowledging \nclimate change is an issue, and is advocating for a national registry. \nThey include Alcoa; American Industry Group, or AIG; Boston Scientific \nCorporation; BP America; Caterpillar; ConocoPhillips;\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nDeere & Company; the Dow Chemical Company; Duke Energy; DuPont; General \nElectric; General Motors Corporation; Johnson & Johnson; Marsh, Inc.; \nPepsiCo; PG Corporation; PNM Resources; Shell; and Siemens \nCorporation. These are the kinds of companies I am talking about.\n\n  Now, there has been some concern expressed over this bill by the \nNational Chamber of Commerce, and I have to tell my colleagues it kind \nof surprises me. First of all, we have a number of good business \nDemocrats as well as good business Republicans on this bill who \nunderstand that you don't want 31 States doing their own national \nclimate registry. I don't have a problem with it because there is no \nchoice. It is the right thing to do. But, in fact, it is much better if \nwe do this on a national basis involving the U.S. Government.\n  Responding to the challenges these businesses laid out, the \nKlobuchar-Snowe-Bingaman amendment establishes a national greenhouse \ngas registry that will gather and consolidate consistent, transparent, \nand reliable data on greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level. \nThe amendment, as I mentioned, requires the Environmental Protection \nAgency to consider cost and coordinate with existing Federal and State \nprograms in implementing the registry.\n  The new registry only covers major emitting facilities and major \nsources of fossil fuel. Utilities already reporting under the Clean Air \nAct would not have to report their data twice.\n  How this is working now is a patchwork of reporting. Some industries \nare reporting to the Energy Department, some industries are reporting \nto the EPA, some are reporting every 3 years, some are reporting every \nyear, and it makes it very difficult to get the kind of greenhouse gas \nemissions data we need to make adequate decisions about climate change \nlegislation.\n  Let me say this bill, with three Republicans and several Democrats on \nit, does not in any way dictate what our next step will be for climate \nchange. It puts the data in place as these major companies asked for \nand fast-tracks it by the end of the year.\n  I also note that for facilities facing burdensome costs in purchasing \nadvanced monitoring equipment, the EPA would accept basic fossil fuel \ndata, which is collected by businesses for general accounting purposes. \nThe EPA would then calculate emissions based on that fuel data.\n  The amendment also specifies that confidential business information \nwould not be published; however, we will have a Web site which would at \nleast give the greenhouse gas emissions data to the public.\n  There was a recent report by National Public Radio which showed that \na reporter tried to find out who are some of the larger emitters of \ngreenhouse gases in this country. She was unable to figure it out. She \ncould figure it out in Canada. Because greenhouse gases are invisible, \nit is very difficult to do by looking at businesses. The registry \nexcludes small businesses as defined by the Small Business \nAdministration, which is less than 500 employees that emit less than \n10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas per year.\n  This amendment makes a lot of sense. It is a commonsense amendment, \nand I am going to be urging my colleagues to support it in the next 2 \ndays. If we can't take this simple step when we are looking at an \nenergy bill, as we are looking at a new direction for energy policy and \nas we are looking at great new ideas for buildings and appliances--as I \nlike to say, I heard somewhere of building a fridge to the 21st \ncentury--as we look at the possibility of raising the gas mileage \nstandards and setting standards in a way that will spur investment \nacross this country, we have to put in place at least the building \nblocks, sensible building blocks toward a new climate change policy.\n  The other thing I would like to address today on this vital topic of \nenergy security is the role I believe renewable fuels ought to play in \nmeeting our Nation's future energy needs.\n  The United States today spends more than $200,000 per minute on \nforeign oil. That is $200,000 per minute. That is $13 million per hour. \nThe money is shipped out of our economy, adding to our enormous trade \ndeficit, and leaving us vulnerable to unstable parts of the world to \nmeet our basic energy needs.\n  Oil companies would have you believe that energy security is decades \naway; that we need some new technology, some vehicle of the future \nbefore we can break the stranglehold oil has on us. I believe we are \ngoing to see this new technology. I believe we are going to see these \nvehicles of the future. But meanwhile, we can't sit and wait and wait \nand wait. We have to start now.\n  Any Minnesota farmer can tell you that one way to go about this is \nwith homegrown renewable fuels. They are here today. Ask someone in \nBrazil, and they will tell you that with sugarcane, they become energy \nindependent. They moved to homegrown energy. In our State, they are \nready to use this homegrown energy, and they believe it will help us to \nbreak free from our addiction to oil.\n  Consider this: In 2006, ethanol offset the need for 170 million \nbarrels of imported oil and kept $11 billion in rural America. Consider \nthis as well: A flexible fuel vehicle driven on about 85 percent \nethanol fuel offsets 477 gallons of gas per year. A hybrid electric \nvehicle saves 94 gallons. That means that flex-fuel vehicles run on \nhigh blends of renewable fuels are by far our best near-term \nopportunity for energy independence. Obviously, the best is to combine \nthese vehicles.\n\n  Renewable fuels also have tremendous potential to revitalize our \nrural economy. Ethanol has been nothing short of a revolution in our \nState. We have 16 ethanol plants up and running and 5 more under \nconstruction. By 2008, Minnesota will be producing 1 billion gallons of \nethanol each year, and that will generate $5 billion for the State's \neconomy and support 18,000 jobs.\n  Last year, my daughter did a report for her sixth grade class on \nethanol, and she interviewed a number of farmers throughout Minnesota. \nShe drew a big picture with the State of Minnesota on it. She had two \nlittle dots designating Minneapolis and St. Paul. Then she had this \nhuge circle that said Pine City, home of farmer Tom Peterson.\n  Well, that is the future for rural America. That is what is \nrevitalizing so many of our towns. Of course, we started with corn-\nbased ethanol and soybean-based biodiesel. But now we are moving to a \nnew level with cellulosic ethanol which can involve all kinds of \nthings. We are focusing on switchgrass and prairie grass and doing this \nin a way that is good for our environment and carbon neutral and \ncreates habitat for wildlife, something our hunters in Minnesota are \nvery interested in. I know the Presiding Officer's brother who lives in \nMinnesota is especially interested as a hunter in having that habitat \nthat we need.\n  In spite of the clear advantages of renewable fuels to our economy \nand our energy security, we face a chicken-and-egg-type problem when it \ncomes to the challenge of making them available to more drivers. The \nautomakers haven't traditionally wanted to sell flex-fuel vehicles in \nareas where there are no E85 pumps, and the gas stations don't want to \nput in E85 pumps when there are no flex-fuel vehicles. That is why I am \nso pleased the amendments that came out of the Commerce Committee, on \nwhich I serve, included not only the increase in gas mileage standard \nbut also a requirement that by 2015, 80 percent of the vehicles \nproduced be flex fuel.\n  In order to ensure that the drivers who purchase the flexible-fuel \nvehicles know they can use E85, our language requires automakers to put \nthat information on the fuel tank cap and to put a flex-fuel emblem on \nthe back of the vehicle that drivers will be able to recognize.\n  On the other end of this problem--the ability for consumers to fill \nup their cars with ethanol and biodiesel--it is crucial that Congress \nact to provide more American drivers with access to renewable fuel \npumps.\n  Right now, Minnesota ranks first in the country for E85 pumps. We \nhave more than 300--I think the last number I heard was 314--of the \n1,200 pumps nationally, far more than any other State. That is great \nfor Minnesota, and it shows the vision of our State government in \nMinnesota, but it limits the positive impact that renewable fuels can \nand should have on the entire Nation's security. If we are serious \nabout finding alternatives to foreign oil, we should ensure that \ndrivers in every State have access to E85 and biodiesel.\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\n  That is why I wish to speak to two amendments to the Energy bill \naimed at making renewable fuels available across the country. Senator \nBond and I have introduced an amendment that would provide grants to \npromote the installation of E85 biodiesel pumps at gas stations \nnationwide. I would also like to thank Senator Voinovich, Senator \nHagel, and Senator Kerry for their support of this amendment.\n  In past years, Congress has only provided a small amount of money \neach year for E85 infrastructure, and last year, even that small amount \nof funding was cut. As a Nation, we are stuck in a rut. Less than 1 \npercent of the gas stations sell E85. It is time for the country to \nmake a serious investment in renewable fuels. That is going to mean, as \nI said, more flex-fuel vehicles. It is also going to mean investment in \ncellulosic ethanol, acknowledging we are not going to have all this \nethanol based on corn and we are not going to have just soybean-based \nbiodiesel; that there are all kinds of possibilities, as we move \nforward, for how we are going to get our ethanol. We need to be \ncreative about that and we need to put the investments in place and put \nthe standards in place.\n  But what we need, if we are going to do this, is the pumps on the \nground. That is why Senator Bond and I have an amendment to give grants \nfor ethanol and biodiesel pumps. It would be enough for 1,000 to 2,000 \nnew pumps, which would nearly double or triple what we have now.\n  I am also introducing an amendment that would block oil company \ntactics to keep renewable fuels out of gas stations. I have heard from \ngas stations in Minnesota that their franchise contracts make it \ndifficult to sell ethanol and biodiesel, so many of them can't even do \nit. Here are some examples. Remember, these are just dealing with \ngas stations in which they have franchise contracts involving the oil \ncompanies: They are not allowed to sell renewable fuels under the main \ncanopy that bears the oil company name. They are not allowed to convert \nthe pumps they already have to sell E85 or B20. They can't put up signs \nto let customers know they have renewable fuel or how much it costs.\n\n  That is why I call it the ``Right to Retail Renewable Fuel.'' Look \nwhat we have on the other side. We have these oil companies. Last year, \nExxon made $29 billion in profit--a record--and the big five oil \ncompanies made $120 billion. Now they are blaming ethanol, the small \namount--these 1,200 pumps across the country at 170 gas stations--they \nare blaming that for the reason they can't do anything about their \nrefineries. It is outrageous.\n  We need to encourage competition. That is what I am trying to do with \nthe right to retail renewable fuel amendment. This amendment would \nprohibit oil companies from placing restrictions on where and how \nrenewable fuels can be sold to gas stations. This will ensure that \nfranchise owners across the country have the ability to make ethanol \nand biodiesel available to their customers.\n  In conclusion, I believe that ethanol and biodiesel have tremendous \npotential to meet the energy needs of our country. Again, I think of \nthe ethanol industry akin to the beginning of the computer industry \nwhen we had the big computers in the room. That is where we are. It is \ngoing to become more efficient, it is going to become better for the \nenvironment, and it is going to become less costly as we move forward. \nThat is why we are moving into things such as cellulosic ethanol that \ncan be grown on marginal farmland that is carbon neutral and that takes \nless energy to produce.\n  I believe these alternative fuels will move us toward energy \nindependence in the immediate term--not decades from now. I believe we \nought to use the Energy bill before us as an opportunity to invest in \nrenewable fuels and to make them available to every American driver. I \nbelieve we should be investing in the farmers and the workers of middle \nAmerica and not the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, as we resume consideration of the \nEnergy bill, I would note to my colleagues that we have about 120 \namendments filed, and we have 10 amendments pending. Additionally, I \nunderstand we have a number of Members who wish to offer other \namendments. I encourage people to come forward and file amendments if \nthey wish to do so.\n  I understand the Finance Committee is working on a major energy \npackage over the next couple of days. I have some concerns about what \nis rumored to be in that package, but I will reserve my comments and \njudgment until the Senate sees the full product. Additionally, we have \na number of large items that I am sure Senator Bingaman concurs that we \nhave to resolve over the next few days, including the Bingaman RPS \namendment, a potential CAFE amendment to the fuel economy language \ncurrently in the base text, as well as the debate on the issue of coal-\nto-liquids, which received a great deal of attention and debate in the \nEnergy Committee and I am sure will receive the same here.\n  This bill does some great things in the area of biofuels, and it is \nimportant to the Senate that we take action on improving the fuel \nefficiency of our vehicles. This is a win for the diversification of \nfuels we use, and it is a win for saving energy, but we must act to \nincrease our domestic energy supply at the same time, especially if we \ncan and especially if we have energy. That is one of the reasons I \nworked so hard to pass the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, and that \nis one reason I support the Bunning amendment which I have introduced \nwhich will be before the Senate on coal-to-liquids. While Senator \nBunning could not be here this afternoon, we all know of his advocacy \non this issue. It is important that the topic of coal-to-liquids be \naddressed before the Senate. I understand that, provided there is \ntime--and I think there certainly should be--Senator Bunning will speak \non this amendment tomorrow, as I indicated, if at all possible.\n\n  We have developed this legislation. This is not the first time the \nissue of coal-to-liquids has come up. On May 2, we considered an \namendment in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to provide \nidentical treatment of coal-to-liquids as that provided for cellulosic \nethanol. Senator Thomas, from Wyoming, and Senator Bunning offered an \namendment to mandate 21 billion gallons of coal-to-liquids by the year \n2022. I supported them. But the amendment failed by the slimmest of \nmargins--a 12-to-11 vote in the committee. Since that markup, for over \na month there has been an effort to reach out and negotiate a middle \nground on the issue of coal-to-liquids. I regret that those discussions \nended without agreement.\n  Let me be clear: I do not support the Tester amendment that may come \nup before the Senate shortly. I oppose the amendment for a number of \nreasons we will discuss when these proposals are more fully debated.\n  The Bunning-Domenici amendment draws wide support from those in the \nfield who will be doing the work necessary to bring those domestic \nfuels to market. This Bunning-Domenici amendment will establish and \nmandate for just 6 billion gallons of coal-to-liquid fuel by 2022, a \nvery large difference in terms of the mandated amount, much smaller--22 \nbefore and 6 now in the amendment before us. That is a reduction of 15 \nbillion gallons from what we offered in the committee.\n  This mandate starts in 2016, which is the same year the cellulosic \nenergy mandate begins in the base bill. Importantly, this mandate \nrequires that greenhouse gas emissions from coal-to-liquid fuels be 20 \npercent better than gasoline--20 percent better than gasoline. Again, \nthat is the same standard as appears in the base bill for cellulosic \nethanol. In other words, you can't make the claim that this 6 billion \nwhich will be there, this 6 billion gallons, will harm the atmosphere \nor greenhouse gases any more than cellulosic ethanol, which we are all \nadvocating, and there is so much pressure to get it done and so much \nalmost awe that it is going to get done and how great it will be. It \nwill have the same effect as this is going to have on the air.\n  There are many ways to provide the incentives for these alternative \nfuels. One that has been proven to work is to provide a reliable market \nfor the products. We have experience with this approach on ethanol, and \nI have not been presented with a reason to believe it will not work for \nother fuels.\n  In terms of the merits of coal-to-liquid fuels, there are many. \nUnlike cellulosic ethanol, this has been commercially demonstrated in \nother countries; now we need to do it here in the United States. Unlike \ncellulosic ethanol, it can be moved in existing pipes and used in \nexisting vehicles. Coal-to-liquid fuel will reduce the emissions of \nsulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and other pollutants \nwhen compared to conventional fuels, and coal-to-liquid fuel will \ncreate an investment in rural communities, good-paying jobs for \nAmericans, and cheaper energy for American consumers.\n  As we move forward with the consideration of coal-to-liquid \namendments, there are some points about this particular one I would \nlike to point out.\n  First, the program is entirely separate and will not compete with the \nbiofuels program.\n  Second, the mandate is only one-sixth the size of the renewable fuel \nmandate.\n  Third, only coal-to-liquid fuel that can meet the same life cycle \ngreenhouse standard as biofuels will be eligible for the program.\n  There will be much we disagree on as we consider the issue more \nfully. Many will say: We cannot do coal-to-liquids unless we require \ncarbon sequestration. We should remember that we do not require carbon \nsequestration for ethanol in this bill. For carbon sequestration, I am \nconcerned about efforts to require it and, after all, we have concluded \nin the base text of the bill before us that carbon sequestration \nrequires more research and development. That is true.\n  I will agree that requiring the same greenhouse gas standards for all \nfuels is a reasonable approach. That is why we have included the same \nlanguage in our amendment.\n  The amendment is quite different from the one that was received in \nthe Energy Committee on May 2. It has been written to address the \nconcerns that arose then and have arisen since. This amendment \nrepresents an effort to ensure that we provide a stable market for the \nfirst coal-to-liquids plants, and if that happens, there is no question \nthat coal, one of Americas most abundant fuels, will be on its way to \nbeing a first-rate source of fuel for the automobile and related kinds \nof activities.\n  There is broad and growing support for reducing our reliance on \nforeign sources of energy in affordable and environmentally sound ways. \nCoal is our most abundant and affordable fossil resource. I do believe \nthat technology will continue to make coal cleaner and that this \namendment further establishes the path forward.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Martinez be \nadded as a cosponsor of the Bunning amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment Senator Domenici just called up be set aside at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1614 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a program to provide loans for projects to \n  produce syngas from coal and other feedstocks while simultaneously \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions and reliance of the United States on \n                       petroleum and natural gas)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I call up amendment 1614 on behalf of \nSenator Tester, Senator Byrd, Senator Salazar, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Webb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Tester, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Ms. \n     Landrieu and Mr. Webb, proposes an amendment numbered 1614 to \n     amendment numbered 1502.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, June 15, 2007, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I am not going to speak about the \namendment at this point or about the Bunning amendment Senator Domenici \ndescribed in general terms. But this is a very important issue. It is \none we spent time on in our Energy Committee markup. It is one we \nclearly need to resolve here on the Senate floor and allow Senators to \nexpress their views on the issue.\n  I know Senator Tester was hoping to be here to speak on the amendment \npossibly later today but, if not, then tomorrow. I know he will want to \nspeak both about his amendment and about the Bunning amendment, and I \nwill plan to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I had hoped to call up an amendment that \nSenator Clinton filed this afternoon on behalf of herself, myself, \nSenator Leahy, and Senator Cantwell, but I understand that laying aside \nthe pending amendment may not be an option. As such, I ask unanimous \nconsent to be recognized to speak about the amendment we filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as we continue to work our way through \nthe Energy bill, I ask my colleagues for their support in doing \neverything we possibly can to remove the ridiculous barriers people \nface when they try to install renewable electricity generation on their \nhomes and businesses. As we all know, there are disagreements about \nsome aspects of our energy policy, but it only seems to make sense to \nme that we should all rally around giving individuals an opportunity to \nmake a meaningful contribution toward solving our energy challenges. \nThis is exactly what the Clinton-Sanders net metering amendment does. \nIt empowers citizens of our country to help provide for the energy our \ncountry needs.\n  Unfortunately, today, many millions of people want the opportunity to \ndo their part, but they are blocked by unneeded barriers. The language \nwe have authored, which is supported by a wide range of groups, \nincluding the Solar Energy Industries Association, Alaska Wilderness \nLeague, U.S. PIRG, Greenpeace, Public Citizen, Friends of the Earth, \nUnion of Concerned Scientists, the League of Conservation Voters, and \nthe Center for American Progress Action Fund, would amend the Public \nUtility Regulatory Policies Act to require utilities to offer net \nmetering to their customers and to require the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to establish interconnection standards for small \nelectricity generators to connect to the grid.\n  The amendment would accomplish many of our shared goals all at once. \nIt would help people to lower their electric bills, it would help to \nstabilize the electricity grid by ensuring less reliance on central \ngenerating plants, it would help to address environmental concerns, and \nit would even be good for the utilities by cutting down on their load \nduring hot summer days--a load that is usually met with increasingly \nexpensive natural gas.\n  I want to quickly talk about what net metering is before I go any \nfurther, and for the sake of my colleagues who would prefer to hear it \ndirectly from the Department of Energy's mouth as opposed to mine, I \nwill quote directly from the DOE's Web site:\n\n       Net metering programs serve as an important incentive in \n     consumer investment in renewable energy generation. Net \n     metering enables customers to use their own generation to \n     offset their consumption over a billing period by allowing \n     their electric meters to turn backwards when they generate \n     electricity in excess of their demand.\n\n  That is, again, from the DOE's Web site. The Department of Energy \ngoes on to note:\n\n       Net metering is a low-cost, easily administered method of \n     encouraging customer investment in renewable energy \n     technologies. It increases the value of the electricity \n     produced by renewable generation and allows customers to bank \n     their energy and use it in a different time than it is \n     produced, giving customers more flexibility and allowing them \n     to maximize the value of their production. Providers, i.e. \n     utilities, may also benefit from net metering because when \n     customers are producing electricity during peak periods, the \n     system load factor is improved.\n\n  Again, that is a quote from the Department of Energy. To summarize \nnet metering, let me make the following points: Net metering allows an \nelectricity customer to send electricity back to the grid when \ngenerating more than she or he is utilizing. So if you are producing \nmore than you need, it goes back into the grid.\n  Net metering promotes wider use of renewables, especially at the \nresidential level because credit is given for energy produced. In other \nwords, every homeowner in America can become a producer and earn credit \nfor what they produce.\n  Net metering advances energy security by helping to stabilize the \ngrid.\n  Net metering empowers Americans to help meet the Nation's energy \nneeds.\n  Perhaps an example would make it clearer. Imagine a sunny day and a \nhomeowner's solar photovoltaic panels on the roof are generating more \nelectricity than the homeowner needs to power all of her appliances. \nWhere does the excess electricity go? It flows back through the \nelectric meter, spinning it backwards, and out to the wires on the \nstreet and down the street to other homes where it is needed to help \nrun the neighbors' air conditioners and other appliances. This provides \nmore power to the grid just when the grid needs it--on sunny days.\n  The Clinton-Sanders amendment would provide for a very conservative \nFederal minimum standard for net metering to encourage more electricity \ngeneration from renewables, such as solar panels and other distributed \ngeneration technologies. More specifically, the amendment specifies, \namong other things, that customers shall be credited for excess \nelectricity generation from solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, anaerobic \ndigesters, landfill gas, and fuel cells, up to 2 megawatts. Net \nmetering must be offered to customers until the distributed generation \ncapacity is at least 4 percent of a utility's peak load, and States may \nadopt more aggressive net metering provisions.\n  As my colleagues know, many States have moved forward on net \nmetering, and as I have mentioned, our amendment would in no way hamper \na State's ability to move forward even more aggressively. Today, 41 \nStates have some sort of net metering standards or programs, but a \nmodest national net metering standard would create a level playing \nfield, encourage greater competition, and accelerate the deployment of \nsolar and other distributed generation technologies.\n  Vermont passed a net metering law in 1998, and as of July 2006, over \n200 Vermont solar projects, wind projects, and methane digesters were \nfeeding electricity into the grid. New Mexico has an aggressive net \nmetering standard in place, as does Colorado, New Jersey, and \nCalifornia.\n  In closing, as we work to wrap things up this week, I hope we can \nsend a clear message that every single household and business across \nthis country should be given the opportunity to be part of solving our \nenergy challenges. Adoption of the Clinton-Sanders net metering \namendment will send such a signal.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Clinton amendment be set aside, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, June 19, when \nthe Senate resumes H.R. 6 following morning business, there be up to \n2\\1/2\\ hours of debate prior to a vote in relation to Bunning amendment \nNo. 1628 and Tester amendment No. 1614, to run concurrently, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled between Senators Bunning and Tester \nor their designees; that the Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for \nthe respective party conferences; that upon reconvening at 2:15\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\np.m., the Senate resume debate on the above-mentioned amendments; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to Bunning amendment No. 1628; that upon disposition of that \namendment, there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to \nTester amendment No. 1614, with no amendment in order to either of the \nabove amendments prior to the vote; that upon disposition of the Tester \namendment, the Senate then debate consecutively the following \namendments listed below and that the debate time on each be limited to \n30 minutes equally divided and controlled in the usual form with no \namendment in order to any of the amendments enumerated below; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of all time with respect to the amendments \nlisted below, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendments \nin the order listed; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nand controlled prior to each vote; and that after the first vote in \nthis sequence, the remaining votes be 10 minutes in duration: The \nlisted amendments are Kohl amendment No. 1519, Thune amendment No. \n1609, and Cardin amendment No. 1610.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, more than 30 months ago, prior to his \nconfirmation as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \nMichael Chertoff told me in my office that if confirmed he would move \nexpeditiously to implement the National Emergency Technology Guard--NET \nGuard--Program. Unfortunately, Secretary Chertoff has failed to honor \nthis pledge.\n  The idea of NET Guard was born in the aftermath of 9/11, when a \nnumber of communications and technology companies told me they wanted \nto help New York City when it was attacked--and there was no system for \nusing their volunteers. Then-Senator George Allen and I moved on a \nbipartisan basis to support a program, called NET Guard, that would \nensure that volunteers with technology expertise could be fully \nutilized in future crises. These teams of local volunteers with science \nand technology expertise would be vital in assisting our communities in \nresponding to attacks on communications networks or recovering from \nnatural disasters. Congress authorized the establishment of NET Guard 5 \nyears ago, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\n  However, DHS has utterly failed to make any visible progress in \nimplementing this critical program. DHS's failure to act in this \ncritical area is inexcusable.\n  Had the Department followed through and created NET Guard, I believe \nit could have played a significant role in alleviating the chaos, \nconfusion, and suffering after Hurricane Katrina. Had NET Guard been \nproperly implemented, there would have been teams of volunteers with \nexpertise ready to mobilize instantly to tackle technical challenges in \nthe wake of the storm. Indeed, on an ad hoc basis, companies and \nindividuals with technology expertise did come forward to assist the \nsuffering. I can only imagine how effective these efforts might have \nbeen had NET Guard been in place.\n  Since my meeting with Secretary Chertoff in 2005, my staff and I have \nbeen given one excuse after another for delaying implementation of NET \nGuard. I have been promised briefings that never happen and reports \nthat never materialize. At the outset, I was willing to accept some \ndelay, but that time has passed.\n  We know that it is only a matter of time before there is another \ncrisis that will put American communities and their critical \ncommunication networks at risk. Further delay is unacceptable.\n  Out of options, I reluctantly feel that I must put a hold on the \nnomination of Dennis Schrader who has been nominated by President Bush \nto serve as Deputy Administrator for National Preparedness, until the \nNET Guard Program is up and running nationwide.\n  It gives me no pleasure to place this hold and I do so grudgingly.\n  I recognize the importance of the position of Deputy Administrator \nfor National Preparedness, but the position didn't even exist for the \nfirst 4 years after the Department of Homeland Security was created; it \nwas just created in March. Since then, Mr. Corey Grouber has served as \nActing Deputy Administrator, so delaying Mr. Schrader's confirmation \nwhile the long-overdue Net Guard Program is put in place will not leave \nthe office leaderless. Mr. Corey Grouber has extensive experinace at \nFEMA, so he can manage for a little longer while the NET Guard Program \nis established. Unfortunately, I see no evidence that the Secretary \nintends to uphold his pledge to me, and until he does, I will keep my \nhold on Mr. Schrader's nomination.\n  I hope DHS will quickly begin to take action so I can remove this \nhold and Mr. Schrader's nomination can move through the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/18/senate-section/article/S7807-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7807-S7808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DRIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment \nNo. 1572, the DRIVE Electric amendment. Senator Salazar is the sponsor. \nSenators Bayh, Brownback, Coleman, Klobuchar, Smith, Clinton, \nAlexander, Biden, and I are cosponsors.\n  I know I speak for my fellow DRIVE Act cosponsors when I thank the \nmembers of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, led by \nChairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Domenici, for reporting versions \nof DRIVE Act provisions out of that committee in May. And I know my \nfellow DRIVE Act cosponsors are as gratified as I am that Chairman \nBingaman and 62 other Senators voted Tuesday to adopt the DRIVE Act's \noriginal oil savings requirement as part of this Energy bill.\n  During the debate preceding Tuesday's vote, Senator Domenici said \nthat Congress should not abdicate its responsibility to spell out the \npolicies that the Federal Government will use to achieve the oil \nsavings targets that now are part of this Energy bill. I could not \nagree more. That is why my DRIVE Act cosponsors are back here today to \nboost the Energy bill's transportation electrification provisions up to \ntheir original DRIVE Act strength.\n  Once restored to its original strength, the DRIVE Act's \nelectrification program will give the Federal Government a vital tool \nthat will take this Nation a considerable distance toward the oil \nsavings targets that the Senate adopted on Tuesday.\n  Currently, our transportation sector runs on oil. That is the problem \nthe Senate is trying to solve with this Energy bill. We are passing a \nlaw in order to move our transportation sector off of oil, in part by \nmoving it onto alternative fuels. In expanding the use of various \nalternative fuels, we should not overlook our own existing electrical \ngrid.\n  Most electricity generation in this country is fueled by domestically \nmined coal. A substantial amount of electricity generation in this \ncountry is fueled by uranium mined in the United States or Canada. \nWhile only a small amount of electricity is generated in the U.S. using \nrenewable sources such as solar and geothermal energy, we know we can \nincrease that amount substantially. Only 2 percent of the electricity \ngenerated in this country is generated using oil.\n  So the more that we use electricity to power our cars, trucks, \ntrains, and ships, the more we will be using domestic energy sources, \nand the less dependent we will be on oil. Fortunately, the technology \nis now available to allow us to plug in our cars at night, when \nexisting powerplants are underused and electricity is especially cheap, \nso that during the day, the cars run largely on battery power. And the \ntechnology is now available to allow trucks to plug in at truck stops--\nand ships to plug in at ports--so that they don't use oil to run their \non-board systems when they're stationary.\n  The founder of a U.S. company called A123 testified before my global \nwarming subcommittee in May about durable, safe, light-weight, high-\ncapacity batteries his company has developed for vehicle use. He is \nusing that technology to convert hybrid vehicles into\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\nplug-in hybrids today. He drives such a car every day. It gets 150 \nmiles to the gallon. The electricity that it takes to drive the vehicle \n40 miles costs about one-tenth as much as it costs to drive the same \ndistance on gasoline. I understand that General Motors believes it can \nstart selling such plug-in hybrid vehicles to American consumers within \nthe next 2 years.\n  At the same hearing in May, the head of global research at General \nElectric testified that the company had already developed a hybrid \nelectric locomotive.\n  Even if you count the pollution from the powerplants--including coal-\nfired powerplants--used to charge a plug-in hybrid or fully electric \nvehicle, or to run an idling truck or ship, powering these vehicles \nwith electricity releases far, far less pollution into the environment \nthan powering them with oil does.\n  The underlying bill contains some language to help accelerate the \ndeployment of these electrification technologies in the transportation \nsector. The DRIVE Electric amendment would strengthen those provisions \nsubstantially. There is broad, bipartisan support here in the Senate \nfor strengthening them. There is no reason not to strengthen them.\n  Here is what the DRIVE Electric amendment would do: The DRIVE \nElectric amendment would expand the Advanced Transportation Technology \nProgram in section 245 of H.R. 6 and augment the Energy Storage \nCompetitiveness Program in section 244 of H.R. 6.\n  More specifically, the DRIVE Electric amendment would expand the \nnear-term vehicle technology deployment program in the underlying bill \nby adding a revolving loan program. This will maximize the \neffectiveness of the program in stimulating the installation of \ntechnologies to reduce petroleum use and cut emissions. In addition, \nthe amendment sets forth types of projects--including port, truck stop \nand airport electrification--that will qualify for the program.\n  The amendment includes a program to remove barriers for existing and \nnew applications of electric drive and hybrid transportation \ntechnologies. It would establish an electricity usage program to \nincrease the understanding of and management of the electricity grid as \na source of power for the transportation sector.\n  The amendment would also direct the Energy Department and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to develop information on the grid-side \nof electric drive technology. It would authorize grants for electric \nutilities to promote customer programs for load management and off-peak \nuse.\n  While the underlying bill would allow for basic and applied energy \nstorage research, the DRIVE Electric amendment would establish an \nelectric drive transportation research and development program. That \nprogram would address additional research needs, including: high \nefficiency on-board and off-board charging components; high power and \nenergy-efficient drive-train systems for passenger and commercial \nvehicles and for nonroad vehicles; control system development and \npower-train development and integration; application of nano-materials \ntechnology, and use of smart vehicle and grid interconnection devices \nand software.\n  The amendment also would direct the Energy Department to evaluate the \nbenefits of plug-in electric drive technology, by creating testing \nprograms to assess the full potential of benefits in terms of reducing \ncriteria air pollutant emissions, energy use, and petroleum \nconsumption.\n  The amendment also would establish a nationwide education program for \nelectric drive transportation technology, including financial \nassistance to create new university-level degree programs for needed \nengineers, supporting student plug-in hybrid electric vehicle \ncompetitions, and other educational efforts.\n  Finally, the amendment would update the fleet acquisition program \nestablished under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to assure that fleet \noperators subject to that law can choose electric drive transportation \ntechnologies, including hybrid electric vehicles, for compliance.\n  I believe this amendment is exactly the kind of commonsense, win-win, \nbipartisan measure that the American people like to see coming out of \nCongress. I respectfully ask that my colleagues support the DRIVE \nElectric amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/18/senate-section/article/S7808-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IN MEMORIAM: DR.

A bill to ensure that vessels of the United States conveyed \nto eligible recipients for educational, cultural, historical, \ncharitable, recreational, or other public purposes are maintained and \nutilized for the purposes for which they were conveyed; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Vessel \nConveyance Act, a bill which would prevent inappropriate transfers of \nsurplus United States vessels to nongovernmental organizations.\n  It has recently come to my attention that two decommissioned U.S. \nCoast Guard ships that had been conveyed in legislation to a certain \ncharitable organization are no longer being used for the purpose \nexplicitly stated by law. In fact, the ships are no longer in the \norganization's possession. Unaware of the costs affiliated with \nmaintenance of the ships, the recipient found itself unable to afford \nthe upkeep. Against the spirit, if not the letter, of the law, the \ncharity sold first one, and then the second ship, and pocketed the \nproceeds, which totaled $415,000.\n  Though the U.S. General Services Administration has a process in \nplace for disposal of surplus vessels, I understand the value of \ndedicated vessel conveyances under certain circumstances. But we must \nrecognize that these assets are the property of the American people, \nand they represent a significant investment of public funds. When \nCongress acts to convey such valuable items to a private entity, it \nalso conveys the responsibility to use the vessel for a specific \npurpose. In cases where that responsibility has not been carried out, \nwe must be able to seek recourse, and this bill would provide that \ntool.\n  Specifically, this legislation would expressly prohibit the recipient \nof a conveyed vessel from either selling it, or using it for commercial \npurposes. It would require the Administrator of the GSA to monitor \nconveyed vessels the same way he monitors ships dispersed under the \nstandard GSA process to ensure that they are being used appropriately, \nand it gives her the power to reclaim the ship if she determines that \nthose conditions have been violated. The bill would also eliminate the \npossibility of transfer to an organization lacking sufficient financial \nstability to maintain a given vessel. Finally, it includes civil \nenforcement provisions making recipients liable for fines of up to \n$10,000 per day that they are in violation of their conveyance \nagreement.\n  On the rare occasions when Congress determines that a certain asset \nis uniquely suited to assist a worthy and capable organization, I do \nnot oppose a legislative conveyance. But I will not allow any \norganization to fleece the American taxpayers by biting the hand\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nthat has provided such a generous gift. I am pleased to introduce this \nbill today, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vessel Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE OF UNITED STATES VESSELS FOR PUBLIC \n                   PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The conveyance of a United States \n     Government vessel to an eligible entity for use as an \n     educational, cultural, historical, charitable, or \n     recreational or other public purpose shall be made subject to \n     any conditions, including the reservation of such rights on \n     behalf of the United States, as the Secretary considers \n     necessary to ensure that the vessel will be maintained and \n     used in accordance with the purposes for which it was \n     conveyed, including conditions necessary to ensure that \n     unless approved by the Secretary--\n       (1) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed may \n     not sell, convey, assign, exchange, or encumber the vessel, \n     any part thereof, or any associated historic artifact \n     conveyed to the eligible entity in conjunction with the \n     vessel; and\n       (2) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed may \n     not conduct any commercial activities at the vessel, any part \n     thereof, or in connection with any associated historic \n     artifact conveyed to the eligible entity in conjunction with \n     the vessel, in any manner.\n       (b) Reversion.--In addition to any term or condition \n     established pursuant to this section, the conveyance of a \n     United States Government vessel shall include a condition \n     that the vessel, or any associated historic artifact conveyed \n     to the eligible entity in conjunction with the vessel, at the \n     option of the Secretary, shall revert to the United States \n     and be placed under the administrative control of the \n     Administrator if, without approval of the Secretary--\n       (1) the vessel, any part thereof, or any associated \n     historic artifact ceases to be available for the educational, \n     cultural, historical, charitable, or recreational or other \n     public purpose for which it was conveyed under reasonable \n     conditions which shall be set forth in the eligible entity's \n     application;\n       (2) the vessel or any part thereof ceases to be maintained \n     in a manner consistent with the commitments made by the \n     eligible entity to which it was conveyed;\n       (3) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed, \n     sells, conveys, assigns, exchanges, or encumbers the vessel, \n     any part thereof, or any associated historic artifact; or\n       (4) the eligible entity to which the vessel is conveyed, \n     conducts any commercial activities at the vessel, any part \n     thereof, or in conjunction with any associated historic \n     artifact.\n       (c) Agreement Required.--Except as may be otherwise \n     explicitly provided by statute, a United States Government \n     vessel may not be conveyed to an entity unless that entity \n     agrees to comply with any terms or conditions imposed on the \n     conveyance under this section.\n       (d) Records and Monitoring.--\n       (1) Compilation and transfer.--The Secretary shall provide \n     a written or electronic record for each vessel conveyed \n     pursuant to the Secretary's authority, including the vessel \n     registration, the application for conveyance, the terms and \n     conditions of conveyance, and any other documents associated \n     with the conveyance, and any post-conveyance correspondence \n     or other documentation, to the Administrator.\n       (2) Monitoring.--For a period not less than 5 years after \n     the date of conveyance the Administrator shall monitor the \n     eligible entity's use of the vessel conveyed to ensure that \n     the vessel is being used in accordance with the purpose for \n     which it was conveyed. The Administrator shall create a \n     written or electronic record of such monitoring activities \n     and their findings.\n       (3) Maintenance.--The Administrator shall maintain vessel \n     conveyance records provided under paragraph (1), and \n     monitoring records created under paragraph (2), on each \n     vessel conveyed until such time as the vessel is destroyed, \n     scuttled, recycled, or otherwise disposed of. The \n     Administrator may make the records available to the public.\n       (e) Cost Estimates.--The Secretary may provide an estimate \n     to an eligible entity of the cost of maintaining and \n     operating any vessel to be conveyed to that entity.\n       (f) Guidance.--The Secretary may issue guidance concerning \n     the types and extent of commercial activities, including the \n     sale of goods or services incidental to, and consistent with, \n     the purposes for which a vessel was conveyed, that are \n     approved by the Secretary for purposes of subsections (a)(2) \n     and (b)(4) of this section.\n\n     SEC. 3. WORKING GROUP ON CONVEYANCE OF UNITED STATES VESSELS.\n\n       Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of Transportation shall convene a working \n     group, composed of representatives from the Maritime \n     Administration, the Coast Guard, and the United States Navy \n     to review and to make recommendations on a common set of \n     conditions for the conveyance of vessels of the United States \n     to eligible entities (as defined in section 2(d)(2)). The \n     Secretary may request the participation of senior \n     representatives of any other Federal department or agency, as \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 4. CIVIL ENFORCEMENT OF CONVEYANCE CONDITIONS.\n\n       (a) Civil Administrative Penalties.--\n       (1) Any eligible entity found by the Secretary, after \n     notice and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with \n     section 554 of title 5, United States Code, to have failed to \n     comply with the terms and conditions under which a vessel was \n     conveyed to it shall be liable to the United States for a \n     civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty under this \n     paragraph shall not exceed $10,000 for each violation. Each \n     day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate \n     violation.\n       (2) Compromise or other action by the secretary.--The \n     Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without \n     conditions, any civil administrative penalty imposed under \n     this section that has not been referred to the Attorney \n     General for further enforcement action.\n       (b) Hearing.--For the purposes of conducting any \n     investigation or hearing under this section, the Secretary \n     may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of \n     witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and \n     documents, and may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall \n     be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses \n     in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt or \n     refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant to \n     this subsection, the district court of the United States for \n     any district in which such person is found, resides, or \n     transacts business, upon application by the United States and \n     after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue \n     an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony \n     before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents \n     before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such \n     order of the court may be punished by such court as a \n     contempt thereof. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n     grant jurisdiction to a district court to entertain an \n     application for an order to enforce a subpoena issued by the \n     Secretary of Commerce to the Federal Government or any entity \n     thereof.\n       (c) Jurisdiction.--The United States district courts shall \n     have original jurisdiction of any action under this section \n     arising out of or in connection with the operation, \n     maintenance, or disposition of a conveyed vessel, and \n     proceedings with respect to any such action may be instituted \n     in the judicial district in which any defendant resides or \n     may be found. For the purpose of this section, American Samoa \n     shall be included within the judicial district of the \n     District Court of the United States for the District of \n     Hawaii.\n       (d) Collection.--If an eligible entity fails to pay an \n     assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and \n     unappealable order, or after the appropriate court has \n     entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the matter \n     may be referred to the Attorney General, who may recover the \n     amount (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the \n     date of the final order). In such action the validity, \n     amount, and appropriateness of the final order imposing the \n     civil penalty shall not be subject to review. Any eligible \n     entity that fails to pay, on a timely basis, the amount of an \n     assessment of a civil penalty shall be required to pay, in \n     addition to such amount and interest, attorney's fees and \n     costs for collection proceedings and a quarterly nonpayment \n     penalty for each quarter during which such failure to pay \n     persists. Such nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal \n     to 20 percent of the aggregate amount of such the entity's \n     penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the \n     beginning of such quarter.\n       (e) Nationwide Service of Process.--In any action by the \n     United States under this Act, process may be served in any \n     district where the defendant is found, resides, transacts \n     business or has appointed an agent for the service of \n     process, and for civil cases may also be served in a place \n     not within the United States in accordance with Rule 4 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this year, while the Senate was \nresuming its business in a new Congress, two dozen families on the \nother side of the world were fleeing their homes. Ninety-four men and \nwomen, some young some old, grabbed whatever belongings they could \ncarry and headed north along the eastern Burmese border to escape the \ntorment of a brutal regime.\n  Human rights officials tell us what happened next. Late last month, \nthese families were forced to move again. And as I stand here today, \nthey are cramped inside the homes of other refugees. We are looking \nforward to summer vacations. They are looking ahead at the bitter work \nof building new homes in the rain, with their hands, in a remote corner \nof a stark, isolated wasteland the world seems to have forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I am here to report that the United States has not \nforgotten. We will continue to shine a light on the oppressive and \nillegitimate military regime that drove these families from their \nhomes. And I will rise every year, as I do today, with my good friend \nthe senior Senator from California, to reintroduce a bill that extends \nfor another year a ban on imports from Burma.\n  Republicans and Democrats work together proudly on some things in the \nSenate. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act is one of them. I am \npleased to say that even though the control of Congress has changed, \nits commitment to the people of Burma has not. Senator Feinstein and I \nare joined this year by 57 cosponsors, more than last year and the year \nbefore that. On the Republican side, for example, the people of Burma \nhave no better friend than the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Support for the people of Burma is growing on Capitol Hill. Senator \nFeinstein and the senior Senator from Texas recently formed the Women's \nCaucus on Burma. The First Lady attended its first meeting last month, \nadding her voice to a growing chorus of those opposed to the Burmese \nregime. The voices are not just coming from Washington. But the words \nand actions of Washington are beginning to cause others to take note of \nthis dire situation.\n  Last year, the United Nations Security Council agreed for the first \ntime to put Burma on its agenda. In January, a U.N. Security Council \nresolution that enjoyed the support of a majority of the Council's \nmember nations was unfortunately blocked by Russian and Chinese vetoes. \nWe remain encouraged by the fact that nine countries agreed to hold the \nregime accountable. We urge Russia and China to reconsider their \nstance.\n  We know others are beginning to notice Burma because 3 years ago the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian nations called the sufferings in Burma \n``an internal matter.'' Yet today ASEAN recognizes that the ``Burma \nproblem'' is its problem, too.\n  Southeast Asian leaders have spoken out more frequently and \nforcefully over the last year in calling for democratic reforms. They \njoin the United States and other freedom-loving people who have \ndemanded for years that the military thugs who control Burma loosen \ntheir grip.\n  We know others are starting taking notice because earlier this year \nthe United Nations Secretary General, Ban ki-Moon, urged the release of \nBurma's roughly 1,300 political prisoners, including the world's only \nimprisoned Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  And we know others are starting to take notice because that effort \nwas followed by a letter signed by 59 former heads of state.\n  The Burmese military regime, the State Peace and Development Council, \nis on notice: the wider international community, including its \nneighbors, are increasingly aware and increasingly outraged by its \nbehavior.\n  Mr. President, The purpose of sanctions is to change behavior. And \nthe changes we seek, in partnership with the Burmese people, are these: \nconcrete, irreversible steps toward reconciliation and democratization \nthat include the full, unfettered participation of the National League \nfor Democracy and ethnic minorities; ending attacks on ethnic \nminorities; and the immediate, unconditional release of all prisoners \nof conscience, including Suu Kyi. The regime also needs to know that a \nsham constitutional process and token prisoner releases will not be \nregarded by anyone as progress toward these goals.\n  The argument against sanctions--that they are most harmful to those \nthey are meant to help--is well known. But it does not apply to Burma. \nIt has long been the policy of the NLD, the winner of Burma's last \ndemocratic election, to seek reform through sanctions against the \ncurrent regime.\n  And for good reason. Burma's military junta has maintained an iron \ngrip on every aspect of the country's economy. Its leaders flaunt and \nsquander whatever wealth they can squeeze from Burmese workers, leaving \nthe country's economy in ruins--but leaving enough aside for its \ncurrent leader, GEN Than Shwe, to impulsively relocate the Burmese \ncapital from Rangoon at a cost of millions, or to throw a wedding for \nhis daughter that is reported to have cost millions more.\n  The military junta has complete control over the flow of goods and \nmoney in and out of Burma. And every dollar that is spent on Burmese \nproducts is money spent on financing the regime. It is the SPDC, not \nthe allies of the Burmese people, who are responsible for Burma's \neconomic woes.\n  As diplomatic pressure intensifies, as the rest of the international \ncommunity undertakes the kind of change we have seen in ASEAN, the \nsupporters of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act are confident this \nregime will be forced to change its ways.\n  The situation is urgent. Burma's military regime has become \nincreasingly reckless. And the humanitarian situation is grave and \ndeteriorating: the junta has intensified its abuse of minority groups \nthrough rape and forced labor. It continues to harass and detain a new \ngeneration of peaceful activists, activists like a young woman named Su \nSu Nway, who has inspired the world with her resolute defiance of \nforced labor practices.\n  In standing up to the Burmese regime, Su Su Nway drew inspiration \nfrom Suu Kyi. Now she is inspiring another generation of Burmese \nactivists who are willing to defend their rights and, despite the \ndanger to themselves, refuse to remain silent in the face of the abuses \nthey see.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, Su Su Nway was asked by a radio \nreporter last year whether she feared imprisonment. Her simple but \neloquent response should give us hope in the determination of this new \ngeneration of activists. ``I will stand for the truth,'' she said.\n  The crimes of the Burmese government are well documented. Here is \nwhat we know: nearly 70,000 children have been taken from their homes \nand forcibly conscripted--that's more children than live in all of \nLexington, the second-largest city in my State.\n  Forced labor is a daily threat in the southeastern Karen State, where \nmilitary personnel force villagers to build roads and shelters, without \nfood or pay, and to leave their homes and farms to do the work. Some \nare used as human shields against democratic insurgents.\n  These are the lucky ones. Others are forced to walk ahead of military \nconvoys to act as human minesweepers. If there is a landmine, they blow \nup. It is from diabolical thugs like these that\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\ndesperate, exhausted families are fleeing their homes.\n  Drugs and disease are spreading across Burma's borders along with its \npeople, and it is no secret why. According to the World Health \nOrganization, Burma is home to one of the worst AIDS epidemics in \nSoutheast Asia. Yet it spent just $137,000 last year on the care and \ntreatment of people with HIV/AIDS, even as it spends countless millions \non Chinese and Russian tanks and jets.\n  You can tell a lot about a man from the company he keeps. We could \nsay the same about governments. In late April, Burma established \ndiplomatic relations with the government of North Korea for the first \ntime in two decades. It was reported last month that a North Korean \ncargo ship docked in Burma. This is a disturbing development to those \nof us on the outside looking in. It can only be discouraging to \ndemocratic reformers inside Burma.\n  News of North Korea's presence on the Burmese coast came shortly \nafter another troubling piece of news. In early April, Burma's second \nin command led a delegation on the nation's first-ever high-level trip \nto Russia. And last month, the Burmese government announced an \nagreement with Russia to build a nuclear research reactor in Burma.\n  This should send a chill up the spine of every one of us. Even \npeaceful nations that lack the proper legal and regulatory framework \nshould not be allowed to have a nuclear program. Those that torture and \nabuse their own people and consort with rogue regimes such as North \nKorea should not be allowed to even contemplate it.\n  And this is how this rogue regime has held onto its power: Internal \nefforts at reform are violently stamped out, as they were when \nthousands of peaceful prodemocracy protesters were slaughtered in 1988. \nIn response to a national election in 1990, in which Suu Kyi's party, \nthe NLD, won 80 percent of the seats in a new parliament, the regime \nsimply threw out the results.\n  By refusing to accept imports from a regime that terrorizes people \nlike Suu Kyi, Su Su Nway, and so many others, we are standing up and \nfacing these tyrants at our own borders and turning them back--until \nthey release these prisoners and begin the process of democratization \nand reconciliation. Every dollar we keep out of the hands of this junta \nis one less dollar it can use to fund the conscription of children, its \nnuclear program, and the war it has waged against its own people for \nnearly two decades.\n  Later this month, Suu Kyi will celebrate her 62nd birthday, alone. I \nurge my colleagues to stand with her as that day approaches. By denying \nsupport for those who imprison her, we will pressure them to change.\n  There are fresh signs that these sanctions have begun to do their \nwork. But we need to keep the pressure on. So I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/18/senate-section/article/S7815-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7815-S7818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 1640. A bill to amend chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code \n(relating to the vessel hull design protection), to clarify the \ndefinitions of a hull and a deck; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a small but \nimportant piece of intellectual property legislation today with my \nfriends from Texas, Wisconsin, and Rhode Island. Our recent \ncollaborations have been fruitful and important. The OPEN Government \nAct with Senator Cornyn, NOPEC with Senator Kohl, and patent reform \nwith Senator Whitehouse. Today, we are joining together to reintroduce \nthe Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments of 2007.\n  Designs of boat vessel hulls are often the result of a great deal of \ntime, effort, and financial investment. They are afforded intellectual \nproperty protection under the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act that \nCongress passed in 1998. This law exists for the same reason that other \nworks enjoy intellectual property rights: to encourage continued \ninnovation, to protect the works that emerge from the creative process, \nand to reward the creators. Recent courtroom experience has made it \nclear that the protections Congress passed 7 years ago need some \nstatutory refinement to ensure they meet the purposes we envisioned. \nThe Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments shore up the law, \nmaking an important clarification about the scope of the protections \navailable to boat designs.\n  We continue to be fascinated with, and in so many ways dependent on, \nbodies of water, both for recreation and commerce. More than 50 percent \nof Americans live on or near the coastline in this country. We seem \nalways to be drawn to the water, whether it is the beautiful Lake \nChamplain in my home State of Vermont or the world's large oceans. As \nanyone who has visited our seaports can attest, much of our commerce \ninvolves sea travel. Protecting boat designs and encouraging innovation \nin those designs are worthy aims, and I hope we can move quickly to \npass this bipartisan legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. VESSEL HULL DESIGN PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Vessel \n     Hull Design Protection Amendments of 2007''.\n       (b) Designs Protected.--Section 1301(a) of title 17, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking paragraph (2) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(2) Vessel features.--The design of a vessel hull, deck, \n     or combination of a hull and deck, including a plug or mold, \n     is subject to protection under this chapter, notwithstanding \n     section 1302(4).''.\n       (c) Definitions.--Section 1301(b) of title 17, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``vessel hull, including \n     a plug or mold,'' and inserting ``vessel hull or deck, \n     including a plug or mold,'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:\n       ``(4) A `hull' is the exterior frame or body of a vessel, \n     exclusive of the deck, superstructure, masts, sails, yards, \n     rigging, hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) A `deck' is the horizontal surface of a vessel that \n     covers the hull, including exterior cabin and cockpit \n     surfaces, and exclusive of masts, sails, yards, rigging, \n     hardware, fixtures, and other attachments.''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today along with the senior Senator \nfrom Vermont to introduce the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act \nAmendments of 2007. This is another significant piece of legislation on \nwhich I proudly have teamed with Senator Leahy, the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Most recently, we have worked together on \nimportant reforms to the Freedom of Information Act, and also \nintroduced comprehensive patent reform legislation. I am glad to \ncontinue our work by introducing this legislation which, though \nseemingly technical and minor, offers very important clarifications \nabout the scope of protections available to boat designers.\n  Boat designs, like any technical designs, are complex and are the \nresult of a great deal of hard work and contribution of intellectual \nproperty. Accordingly, Congress enacted the Vessel Hull Design \nProtection Act in 1998 to provide necessary protections that were not \npresent among copyright statutes prior to that time. The act has been \ninstrumental for the continued development and protection of boat \ndesigns but unfortunately recently has encountered a few hurdles.\n  A recent court decision raised questions about the scope of \nprotections available to various boat designs. Justifiably or not, this \ninterpretation under the VHDPA unfortunately has led many in the boat \nmanufacturing industry to conclude that the act's provisions are not \neffective at protecting vessel designs. Intellectual property \nprotection of those designs is critical to these manufacturers in order \nto encourage innovative design, and a clarification of the law is \nneeded.\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\n  The legislation we offer will clarify that the protections accorded \nto a vessel design can be used to separately protect a vessel's hull \nand/or deck as well as a plug or mold of either the hull or deck. The \nproposed amendments would make clear that it remains possible for boat \ndesigners to seek protection for both the hull and the deck, and plug \nor mold of both, of a single vessel, and many designers no doubt will \ncontinue to do so. However, these amendments are intended to clarify \nthat protection under the VHDPA for these vessel elements may be \nanalyzed separately.\n  This bipartisan legislation provides the necessary assurance to boat \nmanufacturers that the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act will remain a \nvital intellectual property protection statute. The bill offers very \nimportant clarifications about the scope of protections available to \nboat designs and will be welcome news to boat makers across the Nation \nand in Texas. The thousands of miles of coastline in Texas, and all the \nlakes and rivers in between, provide significant opportunities for \nrecreational and commercial boating throughout the state. This \nlegislation will ensure that there will be continued innovation in the \ndesign and manufacture of boats for many years to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1643. A bill to establish the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, one unresolved issue that is of grave \nconcern to many in the west is unresolved Indian water rights claims. \nOver the past century, many parties have sought to determine the extent \nof Indian water rights in the courts. However, litigation to determine \nIndian water rights has failed in many respects for both Indians and \nnon-Indians. Unresolved Indian water rights claims are of particular \nconcern in New Mexico which has 23 Indian tribes.\n  As with all litigation, the outcome is uncertain and one party \ngenerally loses. If the Indian nations were to receive a large award by \nthe courts and those water rights were exercised, the senior priority \ndate of many Indian water rights claims have the potential to displace \nexisting users. This means that non-Indian towns, farmers, and industry \ncould ultimately have their water supply cut off. However, in many \ninstances, even if an Indian nation were to receive a water windfall \nfrom the courts, many of the Indian nations lack the water \ninfrastructure to make use of the water awarded by the courts. \nAdditionally, Indian water rights litigation often takes decades. For \nexample, the Aamodt litigation in New Mexico was filed in 1966 and is \nthe longest standing litigation in the federal judiciary. Finally, the \nnumerous unresolved Indian water rights claims in many western states \nsuch as New Mexico impair our ability to effectively undertake water \nrights planning as we are unsure of the award that the Indian nations \nwill receive.\n  Over the past two decades, many parties have pursued negotiated \nsettlements in lieu of litigation, an approach beneficial to all \nparties involved. In negotiated settlements, multiple parties get \ntogether and determine how best to allocate water among Indians and \nnon-Indians in a way that does not curtail existing uses. Many of the \nsettlements also contain authorization for the Federal Government to \nprovide funding to the Indian nations so that the Indian nations \ninvolved can make use of the water they are awarded under the terms of \nthe settlement, resulting in economic development and health benefits \non the Indian nation.\n  Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne and his staff deserve a \ngreat deal of credit for trying to advance the New Mexico Indian water \nrights settlements. However, current Federal budgets cannot accommodate \nthe upcoming New Mexico settlements. This is troublesome for several \nreasons. First, it impairs Congress's ability to resolve Indian water \nrights claims in a way that keeps all water users whole. Additionally, \nmany of the settlements require the construction of water \ninfrastructure benefiting an Indian nation. Lack of a steady stream of \nFederal money results in water projects that take far longer to \nconstruct, costing taxpayers significantly more money in the long run.\n  Today I introduce the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund Act of 2007. \nThis bill would establish a reliable source of Federal funding to \nresolve Indian water rights claims in New Mexico. The bill provides \nthat, over the next 10 years, 30 percent of the revenues generated in \nNew Mexico that would otherwise be deposited in the reclamation fund \nwould instead be used to fund Indian water rights settlements. The \namounts deposited in this fund could be used to pay for the Aamodt, \nAbeyta, and Navajo Indian water rights settlements after the parties \nresolve outstanding issues and the settlements are signed into law. It \nis important to note that the fund created by this legislation would \nallow us to fund New Mexico Indian water rights settlements without \ncompromising the sustainability of the reclamation fund.\n  The consequences of not settling outstanding Indian water rights \nclaims in New Mexico are dire. The legislation I introduce today would \nremove the main impediment to the resolution of Indian water rights \nsettlement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to require the \nSecretary of Agriculture to make cost-share and incentive payments for \ninnovative fuels management conservation practices, including \nprescribed grazing management on private grazing land and practices \nthat complement commensurate public land, to prevent the occurrence and \nspread of, and damages caused by, wildfires fueled by invasive species; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. REID, Mr. President, today my colleague from Nevada, Senator \nEnsign and I, are introducing The Wildfire Presuppression Fuels \nManagement Act of 2007. This bill establishes a USDA conservation \nprogram that helps to prevent the occurrence, spread of, and damages \ncaused by wildfire to rangeland.\n  Since 1999, approximately 5.8 million acres of Nevada rangeland has \nbeen destroyed by wildfire, 3 million of which burned in 2005 and 2006. \nAccording to the Nevada Department of Wildlife, prior to the 1980's \nburned lands averaged less than 25,000 acres per year. Nevada's current \nacres burned per year have now climbed to 24 times that to 600,000 \nacres burned per year.\n  This legislation would allow private land owners to receive annual \nincentive payments for implementing innovative conservation practices \non rangeland that is vulnerable to wildfire or has suffered the \nconsequences of wildfire. Conservation efforts funded through this \nprogram would protect unburned areas rich in plant diversity and high \nresources from the threat of wildfire and restore areas impacted by \nwildfire and degraded by invasive weeds through reseeding and \nestablishment of native plants.\n  By creating incentives for private ranchers to manage strips of land \nthat border public lands, we are acknowledging the importance of \nprivate land in restoring rangeland health, acknowledging the costs \ninvolved to producers and their businesses and equally important, \nencouraging partnerships between private land and public lands in our \nefforts to prevent wildfires and improve the environment.\n  Nevada, along with other Western States, is facing unprecedented \nthreats to the environmental health of its rangeland. Working hand in \nhand, wildfires and invasive species, such as cheat grass and red \nbrome, are destroying native ecosystems, such as sagebrush habitat, and \nseverely compromising the value of rangeland for livestock production.\n  According to USDA's Pacific Northwest Research Station more than 50 \npercent of existing sagebrush habitat has been invaded by cheat grass. \nThat is more than 10 million acres. They predict that cheat grass will \ndisplace existing sagebrush and other native plants in much of Nevada \nover the next 30 years. That is why this bill has the support and \nendorsement of the Nevada Cattlemen's Association, The Nevada \nAssociation of Counties, and the Coalition for Nevada's Wildlife. They \nunderstand the importance and economic value of healthy rangeland and \nwelcome opportunities to partner with the Federal Government on finding \nsolutions to these problems.\n  This program is one small step forward in addressing these important \nissues. I intend to work to see this legislation included in the farm \nbill being considered by Congress this year. It is one step forward in \naddressing the conservation and environmental concerns of Nevada and \nthe Great Basin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wildfire Presuppression \n     Fuels Management Pilot Program Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) private grazing land in the United States has \n     experienced dramatic increases in the levels of cheatgrass \n     and other invasive or noxious weed species following \n     wildfires; and\n       (2) to address the needs of private landowners with respect \n     to the protection and management of grazing land, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture should provide cost-share and \n     incentive payments to the landowners to develop fuels \n     management plans and practices and to promote activities--\n       (A) to protect areas of grazing land and wildlife habitat \n     that have not been negatively affected by wildfire; and\n       (B) to manage the risks of wildfires that occur--\n       (i) on public land and rights-of-way from moving onto \n     private grazing land; and\n       (ii) on private land from moving onto public land and \n     right-of-way.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The Nevada Cattlemen's Association (NCA) \n     represents public and private land ranchers throughout \n     Nevada. We seek to create a stable business climate for our \n     members in which they can run environmentally sustainable and \n     economically viable operations.\n       Over the past several years fire has played a large role in \n     the Great Basin. As you know, the State of Nevada can be a \n     harsh environment for those who work the land. Cattlemen are \n     susceptible to wildfire on public and private grazing lands. \n     When fire moves\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\n     through rangelands across the west vegetation communities \n     change from shrub dominated, to annual cheatgrass dominated \n     landscapes. Not only do the vegetation communities change, \n     but the fire cycle increase, habitat for wildlife is \n     decreased, and forage for both domestic livestock and \n     wildlife is greatly reduced throughout the grazing year.\n       Reducing fuels before the fire season using prescriptive \n     grazing, brush thinning, green strips, and spring grazing on \n     already cheatgrass dominated areas will help reduce the \n     catastrophic fires that have moved through Nevada over the \n     past few summers. The Nevada Cattlemen's Association would \n     like to Thank You for realizing working on landscapes before \n     the fires start is the best method not only for the landscape \n     but for Ranchers across the state. Fire not only hurts the \n     rancher during the fire, but for the years after when the \n     federal land is closed off. Your recognition of the role that \n     fire plays in these lives of rural Nevadans is greatly \n     appreciated. We hope that you continue to support pre-fire \n     management by ranchers and the federal land agencies. Your \n     support on a national level shows your constituents that you \n     care, and sets a national precedence that fire management \n     should happen just as much before the fire bums as after. We \n     Thank You for your support of pre-suppression fuels reduction \n     on both public and private ground.

Unlicensed devices carry out myriad functions in the \n     Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (``SCADA'') systems \n     that ensure effective oil and natural gas industry operations \n     and are critical to safety of life and the protection of \n     property and the environment. Systems that rely on these \n     devices remotely operate large production fields, sometimes \n     comprised of thousands of oil and natural gas wells, collect \n     and transmit critical data regarding well pressures, \n     temperature, and rates of flow that are essential to the \n     coordinated and safe operation, and transmit alarms in the \n     event of a leak or other emergency. Similar devices in \n     petroleum and natural gas transmission pipeline operations \n     measure and report flow rate, temperature, and pressure. \n     Energy utilities nationwide use unlicensed systems for remote \n     meter reading, which facilitates time-of-day pricing to \n     spread load and promote energy efficiency, and for SCADA \n     systems that efficiently\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\n     manage the hugely complex electric grid and gas distribution \n     networks and minimize disruptive outages.\n       (2) Unlicensed devices in the hundreds of millions likewise \n     serve other critical societal needs, including \n     transportation, manufacturing, education, health care, \n     entertainment, construction, broadband access, retailing, and \n     data processing.\n       (3) Unlicensed operation in the 902-928 MHz band is a large \n     and essential component of all the benefits identified in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       (4) Increased radio-frequency interference in the 902-928 \n     MHz band would impair many industries, and, in particular, \n     would threaten the integrity and safety of energy production \n     and distribution.\n       (b) Protection of Unlicensed Operation.--\n       (1) In general.--In issuing or amending any regulations \n     related to the operation, use, and maintenance of the 902-928 \n     megahertz band, the Federal Communications Commission shall \n     not permit increased levels of radio-frequency interference \n     in such band to unlicensed devices and operations.\n       (2) Exception.--The limitation under paragraph (1) shall \n     not apply to any regulations issued by the Federal \n     Communications Commissions that directly govern unlicensed \n     operation in the 902-928 megahertz band.\n       (3) Goal.--Consistent with paragraphs (1) and (2), the \n     Federal Communications Commission shall endeavor to maximize \n     efficient use of the 902-928 megahertz band.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Unlicensed device.--The term ``unlicensed device'' \n     means an intentional radiator authorized pursuant to part 15 \n     of the Federal Communication Commission's Rules (47 C.F.R. \n     Part 15).\n       (2) Unlicensed operation.--The term ``unlicensed \n     operation'' means operation of an unlicensed device.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1646. Ms. CANTWELL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby her to the bill H.R. 6, to reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign \noil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative energy resources, \npromoting new emerging energy technologies, developing greater \nefficiency, and creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables \nReserve to invest in alternative energy, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 277, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 521.

LIMITATION ON RADIO-FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE LEVELS \n                   IN THE 902-928 MEGAHERTZ BAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Unlicensed radio devices are critical to promoting \n     energy efficiency in the United States. This equipment is \n     used by virtually all of the major companies involved in \n     exploration, production, refining, marketing, and \n     transportation of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural \n     gas. Unlicensed devices carry out myriad functions in the \n     Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (``SCADA'') systems \n     that ensure effective oil and natural gas industry operations \n     and are critical to safety of life and the protection of \n     property and the environment. Systems that rely on these \n     devices remotely operate large production fields, sometimes \n     comprised of thousands of oil and natural gas wells, collect \n     and transmit critical data regarding well pressures, \n     temperature, and rates of flow that are essential to the \n     coordinated and safe operation, and transmit alarms in the \n     event of a leak or other emergency. Similar devices in \n     petroleum and natural gas transmission pipeline operations \n     measure and report flow rate, temperature, and pressure. \n     Energy utilities nationwide use unlicensed systems for remote \n     meter reading, which facilitates time-of-day pricing to \n     spread load and promote energy efficiency, and for SCADA \n     systems that efficiently\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\n     manage the hugely complex electric grid and gas distribution \n     networks and minimize disruptive outages.\n       (2) Unlicensed devices in the hundreds of millions likewise \n     serve other critical societal needs, including \n     transportation, manufacturing, education, health care, \n     entertainment, construction, broadband access, retailing, and \n     data processing.\n       (3) Unlicensed operation in the 902-928 MHz band is a large \n     and essential component of all the benefits identified in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       (4) Increased radio-frequency interference in the 902-928 \n     MHz band would impair many industries, and, in particular, \n     would threaten the integrity and safety of energy production \n     and distribution.\n       (b) Protection of Unlicensed Operation.--\n       (1) In general.--In issuing or amending any regulations \n     related to the operation, use, and maintenance of the 902-928 \n     megahertz band, the Federal Communications Commission shall \n     not permit increased levels of radio-frequency interference \n     in such band to unlicensed devices and operations.\n       (2) Exception.--The limitation under paragraph (1) shall \n     not apply to any regulations issued by the Federal \n     Communications Commissions that directly govern unlicensed \n     operation in the 902-928 megahertz band.\n       (3) Goal.--Consistent with paragraphs (1) and (2), the \n     Federal Communications Commission shall endeavor to maximize \n     efficient use of the 902-928 megahertz band.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Unlicensed device.--The term ``unlicensed device'' \n     means an intentional radiator authorized pursuant to part 15 \n     of the Federal Communication Commission's Rules (47 C.F.R. \n     Part 15).\n       (2) Unlicensed operation.--The term ``unlicensed \n     operation'' means operation of an unlicensed device.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1646.
