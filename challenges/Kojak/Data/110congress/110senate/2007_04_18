Mr. President, on the first cloture vote dealing with \nprescription drugs, I think probably I have said enough to indicate my \ndispleasure and disappointment with what has happened this week, for \nour inability to proceed on something that is so basic to the security \nof this Nation, the Intelligence authorization bill, which deals with \nour espionage efforts, our ability to collect intelligence from around \nthe world. That was stopped on a strict party-line vote because the \nVice President didn't want that. So that is enough said on that.\n  On the prescription drug issue, when all else fails I think we should \nlook at common sense. What we are asking is that Medicare be able to \nnegotiate for lower prices in the purchase of drugs for senior \ncitizens. This is opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, the insurance \nindustry, and HMOs because they have a sweetheart deal. They can \nnegotiate for lower prices but Medicare can't.\n  You can throw around all the statistics you want, it is not going to \nlower prices. I call upon our common sense. Doesn't it make sense that \nMedicare should be able to compete with these HMOs and negotiate for \nlower price drugs? Of course. That is why AARP and dozens of other \norganizations that care about seniors, not about profits, are on the \nside of moving forward on this legislation. I hope there will be \nSenators on the other side of the aisle who will step up and allow us \nto move forward on this legislation.\n  Finally, it is hard to comprehend, but in addition to not being able \nto move forward on the issues relating to intelligence, and probably on \nprescription drug negotiations, we have been\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nstymied in being able to bring forward a bill on court security. I hope \nit is just a small minority of Senators on the other side holding up \nthis bill. We have had violence in courtrooms all over America. In \nReno, NV, a disgruntled man did not like what a judge was doing on a \ndivorce proceeding. He drove to a garage with his high-powered, deer-\nhunting rifle and fired, at almost 200 yards, through the window of the \njudge's chambers. The shot did not kill him but badly wounded him.\n\n  We know what happened in Atlanta, GA, with someone who was in \ncahoots, basically, with one of the violent prisoners. As a result of \nthat, people were killed.\n  In Illinois, a disgruntled litigant waited in the judge's home, and \nwhen the father and one of the children came home, he killed them both.\n  This legislation dealing with court security is extremely important. \nWe just had this terrible incident in Blacksburg, VA, indicating how \nprone this country is to violence. This legislation dealing with court \nsecurity allows grants to States to beef up the security in courtrooms. \nIt will allow bulletproof glass, as should have been in the judge's \nchambers in Reno, NV, and metal detectors. It would allow jurisdictions \nto obtain metal detectors. It would limit what Federal judges have to \nlist in their various personal papers. It would not be possible, if \nthis legislation passes, for some disgruntled defendant, witness, or \nwhatever the case might be, to go to the Internet and find out where \nthe judge lives, as happened in Illinois. They would not have to \ndisclose personal information like that. They would not have to \ndisclose the jobs of family members so one of these violence-prone \npeople could go to someone's place of business and hurt and injure a \nchild or loved one of one of these judges who make difficult decisions.\n  This legislation is important to allow us to better understand and \nprotect against disgruntled litigants. It increases the penalties for \npeople who do these bad things, who harass prosecutors, judges, and \nwitnesses.\n  It is very important legislation, and we should have already \ncompleted it. But here we are. We are going to have to move to proceed \nto it. Once--I hope--cloture is invoked, then we have 30 hours to wait \nbefore we get onto the bill. It would be a shame that we have to waste \nthe time of our country, time that could be spent on valuable \nlegislation that could be done here in this Chamber, waiting to move \nforward because of people not wanting to legislate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4624-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes on \nthe bill on which we will be voting in approximately an hour, as the \nmajority leader just said. I would like to speak directly to the point \nhe attempted to make, which was why should there be a problem with \nallowing the Federal Government to negotiate for drug prices for \nMedicare by repealing Medicare's so-called noninterference provision?\n  Nobody doesn't support negotiation. Negotiation is at the heart of \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit. I was there when it was written \nin the conference committee and there was a conscientious decision to \nensure that there would be competition for lowering prices by \nspecifically designating pharmacy benefit managers to do negotiating \nwith the drug companies to bring the prices down. So the first myth is \nthat Medicare somehow does not involve negotiations. It involves \nextensive negotiations. What it does not do is allow the Federal \nGovernment to interfere in those negotiations and, in effect, put \nitself in between patients and doctors and the drugs.\n  The Medicare Fair Prescription Drug Price Act of 2007, on which we \nwill be voting cloture, turns this law upside-down and basically \ninserts the Government into this process under these decisions. The \npurpose may sound simple--the Government, using its negotiating clout, \nforcing drug companies to give seniors deep discounts--but if you take \na closer look and peel away the layers, you realize it is nothing more \nthan a promise running on empty, void of details and muddled by \npolitical rhetoric rather than sustained by the facts. Let's look at \nthe facts.\n  First of all, Medicare Part D is working. When Congress crafted the \nbill, we heard from our constituents loudly and clearly. They wanted a \nprescription drug benefit that guaranteed access to affordable drugs \nand offered a choice of plans. They didn't want to be packed into a \none-size-fits-all, Government-run plan that didn't fit their needs, and \nin fact they asked us to model the benefit after the plan that is \navailable to Members of Congress. We did that. We chose access over \nrestrictions, choice over Government control, and competition over \nprice control. As a result, Medicare Part D is exceeding everyone's \nexpectations. Approximately 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have \nsome form of prescription drug coverage. The average premium was $22, \nin 2007, which is 42 percent lower than the Government projected \ninitially. On average, seniors saved $1,200 on their prescription drug \ncosts last year.\n  Eight out of ten Part D enrollees report they are satisfied with \ntheir current coverage, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat the drug benefit will cost the taxpayers 30 percent less, $265 \nbillion in savings over the next 10 years.\n  To sum it up, we have 90 percent Medicare beneficiaries with \ncoverage, 80 percent satisfaction rate, and it costs 30 percent less \nthan originally estimated. If it ``ain't'' broke, don't fix it.\n  The second fact, drug negotiation is at the heart of the Medicare \nbill. For the first time in history, health insurance plans and \npharmaceutical companies and these benefit managers whom I mentioned \nare required to negotiate better prices for seniors, just like they do \nfor Members of Congress. The noninterference provision, which first \nappeared in democratically sponsored legislation, prevents the Federal \nGovernment from interfering in those negotiations. It is a basic \neconomic principle. In competitive markets, supply and demand interact, \ndetermining the price of the good or service. How do you get a good \nprice? These pharmacy benefit managers I mentioned have significant \nmarket power.\n  Consider this fact: The three largest PBMs have nearly 200 million \nmembers, compared to Medicare's 44 million. So when you talk about the \nGovernment using its considerable bargaining clout because it would \nrepresent 44 million, appreciate that these pharmacy benefit managers \nrepresent 200 million. They insure all of these people--Americans in \nthe private sector, as well as Americans who have Government insurance. \nSo the private drug negotiators already enjoy a significant competitive \nadvantage. They use that power to negotiate lower prices and, as I \npointed out, that negotiation has worked.\n  Third, the secretarial negotiation cannot achieve any lower price \nwithout rationing choice in access. That was the testimony before the \nSenate Finance Committee, and I think every one of us appreciates that \nwe should be very careful about anything which could restrict access to \ncare for our seniors. When the Finance Committee marked up this bill \nlast week, I looked forward to getting some clarity on exactly how \nMembers contemplated this secretarial negotiation, how it would work.\n  To my disappointment, no one could explain exactly how it would work. \nIn fact, my colleagues openly and candidly admitted they had no plan or \nany specifics. What they said was that the Secretary would have to use \nhis imagination and that it could take a number of different forms.\n  So what we are buying, in effect, is a pig in a poke. Nobody knows \nwhat the\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\nSecretary would or could do in order to try to bring prices down; he \nwould have to use his imagination.\n  I think it is appropriate for us to ask this kind of question before \nwe buy into legislation that could so dramatically and negatively \nimpact health care for our seniors. Restricting access could \ntheoretically reduce lower prices if they were raised with some other \nprogram. That is the other downside to this legislation.\n  During the Finance Committee noninterference hearing, we heard \ntestimony from Dr. Fiona Scott Morton, who is a Professor of Economics \nat the Yale School of Management. She made a couple of critical points. \nIndividuals eligible to participate in Medicare Part D generate \napproximately 40 percent of prescription drug spending in the United \nStates. The Secretary cannot negotiate a lower average price for such a \nlarge population; Medicare is the average.\n  So if it were somehow theoretically possible to reduce prices, they \nwould have to go up somewhere else. That is the other point we \nestablished as well. There are many different organizations, including \nveterans organizations, that urged us to oppose this legislation \nbecause they understand that if you are somehow able to lower the \nprices for Medicare, they necessarily, arithmetically, have to go up \nsomewhere else. The Veterans' Administration is one of those areas.\n  Let me quote from two letters, one received from the American Legion, \nwhich asks us to consider, and I quote:\n\n        . . . the serious collateral damage that would result from \n     repealing the noninterference provision.\n       The VA is a health care provider, whereas Medicare is a \n     health insurer. Any possible Medicare savings would likely \n     result in a reciprocal cost to the VA. Compromising the \n     noninterference provision by striking this section is not in \n     the best interest of America's veterans and their families.\n\n  The American Legion is not alone. The Military Order of the Purple \nHeart sent a similar letter to the Hill. Bottom line here: Cost savings \nare the result of true efficiencies. Repealing the noninterference \nprovision is just another way to shift costs at the expense of other \nconsumers.\n  In conclusion, during this markup of this bill in the committee, I \noffered three amendments, each of which ensured important safeguards: \nNo. 1, to prohibit cost shifting, as I mentioned, to entities such as \nMedicaid or veterans or the uninsured; No. 2, to require a \ncertification of cost savings to Medicare beneficiaries if these \nnegotiations were to occur; No. 3, a certification of four beneficiary \nprotections: One, individual choice of a prescription drug plan; two, \naccess to prescription drugs by prohibiting a government formulary or \nother tool to restrict drug access; three, guaranteed access to local \npharmacies; and, four, no cost shifting to other payors, such as \nMedicaid, veterans or the uninsured. All three of these amendments were \nrejected. In fact, somebody called them a red herring. Well, \nrestricting seniors' access to prescription drugs and increasing drug \nprices for all consumers are not red herrings, they are important \nissues which have not been adequately addressed in this legislation.\n  Repealing this noninterference provision would put the Government, \nnot the individual in charge, and put seniors one step closer to a \nsingle Government-run designed formulary.\n  I appreciate and respect the goals of my colleagues. We all want to \nimprove access to affordable health coverage. But with all due respect, \nthey are wrong. A great deal of expert testimony and experience with \nMedicare Part D by millions of Americans has demonstrated they are \nwrong. So I urge my colleagues, when considering how to vote on this \nmotion for cloture, to appreciate the fact that, first of all, there is \na great benefit that is producing savings and is well appreciated by \nthe American people; that there are organizations that are very much \nopposed to this, such as the VA, and that we would be very foolish, it \nseems to me, to adopt a piece of legislation such as this about which \nthere is no consensus as to how the Secretary would utilize his \nauthority to negotiate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point \nin the Record an editorial from the Wall Street Journal of today, April \n18, 2007, which further amplifies the points I have made this morning.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 18, 2007]\n\n                              Bitter Pills\n\n       The Senate is scheduled to vote today on legislation to \n     allow the government to negotiate drug prices under the 2003 \n     Medicare prescription drug bill. Democrats and such liberal \n     interest groups as AARP claim this would save money for \n     seniors and taxpayers, but the more likely result is that \n     seniors would find that fewer of their therapies are covered.\n       We opposed the prescription drug bill as a vast new \n     entitlement, but there's no denying the program's innovation \n     of using private-sector competition has worked far better \n     than critics predicted. In the first year alone, the cost of \n     Medicare Part D came in 30 percent below projections. The \n     Congressional Budget Office calculates the 10-year cost of \n     Medicare Part D will be a whopping $265 billion below \n     original estimates.\n       Seniors are also saving money under this private \n     competition model. Premiums for the drug benefit were \n     expected to average $37 a month. Instead, premiums this year \n     are averaging $22 a month--a more than 40 percent saving. \n     Democrats don't like to be reminded that many of them wanted \n     to lock in premiums at $35 a month back in 2003. No wonder \n     recent polls find that about 80 percent of seniors say \n     they're satisfied with their new Medicare drug benefits.\n       Democrats who opposed all of this private competition now \n     say that government-negotiated prices will do even better. \n     They must have missed the new study by the Lewin Group, the \n     health policy consulting firm, which found that federal \n     insurance programs that impose price controls typically hold \n     down costs by refusing to cover some of the most routinely \n     prescribed medicines for seniors. These include treatments \n     for high cholesterol, arthritis, heartburn and glaucoma.\n       Supporters of federal price ``negotiations''--really, an \n     imposed price--also like to point to the example of the \n     Veterans Health Administration, which negotiates prices \n     directly with drug companies. But it turns out that the \n     vaunted VHA drug program has a few holes of its own. The \n     Lewin study examined the availability of the 300 drugs most \n     commonly prescribed for seniors. It found that one in three--\n     including such popular medicines as Lipitor, Crestor, Nexium \n     and Celebrex--are not covered under VHA. However, 94 percent \n     are covered under the private competition model of Medicare \n     Part D. Fewer than one of five new drugs approved by the FDA \n     since 2000 are available under VHA.\n       Here's the real kicker: Statistics released March 22 by the \n     VHA and Department of Health and Human Services show that \n     1.16 million seniors who are already enrolled in the VHA drug \n     program have nonetheless signed up for Medicare Part D. \n     That's about one-third of the entire VHA case load. Why? \n     Because these seniors have figured out that Medicare Part D \n     offers more convenience, often lower prices, and better \n     insurance coverage for their prescription drugs. In short, \n     seniors are voting with their feet against the very price \n     control system that Democratic leaders Harry Reid and Nancy \n     Pelosi want to push them into.\n       Of course, the greatest threat from drug price controls is \n     not to our wallets, but to public health. Price controls \n     reduce the incentive for biotech and pharmaceutical companies \n     to invest the $500 million to $1 billion that is often now \n     required to bring a new drug to market. If government price \n     controls erode the profits these companies can earn to \n     produce these often life-saving medications, the pace of new \n     drug development will almost certainly delay treatments for \n     AIDS, cancer, heart disease and the like. Congress is \n     proposing dangerous medicine, and if it becomes law seniors \n     may be the first victims.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have a very important vote we are \ngoing to take in a few minutes about whether we are going to be allowed \nto proceed--even to proceed--to a bill that would give the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services a very important tool to lower prices for \nprescription drugs.\n  With all due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I \nhear very differently from seniors. First of all, they don't like, in \nMichigan, wading through 50, 60, 70 different insurance plans and all \nthe paperwork to figure out what plan they are going to sign up for. \nThey wanted us to go directly to Medicare which is, by the way, a \nGovernment-run program, one of the most successful in the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  They wanted us to be able to set up prescription drug coverage \nthrough Medicare. That wasn't done. Instead, we have this privatized \nsystem that was geared to making sure the industry would have the \nmaximum amount of profit. That has been the focus, unfortunately, of \nthis legislation, which\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nis why we would see, in the middle of a prescription drug bill for \nseniors, actual language that says: You cannot negotiate for lower \nprices.\n  Now, we have an opportunity to change that, to take that language \naway. What are we hearing? Well, we are hearing all kinds of things, \nall kinds of things. On the one hand we hear: This will do nothing for \nseniors. It will not help seniors. It will not lower prices. On the \nother hand we hear: It is going to do all kinds of things that are very \nterrible for people.\n  Well, it can't be both. What we have going on is an orchestrated \neffort by the industry to keep things the way they are.\n  If we were able to get better prices for seniors, there would not be \nthat big gap in coverage that I guess some folks think the seniors \nlike. Seniors in Michigan do not like that. After they have paid some \n$2,100 in drug costs, going into a gap where the average price has \nactually gone up, they have no help. This is a very different world I \nam hearing from, the people in Michigan, rather than what we are \nhearing from the industry and from others who support this plan the way \nit is.\n  We can do better than this Medicare prescription drug benefit. Today \nis the opportunity to decide whose side you are on, either on the side \nof the industry that is doing great under this bill, record profits, or \nyou are going to be on the side of the seniors who are asking us to \nhelp them, whatever way we can, get the best deal for them by lowering \ntheir prices.\n  I wish to go through a few of the myths and the scare tactics that \nhave been out there, and there have been many, there is no question \nabout it. First of all, we are hearing from the industry now in big \nads--by the way, I should say, $135,000 an ad a day--by folks who say \nthis bill would not do anything. It is the Washington Post and another \nWashington Post. We go on and we can see all of the papers that we \nread. We have seen these ads in the Congressional Daily--daily, \nmillions and millions of dollars.\n  I woke up this morning to an ad on television I have seen many times: \nThe Medicare prescription drug benefit, yes, it is doing great for \nthem. It is not doing great for our seniors.\n  Here is one of the things they are saying: that 89 percent of the \nfolks oppose negotiation, if it could limit access to new prescription \ndrugs. What they are saying is, they are telling people they are going \nto limit access to new drugs, they are not going to be able to do \nresearch anymore.\n  In fact, this bill would not limit access to prescription medication. \nI have to say, with all due respect, the industry spends about 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes more on advertising and marketing than they do on research. We \nhave a long way to go. We could cut out a couple of ads. One ad for \n$135,000, if it was not done, I wonder how much medicine that would buy \nfor people? This is not about doing away with research. We know that. \nCBO says that. We know that as a fact. This is not about taking away \naccess to medicine for people.\n  We are being told it will have an effect on other purchasers. The \nCongressional Budget Office, I asked them to put in writing, after our \nFinance hearing, whether this bill would do that. CBO anticipates that \nS. 3--the bill in front of us, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price \nNegotiation Act of 2007 as reported by the Finance Committee--would not \nhave an effect on drug prices for other purchasers.\n  Unfortunately, my good friends, the veterans for whom we work hard, \nwhom we have raised health care dollars for, have been told something \ndifferent. That is very unfortunate. It is not true. It is a \nscare tactic. This bill does not do that. CBO, in fact, has indicated \nit does not do that.\n\n  We hear something else that I think is very important. We hear: Well, \nwe should not compare this to the VA; the Veterans' Administration \nnegotiates group prices for our veterans. In fact, the average \ndifference in price is 58 percent.\n  Now, some go up to as high as 1,000 percent, a 1,000-percent \ndifference. On Zocor, there is a 1,000-percent difference. It seems to \nme there is a little room for us to negotiate for those on Medicare \nwithin that 1,000 percent.\n  But we are told no. The problem is that the VA, first of all, gets \nlower prices because they do not offer as many drugs; you cannot go to \nthe VA and get the drugs you need, which is also not true.\n  From a presentation overview of the VA pharmacy benefit, in a \npresentation that was made, comparing apples to apples, now they have \ncompared on the other side of this argument chemical compounds as \nopposed to actual drugs.\n  But the fact is, under Medicare there are 4,300 different drugs \navailable, 4,300. Under the VA, they dispense 4,700--not 4,300--4,778 \nspecific drug products, specific drug products which represent the \nchemical compounds that have been used on the other side of the \nargument.\n  In fact, in addition to that, if you go to the VA and if on the list, \nthe approved list, there is not the medicine you need, you can ask for \nan exception to get the medicine you need. In addition to the 4,778 \ndifferent medicines available from the VA, last year they dispensed \nprescriptions for an additional 1,416 different drugs so our seniors, \nour veterans were able to get what they needed from the VA.\n  When we hear concerns about veterans health care, with all due \nrespect--I hear a lot about driving too far to get tests, waiting too \nlong to see a doctor--I do not hear about not being able to get \nmedicine.\n  The fact is, the VA dispenses more different prescriptions at a lower \nprice than this privatized system, what I view as a dismantling of \nMedicare that has taken place through the prescription drug benefit \nthat is before us.\n  What we have is the ability today to take a vote on proceeding to a \nbill that 87 percent of the American public wants to see us pass. And \nthis is the AARP. Now, I find it very interesting, on the one hand, we \nhave got all the folks representing the industry doing well under this \nbill, putting in ads, doing surveys, talking to us through the \ntelevision and the radio saying that seniors do not want to negotiate \nthe best price because of all these scare tactics.\n  But when the group who represents seniors, the AARP, speaks, they \ntell us 87 percent of voters want us to move ahead. This is a tool. \nThis is giving the Secretary the ability to use that tool in a way that \nis responsible and will lower prices for our seniors. This is a motion \nto proceed.\n  I hope we are not going to see what we have seen, unfortunately, too \nmany times this year, as we have--in the new majority--worked hard to \nchange the direction of this country. I hope we do not see our efforts \nstopped from even moving forward to debate this critical piece of \nlegislation. Eighty seven percent of the American public has some \ncommon sense. They are saying: What are you doing? What are you doing \nthat you would not give the Secretary the ability to negotiate the best \nprice?\n  I hope we will join together overwhelmingly and vote to give us the \nopportunity to consider this bill, to be able to move forward on a \nbasic policy of common sense to help our seniors, people on Medicare, \nget the lowest possible price for their medicine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I inquire how much time this side of the aisle has \nremaining in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has a little over 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I see the distinguished ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee here. I will speak briefly and then certainly yield the rest \nof our time to him.\n  There is a much larger question than has been addressed so far before \nthe Senate this morning on this particular motion to proceed; that is, \nwhether we are going to see the incremental growth of Government \ninvolved in intervening between decisions that should be made by \npatients in consultation with their doctors as a matter of individual \nchoice. If, in fact, the advocates of this particular legislation are \nsuccessful, it will be one step further down the road toward a single-\npayer system where the Government will decide what kind of health care \nwe get and our family members receive rather than we as a matter of \nindividual choice in consultation with our personal family doctor. That \nis a dangerous trend.\n  As my colleagues know, the Federal Government and Federal taxpayers \npay for 50 percent of health care today. I am staggered by the \nsuggestion that\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\nthe Federal Government can somehow do a better job than the private \nsector through choice and competition in setting drug prices. Rather \nthan a negotiation, this is like a take-it-or-leave-it offer with a gun \nto your head. The consequences, if this legislation is successful, will \nbe that seniors will have fewer choices, Government will have grown \nthat much bigger and interfered much more in the private choices we \nshould all make as a matter of personal choice. The irony is, this is \none of the Government programs--I would say rare Government programs--\nthat actually works better than we thought it would. As a matter of \nfact, I voted for the Medicare prescription drug bill in 2003, but I \nwas concerned when some of the estimates that came out of the \nCongressional Budget Office indicated it would actually cost a lot more \nthan we originally thought. But this is a good news story.\n  What I don't understand is why our Democratic friends want to ruin a \ngood thing that 80 percent of seniors who have access to this \nprescription drug plan say they like and 90 percent of seniors eligible \nhave signed up for, saving on average $1,200 a year. Why in the world \nwould we want to mess up a good thing? I don't understand it, unless it \nis that incremental step toward a single-payer, Government-run health \ncare system that would be a bad direction, rather than leaving the \nprivate sector to provide choices and competition, which improves \nservices and lowers price.\n  Listening to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to \nparaphrase H.L. Mencken, they live in dread that somebody somewhere is \nactually making a profit in a private enterprise. I don't particularly \ncare if shareholders in a company decide they want to risk their money \nto invest in a competitive enterprise to provide me and my family a \nservice that I want and like and need and do it at a price that is \nlower and a service quality that is better than the Federal Government. \nThe fact that they make a profit, good for them. That is what this \ncountry is built on. That is why our economy is the envy of the world.\n  Competition provided in the prescription drug benefit has forced \ncosts down far below what was anticipated. In 2007, the average premium \nfor the benefit is $22 a month--40 percent less than projected. We have \nheard the statistics before, but they bear repeating. The Congressional \nBudget Office new budget estimates that for the next 10 years, the net \nMedicare cost for the prescription drug benefit will be more than 30 \npercent lower than originally forecast, $265 billion. I have only been \nin the Senate for 4\\1/2\\ years, but I don't think I have ever seen or \neven read about a Government program that actually came in under budget \nat a lower cost than originally projected. For some reason--and it \nescapes me--some of our colleagues here want to change that, and that \nis a mistake.\n  One of the editorials in one of my newspapers back in Texas, the \nAustin American Statesman, writes:\n\n       The incoming majority of Congressional Democrats, it seems, \n     has a problem: a promise to fix something--the new Medicare \n     drug program--that might not need fixing.\n\n  The basic point is this: We passed a prescription drug benefit that \nuses market competition to provide critical medications to seniors at \ncosts much lower than projected. The results so far demonstrate the \nfamiliar principle that competition and choice could bring lower \nprices, something that should not surprise any of us. I must say, I am \nsurprised at the magnitude of the benefit and the magnitude of the \nsavings and the way this has lived up or, I should say, even exceeded \nexpectations.\n  Today in the Wall Street Journal there is an article entitled \n``Bitter Pills'' which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. This speaks directly to the comments made by the Senator \nfrom Michigan about the Veterans' Administration. Let me briefly read \nthis paragraph:\n\n       Supporters of federal price ``negotiations''--really, an \n     imposed price--also like to point to the example of the \n     Veterans Health Administration which negotiates prices \n     directly with drug companies. But it turns out that the \n     vaunted VHA program has a few holes of its own. The LEWIN \n     study--\n\nWhich it alludes to earlier, a health policy consulting firm\n\n     examined the availability of the 300 drugs most commonly \n     prescribed for seniors. It found that one in three--including \n     [the most] popular medicines as Lipitor, Crestor, Nexium and \n     Celebrex--are not covered by the VHA.\n\n  Not covered. That is what the advocates of this legislation, I guess, \nbelieve is the ideal, to cover less drugs, and that is what the \nconsequences of this legislation would be.\n  Let me read the last sentence:\n\n       However, 94 percent of these drugs are covered under the \n     private competition model of Medicare Part D. Fewer than one \n     of five new drugs approved by the FDA since 2000 are \n     available under the VHA plan.\n\n  If the right vote on this upcoming motion to proceed is to end the \ndebate, it is not true that we haven't had debate. We are having the \ndebate right now. But I believe the country would be better off, \nseniors would be better off, and choice and competition would remain \navailable if we voted against the motion to proceed. That is how I \nintend to vote and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 18, 2007]\n\n                              Bitter Pills\n\n       The Senate is scheduled to vote today on legislation to \n     allow the government to negotiate drug prices under the 2003 \n     Medicare prescription drug bill. Democrats and such liberal \n     interest groups as AARP claim this would save money for \n     seniors and taxpayers, but the more likely result is that \n     seniors would find that fewer of their therapies are covered.\n       We opposed the prescription drug bill as a vast new \n     entitlement, but there's no denying the program's innovation \n     of using private-sector competition has worked far better \n     than critics predicted. In the first year alone, the cost of \n     Medicare Part D came in 30 percent below projections. The \n     Congressional Budget Office calculates the 10-year cost of \n     Medicare Part will be a whopping $265 billion below original \n     estimates.\n       Seniors are also saving money under this private \n     competition model. Premiums for the drug benefit were \n     expected to average $37 a month. Instead, premiums this year \n     are averaging $22 a month--a more than 40 percent saving, \n     Democrats don't like to be reminded that many of them wanted \n     to lock in premiums at $35 a month back in 2003. No wonder \n     recent polls find that about 80 percent of seniors say \n     they're satisfied with their new Medicare drug benefits.\n       Democrats who opposed all of this private competition now \n     say that government-negotiated prices will do even better. \n     They must have missed the new study by the Lewin Group, the \n     health policy consulting firm, which found that federal \n     insurance programs that impose price controls typically hold \n     down costs by refusing to cover some of the most routinely \n     prescribed medicines for seniors. These include treatments \n     for high cholesterol, arthritis, heartburn and glaucoma.\n       Supporters of federal price ``negotiations''--really, an \n     imposed price--also like to point to the example of the \n     Veterans Health Administration, which negotiates prices \n     directly with drug companies. But it turns out that the \n     vaunted VHA drug program has a few holes of its own. The \n     Lewin study examined the availability of the 300 drugs most \n     commonly prescribed for seniors. It found that one in three--\n     including such popular medicines as Lipitor, Crestor, Nexium \n     and Celebrex--are not covered under VHA. However, 94 percent \n     are covered under the private competition model of Medicare \n     Part D. Fewer than one of five new drugs approved by the FDA \n     since 2000 are available under VHA.\n       Here's the real kicker: Statistics released March 22 by the \n     VHA and Department of Health and Human Services show that \n     1.16 million seniors who are already enrolled in the VHA drug \n     program have nonetheless signed up for Medicare Part D. \n     That's about one-third of the entire VHA case load. Why? \n     Because these seniors have figured out that Medicare Part D \n     offers more convenience, often lower prices, and better \n     insurance coverage for their prescription drugs. In short, \n     seniors are voting with their feet against the very price \n     control system that Democratic leaders Harry Reid and Nancy \n     Pelosi want to push them into.\n       Of course, the greatest threat from drug price controls is \n     not to our wallets, but to public health. Price controls \n     reduce the incentive for biotech and pharmaceutical companies \n     to invest the $500 million to $1 billion that is often now \n     required to bring a new drug to market. If government price \n     controls erode the profits these companies can earn to \n     produce these often life-saving medications, the pace of new \n     drug development will almost certainly delay treatments for \n     AIDS, cancer, heart disease and the like. Congress is \n     proposing dangerous medicine, and if it becomes law seniors \n     may be the first victims.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is my intention to go a little less than 10 minutes. I \nknow the distinguished chairman of the committee is here as well, and I \nwant him to be able to speak for our side.\n  Mr. President, I have always tried to work in a bipartisan way on \nhealth care. I voted in favor of creating the Medicare prescription \ndrug program. I do not favor the Government running everything in \nhealth care. In fact, I have introduced legislation that would ensure \nthat the government would not run everything. I believe it is important \nthat pharmaceutical companies be successful in developing new products \nand therapies for America's seniors and for patients who are suffering. \nI believe it is time for the Senate to right a wrong. Outlawing the \nGovernment from any and every opportunity to negotiate lower drug \nprices for millions of seniors and taxpayers is an instance of special \ninterest overreaching. Everybody else in America negotiates. Employers \nnegotiate. Labor unions negotiate. Individuals negotiate. Everybody \ntries to be a smart shopper. Certainly Medicare, with 43 million \npeople's interest on the line, ought to do everything it possibly can \nto be a savvy shopper.\n  It is especially important that the Government not give up the right \nto negotiate when single-source drugs are involved. These are drugs \nwhere there is no competition and no therapeutic equivalent. For many \npatients, a single-source drug is essentially the only drug available. \nCancer drugs often fall into this particular category. What this means \nis, seniors who depend on these cancer drugs for their very survival \noften face bills of thousands and thousands of dollars. In my hometown, \nit can often cost something like $400 for a particular injection. We \nare talking about treatment with these single-source drugs for those \nwho are suffering, say, from leukemia, from kidney disease. For the \nlife of me, I don't see how it is common sense to say that we are going \nto give up every single opportunity for all time for the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to try to negotiate a better deal for those \nseniors on drugs where there is no competition.\n  Senator Snowe and I have worked for more than 3 years in a bipartisan \nway to address the most important concerns of our colleagues who have \nquestioned this proposal. We believe strongly that we should not have \nprice controls in any shape or form. Price controls clearly impede \ninnovation and the development of new therapies. We should not do that. \nChairman Baucus has ensured that price controls would not be allowed \nunder the measure before the Senate today.\n  Senator Snowe and I also believe strongly that there should not be \nrestrictive formularies. These form-\nularies--to use technical health care lingo--essentially involve a list \nof drugs to which seniors could get access. We should not restrict the \naccess of seniors to medicines. Senator Snowe and I have made that a \npriority for more than 3 years. Chairman Baucus has addressed that as \nwell.\n  We don't have any one-size-fits-all, run-from-Washington kind of \npricing regimes. All we have said is: Let's make sure we can negotiate \nwhen it is critically important. I submit, in every one of these budget \nletters--I know the history has been hard to follow; one said this, one \nsaid that--every one has indicated that there can be savings when there \nare single-source drugs involved in negotiation. I emphasize that. For \ncertain cancer drugs, where seniors can be spending thousands and \nthousands of dollars, there is the potential for savings when the \nSecretary has a role there.\n  Not a single person in the Congress today can imagine all of the \nscenarios possible that may come up in 10 or 20 years, what new drugs \nthere may be that could cure or treat health problems. There can be \nsituations in the future where, for example, a different Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services would use negotiating authority to get \nsavings that can't be anticipated for drugs that haven't even been \ncontemplated today. It doesn't make sense for the Congress to \npreemptively outlaw future savings. It especially doesn't make sense \nwhen the American Association of Retired Persons, in an RX Watchdog \nReport that looked at nearly 200 drugs including the most commonly used \nbrand-name medications, has found that seniors very often need \nmedicines that carry price tags that have gone up twice the rate of \ninflation. So we have older people getting hit--almost clobbered--with \nthese costs which are going up more than twice the rate of inflation.\n\n  I and others have said we want to be sensitive to the question of \ninnovation. That is why we have not supported price controls. But when \nyou are talking about drugs, such as certain cancer drugs, and the \ninterests of older people, let us not say, for all time, and in every \ninstance, we are going to forsake the opportunity to negotiate.\n  Given that is possible to negotiate savings for seniors, if you stand \nup at a town meeting anywhere in this country and say, well, gosh, that \nis no big deal, I think seniors and taxpayers would say, try to get us \nthe most value out of this program. This is a program I voted for and \nthat I have always tried to look at ways to improve. I think there are \nplenty of ways under the leadership of Chairman Baucus and Senator \nGrassley we can improve this program.\n  Certainly, it is still far too complicated. You almost have to be a \nlegal wizard to sort through some of these forms and to be able to \ncompare the possibilities you might have for your coverage. So there \nare other steps that can be taken in a bipartisan way. But we ought to \nhave a real debate in the Senate on one of the most important \npocketbook issues of our time. This is what people talk about in coffee \nshops, in senior centers, and in community halls all across the \ncountry.\n  I think the proposal Chairman Baucus has developed in this area makes \nsense. It does not go over the line and impede pharmaceutical \ninnovation. It ensures we are going to be on the side of trying to \nstand up for seniors when it comes to those drugs, such as the cancer \ndrugs I have discussed this morning, when they have trouble affording \nthem.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote for the motion to proceed and a \nchance for the Senate to have a real debate rather than this abridged \nkind of discussion where only a handful of Senators can participate.\n  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for making sure this \ngets to the floor and, particularly, my colleague, Senator Snowe, who \nhas worked with me on this issue in a bipartisan way for more than 3 \nyears. If we get a chance to proceed, she and I will be offering an \namendment to strengthen the proposal still further.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in Shakespeare's time, the poor had little \naccess to medicine. In ``Measure for Measure,'' one of Shakespeare's \nplays, he wrote:\n\n       The miserable have no other medicine, but only hope.\n\n  With the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, we sought to give \nAmerica's seniors, especially America's poorest seniors, something more \nthan only hope. We sought to ensure that seniors had access to the \naffordable medicine they need.\n  When we crafted the Medicare drug benefit, we could only imagine how \nit would work. We really did not know. In some respects, our work was \ntheoretical. We established a market-based approach in which any number \nof private insurers would compete to offer drug coverage. That was the \nfoundation.\n  Even with a market-based design, we had tremendous concern that the \nmarket would not be able to offer drug coverage. As the former CMS \nAdministrator said at the time:\n\n       Private drug plans do not yet exist in nature.\n\n  We were starting from scratch.\n  In an abundance of caution, we went a step further than merely \ncreating a market for drug coverage. We took what I am now convinced \nwas a step too far: We tied the hands of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services with what has come to be known as the ``noninterference \nclause.'' We eliminated the Government's ability to intervene to get \nfair drug prices for seniors. Today, we consider a bill to repeal a \nportion of that noninterference clause created by the Medicare \nprescription drug program.\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\n  What is the noninterference clause? The noninterference clause \nprohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from \n``interfering'' with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and \npharmacies and drug plan sponsors. Essentially, this provision bans the \nSecretary from doing anything that would affect the prices Medicare \npays for drugs. Another prong of this noninterference clause prohibits \nthe Secretary from creating a single, national formulary and from \nsetting prices under the Medicare drug benefit. The legislation before \nus today, however, leaves that part alone. Those prohibitions remain.\n  Now the Medicare drug benefit is in its second year. Our theory that \nprivate plans would offer and deliver Medicare drug coverage proved \naccurate. It is working for millions of Americans. It is giving them \nmore than just hope. But it is not perfect, and in some cases it still \nmay not be giving seniors affordable drugs. We are here today because \nwe need to do all we can to make sure it works well for everyone. \nLooking at the program today, the noninterference clause is an \nunnecessary hindrance. It ties the Secretary's hands.\n  Free markets are usually the best solution. But markets sometimes \nfail. In this program, American taxpayers are spending more than $50 \nbillion a year to deliver a prescription drug benefit to seniors. We \nmay on occasion need the Secretary to roll up his sleeves and get more \ninvolved in the program. We want Secretaries of HHS to be able to use \nthe tools at their disposal. We want them to help shape the drug \nbenefit into a strong and thriving program. It is time to untie the \nSecretary's hands.\n  The bill before us today does not change the market-based approach of \nthe drug benefit. It does not change that at all. This bill is not the \nfirst step toward Government-run health care, nothing close to it. This \nbill is not the first step toward a single-payer health care system. No \nway. Rather, the bill before us today aims simply to improve and \nstrengthen the drug benefit. It is our way of fulfilling our promise to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with access to affordable medicines. We \nshould not allow the Government to sit idly by while seniors continue \nto pay high prices or even go without their medicine. That would be a \ndereliction of duty. Congress created this benefit to give seniors \naccess to affordable drug coverage. Now we need to make sure the prices \nseniors pay at the pharmacy are low, too. That is the goal of this \nlegislation.\n  So let us build on the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Let us \nseek to give America's seniors something more than only hope. Let us \nensure that seniors truly have access to the affordable medicine they \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have 12 minutes left; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to please inform me when \nI have used 11 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we have a situation here where the latest argument has \nbeen that when we wrote the bill 4 years ago, providing pharmaceuticals \nfor seniors under Medicare, we went one step too far by saying the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services should not interfere in plans \nnegotiating drug prices.\n  Well, I want everybody to understand that we took this language from \nseveral different Democratic bills which had been introduced because I \nwanted this program to be as bipartisan as we could make it. So we had \nSenator Moynihan introducing President Clinton's bill in 1999 which had \nthat language in it. We had a Daschle-Reid bill in the year 2001 which \nincluded that language. We had a House bill in 2001 which\nincluded that language. We had a\nGephardt-Pelosi-Rangel-Stark-Dingell-Stabenow bill--Senator Stabenow \nnow--which had this language in it.\n  So I want people to know that as to this language which they now \nthink should not be in this legislation--the bipartisan approach--we \ntook this language because we thought this would be one step further \ntoward making this whole program bipartisan because we do not have \nenough bipartisanship in the Congress now. All of a sudden, everybody \nwho thought this language was perfect language thinks this language--\nfrom Democratic pieces of legislation--ought to be struck out of this \nbipartisan bill. Obviously, as I said yesterday, and I say today, we \nhave plans that are working. And if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n  Mr. President, I have always been fond of jigsaw puzzles--spinning \nthe pieces around, figuring out how the pieces of a puzzle all fit \ntogether, until you finally see the whole picture. This debate is a lot \nlike working a jigsaw puzzle. I would like to have you take a look at a \nfew of the pieces.\n  One piece is the House bill, H. 4, passed by the House. The House \nbill requires the Secretary to negotiate prices with drug \nmanufacturers. The House bill also strikes the ban on Government price-\nsetting. To date, the House authors have not explained why they wanted \nto authorize the Government to set prices.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said the House bill would not achieve \nany savings unless the Secretary was given the authority to establish a \nformulary or use some other tools to negotiate lower prices.\n  Let's look at another piece of the puzzle; that is, the bill before \nus, S. 3. The Senate bill authorizes the Government to take over \nMedicare's negotiations. It strikes the prohibition on Government \ninterference in negotiations the prescription drug plans are doing \ntoday, negotiating with the drug companies to get drug prices down. The \naverage cost of the 25 most used drugs by seniors is down 35 percent.\n  The Senate sponsors keep saying their bill ``begins the process'' for \nnegotiation. But what about the negotiation that has been going on for \n4 years under this bill? They say their language, by striking, is a \nstep toward what they want.\n  As was the case in the House bill, H.R. 4, the Congressional Budget \nOffice also says the Senate bill, S. 3, will not achieve any savings \nunless the Secretary establishes a national formulary or uses other \ntools to reduce drug prices.\n  So we have two bills, two pieces to our puzzle. But on Thursday \nnight, in our Finance Committee markup of S. 3, we found a missing \npiece that helps us bridge the bills together and finally see the full \npicture of the puzzle.\n  On Thursday night, I offered an amendment that would prevent the \nSecretary from using preferred drug lists to limit access to approved \nprescription drugs. We have heard over and over again from our \ncolleagues that neither H.R. 4 nor the Senate bill, S. 3, allows for a \nnational formulary. But as all observers of the Medicaid Program know, \nStates are not allowed to use formularies, but the courts have said \nStates can use preferred drug lists. A preferred drug list is just like \na formulary, only in sheep's clothing. It is a Government-controlled \nlist of drugs a beneficiary can and cannot have; in other words, the \nGovernment saying what drugs you can use, not your doctor, or at least \nwhat drugs we are going to pay for. A national preferred drug list \nwould have the same effect, then, as a national formulary.\n  So I thought: For all the talk about not allowing Government \nformularies, the proponents of S. 3 would embrace a provision banning \npreferred drug lists. If they really do not want to limit beneficiary \naccess to drugs, it should have been an easy thing for them to support. \nSo I offered that amendment to prohibit the Secretary from imposing a \nnational preferred drug list. Much to my surprise, every Democrat in \nthe committee voted against my amendment. When the proponents of \nGovernment negotiations defeated my amendment, they were, in fact, \nvoting in favor of having the Government limit access to drugs. They \nvoted for Government limits on access to drugs. They voted to have the \nGovernment tell beneficiaries which drugs they can have and which they \ncannot have, which is an intervention of Government between a doctor \nand a patient--that relationship we were working so hard to preserve \nwhen we wrote the bill in 2003.\n  We have the final piece of the puzzle allowing everything to fall \ninto place.\n  What would H.R. 4 and S. 3 look like after they merged them together \nin conference between the House and Senate? Well, you can put two and \ntwo together and get an answer.\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\n  H.R. 4 requires the Secretary to negotiate drug prices and eliminate \nthe ban on price setting. It is clear now that supporters of the Senate \nbill want the Government to set preferred drug lists because they voted \nagainst it when I offered that in committee, that the Secretary \ncouldn't do that, preferred drug lists, which are just like \nformularies. They want the Government to determine what drugs seniors \nwill be allowed to get coverage for. We have heard all this hooray \nabout the VA and how they do things. Remember, the VA only pays for 23 \npercent of the drugs that seniors can get now under Part D.\n  The puzzle is complete. If we let S. 3 go to conference, we will have \nreturned to us a bill that requires the Secretary to negotiate with \ndrug manufacturers using price controls and a national preferred drug \nlist. It couldn't be more clear.\n  We must not let that happen. We must put a stop to it and do it right \nhere. Price control and a national preferred drug list are the tools \nthey want the Government to have. They want to have the Federal \nGovernment take over Medicare prescription drug marketing, and that is \nabsolutely the wrong thing to do. The Medicare drug benefit is working. \n``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' It is a testimony to the idea that \nthe private market works, that Government-run health care is not the \nanswer.\n  They say Medicare doesn't negotiate. That is not true. Medicare is \nnegotiating today, just the way we set it up 4 years ago to negotiate. \nMedicare is negotiating through the market clout of its prescription \ndrug plans, and the market-based model for Part D is working. Costs are \nfar lower than expected. CBO projections for Part D dropped by $308 \nbillion--32 percent lower. That is the 2007 baseline compared to the \n2006 baseline. Premiums for beneficiaries are 40 percent lower. Seniors \noverwhelmingly approve of the benefit.\n  So why do supporters of this legislation hate the Medicare drug \nbenefit so much? They hate it because nothing could be more damaging to \nthe idea of Government-run health care than Part D, the way we wrote it \n4 years ago. It is a free market plan, and it is a market that is \nworking, and that is not their plan for how health care should work. \nTheir view is that Government knows best.\n  So what do seniors and all Americans have to look forward to if this \nTrojan horse attack succeeds in a Government takeover of prescription \ndrugs? Seniors can look forward to fewer choices. Gone will be the days \nwhen seniors can select from various plans to find one that suits them. \nIf this bill passes, seniors will get only the drugs the Government \nselects for them.\n  Do you want a Government bureaucrat in your medicine cabinet? All \nother Americans will see higher prices for their prescription drugs, \nexperts testified before the Finance Committee.\n  I will go ahead and use up the remaining minute.\n  CBO has said that everybody else's prices will go up. We have reams \nof evidence showing that price controls and Medicare will lead to \nhigher drug costs for everybody else. That means higher prices for \nveterans. That means higher prices for the disabled, pregnant women, \nand children on Medicaid. That means higher prices for small business \nowners and families. If we don't stop this bill right now, that is what \nwe have to look forward to.\n  We can and should stop this bill in its tracks. Vote against \nGovernment-controlled drug lists, vote against Government setting \nprices, vote against Government restriction on seniors' access to \ndrugs.\n  Mr. President, everyone should move beyond the simpleminded rhetoric \nof sound bites and see the full picture because sound bites don't make \nsound policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time does \nour side have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nIowa, but I simply want to set the record straight with respect to a \ncouple of points. The distinguished Senator from Iowa was talking about \nthe House bill to a great extent. We are not dealing with the House \nbill. I want to be very clear what the Senate bill does.\n  All the Senate bill does is lift this restriction which bars the \nSecretary from ever having a role in negotiation. This bill--the \nmeasure that is before the Senate--does not take over the role of the \nprivate plans. The private plans would continue as they have since the \nprogram's inception: to sign the contracts, to conduct the various \nactivities to make sure that seniors can purchase that coverage. There \nis no takeover of private plans, despite what has been suggested.\n  Point No. 2: In no way does the measure now before the Senate limit \naccess to drugs for seniors. We have been told that under this \nparticular measure, there would be huge restrictions with respect to \nseniors being able to get drugs, that there would be formularies \nestablished, a variety of prescriptive arrangements that would deny \nchoice. That is not the case in this legislation.\n  Let's be clear. One, this is not the bill that is before the House. \nIt is not the bill the House has acted on. Two, it simply lifts the \nrestriction. Three, it doesn't take over the role of the private plans. \nThe Secretary is simply complementing the role of the private plans. \nFour, under this particular measure, the Government would not limit \naccess to drugs. There would be no restriction on drugs that seniors \ncould get under this bill.\n  I only come back to the point I made earlier. This is about patients \nwho are hurting. This is about those cancer patients, for example, who \nare taking drugs for which there is no competitive alternative, where \nthere is no therapeutic alternative. Should we simply sit by and say \nthat when they have to spend thousands and thousands for those cancer \ndrugs--cancer drugs that are essential to their survival--are we going \nto say that we should give up any and every opportunity for the \nSecretary to try to negotiate a good price? I think we understand this \nis a straightforward issue. This is about whether we are going to have \na real debate on one of the most important consumer issues of our time.\n  There are groups such as the AARP that have brought to the attention \nof every Senator what this means for their members. This is what people \nare talking about in coffee shops. They are talking about it in \ncommunity centers. They are talking about it all across the country \nbecause they think when you have a program that has 43 million people, \nbe the smartest shopper you possibly can.\n  We have the private plans out there already. The Baucus proposal--and \nI want to emphasize this--does not restrict the role of those private \nplans. It is going to go forward.\n  The question is, Should we make it possible for the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to complement that role, to go beyond it and \nto say there may be some instances where we ought to negotiate? I voted \nfor the Medicare prescription drug program. I do not support the idea \nof Government running everything in American health care, but it is \ntime to right a wrong. This particular provision, which restricts the \nSecretary from ever negotiating, is an example of special interest \noverreaching.\n  The Senate ought to say today: We want to proceed to a real debate, \nnot this abridged version where only a handful of Senators could \nparticipate. I am glad I could correct the record so that as we go to \nthe vote, Senators understand that this bill is not the House bill, \nthat this bill will not restrict the private plans, and it will not \nrestrict access for seniors to medications. I urge our colleagues to \nvote for the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one of the biggest flaws in the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit is that it does not adequately address the \nskyrocketing prices of prescription drugs. By denying the Government \nthe ability to negotiate price discounts, the benefit actually takes \naway one of the best tools the Medicare Program could use in bringing \ndown prescription drug prices.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of legislation that would help address \nthis fundamental flaw. The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation \nAct, S. 3, will remove language included in the Medicare Modernization \nAct that prohibits the Secretary of Health and\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nHuman Services from negotiating prescription drug prices with \nmanufacturers. The legislation goes a step further to require much \nneeded data that would set the stage for additional legislation to \nstrengthen negotiation in the future. This bill is something that the \nentire Senate should support, and I am disappointed that the Senate is \nbeing prevented from even debating, let alone voting on, this important \nbill.\n  When I talk about the new Medicare prescription drug benefit during \nmy travels around my home State of Wisconsin, I continually hear from \nconstituents about how they cannot believe that the Federal Government \ncannot negotiate with pharmaceutical companies about the prices of \nprescription drugs.\n  We need to help Medicare beneficiaries obtain affordable prescription \ndrugs while still ensuring the Federal Government keeps prescription \ndrug costs down. By lowering the underlying cost of prescription drugs \noffered through the Medicare Program, we will not only be helping \nbeneficiaries save money, but we will also save the Federal Government \nmoney.\n  In a time of mushrooming deficits, skyrocketing prescription drug \ncosts and an aging population, we need to be smart about how we use \ntaxpayer dollars. If we are going to keep Medicare solvent, we need to \ntake strong action to keep health care costs down, especially the \nincreasing costs of the prescription drugs the new Medicare Program \nwill be providing. This is the fiscally responsible thing to do, and it \nis also the compassionate thing to do as keeping drugs affordable \nensures access to prescriptions for 43 million seniors.\n  I support this legislation, but I also support an even stronger step. \nIt makes sense at this time to impose a mandate on the Secretary of HHS \nto negotiate lower prices. The Secretary should also have the right \ntools to negotiate effectively.\n  This bill doesn't address formulary or price control authority for \nthe Secretary. An ideal bill would at least examine these issues \nclosely, yet these are not mentioned. Formulary power and price \ncontrols in Medicare Part D should be debated in the near future, and \nthe reports required in S. 3 will provide needed information for that \ndebate.\n  So while I would like a stronger bill today, I support today's \nlegislation because it is a giant step forward from where we are today. \nI hope my colleagues who are currently blocking this important \nlegislation will reconsider their actions.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss an issue that is \non the minds of millions of seniors--prescription drug access and \npricing. I am here to defend Medicare Part D and the importance of \ncompetitive drug pricing, because it works.\n  Prescription drugs play a vital role in our health care system. \nThanks to technological and scientific breakthroughs in \npharmaceuticals, Americans are living longer and more productive lives \nthan ever before.\n  There has been a remarkable rise in pharmaceutical drug access to our \nNation's citizens. A generation ago, there were nowhere near as many \nprescription drugs available--today, there are effective drugs on the \nmarket that help people do just about anything. From drugs that reduce \nblood pressure and fight uncommon bacterial infections, to others that \nlower stress and protect immune systems in the fight against cancer, \nthere has never been a time in history like this.\n  Members of Congress have--over the last decade or so--made many \nefforts to extend prescription drug access to as many Americans as \npossible, specifically seniors. The expense has been significant, but \nso have the results. This improvement to prescription drug access is \ndue in large part to Medicare Part D.\n  The Medicare Part D prescription drug program has been successfully \nreducing drug costs for seniors, and as long as we leave it alone and \nlet it run as it was intended to, millions of Americans will continue \nto benefit--this was the goal and the goal is being met.\n  I strongly oppose any efforts to repeal the noninterference clause, \nand I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, however, are moving to \neliminate the noninterference clause--written into the Medicare \nModernization Act, MMA--which, in layman's terms, means that some \nMembers of Congress would like to give the Government the ability to \nnegotiate drug prices on behalf of consumers. Proponents of this move \nbelieve that Government negotiation of drug prices would lead to lower \nprices for the millions of Americans in need of prescription drugs. Yet \nthat is not the full picture. The reality is that there is no proof \nthat eliminating noninterference would reduce costs for seniors in need \nof low-cost prescription drugs; in fact, there is a chance that this \napproach could limit senior access to certain types of prescription \ndrugs--this is because, in Government negotiating of drug prices, \ncompetition will be eliminated. This is to say that certain drug \ncompanies will simply back away from the table and choose not to \nparticipate.\n  As you can see, Government negotiation will not benefit the consumer. \nIt actually hurts the consumer because it limits what prescription \ndrugs are available to them.\n  For that reason, I feel strongly that moving in this direction and \nhaving this debate is not the best use of the Senate's time. Why are we \ndebating a program that has been successful in providing drug coverage \nfor our seniors and has done so while costing less than anticipated? \nOur seniors have a choice in their plans, and they are pleased with \nthose options. We should be using this time to focus on those who lack \nany healthcare options. I am talking about the millions of uninsured \npeople in this country.\n  My colleagues and I should be talking about ways to give these \nindividuals a chance for health care coverage. We need to further \nexamine the Tax Code and fix its glaring inequities. The Tax Code needs \nto be unbiased; where you work should not affect how much you pay for \nhealth care coverage or what kind of health care options you have.\n  Why can't all American workers--whether they work for a Fortune 500 \ncompany or the local bakery they started from scratch--have the ability \nto purchase health insurance with pretax dollars?\n  My bill, the TEA Act, will allow just that. Why aren't we talking \nabout that?\n  What about Senator Coburn's Universal Health Care Choice and Access \nAct--why aren't we talking about that? His bill will help transform our \nhealth care system to one that focuses on prevention and helps to \nreestablish the doctor-patient relationship, while also empowering \nindividuals to choose where their care is delivered.\n  I encourage us to get past this time-consuming and unnecessary Part D \ndebate and turn toward issues that are in need of solutions. From the \nuninsured, to future budget insolvency, to the global war on terror, \nthere is plenty--of substance--to discuss.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I wish to speak in opposition to the \nbill currently before the Senate.\n  First I would like to briefly review the status of the new Medicare \nlaw that Congress passed in November of 2003. That landmark legislation \nenacted the first major benefit expansion of the program since 1965 and \nplaced increased emphasis on the private sector to deliver and manage \nbenefits. It created a new voluntary outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit to be administered by private entities. The legislation also \nexpanded covered preventive services and created a specific process for \noverall program review if general revenue spending exceeded a specified \nthreshold.\n  I am pleased to be able to report that this new program is working. \nAll across the country, seniors are expressing their approval of the \nnew benefit. In my State of Wyoming, the new Part D prescription drug \nbenefit has been a huge success. Last year, I traveled around Wyoming \nand visited with seniors in Cheyenne, Douglas, Sheridan, Casper, \nPowell, and Rock Springs. I talked to folks all over the State and told \nthem about the new program as I encouraged them to sign up for it. I \nalso talked to a few of the pharmacists in Wyoming that worked so hard \nto make this program a success. I believe I can speak on behalf of many \nof my colleagues in saying thank you to the thousands of pharmacists \nthroughout the country that did so much to implement this great \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\n  Today, about 89 percent of Wyoming seniors are receiving prescription \ndrug coverage, an increase of 16 percent from last year. They remember \nwhat it used to be like when they tried to get their prescription \nmedications and they don't want to go back. I have received hundreds of \ncalls and letters from Wyoming seniors who like the way things are and \ndon't want Congress interfering with their prescription drug plan \nbecause it is working for them. Five separate surveys show that more \nthan 75 percent of all beneficiaries are satisfied with the way the \nprogram works.\n  Not only are about 90 percent of seniors now receiving prescription \ndrugs, the program is costing less than originally expected. When is \nthe last time a government program cost less than was estimated? I came \nto Washington in 1997, 10 years ago, and I don't know that I have ever \nseen a government program that spent less money than we expected. \nPrivate competition is working better than we envisioned and it is \nsaving seniors and the government more and more money every day. Why \nshould we change that?\n  For some reason my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ndecided they need to ``fix'' a program that isn't broken. We have \nimplemented a plan that is working and before we change it, we need to \nbe sure about what we are doing and the effect it will have on the \nprogram and the impact it will ultimately have on seniors from coast to \ncoast.\n  The bill now before the Senate would strike the noninterference \nclause from the Medicare law. The ``noninterference'' language in the \nMedicare law prevents the Federal Government from fixing prices on \nMedicare drugs or placing nationwide limits on the drugs that will be \navailable to seniors and the disabled. I support this language \n100 percent. Decisions on what drugs should be available should be made \nby seniors and their doctors, not by some central committee in \nWashington.\n\n  Under the Medicare Part D law, each prescription drug plan has its \nown list of preferred drugs. Each plan's list is different--some are \nbroader, some are narrower. Each list, however, has at least two drugs \nfrom each therapeutic class of medications and everyone can find a plan \nthat is advantageous to them.\n  The ``noninterference'' bill before us is not only unnecessary, but \nit could also prove to be harmful to the health of our nation's \nseniors. The ``noninterference'' language protects seniors and the \ndisabled from having the government decide which drugs their doctors \ncan prescribe. It maintains the sacred relationships that seniors have \nwith their doctors, who know best about what particular drugs are right \nfor their patients. Patients support this language, and they want us to \nmaintain it.\n  I would like to repeat, we have already implemented a plan that is \nworking. Yet the majority party wants to ``fix'' the Medicare drug \nbenefit. It is ironic to me that they use the word ``fix''--fix is \nexactly what this bill will lead to, the government ``fixing'' prices \non drugs. It is not a bill about negotiating prices; it is a bill about \nfixing prices. As most Americans know, the Government doesn't negotiate \nin the Medicare program. It sets the prices that the Government will \npay doctors and hospitals for serving seniors.\n  Setting the price is the same as price controls. And we saw what \nhappened in the 1970s when we tried to control the price of gasoline. \nDo you remember the long lines at the gas pumps? Trying to control the \nprice of gasoline was a complete disaster. Let's not experiment with \ngiving government the ability to control the prices of prescription \ndrugs.\n  Despite what some folks are reporting, the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office has said over and over again that removing this language \nwould not save the Government or seniors any money. It wouldn't save \nmoney because the Medicare prescription drug plans will have strong \nincentives to negotiate drug price discounts that would be as low--or \nlower--than anything the Government could negotiate. Additionally, many \nplans represent more people than Medicare, Medicaid, or the Veterans \nAdministration, so the plans have greater purchasing power than the \nGovernment. To effectively negotiate, you need competing products, or \nyou have to be willing to do without one of the products on which you \nare negotiating.\n  How many times does the Congressional Budget Office have to say that \nthis bill will not save the Government any money before it starts to \nsink in? When will my friends on the other side of the aisle \nacknowledge that this bill will not save any money?\n  We do, however, know of something that will save the Federal \nGovernment and seniors money--competition among private plans. What has \nbeen proven to reduce costs--especially for seniors with low incomes--\nis the new Medicare drug benefit that we passed in 2003.\n  The competition among private plans is driving the cost of the \nprogram down. The average monthly premium has dropped by 42 percent, \nfrom an estimated $38 to $22--and there is a plan available in every \nstate for less than $20 a month. So let me suggest letting competition \nwork to drive the prices even lower instead of instituting government \nprice controls that have failed in the past.\n\n  Also, because the program has choice, if the price of one plan goes \nup, beneficiaries can switch plans. It is important to remember that \nsometimes the prices will go up, because medical costs will go up as \nlong as new technologies are invented that allow people to live longer, \nhealthier lives.\n  Democrats want to change Part D to resemble the drug benefit program \nof the Veterans Administration. In the VA system, the Government sets a \nprice on a drug it can get at the cheapest rate and limits or restricts \naccess to those it can not get at cheap rates. As a result, the VA \nbenefit excludes three out of four drugs available through Part D. \nChanging the Medicare Program to be as restrictive as the VA system is \ncompletely illogical.\n  Another thing about the VA system is that it can take a long time for \nnew drugs to be included on the formulary--sometimes as long as 3 \nyears. Let me repeat that. It can take as long as 3 years for new, \nlife-saving drugs to be included on the VA formulary.\n  Lastly, the VA owns the whole system, so you have to order your drugs \nfrom them or you have to fill your prescriptions at one of 350 \ngovernment-run facilities nationwide. In contrast, seniors signing up \nfor a Medicare prescription drug plan can choose their plan based on \nthe pharmacy they want to use to fill their prescriptions. As a result \nof all of these things, more than 1 million retired veterans have \nsigned up for Medicare in the last year. I talked to many veterans in \nWyoming and they all told me that they signed up for Medicare Part D so \nthey could finally get the drugs they needed that they couldn't get \nfrom the VA.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nmake the Medicare Program more like the VA program. They want to take \naway a senior's ability to choose. The real thing we should be talking \nabout is how we can change the VA program to be more like Medicare Part \nD.\n  The mark also contains a few other provisions relating to the \ncomparative effectiveness of prescription drugs--a study that \ndetermines whether drug A is better than drug B at treating a disease. \nThe mark also contains a provision authorizing consideration of \ncomparative clinical effectiveness studies in developing and reviewing \nformularies under the Medicare prescription drug program. No surprise \nhere, but the Congressional Budget Office stated no savings will result \nbecause of this section.\n  This is the first step of a dance the Democrats want to do called \n``cutting in on the relationship between doctors and patients.'' \nDecisions about what drugs patients should take should be made by \ndoctors and patients. I think we should keep the Government out of the \nexam room.\n  To close, I would just like to remind folks of a few key points: (1) \nThe Medicare Program is working. More seniors are getting the drugs \nthey need at lower costs. (2) The bill before the Senate tries to \n``fix'' something that isn't broken. (3) This bill will take away the \nchoices seniors have about the drugs they use. (4) The Congressional \nBudget Office has stated several times that this bill will not produce \nany savings. (5) The bill tries to make the Medicare Program more like \nthe Veterans program, but the Veterans program has\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nfewer choices than the Medicare Program)--that is why over one million \nveterans have signed up for the Medicare Program.\n  We don't need meddling for the sake of meddling or a new system \nconjured up for political convenience. Let's stop wasting the time of \nthis important body and move to a bill that can actually do some good \nfor the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed in leader time.\n  I rise in opposition to the effort to roll back the remarkable \nsuccess of a prescription drug benefit that American seniors have been \nwaiting for for decades and which millions of them now enjoy.\n  Republicans strongly oppose this effort to tamper with a program that \nis working extraordinarily well by every conceivable measure. In \nstanding against those who would end it, we are standing up for the 32 \nmillion seniors in this country who enthusiastically support this \nterrific life-changing benefit.\n  But before I explain our reasons, I want to thank Senator Grassley, \nwho has been an extraordinarily effective leader on the Finance \nCommittee, who has been right in the middle of this issue, going back \nto its formative stages in 2003, and has made a very articulate and \npersuasive case today for not tampering with this extraordinarily \nsuccessful program.\n  Having said that, let's get right to the point. Republicans are on \nthe side of seniors on this issue. There is simply no doubt about this. \nThe only thing in question is why Democrats would even think about \nmeddling with a drug benefit that has 92 percent coverage, 80 percent \nsatisfaction, and which costs more than 30 percent--more than 30 \npercent--less than even the most daring bean counters estimated when we \npassed the bill.\n  Seniors who signed up for this benefit are saving an average of \n$1,200 a year on the cost of medicine, and taxpayers are saving \nbillions--billions--$265 billion over the next 10 years less than \nanticipated.\n  Now, I ask everyone--anyone--in this Chamber: When was the last time \na Government program came in under budget?\n  For those of you who may be watching on C-SPAN, that quietness was \nthe sound of crickets and tumbleweed you just heard echoing from the \nSenate Chamber because I doubt a single Government program in modern \nhistory, let alone one this big and this important, has ever--ever--\ncome in under budget. So it is a mystery why our Democratic friends \nwould want to tamper with this Medicare benefit. If it isn't broke, why \nbreak it?\n  Now, the refrain we keep hearing from the other side is that we need \ncompetition, that drug prices will be even lower if we allow the \nGovernment to bargain for lower prices. Unfortunately, that is not \ntrue. The impartial Congressional Budget Office just sent us a letter \nsaying there would be zero--that is zero--savings if Government stepped \nin and interfered with the current system. They sent the same letter to \na Republican-controlled Congress last year.\n  The reason is simple. Prices have plummeted under Part D precisely \nbecause we have let private drug benefit managers, who already \nnegotiate, into a Government drug program for the first time. They do \nthe negotiating for us, and it is a good thing because they have much \nmore leverage than we do. The three biggest drug negotiators, in fact, \nhave four times as many members as the entire Medicare population.\n  Let me say that again. The three biggest drug negotiators have four \ntimes as many members as the entire Medicare population.\n  Look, you don't have to be a Milton Friedman to see that bigger \nnegotiators are going to get better prices, and that is what we have \nright now with these drug benefit managers. Yet the other side wants to \nsend a Medicare team to the negotiating table--a population with one-\nfourth the negotiating power. That is like sending a Little League \npitcher up to the big leagues and handing him the ball for the big \ngame. We already have aces on the mound, and they don't need any \nrelief.\n  The point is, Republicans favor negotiation and competition, and our \nDemocratic friends oppose it. Just look at the numbers. They speak for \nthemselves. There is no way we could have achieved these savings if \nmarket competition and negotiation weren't at play. Secretary Leavitt \nsaid it pretty clearly just yesterday:\n\n       There is rigorous, aggressive negotiation taking place \n     right now.\n\n  That is why we are seeing such success and satisfaction with this \nprogram. But let's assume just for the sake of argument that price \nisn't an issue. Let's take price off the table for a moment. What about \nchoice? What about choice? Here, too, Republicans are on the side of \nseniors. The VA model the Democrats are for some reason enamored with \nis inflexible and restrictive. It excludes three out of four drugs \navailable through Part D, including some of the most innovative \ntreatments for arthritis, high cholesterol, breast cancer, and other \nailments. Veterans who want cutting-edge drugs like Crestor or Revlimid \nhave to go elsewhere or they have to go without. The choice that 1 \nmillion of them have already made is to join the Part D Program--more \nthan a third of them have signed up for the program over the last few \nyears.\n  So let's sum it up. This seniors prescription drug benefit is \npopular. It is reaching millions of seniors. It is saving us billions \nof dollars. Veterans who have been using the program that our friends \non the other side want us to imitate are signing up for this one in \ndroves.\n  No wonder the former Democratic majority leader, Senator Daschle, and \nPresident Clinton's Health Secretary were all for creating a program \nsuch as Part D before suddenly our friends on the other side decided to \noppose it.\n  This debate is hardly worth having. The facts are plain. Tens of \nmillions of seniors in this country have a great drug benefit program--\ncheap, comprehensive, and easy to use. Republicans aren't going to let \nanybody fool with them.\n  I strongly oppose cloture on the motion to proceed and urge my \ncolleagues to vote likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: Our side \nhas 2 minutes to close; am I correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. As one who voted to establish the Medicare prescription \ndrug program and believes in bipartisanship, my message today to \ncolleagues on the other side and on this side is this: We can do \nbetter.\n  There are patients who are enrolled in this program--enrolled right \nnow--who are heart transplant patients and patients suffering from \ncancer, who, while enrolled in the program, are seeing their medicines \ngo up hundreds of dollars--hundreds and hundreds of dollars in 1 month. \nThey are enrolled in this program that I have voted for.\n  I say to my colleagues, let us look at ways to do better. The private \nplans are going to continue to take the lead. This measure does not \npreempt the work of those private plans. But in the name of those \nseniors who are enrolled in this program, who are seeing their bills go \nup hundreds of dollars a month right now, let us not pass up the \nopportunity to do better.\n  If we don't vote for cloture and go to this bill, we will not even \nhave a debate in the Senate on an issue with such immediate life-and-\ndeath implications for our people, and I simply think that is wrong. I \nwish to make this program better. I wish to make sure we take advantage \nof every opportunity to do that.\n  I urge our colleagues, in the name of seniors who are enrolled in the \nprogram today and are having difficulty paying their bills, to vote for \ncloture. Let us have a real debate on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4633-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider that vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed by the Senate's \nfailure to consider a bill that would have placed the needs of seniors \nahead of the profits of the health industry. Once again, a minority of \nthe Senate has allowed the power and the profits of the pharmaceutical \nindustry to trump good policy and the will of the American people.\n  We have a major crisis in this Nation, and that is the rising cost of \nhealth care. Over the last century, the Nation has witnessed tremendous \nadvances in medical science and technology, and we now have treatments \nand cures for diseases and conditions that were at one time surely \nfatal.\n  Yet we are paying the price for this success. Health care, \nparticularly the cost of drugs, is becoming increasingly unaffordable. \nOver the last decade the cost of drugs has quintupled, now totaling \nalmost $200 billion. In 2005, the drug companies' profit was 16 percent \nof their revenues, compared to only 6 percent for all Fortune 500 \nfirms. The total profit of the top 7 U.S. based drug companies was $34 \nbillion in 2004, and, if you add it up, their CEOs were paid $91 \nmillion that same year. Clearly, the new drug benefit in Medicare has \nbeen a tremendous boon for the drug companies, adding to these extreme \nprofits.\n  The growth in the cost of drugs has slowed in recent years, in part \nbecause of greater use of generic drugs. But given the pricetag, and \nthe financial challenges of our health care system, we can--and must--\ntake additional steps to curb how much we are spending on drugs.\n  Allowing the Federal Government to negotiate for lower drug prices in \nthe Medicare Program would have been an important step forward in this \nregard. When you look at the prices the Federal Government has \nnegotiated for our veterans and military men and women, it is clear \nthat the government can--and should--use its leverage to lower prices \nfor our seniors as well.\n  Drug negotiation is the smart thing to do and the right thing to do, \nand it is unconscionable that we were not able to take up this bill \ntoday.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I speak today in outrage that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to block S. 3, \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, from coming to \nthe floor.\n  You meet a lot of people when you campaign for a seat in this \nesteemed body. You meet people of all ages, from all socioeconomic \nlevels, from all ethnic and cultural backgrounds, liberal and \nconservative, rural and urban, healthy and ailing--you meet them all. \nThese individuals bring personal voices to national issues. They \neducate us with their stories, and they trust us to be stewards of \ntheir experiences. I am sure my fellow freshman Senators will agree \nwith me when I say that listening to these stories was the best part of \nrunning for U.S. Senate.\n  Sometimes these stories are uplifting tales about the triumphs of \ngovernment: SCHIP providing health insurance to at-risk children, \nAmeriCorps helping young people serve communities throughout the \nNation, The Family and Medical Leave Act allowing parents, spouses, and \nchildren the time to care for loved ones. But sometimes these stories \nare just the opposite--depressing, discouraging, disheartening tales of \nhow the government has failed in its duty to support and safeguard our \nmust vulnerable citizens.\n  I have hosted community dinners throughout my State. Some of the very \nsaddest stories that Rhode Islanders shared with me were about their \nexperiences with the Part D drug benefit. I would like to share with \nyou a particularly touching story from Travis, who came to one of my \ncommunity dinners in Woonsocket. Travis told me of his great-\ngrandmother, a woman over 90 who was living independently, in a second \nor third story walk-up apartment building in Woonsocket. She, like \nother women her age, had signed up for a Part D plan, and was taking a \nnumber of prescription medications. One day, Travis's great-grandmother \narrived at the pharmacy, only to be told that she was in the donut \nhole, that she would now be responsible for almost the entirety of her \ndrug bill. His great-grandmother called Travis in despair. She would no \nlonger be able to afford her apartment, or her independent lifestyle. \nShe was forced to choose between her spirit of self-reliance and her \nhealth.\n  This is a tragedy. It is a human tragedy because no human being \nshould be forced to choose between her dignity and her life, and it is \na moral tragedy because this is a totally unnecessary choice. The \nCongressional Budget Office concludes that the privatization of the \ndrug benefit--the choice not to simply add the drug program onto the \nestablished Medicare benefit--costs almost $5 billion a year. The \nCenter for\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nEconomic and Policy Research reveals that the combined cost of \nprivatization and failure to negotiate prices is more than $30 billion \na year. I do not know about you, Mr. President, but I cannot look \nTravis in the eye and tell him that the reason his great-grandmother \ncannot afford her apartment is that the government needed to give it to \npharmaceutical manufacturers, an industry that, in 2004, was three \ntimes more profitable than the median for all Fortune 500 companies--an \nindustry that from 1995 to 2002 was the most profitable industry in the \nentire country.\n  I was not in the Senate when the drug benefit was created. I was not \nprivy to the debates that went on here regarding the complexities and \nparticulars of the bill. But I have a very hard time understanding how, \nwith a successful Federal drug benefit model in place at the VA, this \nbody created a new program that pays, on average, 70 percent more for \ndrugs than the existing VA program, according to the Center for \nEconomic and Policy Research. I understand that there are fundamental \ndifferences between the Veterans population and the senior population, \nbetween the Veterans system and the Medicare system, but 70 percent? \nThis seems, to me, like a de-evolution of the policy making process. We \nare creating new programs that function less effectively and less \nefficiently than the ones we already had in place.\n  The real question is why. Have we gained something valuable for this \nextra cost? Can we justify the expensive and byzantine architecture of \nthis program based on the promotion of other values? Some of my \ncolleagues argue that the Part D drug benefit maximizes choice, and \nthat choice is of fundamental importance in health insurance markets. \nIndeed, the bill succeeds here. In 2006, there were nearly 1,500 \nprescription drug plans offered throughout the Nation. Beneficiaries in \n46 States had over 40 plans to choose from. This year, seniors \neverywhere in the country can choose between at least 45 plans. In my \nsmall state of Rhode Island alone, there will be 51 plans available.\n  But study after study, survey after survey, has shown us that, beyond \na reasonable point, more plans do not add up to beneficiary or provider \nsatisfaction. In fact, 73 percent of seniors think the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit is ``too complicated.'' Sixty percent agree \nwith the statement, ``Medicare should select a handful of plans that \nmeet certain standards, so seniors have an easier time choosing.'' \nThirty-three percent think it is ``somewhat difficult'' or ``very \ndifficult'' to enroll in a plan. In addition, 91 percent of pharmacists \nand 92 percent of doctors think the benefit is too complicated. It is \ntime to admit that a plethora of plans does not add value to the \nprogram; it adds bewilderment and burden.\n  And do we have a system in place to deal with the confusion we have \ncaused? No. We have 1-800-Medicare, which is adequate at its best, and \ninaccurate, unreliable, or altogether unreachable at its worst. But we \nneed not rely on anecdotal evidence. GAO itself placed 500 calls to the \nMedicare help line in the middle of last year to make its own \ndetermination about the usefulness of the feature. Eighteen percent of \ncalls received inaccurate responses, 8 percent of the responses were \ninappropriate given the question posed, 5 percent of the calls ended in \ndisconnection, and 3 percent of responses were incomplete. In total, \none-third of calls placed by GAO in this study were handled in an \nunacceptable fashion. Our mechanism to demystify the drug benefit for \nthe average consumer is furthering the confusion of one-third of \ncallers. This is a catastrophe.\n  A second value that some of my colleagues argue excuses the \nconvoluted and costly nature of the drug benefit, is expanded coverage. \nMore seniors have drug coverage now than they did before January 2006. \nNo one disputes this. But insurance is not insurance unless it is there \nfor you when you really need it. Our sicker seniors are reporting far \nmore problems getting their prescription drugs than our healthy seniors \nare. Over 40 percent of seniors who describe themselves as in ``fair'' \nor ``poor'' health report problems filling a prescription under their \nPart D coverage, while only 12 percent of seniors in ``excellent'' or \n``very good'' health report a problem. If Part D is failing to help the \nsick, it is failing to meet the basic definition of insurance.\n  Do I mean to say that providing some coverage is worse than being \nuninsured? No. But that was not the option on the table in 2003. We had \nthe option to provide everyone with excellent coverage. We had the \noption to care equally and comprehensively for every elderly person in \nthis country, healthy, sick, or in between. We did not. Instead, we \nchose to write checks to the pharmaceutical industry, we chose to write \nchecks to private insurers, and we left our seniors to write their own.\n  What, then, can we do to fix this broken benefit? There is a lot we \ncan do, and today is the first step. Today, we can allow the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug companies \nto lower prices for consumers. We can require the collection of data \nfrom prescription drug plans, so that our experts at CRS, at CBO, at \nGAO, or at MedPAC can better understand the operations of this program. \nWe can require CBO to study whether or not market competition is truly \nreducing prices, as was the intent of privatization. We can increase \ntransparency for our seniors, by making the prices of covered drugs \navailable to the public on the CMS website. We can pass S. 3--the only \nthing standing in our way is Republican obstructionism.\n  I thank the majority leader and Senator Baucus for their commitment \nto our Nation's seniors, and I hope that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will drop their obstructionist tactics and let us get \nto work on this bill. As important as it is, it is only a first step to \nfixing our Medicare Part D program. I hope we can soon take that step \nand then move on to the broader issues, for I believe there is much, \nmuch more to be done.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I voted for cloture to cut off debate on \nthe motion to proceed because I think that the Senate should proceed to \ngive full consideration to the proposed legislation which would \nauthorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with \nthe pharmaceutical companies under Medicare Part D coverage. In the \npast, I have favored such proposals because of the argument that the \nSecretary's bargaining power would result in lower negotiated prices.\n  In light of the conclusion by the Congressional Budget Office in a \nletter dated April 10, 2007 from Director Peter R. Orszag to Chairman \nMax Baucus that the new authority to the Secretary ``would have a \nnegligible effect on federal spending because we anticipate that under \nthe bill the Secretary would lack the leverage to negotiate prices \nacross the broad range of covered Part D drugs that are more favorable \nthan those obtained by PDPs [prescription drug plans] under current \nlaw,'' I have reviewed the negotiation process under existing laws.\n  The underlying facts are that the pharmacy benefit managers who \nnegotiate prices for the prescription drug plans represent \nsubstantially more people than the Secretary would under Part D. For \nexample, Medco represents 62 million people, Caremark represents 80 \nmillion and Wellpoint represents 30 million, contrasted to the 29 \nmillion people covered under Medicare Part D. Accordingly, it may be \nthat the pharmacy benefit managers have even greater leverage than the \nSecretary would if the Secretary were authorized to negotiate prices. \nThat is not certain because the negotiations between the pharmacy \nbenefit managers and the pharmaceutical companies are conducted on a \nconfidential basis, so that it is not known with certainty that the \nlowest prices are obtained or that the cost savings are all passed on \nto the prescription drug plans.\n  The latest Congressional Budget Office estimate for Part D costs is \n$388 billion below the original estimates, for the 10-year period from \nfiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2016. That suggests the current system \nis working well.\n  Extended Senate floor deliberation would provide an opportunity to \ndebate these issues and obtain greater detail on the facts.\n  One of the additional arguments favoring giving the Secretary power \nto negotiate was the analogy to the savings achieved through the \nnegotiating power of the Department of Veterans Affairs. In analyzing \nthe VA's bargaining power, it must be noted that the Veterans \nDepartment represents 4.4\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\nmillion veterans, a much smaller number than represented by the \npharmacy benefit managers. It is also important to note that among \nbrand-name drugs listed on the 300 most popular drugs for seniors, only \n42 percent are available to the VA plan because the pharmaceutical \ncompanies declined to provide some of the drugs because of their \nunwillingness to meet the price determined unilaterally by the VA. On \nthe other hand, it is estimated that PDPs under Medicare Part D have \naccess to 97 percent of the brandname drugs among the most favored 300 \ndrugs. The Medicare Part D beneficiaries have an opportunity to select \nthe prescription drug plans that best meet their prescription drug \nneeds, with the opportunity to select a new plan on an annual basis.\n  Notwithstanding these factors, there may be answers and compelling \narguments in support of the proposed legislation to give the Secretary \nnegotiating authorities. A full debate by the Senate on these important \nissues would pose the opportunity to resolve these complicated \nquestions and come to a reasoned judgment. The Senate will doubtless \nrevisit this issue in the future. In the interim, I intend to inquire \nfurther and consider these issues in greater depth to determine what \npolicies would best serve the interests of the beneficiaries of \nMedicare Part D.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4636-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4636-S4653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COURT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSpecter, prior to a vote on a motion to proceed to S. 378.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week we join in mourning the tragic \nkillings at Virginia Tech on Monday. The innocent lives of students and \nprofessors are a terrible loss for their families and friends and for \ntheir community. It affects us all. We honor them and mourn their loss. \nI expect that in the days ahead, as we learn more about what happened, \nhow it happened and perhaps why it happened, we will have debate and \ndiscussion and perhaps legislative proposals to consider.\n  For example, I know that Senator Boxer has introduced a School Safety \nEnhancement Act, S. 677, to allow matching grants for school security, \nincluding surveillance equipment, hotlines and tip lines and other \nmeasures.\n  We may need to further enhance the COPS in Schools Program begun by \nPresident Clinton. I look forward to working with Regina Schofield, the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs at the \nDepartment of Justice, Domingo Herraiz, the Director of the Bureau of \nJustice Assistance, and others to make improvements that can increase \nthe safety and security of our children and grandchildren in schools \nand colleges.\n  Today, we may finally make progress on security in another important \nsetting by turning to the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, S. \n378. Frankly, this legislation should have been enacted last year but \nwas not. It should not be a struggle to enact these measures to improve \ncourt security. We are fortunate that we have not suffered another \nviolent assault on judges and their families.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I concur with the statements by the \nchairman. We introduced court security during the 109th Congress after \nwe had the brutal murders of the family of a Federal judge in Chicago. \nWe have continuing problems. Rat poison was mailed to each of the nine \nJustices on the Supreme Court. There is no doubt that there is an \nurgent need for additional court security, in light of the attacks on \nthe judges. The independence of our judiciary is fundamental in our \nsociety for the rule of law.\n  This bill passed by unanimous consent last December, but, \nunfortunately, it was not taken up by the House. We ought to consider \nit expeditiously, and I urge my colleagues to vote to invoke cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, pursuant \nto rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture \nmotion, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 107, S. 378, the Court Security \n     Improvement Bill.\n         Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, Chuck Schumer, Jack Reed, \n           Byron L.

On this vote, the yeas are 93, the \nnays are 3. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the motion to proceed has just passed, \n93 to 3. We will bring before the Senate in fairly short order the \nCourt Security Improvement Act of 2007. I rise today to speak in \nsupport of that act. It is a bill that is as simple as it is important.\n  At a time when judges are the subject of sometimes vitriolic \ncriticism, when judges and their families have been made the targets of \nacts of violence and murder, when the independence of the judiciary \nmust be maintained in a climate of violence, we should take these \nimportant steps to improve the safety of our judges and their families. \nThis bill will do that by requiring the U.S. Marshals Service--which \nhas oversight over the safety of the judicial branch--to consult with \nthe Judicial Conference to determine security requirements of the \njudicial branch, and it authorizes $20 million for the Marshals Service \nto protect the judiciary further.\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\n  The bill also amends the Criminal Code to enhance penalties for the \npossession of dangerous weapons within Federal court facilities. This \nbill also extends and expands to family members the authority of the \nJudicial Conference to redact certain information from a judge's \nmandatory financial disclosure for security purposes.\n  The bill directs the Attorney General to report to Congress on the \nsecurity of assistant U.S. attorneys arising from the prosecution of \nterrorists and violent gangs. I will speak in a moment to an incident \nthat happened in my State.\n  The bill will increase criminal penalties for tampering with or \nretaliating against a witness, victim or informant, and it will \nauthorize grant programs to expand witness and victim protection \nprograms.\n  In my own experience as U.S. attorney in Rhode Island, I have been \nthe subject of threats. Indeed, one man went to prison for threatening \nme. Prosecutors whom I sent to court we had fitted with body armor \nbecause of the security to their personal safety. We had prosecutors \nhave extensive security systems installed in their homes to protect \ntheir security. That is one experience from one U.S. attorney in one 4-\nyear term. Across this country, the need is very great.\n  In February, the Judiciary Committee held an important hearing where \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy spoke to us about the need to \npreserve an independent judicial branch and to pass this bill. U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge Brock Hornby also had important testimony \nregarding the need to pass this legislation. He said: ``This bill will \ncontribute significantly to the security of Federal judges and their \nfamilies.''\n  In short, it is long past time that this bill be enacted. Indeed, the \ncore provisions of this bill have already passed the Senate twice last \nyear, the second time by unanimous consent. So it is a little \nsurprising that it is not being approved by unanimous consent at this \ntime. But apparently some of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have lodged an objection. Nevertheless, I am happy to spend \nwhatever time is necessary to ensure passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  The Framers of our Constitution understood the importance of an \nindependent judiciary. As Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist 78: \n``The independence of judges is equally requisite to guard the \nConstitution and the rights of individuals . . . ''\n  While in this Chamber we may disagree on judicial nominations and we \nmay argue over judicial philosophies, we should all, every one of us, \nagree to do everything we can to make sure the men and women who work \nin the judicial branch, who serve their communities in those important \npositions--and their families--are safe, as they make the important \ndecisions lodged in their care.\n  I am pleased this bill has broad bipartisan support. I am pleased \nwith the powerful results of the motion to proceed. I wish to commend \nparticularly the efforts of Chairman Leahy of the Judiciary Committee \nand our ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, for \ntheir hard work on this issue. I look forward to supporting passage of \nthis important legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Bipartisanship\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are a little over 100 days into the new \ncongressional session. With new leadership, new management, there was \nhope--and still is--that we can find some ways to establish bipartisan \ncooperation. By its nature, the Senate almost requires it. Under Senate \nrules, anything that is serious and important takes 60 votes. In a \nChamber with 100 Members, that is obviously a supermajority, and that \nrequires cooperation. When Senator Johnson has recovered to the point \nthat he is back on the Senate floor and we are at full complement, \nSenate Democrats will have 51 votes to the Republicans' 49. This means \nthat on any given day, if we are going to pass or consider important \nlegislation, it has to be bipartisan. We need help. We need Republicans \nto join with Democrats to bring it to 60 votes. That is the nature of \nthe Senate.\n  Some people, particularly House Members--I used to be one--look at \nthis as not only a quaint procedure but in many cases antiquated. I \ndisagree. The nature of the Senate is reflected in the wisdom of the \nFounding Fathers who needed to create this body in order to have a U.S. \nGovernment. When they initially suggested that Congress would reflect \nthe population of America, smaller States, such as those represented by \nthe Presiding Officer, the State of Rhode Island, said: We don't have a \nchance. We are going to be overwhelmed by the big States such as \nVirginia and Massachusetts. So in their wisdom, they said: In the \nSenate, every State has two Senators, no matter how large or small.\n  In the Senate, when it came to rules, the rules reflected the same \nfeeling, that minority rights would always be respected, that it would \ntake a large majority vote to overcome those minority rights; in other \nwords, 60 votes. At one time it was 67 votes. That 60-vote margin was \nadded in the 1960s. As a result, to achieve anything in the Senate, we \nneed to work together.\n  Unfortunately, in the first 100 days, there have been a few instances \nof cooperation but some other disappointing episodes. When we wanted to \ndebate and have a vote about President Bush's proposal to send 20 or \n30,000 more of our best and bravest American soldiers into the war in \nIraq, when we wanted the Senate to go on record on that issue to debate \nit honestly so the American people and their strong feelings would be \nrepresented, we were stopped, stopped by the Republican minority. They \nwould not allow us to go to the substance of that debate. They didn't \nwant the Senate to spend its time considering a resolution going on \nrecord as to whether we approve or disapprove of the President's \naction.\n  I personally think the escalation of ground troops in Iraq is the \nwrong decision. This is a civil war, a war between Sunnis and Shias. \nOur sons and daughters are caught in the crossfire of that civil war, a \nwar that is generated by a conflict within the Islamic religion that \ndates back 14 centuries. I don't believe sending 20 or 30 or 40,000 \nmore American soldiers is going to change the conflict. Only the Iraqis \ncan change it. I wanted to make that point in the debate and let those \nwho defend the President's position to escalate the war make their \npoint as well and bring it to a vote. That is what the Senate is \nsupposed to be about. But the Republican minority, with the power given \nthem under Senate rules, said: No, there will be no debate.\n  We couldn't find 60 votes to even have a debate on that issue. They \nstopped us. Earlier this week, they stopped us again. What was the \nmeasure in question? It was the reauthorization of the intelligence \nagencies of the Government. These agencies are critical to our national \nsecurity. Intelligence is the first line of defense when it comes to \nterrorism. Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia is chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee; Senator Chris Bond is the ranking \nRepublican. The two of them worked on a bipartisan bill and brought it \nto the Senate floor. There was a lot of give and take. Senator \nRockefeller acceded to the requests of Senator Bond and vice versa. \nThey brought this bill to the floor. For the first time in years, we \nwere going to have an authorization bill that addressed some of the \nserious problems of intelligence gathering so that we can be safer. \nWhat happened? As it turned out, the Republican leadership decided they \ndidn't want to have this debate. They didn't want this bill to be \nseriously considered and passed. On two different occasions this week, \nthey refused to vote to give us 60 votes so we could consider this bill \nand pass it. We had to put it back on the calendar, take it off the \nfloor.\n  Think about that. In the midst of a war in Iraq and Afghanistan, with \nall of the threats to the United States, a trip to an airport now \nbecomes a half-hour commitment. As you take off your shoes and make \nsure your toothpaste is in a plastic bag and all of the things we go \nthrough that relate to terrorism, the Republican minority decided they \ndidn't want us to debate and\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\nbring to a vote intelligence reauthorization. That was their decision.\n  For the second time, on a critical issue--first on the escalation of \nthe troops in Iraq and then on the reauthorization of our intelligence \nagencies--the Republican minority has said: We don't want the debate. \nWe don't want the Senate to act. It is within their power. That is what \nthe Senate is all about. A minority, in this case 49 Republican \nSenators, was able to stop it.\n  But that was not the end of it. There was another issue, one that \nmany of us consider to be very basic. It relates to the Medicare \nprescription Part D Program. Medicare prescription Part D is a program \nlong overdue. When Medicare was created by President Johnson in the \n1960s, it didn't include prescription drugs. Over the years, as more \nand better prescription drugs were discovered and invented and \nmarketed, we understood that to keep people healthy, our parents and \ngrandparents and disabled people needed access to affordable drugs.\n  For many years, many of us have supported the idea of including \nprescription drugs in the Medicare plan so seniors could have help in \npaying for them. When the bill came before us to vote on several years \nago, when the Republicans were in control of this body, we wanted to \nadd one provision. The one provision said the Medicare Program could \nbargain for less expensive, more affordable drugs. Private insurance \ncompanies could do the same, but the Medicare Program could offer \nprescription drugs to seniors on Medicare as one option, and then \nseniors could make a choice. Do they want to go with a private \ninsurance company? Do they want to go with some other source for their \nprescription drugs under Medicare? Or do they want to go back to the \nMedicare plan?\n  Our thinking behind it is sound, because what we said is: We learned \na lesson at the Veterans' Administration. In the Veterans' \nAdministration we learned that to reduce the cost of prescription drugs \nfor the men and women who serve in uniform and are now veterans, our \nVeterans' Administration bargains with pharmaceutical companies, and \nthey have bargaining power. They buy in bulk. They buy at discount. Our \nveterans benefit from it. They get the best at the lowest prices, and \nit is good for them and for taxpayers.\n  Why can't our seniors under Medicare have the same opportunity? That \nwas the point we wanted to make, a point that said: Medicare should be \nallowed to bargain bulk discounts, low prices for seniors so we can \ngive them even a better deal than the current program offers. The \npharmaceutical companies hate this idea like the devil hates holy \nwater. The notion that they would face competition, that they would \nhave to give bulk discounts, eats right into their profits, their \nbottom lines, and their CEOs' golden parachutes. They have been \nspending millions of dollars trying to convince America that this kind \nof bulk discount, this effort to have bargaining for lower prices, is \nsomehow fundamentally wrong. They have spent a lot of money on it--\nfull-page ads in newspapers, television advertising to try to convince \nAmericans that having some competition when it comes to prescription \ndrugs is plain wrong.\n  They didn't convince many, but they convinced enough, because earlier \nthis morning we had a vote as to whether we would move to this proposal \nto allow Medicare to bargain for lower prescription drugs and, once \nagain, the Republican minority stopped us. They don't want to have that \ndebate. They don't want to face a vote. They want to make sure their \nfriends in the pharmaceutical industry don't have to face competition. \nI am sure they feel their position is correct. I happen to believe my \nposition is correct.\n  The nature of debate in the Senate is that we stand and talk and \nultimately come to a vote. But on three separate occasions now, the \nRepublican leadership has stopped the debate, stopped the debate on \nescalating troops in Iraq, when it comes to intelligence \nreauthorization, and when we try to reduce prescription drug prices for \nseniors.\n  It seems they want to do nothing. They want the Senate to come in, \ncollect its paycheck, and go home; make a few speeches on the floor, \nwave a few flags, and head on home.\n  That is what happened around here for a long time. The do-nothing \nCongress of the last 2 years is the reason the voters came out and \nvoted as they did last November. They said: We sent you to Washington \nto do something. We sent you to Washington to address issues that are \nmeaningful and important to people across America. One of those issues \nis the war in Iraq. Another issue is homeland security. Certainly \nanother issue is the cost of health insurance and the cost of \nprescription drugs. In the Democratic majority, we have tried to come \nto those issues. We have tried to move the debate to those issues. But \nthe Republican minority has stopped us time and time again.\n  Ultimately, they will be held accountable for their strategy. That is \nwhat elections are all about. But we have a year and a half to go here, \na year and a half more before another election. Are we going to waste \nall this time? Are we going to spend a little time addressing the \nissues that count: first and foremost, the war, but then keeping \nAmerica safe? How about a national energy policy? Will the Republican \nminority stop us from debating that at a time when we know we are so \ndependent on foreign oil that we are sending hundreds of millions of \ndollars each day to countries around the world that disagree with our \nbasic values because they happen to be supplying us with oil?\n  When it comes to issues such as global warming, will they use the \nsame strategy to stop the debate so that for 2 more years things will \nget worse instead of better when it comes to the greenhouse gases and \nthe global warming and climate change which we all know is a reality? \nThey have the power to do it.\n  The only thing that can break the grip they have on the agenda and \ncalendar of the Senate is if 10 of their Members have the courage to \nbreak ranks and join us. It is the only way we can come to these \ndebates. So far a handful have edged across the line, put the toe in \nthe water and said: Well, maybe we are with you on the debate. But it \nis never enough. It is always enough just to have a press release back \nhome saying: We tried to help the Democrats--but never enough to get \nthe job done. That is what we face.\n  Now comes this bill before us, the Court Security Improvement Act of \n2007. This bill is the kind of bill which routinely passes in the \nSenate with no debate. The reason is, it isn't debatable. It comes down \nto a question of protecting the men and women who serve in the Federal \njudiciary.\n  This is an issue which is personal with me. In 2005, one of my close \npersonal friends, a woman I appointed to the Federal court in Chicago, \nJoan Lefkow, went through a tragic personal experience. Someone invaded \nher home and murdered her husband and mother. Those killings were \nperpetrated by a disgruntled litigant who had his case dismissed by \nJudge Lefkow. It was an unwelcomed wake-up call for our country. It \nsensitized many of us to the vulnerability of our judges and their \nfamilies.\n\n  It was not an isolated incident. Last year, a judge was shot in Reno, \nNV. In Louisville, KY, a man pleaded guilty to threatening to kill the \nFederal judge presiding over the outcome of his arson trial. In March \n2005, three people were killed in an Atlanta courthouse, including a \ncounty judge. Just yesterday, there were reports that the car and \ngarage of an Illinois State court judge on the north side of Chicago \nwere damaged by gunshots.\n  The sad reality is that violence and threats against our judges are \non the rise. Between 1996 and 2005, the number of threats and \ninappropriate communications toward judges went up dramatically--from \n201 in 1996 to 943 in 2005. There may be many reasons for this \nincreased violence against judges, but one of the most regrettable is \nthe rise in criticism and condemnation of these fine men and women not \nonly in the halls of Congress but on some of the shock radio shows that \ngo on and pass as news on some cable channels and radio stations.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a woman I respect, who recently retired \nfrom the Supreme Court, said recently:\n\n       [T]he breadth and intensity of rage currently being leveled \n     at the judiciary may be unmatched in American history.\n\n  It is time for the rage and irresponsible rhetoric to come to an end. \nIt is\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\nalso time for Congress to step up and increase protection for judges.\n  In 2005, Senator Obama, my junior colleague from Illinois, and I \nhelped obtain an appropriation after the terrible Lefkow incident. We \nwanted to provide enough money so judges would have some basic \nprotection in their home.\n  The bill we vote on today--the Court Security Improvement Act of \n2007--is another important response. It passed the Senate last year on \ntwo different occasions. The House of Representatives refused to take \nit up. Let me touch on a couple important provisions in this bill, and \nthen let me tell you why, at the end of these remarks, we have reached \nanother terrible moment when it comes to considering a bill of this \nimportance.\n  First, the bill has new criminal penalties for misusing personal \ninformation to threaten harm to judges and their families. It expands \nthe definition of dangerous weapons that are banned from Federal \ncourts. It extends and expands the ability of Federal judges to redact \npersonal information from their financial disclosures that might \nendanger themselves or their families. It allocates more resources to \nthe U.S. Marshals Service to protect Federal judges. It requires better \ncoordination between the Marshals and the Federal judiciary. It \nauthorizes State courts to receive Federal grant money to improve \nsecurity. It is essential that we pass this legislation, and it is long \noverdue.\n  A year ago, on the first anniversary of the murders of her husband \nand mother, Judge Lefkow, of Chicago, released a statement. Here is \nwhat she said:\n\n       The tragedies which we experienced have necessarily alerted \n     me to the fragility of judicial security. Accordingly, I have \n     made a commitment to all of my judicial sisters and brothers \n     to do all in my power to help improve the safety of all \n     judges in the years ahead. It is my fervent hope that nothing \n     that happened in Chicago and Atlanta last year will ever be \n     repeated.\n\n  Those are words we need to take to heart today. I commend Majority \nLeader Harry Reid for bringing up this bill. This Court Security \nImprovement Act is a legacy to the memory of those judges and family \nmembers whose lives were cut short by tragic, vicious acts of violence.\n  Judges should always feel secure in their courtrooms and safe at \nhome. We owe it to them and their families to do everything we can to \nprotect them.\n  As I said before, this is the kind of bill which Members would come \nto the floor and make a few statements on, such as I made, and then \npass by a voice vote, for obvious reasons. Who is going to argue \nagainst this bill? Who believes our judges should not be safe in their \ncourtrooms and at home? We cannot ignore the obvious. There are dangers \nto their lives, and we should act on them. But what has happened in the \nSenate from a procedural viewpoint reflects the argument I made \nearlier. A Senator on the Republican side, within his rights under the \nSenate rule, objected to this bill. Well, it was not enough he \nobjected--he can do that; he could vote against it if that is his \nchoosing--but he demanded we have what we call a cloture motion, that \nwe postpone this bill for 30 hours before we take it up and consider \nit. That is his right. I will fight for his right to do so. But it \nreflects a mindset among some on the other side that is not \nconstructive and not positive.\n  Hard as it is to believe, there are some who think the bill I \ndescribed is an insidious part of the procedure of the Senate, and they \ncall it an earmark--an earmark. This is not the kind of Jack Abramoff \nearmark where a fat cat lobbyist on K Street in Washington inserts a \nprovision in the bill for one of his clients, which ends up with \nmillions of dollars for his client and a fat fee for him to take home. \nNothing in this bill inserts a dollar for any private entity, nor does \nit create any opportunity for a lobbyist to get fat and sassy. Yet some \non the other side of the aisle are arguing this bill has to be stopped \nbecause it is an earmark. An earmark? An earmark to create a program to \nprovide money for courts to make them safer? An earmark to increase the \npenalties for those who would harm our judges and their families?\n  They have corrupted the word ``earmark'' to the point where they \nthink everything is an earmark. This bill is not. This bill emerged \nfrom the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, with strong \nbipartisan support. Instead of enacting it and moving on to other \nimportant bills, we have been bogged down again by procedural hurdles \nthat are thrown at us from the other side of the aisle--something as \nbasic and as fundamental as this bill.\n  Now, I am glad Republican Senators joined us in trying to stop this \none Senator who believes he sees an earmark behind every bill and every \nbush. But the point is, if we are going to be constructive in the \nSenate--whether it is on the war or intelligence or reducing the cost \nof prescription drugs or protecting judges--we need much more \nbipartisan cooperation. As I said earlier, I will fight to the death to \ndefend my colleagues' rights under the rules of the Senate. Those rules \nhave been used by me and by other Senators, and that is why they are \nthere. But common sense should prevail. I think the common good should \nprevail, and we should come together, Democrats and Republicans, \nand compromise and cooperate. That is one thing the American people are \nbegging for: Start addressing the real problems, some that affect only \na small number of Americans, as important as they may be, such as \nmembers of the Federal judiciary, and others that affect us all, such \nas the war in Iraq.\n\n  Isn't it time we put behind the do-nothing Congress, the do-nothing \nmentality, and start out on a new day in this Congress, trying to find \nbipartisan ways to cooperate and solve the real problems that face our \ncountry?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Algeria Bombings\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last Wednesday, April 11, terrorists \nexploded two bombs in Algiers, Algeria, killing 33 people and wounding \nover 200. The terrorist organization al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb \ntook credit for the attacks, which targeted the Algerian Prime \nMinister's office and a police station.\n  The attack occurred 1 day--1 day--after three would-be suicide \nbombers blew themselves up in Casablanca, Morocco, killing a police \nofficer in the process. A fourth individual was shot before he could \ndetonate his bomb. It also preceded, by only 3 days, attacks by two \nmore would-be suicide bombers in Casablanca, Morocco, this time outside \nthe American consulate and the American Language Center. The consulate \nsubsequently closed.\n  While a link between the Algeria bombings and the terrorists in \nMorocco has not yet been established, the confluence of these events \ndemonstrates an increasingly deadly and dangerous situation in North \nAfrica, for the region, for the United States, and for our friends and \nour allies.\n  The bombings should also remind us of the need to be more globally \nfocused in the fight against al-Qaida and its affiliates, which must be \nour national security priority. Yet the administration, fixated on \nIraq, remains narrowminded in its focus and seemingly almost \nindifferent to last week's attacks in North Africa.\n  Until last fall, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb was known as the \nSalafist Group for Preaching and Combat, or GSPC. It has been described \nby the State Department as a regional terrorist organization which \nrecruits and operates in Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Mauritania, and \nTunisia, as well as in Europe.\n  In 2005, GSPC killed 15 people at a military outpost in Mauritania. \nPolice in France, Italy, and Spain have arrested individuals suspected \nof providing support to the organization. GSPC has also called France \n``public enemy number one.'' A French counterterrorism magistrate has \ndescribed GSPC as the biggest terrorist threat facing his country \ntoday.\n  Last year, al-Qaida leadership announced its formal ties to the GSPC, \nraising concerns about the extension of al-Qaida's deadly reach. In \ntestimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee this February, FBI \nDirector Mueller warned of the possible consequences of\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\nthis alliance, including to the United States. According to Mueller's \ntestimony:\n\n       Al-qaida has made efforts to align itself with established \n     regional terrorist groups such as the GSPC that may expand \n     the scope of the threat to the Homeland.\n\n  Despite this clear threat, our Nation barely took notice of the \nattacks last week. The State Department issued a brief statement. The \nWhite House said virtually nothing--or nothing. Vice President Cheney \nmentioned them during a radio interview on Friday and again on Sunday, \nbut only in passing, as a part of his repeated efforts to try to link \n9/11 to the war in Iraq and to support an endless and disastrous war \nthat is emboldening the members of al-Qaida and other terrorist \norganizations.\n  Let me read exactly what the Vice President said:\n\n       We had--just this week there were attacks in Algeria and \n     Morocco by al-Qaida, bombings that were aimed at killing \n     innocent civilians. It is a global conflict, by anybody's \n     measure. And it is clearly against some of the world's worst \n     offenders, and Iraq is very much a part of that. It is, right \n     now, the central front on that global conflict.\n\n  Amazingly, the only comments by the White House on these horrific \nattacks in north Africa were to insist that a terrorist attack in \nAlgeria somehow proved that Iraq, more than 2,000 miles away, is the \ncentral front in the war on terrorism. The Vice President's assertions \nare not just factually wrong, they are offensive to the people murdered \nin Algeria last week, as well as their families and all those working \nhard to capture these terrorists. It is also indicative of everything \nthat is wrong with this administration's national security policies.\n  We should be directing our attention and resources to combating the \nthreat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates, wherever they may be. As \nwe all know, this is not a conventional war. It requires better \nintelligence, better cooperation with friends and allies, stronger \nregional institutions, and diplomatic and economic policies designed to \ndeny terrorists safe havens. It is not easy, and I have enormous \nrespect for the men and women in our intelligence community, diplomatic \ncorps, military, and other elements of our Government who are working \nhard to protect us from this threat. We should provide them our full \nsupport, not only in terms of resources but also with an effective \nglobal counterterrorism strategy rather than the current myopic and \nmisguided focus on Iraq.\n  First, we must improve our intelligence with regard to threats in \nAfrica. The Intelligence authorization bill we were considering in the \nSenate earlier this week includes an amendment I offered with Senator \nRockefeller calling for more intelligence resources to be directed to \nAfrica. If we are to protect our national interests on the continent, \nwe must commit ourselves to understanding not only the terrorist \norganizations that operate there but regional conflicts, corruption, \npoor governance, endemic poverty, and the historic marginalization that \nhas allowed terrorists and other threats to fester.\n  Second, we must expand and strengthen our diplomatic and foreign \nassistance activities in the continent. Our presence in far-flung parts \nof Africa, whether it be a new consulate or outpost or an expanded \nUSAID development or public health program, exposes local populations \nto our Nation, linking us to parts of the world which, as we know, we \ncan no longer afford to ignore. We need to help build strong \ngovernmental institutions that respect human rights and an equally \nvibrant civil society, while also strengthening the relationship \nbetween the two.\n  Third, we need military policies that place counterterrorism in the \ncontext of a larger, more comprehensive strategy. Policies such as the \nTrans-Sahara Counterterrorism Initiative are important, particularly in \nimproving the capacities of local governments. But unless they are part \nof bilateral and multilateral policies that emphasize human rights and \ndemocratization and anticorruption, our military resources may be \nsquandered or, worse, may be even directed in counterproductive ways. \nFor this same reason, I have supported the establishment of an Africa \nCommand within the Defense Department, while insisting that its mission \nbe squarely within the broader strategic goals of the United States on \nthe continent.\n  Fourth, we must develop effective policies for dealing with terrorist \nsafe havens such as the one in the Sahel where al-Qaida in the Islamic \nMaghreb operates. According to the most recent State Department \nterrorism report, the organization not only trains, recruits, and \noperates in the region, it also raises money, including through \nsmuggling. Clearly, confronting this organization requires addressing \nthe root causes that have allowed it to develop and operate, whether \nthey be poverty or corruption or the lack of government support to and \npresence in the region. We must develop comprehensive policies to \nconfront these safe havens, including the settlement of regional \nconflicts and an adequate provision of economic and development \nassistance, so local populations can reject terrorist organizations.\n  Fifth, we must help governments in the region in their efforts to \nconfront terrorist organizations. The most recent State Department \nterrorism report stated that, in Mali, the sheer size of the country \nand the limited resources of the Malian Government ``hamper the \neffectiveness of military patrols and Border Patrol measures.'' The \nreport also indicated Mauritania, another country where al-Qaida in the \nIslamic Maghreb operates, lacks funding and resources to combat \nterrorism.\n  In order to combat international terrorist organizations such as the \nal-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, we need regional strategies that \naddress the capabilities and policies of all affected countries on a \nbilateral and multilateral basis. We must expand our assistance to \nthese and other countries while ensuring that their counterterrorism \npolicies are consistent with ours and that corruption and human rights \nabuses do not undermine efforts to combat terrorist organizations.\n  Sixth, we must work closely with our European allies. Al-Qaida in the \nIslamic Maghreb is a direct threat to Europe; our allies have every \nincentive to work with us. By working to establish mutually agreed upon \napproaches to counterterrorism, we can develop a strong, coordinated \nstrategy that helps keep all of us safer.\n  Seventh, we must encourage regional institutions to confront \nterrorism. For example, the African Union has established a Center for \nStudy and Research on Terrorism to combat terrorism throughout the \ncontinent. This center and other regional initiatives are worthy of far \nmore attention and support than we have thus far provided.\n  Finally, we must at last recognize that the fight against al-Qaida is \nbeing undermined by the endless war in Iraq. As the NIE of last April \nconcluded, the war has become a ``cause celebre'' for international \nterrorists. Moreover, tactics from Iraq are now being used around the \nworld, including by terrorists in Algeria. As the State Department \nterrorism report noted:\n\n       Using lessons from Iraq and wanting to reduce the level of \n     casualties sustained in direct confrontation with Algerian \n     security services, the GSPC carried out attacks using \n     roadside improvised explosive devices. In one act on \n     September 14, GSPC terrorists killed three Algerian soldiers \n     and wounded two others in a military vehicle near Boumerdes \n     by remotely detonating a roadside IED.\n\n  The horrific bombings last week in Algiers and the manifest threat in \nMorocco should remind us that our national security does not begin and \nend in Iraq. Indeed, Iraq remains a drain on our national attention to \nresources and an endless distraction from our real national security \npriorities, which is fighting al-Qaida and its affiliates. We cannot \nignore the rest of the world to focus solely on Iraq. Al-Qaida is \ncontinuing and will continue to be a global terrorist organization. \nContrary to what the administration has implied, al-Qaida is not \nabandoning its efforts to fight us globally so it can fight us in Iraq. \nNo. Instead, it is forming alliances with groups like the GSPC, and it \nis seeking to attack us and our friends and allies around the world. By \ndownplaying this threat, the administration is ignoring the lessons of \nSeptember 11 and endangering our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Medicare Part D\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, when Congress passes a law, the \nAmerican people have every right to expect that their elected \nrepresentatives will do what is best for them. But the country did not \nget a fair deal in 2003 when Congress passed the Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program. Today, the Senate had the opportunity to \nremedy this problem, and politics won out over providing affordable \nprescription drugs to our seniors.\n  Providing prescription drug coverage to millions of seniors is a very \nimportant benefit, and I very much support it, but Part D got off to a \nvery rocky start. Seniors were overwhelmed and confused. Many were not \nenrolled in a timely fashion. When they were enrolled, there were \nserious, even life-threatening delays in getting the medication they \nneeded. A number of States, including my own, declared public health \nemergencies and had to step in to fill the gap. At the time, my mom, a \nformer second grade teacher, told me that Medicare Part D got the grade \nit deserved from the beginning. Since then, many of these early \nproblems with implementation have been remedied.\n  Even today, however, Medicare Part D remains needlessly complex and \nconfusing, with dozens of insurance companies involved, hundreds of \ndifferent plans, and countless benefit structures, pricing tiers, and \ndrug formularies, not to mention the ``doughnut hole'' which each year \neats deeper into the wallets and pocketbooks of millions of seniors.\n  However, by far, the most serious flaw in the original law is the \nnoninterference clause that expressly prohibits Medicare from \nnegotiating lower prices from pharmaceutical companies. This \nprohibition is contrary to how Medicare handles its purchases of other \ngoods and services. It is contrary to how both Medicaid and Veterans \nAffairs purchase medications for their beneficiaries. It is contrary to \ngood business practices and to good government.\n  This prohibition has imposed substantial and unnecessary costs on \nAmerica's taxpayers and seniors who are paying excessive prices for \nprescription drugs. An analysis last year by Merrill Lynch found that \nafter Part D took effect, prices on popular brand-name drugs increased \nby 8.6 percent. This week, there is a new analysis from Families USA. \nIt finds that the prices charged by the largest Part D plans for the 15 \nmost commonly prescribed medications increased by an average of 9.2 \npercent during the past year. This increase is almost four times the \ngeneral inflation rate, and it is nearly three times the cost of living \nadjustment that seniors received this year for their Social Security \nincome. By banning the Government from negotiating discounts, Congress \nsaddled seniors with inflated prices for their medications, while \nhanding a huge financial windfall to the pharmaceutical industry.\n  As I travel throughout my State, Minnesotans tell me they are \nmystified and frustrated that the Government has tied its own hands \nwhen it comes to achieving huge cost savings with prescription drugs. \nThe people of my State repeatedly tell me they want Medicare to use \nevery possible tool to get the best prices. It is a simple principle of \neconomics that consumers strike better deals when they band together \nand exercise their bargaining power. The power of many has much more \nleverage than the power of the few. Congress rejected this commonsense \nprinciple when it barred Medicare from negotiating drug prices. This is \njust plain wrong. When appropriate, the Government should be empowered \nto harness the collective bargaining power of 43 million Americans on \nMedicare to deliver low-cost medication to seniors.\n  We are now poised to give the Government the power to negotiate. The \nHouse has already passed a measure to do so. Now it is our turn, and it \nis our responsibility. This is a matter of fairness for our seniors who \ndeserve affordable prices for their drugs, and it is a matter of \nfairness for American taxpayers who pay 75 percent of the bill for \nMedicare Part D.\n  Under current law, only individual insurance companies can negotiate \nMedicare drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has tried to reassure \nAmericans that this will inevitably produce the lowest prices because \nof competition. This explanation is unconvincing. Evidence and \nexperience shows us that the present system often does not produce the \nfairest prices.\n  The pharmaceutical companies like to say that Part D Program costs \nare lower than projected, but beating artificial projections has not \nresulted in lower prices. Numerous studies show that Part D prices are \nsignificantly higher than prices for drugs and programs where \nnegotiation is permitted.\n  For example, a review of drug prices in Florida last October reported \nthat the lowest retail price--the price you get by just shopping \naround--is usually cheaper than the Medicare price for popular drugs.\n  In January of this year, a study by Families USA found that the top \nfive Medicare Part D insurance companies serving two out of three \nenrollees charged prices at a median rate that were 58 percent higher \nthan the same drugs provided to veterans through the VA. The study \ncompared the lowest price available under Part D and the lowest VA \nprice for the 20 most common medications prescribed to seniors. \nCelebrex, for arthritis, was 50 percent more expensive under Medicare \nPart D; Lipitor, for cholesterol and heart disease, was 51 percent more \nexpensive; Nexium, for heartburn and acid reflux disease, was 65 \npercent more expensive.\n  If these aren't bad enough, consider these:\n  Fosamax was 205 percent more expensive under Part D. That is for \nosteoporosis; Protonix, for heartburn and acid reflux disease, was 435 \npercent more expensive; and Zocor, for cholesterol and heart disease, \nwas over 1,000 percent more expensive.\n  With this tremendous disparity in drug prices, it simply defies \ncommon sense to assume Medicare is giving our seniors a good deal. They \nshould be negotiating for better prices.\n  Maybe the discounts would not be as great as the VA gets because of \nthe differences in those two programs. But how can anybody be satisfied \nwhen Medicare is paying prices that are, on average, 58 percent higher? \nCan we not at least try to get a better deal? Can't we even allow the \npossibility of negotiation by our Government with the drug companies?\n  Yet this administration and its Secretary of Health and Human \nServices have shown absolutely no interest in the potential of \nnegotiation. In fact, the Secretary has been aggressively defiant about \neven the idea of it. This needs to change.\n  There is another reason we should not trust the assurances of the \npharmaceutical industry that America's seniors are already getting the \nlowest prices possible. The Government can often negotiate bigger \ndiscounts than insurance companies, which represent smaller numbers of \nseniors. There is no good reason to arbitrarily foreclose this \nopportunity for gaining a price cut.\n  By Medicare's own calculations, Part D private plans are negotiating \nprices that are 73 percent of the average wholesale prices. But \nMedicaid pays only 51 percent, and the VA pays only 42 percent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also agrees that the Government could \nbe more effective than private plans in negotiating prices for unique \ndrugs that have no competition.\n  Even limited savings on popular drugs could translate into billions \nof dollars. Consider Zocor and Lipitor, two top-selling prescription \nmedications. If Medicare could negotiate prices in line with what the \nVA gets, the savings from those two drugs alone could be more than $2.8 \nbillion each year. Even a fraction of this amount would still represent \nsubstantial savings. That would mean cheaper drugs for seniors, a \nbetter deal for taxpayers, and less Government spending.\n  The only real winners from a prohibition on negotiation are the \npharmaceutical companies. They vigorously lobbied for the ban, knowing \nit would boost their profits, while denying fair prices to seniors and \ntaxpayers. They paid big money to make sure they got a Medicare drug \nprogram that prohibited price negotiation, and now they are spending \nbig money to keep that profitable ban in place.\n  Since 1998, the pharmaceutical industry has spent over $650 million \non lobbying. In the past year and a half, they\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nhave spent a record $155 million. What are America's seniors supposed \nto think all that money goes for?\n  The drug industry employs some 1,100 lobbyists. That is two drug \nlobbyists for every Member of the Senate and House of Representatives. \nThe pharmaceutical industry has fired up its lobbying machine again to \noppose efforts to lift the ban.\n  The industry lobbying organization, PhRMA, has been running a massive \nadvertising campaign in opposition to negotiating lower prices. It \nincludes full-page ads in newspapers across the country. They have been \nbuying these ads in my State, too. The most recent full-page ad \nappeared earlier this week in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. It tells \nMinnesotans how they are supposed to think. It uses quotes from USA \nToday and the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n  With all due respect to these good newspapers, we Minnesotans know \nhow to think for ourselves and how to reach our own conclusions. When \nit comes to Medicare Part D, the people of Minnesota have made up their \nminds. A statewide survey earlier this year found that fully 93 percent \nof Minnesotans want Medicare to have the power to bargain for lower \nprescription drug prices.\n  But the drug industry keeps using scare tactics, throwing around \nwords such as ``rationing'' and ``price controls.'' It ignores \npromising negotiation approaches that don't limit the drugs available \nto seniors and that do not involve price setting.\n  I have dealt with this before. In the last few years, I was actually \naccused of trying to ration Lipitor. That simply isn't so. My mom takes \nLipitor. If people think I would advance a proposal that would take my \nmom's drugs away, they don't know my mom.\n  Allowing negotiation would not mean rationing, but lifting the ban on \nnegotiations would cut into the hugely profitable windfall the drug \nindustry has enjoyed, thanks to Medicare Part D. In the first 6 months \nafter Medicare Part D went into effect, the profit for the top 10 drug \ncompanies increased by over $8 billion, which is a 27-percent jump.\n  It should be no surprise. Medicaid Part D has provided the drug \ncompanies with a surge of new Government-subsidized customers. And \nCongress has allowed the drug companies to charge excessive prices.\n\n  This has been especially true with the more than 6 million Americans \nwho were transferred from Medicaid to Medicare under the Part D law. \nThey are known as dual beneficiaries or dual eligibles because they are \neligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. They now account for more than \n25 percent of all Part D enrollees.\n  Before the Part D law took effect, Medicaid was already buying \nprescription drugs for these individuals under a ``best price'' rule. \nThis meant the price a drug company offered Medicaid could not exceed \nthe lowest price it received for that same drug in the private market.\n  These dual-eligible individuals are now covered only under Medicare \nPart D, which has no ``best price'' rule and, of course, no negotiating \npower either.\n  Two economists have analyzed last year's financial filings from the \ntop drug companies. In a study released earlier this month, the two \neconomists concluded these companies have gained substantial new \nprofits because they no longer had to provide the rebates and discounts \npreviously demanded by Medicaid. That is great for the drug industry, \nbut it is not so great for all of us.\n  I grew up believing every dollar, every quarter, every penny counts. \nI remember saving all my quarters from baby sitting in a box in my \nroom. I also believe that is true for our Government, for our \ntaxpayers, and especially for our seniors. The average income for a \nretiree is about $15,000, with most living on a fixed income. Seniors \nneed medications more than any other age group. For those over age 75, \nthey depend on an average of almost eight prescription medications.\n  So for seniors, money and medications are a very serious matter. It \nmust be a serious matter for us, too. By lifting the ban on price \nnegotiations, we will continue to give seniors access to the \nmedications they need and the same broad range of plans. The difference \nis that the Federal Government, representing all 43 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries, will also be at the bargaining table.\n  It is time to lift the ban. It is time to negotiate with the powerful \ndrug companies. It is time to help our seniors get the lower, fairer \nprices they deserve for the life-saving and life-enhancing medications \nthey need.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire as to where we are at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to S. 378.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tax Simplification Act of 2007\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday was tax day 2007. I had hoped to \ncome to the floor at that time, but we were busy on several other \nissues. I join with my friend and colleague, Senator Shelby, as a \ncosponsor of S. 1040, which will replace our current broken tax system \nwith a simple, what I call fair flat tax.\n  Over the years that I have served the State of Idaho in the Congress, \nI have looked numerous times at the concept of a flat tax and believe \nit to be by far a more preferable system for all our taxpayers to be \ninvolved in.\n  Only a few weeks ago, we debated the fiscal year 2008 budget \nresolution and some recurring points began to emerge. Over and over \nagain, from both sides of the aisle, we heard about the repeal of the \ndeath tax, the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, the child tax \ncredit, and marriage penalty relief, and problems associated with the \nso-called tax gap.\n  The average American listening to that debate, if they were not true \nstudents of the Tax Code or if, in fact, they hadn't been victims of \nthat portion of the Tax Code, would have wondered in what kind of code \nthe Senators were speaking or talking through at the moment.\n  Congress has offered temporary fixes to these problems for years, but \nthese problems are merely symptoms of a larger problem that needs \nfixing. I believe the larger problem is we have a convoluted, broken \nTax Code system today.\n  The current Tax Code is--well, let me use this as an example. In \n2005, according to the IRS's own estimates, Americans spent 6.4 billion \nhours preparing their tax returns and a whopping $265 billion in \nrelated compliance costs. You know that if you make any kind of money \nat all and you can afford to, you start hiring attorneys and tax \nexperts to find ways of manipulating yourself through the system, not \nnecessarily to avoid taxes but maybe to provide some level of \ninheritance to your children and your grandchildren so Uncle Sam \ndoesn't get it on your moment of death. The complication has \nincreasingly grown over the years and, of course, the cost is \nphenomenal.\n  So, Mr. President, if you will bear with me for a moment, think about \nthis analysis: Americans, if they had to wade through the 66,498 \npages--that is right, 66,498 pages--of the Federal tax rules on a \nletter-size sheet of paper, that amount of pages would stand about 22 \nfeet tall. That is about three times taller than I am with cowboy boots \nand a cowboy hat on. That is pretty significant stuff. Yet the average \nAmerican is supposed to figure out how to get through that? That is why \nthey spend $265 billion hiring the experts to figure out how to get \nthem through it. The Tax Code's purpose is simply to fund the Federal \nGovernment, but we have turned it into a system loaded with \npreferences, deductions, credits and exceptions and, yes, other kinds \nof loopholes that cater to a special-interest tier and fail to treat \nall taxpayers fairly because we politically are manipulating where we \nwant the money to go, how we want the economy to run, how we want the \naverage person to spend or not spend his or her hard-earned wages in a \nway that is, by our definition, beneficial to the\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\ncountry, to the culture, to the economy at large.\n  The time for half-measures ought to be over. Fundamental reform is \nthe only thing that will restore, in my opinion, fairness and \nsimplicity to the system, and I have long thought a flat tax is the \nbest approach toward reforming the code.\n  A flat tax, such as the one in S. 1040, will provide a simple flat \nrate of 19 percent, eliminate special preferences, end the double \ntaxation of savings and investment, and provide a generous exemption \nbased on family size.\n  Not everyone agrees--I am sure we all understand that--but that \nshouldn't stop the conversation, the fundamental debate, the energy of \nthis Senate and this Congress becoming involved in reforming our Tax \nCode for the greater benefit of our country.\n  That is one of the reasons why I joined Senator Wyden, a Democrat on \nthe other side of the aisle, in launching a bipartisan Cleanse the Code \nCoalition. Although Members of the coalition disagree sharply about the \nbest approach to tax reform, we all agree fundamentally that reform is \nimperative, that it is something that should embody the principles of \nsimplicity, fairness, and fiscal responsibility.\n  Our current tax system is a handicap on our Nation's citizens, our \nbusinesses, and our economy. As we continue to increase our competitive \ncharacter and compete with other economies around the world, those \nfeatures of simplicity and fairness become increasingly important.\n  Our current tax system is a handicap. There is something that ought \nto be done about it. We will, again, tinker around the edges, as we did \nwith the 2008 budget resolution that sets parameters for spending and \nfor revenues and, once again, we will talk about it a great deal more \nthan we will act on it. When we act, we will simply adjust and change \nand modify, and every time we do, in that illustrative picture I gave \nyou, we will add another cowboy hat to the top of my head and make that \n66,000-page stack of papers that is 22 feet tall a little taller for \nthe average American to work their way through in frustration, \nsometimes in anger, sometimes in fear that they have failed to comply \nand the IRS is just around the corner.\n  I hope that a day will come in April, a year or two from now, when \nthe process of filing a tax return is a simple sheet of paper: Here is \nhow much I have made, you apply the 19 percent to it, it is all online, \nand you don't have to hire attorneys and accountants in great \ncomplication to weave your way through the morass of rules and \nregulations. And Americans for the first time could say: You know, that \nwas a pretty easy task. I am a responsible citizen. I have paid my \ntaxes.\n  As one who gains the great benefit of this country, while we may not \nnecessarily like it, it ought to be an easy and painless task to do. \nThat ought to be our challenge. That is why I am a part of the \nlegislation and in support of it and why I am on the Senate floor \ntoday--to challenge my colleagues to think a little more about it. It \nought not be a game of dodge and hide and replace and reshape. It truly \nought to be one of saying to the average citizen: We want to make it \neasy, we want to make it simple for you to fulfill your responsibility \nin assisting your Government in paying for the necessary services it \nneeds in a straightforward and, most importantly, simplistic way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Partial Birth Abortion Ban Upheld\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today with great hope in my \nheart that a step was taken forward on human dignity today. Earlier \ntoday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the partial-birth abortion ban \npassed by Congress in 2003, and I applaud the Court for this decision.\n  As many of my colleagues know, partial-birth abortion is one of the \nmost heinous and grotesque forms of abortion. Science has shown that \nafter 20 weeks, unborn children do indeed feel pain. Imagine the pain a \nprenatal baby feels as it is so savagely destroyed in the latter part \nof the pregnancy. It is incomprehensible that we should allow such a \nprocedure to continue in our Nation, and I am thankful--I am thankful--\nthe Congress passed this important ban, that President Bush signed it \ninto law, and now the Supreme Court has upheld this in the face of a \nchallenge. I think this is an important day for human dignity, that we \nare starting to recognize the dignity of everybody at all stages.\n  We had a big debate on the Senate floor last week about stem cells \nand whether we should destroy the youngest of human lives for research \npurposes. I don't think we should. We should extend dignity. But \ncertainly we should extend dignity to a child who is very well \ndeveloped in the womb and who is being aborted feeling great pain, the \nchild itself. We should show dignity for that life. The Court is \nstarting to express the fundamental right to life and the dignity of \neach life in the country, and what a great message to our Nation, what \na great message to our world for us to have that.\n  The majority decision of the Court, authored by Justice Anthony \nKennedy, recognizes that partial-birth abortion is not medically \nnecessary. Far from it. Both mother and child deserve far better than \nabortion, particularly such an invasive, barbaric procedure as partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  I am pleased that the Court states in its opinion:\n\n       It is, however, precisely this lack of information \n     concerning the way in which the fetus will be killed that is \n     of legitimate concern to the State.\n\n  Citing Casey, the father of the Presiding Officer, supra, at 873, it \nstates:\n\n       States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable \n     framework for a woman to make a decision that has such \n     profound and lasting meaning.\n       The State has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is \n     well informed. It is self-evident that a mother who comes to \n     regret her choice to abort must struggle with grief more \n     anguished and sorrow more profound when she learns, only \n     after the event, what she once did not know: that she allowed \n     a doctor to pierce the skull--\n\n  Of a child, her child--\n\n     and vacuum the fast developing brain of her unborn child . . \n     .\n\n  The child is human and in her womb.\n  I repeat, today's decision by the Supreme Court puts hope in our \nhearts. Americans understand that life is a precious gift and worthy of \nrespect and protection. Indeed, this deep belief is at the very root of \nour Nation's founding--of our Constitution. I believe our laws and the \nprecedents of our courts ought to reflect this culture of respect for \nhuman life and human dignity at all stages, in all places; that every \nhuman life is precious, it is unique, it is sacred, and it is a child \nof a loving God. It applies to the child in the womb at whatever stage \nits development. It applies to a child in poverty. It applies to a \nchild in Darfur. It is pro-life and it is whole-life, beginning to end, \nand that is as it should be.\n  I am delighted that the Supreme Court is moving forward to see the \nexpression of life in the Constitution. I hope that someday we will see \nall life respected at all stages and protected in this land and around \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded, and I ask to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                        Alternative Minimum Tax\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday was tax return filing day for \nmost Americans for the 2006 tax year. While filing that 2006 tax return \nand paying tax owed for 2006 was stressful enough, for 23 million \nfamilies who will be AMT taxpayers in 2007, there was added stress. \nThat added stress is due to the fact that those 23 million families \nbear the uncertainty of whether\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nthere will be an AMT patch for the year 2007; in other words, for \nCongress to take action so the alternative minimum tax will not apply \nto an additional 23 million families for this year's earnings as the \npresent law is going to do it. Congress, each year, has taken action so \nthat would not happen. The big question is will Congress act soon \nenough so that the uncertainty of these 23 million taxpayers will not \nbe realized.\n  This matters for taxpayers now because the first quarter estimated \ntax payments are due for the 2007 tax year. I have a chart here I wish \nto show that shows the form for the payment these 23 million families \nhave to make, and why going through the trouble of filling this out is \nstressful for the 23 million taxpayers--in addition to having to pay \nall of this tax. Barring an extension in the ``hold harmless'' \nprovisions that made certain that people who filed on 2006 earnings did \nnot have to pay the AMT, if we do not take action for the year we are \nin, AMT exemptions then will return to the pre-2001 levels. Many \nAmericans may be surprised to find in their 1040 ES instruction package \nthat the AMT exemption amount for single taxpayers is decreasing from \n$42,550 in 2006 to $33,750 in the year we are in now for earnings, \n2007. And for married taxpayers, the exemption amount is decreasing by \nnearly $20,000, from $62,550 down to $45,000.\n  You can see here on line 29 that these higher exemption amounts are \nthere. To add insult to injury in this whole matter, certain credits \nwill not be allowed against the alternative minimum tax in 2007, \nincluding the credit for child and dependent care expenses, credit for \nthe elderly or the disabled, and education credits. And that is just to \nname a few.\n  The alternative minimum tax is not a new problem and has been with us \nfor several decades. The individual minimum tax--that is a precursor to \nour AMT--was originally enacted in 1969 after Congress discovered that \n155 taxpayers with incomes greater than $200,000--these are 1969 \nfigures--were not paying any taxes at all.\n  As originally formulated, the individual minimum tax affected one out \nof a half-million taxpayers. Clearly that situation has changed now \nvery dramatically in the last 30 years when today about 4 million \ntaxpayers are paying the alternative minimum tax. If we do not do \nanything this year, 23 million more people will pay it on earnings they \nare making right now.\n  Although not its only flaw, the most significant defect of the \nalternative minimum tax is that it is not indexed for inflation. If it \nhad been indexed for inflation, then obviously we would not have these \n3 million people, or these potential 23 million people, having to worry \nabout paying the alternative minimum tax.\n  This failure to reindex the exemption and the rate brackets, the \nparameters of the AMT system, is also a bipartisan problem.\n  Perhaps the most notable missed opportunity to index the AMT for \ninflation was the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Another missed \nopportunity was the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act in 1993, in which \nthe exemption levels were not indexed but were increased to $33,750 for \nindividuals and $45,000 for joint returns. But this was accomplished by \nan additional rate increase.\n  By the way, the 1993 tax increase passed this body with only \nDemocratic votes. Once again, graduated rates were introduced, except \nthis time they were 26 percent and 28 percent.\n  By tinkering with the rate and exemption level of the AMT, these \nbills were only doing what Congress has been doing on a bipartisan \nbasis for almost 40 years, which is to undertake a wholly inadequate \napproach to a problem that keeps getting bigger. And by ``keeps getting \nbigger,'' I mean it is applying now to 23 million taxpayers for \nearnings this year to whom it should not apply.\n  In 1999, the issue again had to be dealt with. At that time Congress \npassed the Taxpayers Refund and Relief Act of 1999. In the Senate, only \nRepublicans voted for the bill. That bill in fact included a provision \nthat actually repealed the entire alternative minimum tax. If this bill \nhad not been vetoed by President Clinton, we would not even be talking \nabout this today.\n  Later on, in 1999, an extenders bill, including a fix good through \n2001, was enacted to hold AMT harmless for a little longer.\n  Most recently, in March of 2007, less than a month ago, this body, \nnow under the control of the Democrats, voted against an amendment I \nsponsored to put some honesty back into the budgeting process and to \nstop spending amounts that are scheduled to come into the Federal \ncoffers through the alternative minimum tax.\n\n  Take a minute to visit about that vote on my amendment to the budget \nresolution a month ago. That amendment would have amended the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2008 in order to accommodate a full repeal \nof the alternative minimum tax, preventing the same 23 million people, \nboth families and individuals whom I am talking about today, from being \nsubject to the alternative minimum tax in 2007, not to mention the \nmillions of families and individuals who will be hit by it in \nsubsequent years.\n  You would think we would have seen a flood of bipartisan support for \nthat amendment, given the numbers of families represented by my \ncolleagues across the aisle who are now paying the alternative minimum \ntax in 2007. But, instead, true to form, not a single Democratic \nSenator voted for the amendment to provide relief from the alternative \nminimum tax and to stop spending money this country does not have and \nwas not intended to get. If you get it from these 23 million people, it \nhas the capability of ruining the middle class in America. We got not a \nsingle vote from the other side of the aisle.\n  So even though the alternative minimum tax is a problem that has been \ndeveloping for a while, almost 40 years, Congress has had an \nopportunity to deal with the issue but has blocked attempts to deal \nwith the issue thoroughly. Or, if Congress passed it, President Clinton \nvetoed it. Although on numerous occasions Congress has made adjustments \nto the exemption and in the rates, it has not engaged in a sustained \neffort to keep the alternative minimum tax from further absorbing the \nworking people who are in middle-class America. Instead, despite \ntemporary measures, the AMT has gone from being a threat to millions of \ntaxpayers who were never supposed to be subject to a minimum tax, to \nbeing a reality when they sent in their estimated income tax payments \nto the IRS for the first quarter.\n  That the alternative minimum tax has grown grossly beyond its \noriginal purpose, which was to ensure that the wealthy were not exempt \nfrom an income tax, is indisputable, and that the alternative minimum \ntax is inherently flawed then falls into the commonsense category.\n  Despite widespread agreement that something needs to be done about \nthe alternative minimum tax, agreement on what exactly to do is not so \nwidespread. I suppose if there had been an agreement to repeal it, I \nwould have gotten more than 44 votes on my amendment to the budget \nresolution a month ago. So you can use your mathematics. It is going to \ntake at least seven more people to agree with me before we can get that \ndone. And a major factor in the disagreement relates to massive amounts \nof money that the alternative minimum tax brings to the Federal \nGovernment. In 2004, the alternative minimum tax brought $12.8 billion \ninto the Treasury. Projections show that the AMT balloons revenues in \ncoming years. These projections are used to put together the budget \nusing current law, so that is why this money that was never supposed to \nbe collected is put into the budget by the Congressional Budget Office \nand by the Office of Management and Budget in the executive branch.\n  This is a bipartisan problem. Whether you have a Republican majority \nor Democratic majority in this body, it is going to be handled the same \nway. Republican and Democratic budgets, then, rely on the same source \nof revenue--even though it is a revenue that was never supposed to be \ncollected. In 1969, it was never anticipated it would hit more than \npeople with adjusted gross incomes, at that time, of $200,000; and if \nyou brought that on for inflation now, it would be somewhat a bigger \nfigure but it would not take in 3 million people as it does today and \nit wouldn't be taking in 23 million people as it will this very year.\n  This means the central problem in dealing with the AMT is not money\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\nthat will come in, but people are counting on it to come in. I call it \nphantom income. Of course, for the 23 million people who file or have \nto file for this year's income, if we do not do something, it is going \nto bring in additional revenue, and it would not be phantom in that \ncase, but it is phantom in the sense that if it was supposed to hit a \nfew rich people and it is hitting 23 million middle-income Americans, \nit does not seem legitimate to count it as money coming into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  There are some people who would say we can only solve the alternative \nminimum tax problem if offsetting revenue can be found to replace the \nmoney the AMT is currently forecast to collect. Anyone who says this \nsees the forecast showing revenue being pushed up as a percentage of \ngross domestic product and, quite frankly, they like to spend more \nmoney so they want to keep it there.\n  These arguments are especially ridiculous when one considers that the \nalternative minimum tax was never meant to collect as much revenue; in \nother words, it is a failed policy. It is simply unfair to expect \ntaxpayers to pay a tax they were never intended to pay. It is even more \nunfair to expect them to continue paying that tax once we get rid of \nit.\n  The reform or repeal of the AMT should not be offset because it is \nmoney we were never supposed to collect in the first place. So the way \nto solve this problem is to look on the other side of the ledger, on \nthe spending side. Budget planners need to take off their rose-colored \nglasses when looking at the long-term revenue projections and read the \nfine print.\n  In general, it is a good idea to spend money within your means. That \nis true in this case as well. If we start trying to spend revenues we \nexpect to collect in the future because of the alternative minimum tax, \nwe will be living beyond our means. We need to stop assuming that \nrecord levels of revenue are available to be spent and recognize that \nthe alternative minimum tax is a phony revenue source.\n  As we consider how to deal with the alternative minimum tax, we must \nfirst remember we do not have the option of not dealing with it if we \nwant to maintain a middle class in America. The problem will only get \nworse every year and make any solution more difficult.\n  We must also be clear that the revenue the alternative minimum tax \nwill not collect as a result of repeal or reform should not be offset \nas a condition of repeal or reform. We should not call it lost revenue \nbecause it is revenue we never had to begin with.\n  This week millions of families are beginning to feel the \nramifications of that revenue vortex. I have outlined that the \nalternative minimum tax problem has been developing for decades, but I \nwant to make clear that something distinctly different and more onerous \nis happening this year for alternative minimum taxpayers; that is, that \nfor the first time in 6 years, there is no money in the budget to fix \nthe alternative minimum tax even for 1 year. So the outlook for those \n23 million people who are paying it right now on incomes earned this \nyear is even a little bleaker than in recent years.\n  For the first time in 6 years, there is also no bill on the floor to \ndeal with the issue. Now, there is the Baucus-Grassley bill that I do \nnot think the Democratic leadership has put on the schedule yet but \nthey ought to if they want to preserve the middle class.\n  At estimated tax payment time last year, folks were feeling a similar \ncrunch on the alternative minimum tax. But the legislative posture on \nthis point was significantly different. This time last year, the \nalternative minimum tax fix bill for 2006 had already passed in both \nthe House and the Senate. At this time last year, the tax-writing \ncommittees were in conference on a tax package that included a fix to \nthe alternative minimum tax for the year 2006 income and was enacted in \nMay of 2006.\n  This year, those 23 million families facing a 2007 estimated tax \npayment have nothing to refer to but the IRS instruction package that \nis telling them it is time to start paying on the 2007 alternative \nminimum tax problem now.\n  It is time for Congress to wake up to this problem. It cannot wait \nuntil the end of this year. It cannot wait until the end of the next \nPresidential election. The time is now. So I implore my colleagues to \njoin me in addressing this issue.\n  Perhaps the 23 million families who are feeling the absolutely \nmaddening tax increase of 2007, beginning this week, will be inspired \nto act, and hopefully we will have a prairie fire of support for acting \non this quickly and maybe even doing the right thing by repealing it \nentirely.\n  We just went through that time of the year where, for most people, \nthe Tax Code transforms from an abstraction to a concrete reality. The \nsame is true of tax relief. What may be an academic or policy \ndiscussion becomes something more when the men and women of our Nation \nactually work out how much of what they have earned they turn over to \nus in Congress to spend for them.\n\n  Thanks to the popular and bipartisan tax relief enacted in 2001 and \n2003, virtually all Americans paid less in taxes this year than they \ndid last year. There seems to be several Members of this body who view \nthat as a bad thing to happen, who would rather take what others have \nearned and stuff it into the pork barrel.\n  I think that American workers are the best people to decide how to \nspend their money and that letting them keep as much of their own money \nas possible is very good.\n  As I said, Americans generally paid less this year than they did last \nyear because of bipartisan tax relief. Last year I talked about the \nslim majority who have governed the Senate for the past several years. \nIf tax relief hadn't been bipartisan, the 2000 tax relief bill would \nnot have received the support of nearly a quarter of the Democratic \ncaucus that year when the conference report came up for a rollcall \nvote.\n  However, this popular and bipartisan tax relief has been put at risk \nby Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The Senate-passed \nbudget resolution only provides 44 percent of the revenue room needed \nto make tax relief permanent; only 44 percent. The House-passed budget \nresolution provides zero percent of the revenue room necessary, which \nmeans that taxpayers face a serious risk of being hit with a wall of \ntax increases in 2011, as illustrated by this chart, the wall between \nwhat taxes are being paid now and what will be paid when 2011 happens.\n  According to the U.S. Treasury, a family of four with an income of \n$40,000 will be hit by a tax hike of $2,052 per year, every year. That \nis an increase for a family of four with an income of $40,000 a year, \nnot rich people.\n  To see the consequences, we need to look past academic seminars and \nworking papers and wordy editorials to see what this tax hike will mean \nfor real people. For a family of four at $40,000, this tax wall of \n$2,052 of increased payment to the Federal Government is real and at \nthat time will be a real problem.\n  Right now I want to walk through the specific components of the \nbipartisan tax relief that are at risk. This chart breaks down what \ncould be a $407 billion tax increase over 5 years. Here is the tax \nincreases of various parts of the 2001-2003 tax bills that have those \nsubdivisions in it, and as these expire, income will be coming in this \nmuch more from various things that automatically happen.\n  Let me be clear on this: This is a tax increase that Congress is not \ngoing to vote for. This is a tax increase that Congress would not have \nguts enough to vote for. This is a tax increase that is automatically \ngoing to happen because the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 sunset in 2010.\n  To anybody around this body who says they are not voting to increase \ntaxes, we can stop this. If we stop this, we keep the present level of \ntaxation, we would not be cutting taxes more. The policy we have had in \nplace for this decade would stay in place the next decade. That is not \na bad tax policy because of the increase of the 7.8 million new jobs. \nAnd that is Chairman Greenspan saying it is responsible for the \nrecovery we have. As pointed out, almost everything statistically that \nwe use to show that the economy is working, it is all very positive.\n  So let's look at some of these subdivisions of this 2001-2003 tax \nbill. Let's take the marginal tax rate cuts. We set up a brand-new 10-\npercent bracket that year in 2001 so that low-income people\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\nwould not have to pay as much tax, if their first tax dollar is taxed \nat 10 percent, where it used to be taxed at 15 percent for lower income \npeople.\n  That costs $203 billion over 5 years, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. I am sorry. That included the 10-percent \nbracket. But I was talking about the marginal tax rate cut generally, \nincluding the 10-percent bracket. What I said about the 10-percent \nbracket, making it possible for low-income people to pay less tax on \ntheir first dollar, is also true.\n  But the $203 billion applies to all tax rates. The 10-percent bracket \ncosts $78 billion over 5 years, all by itself. But that proposal \nreduces the taxes of approximately 100 million families and individuals \nacross the Nation. When considering the rest of the marginal rates, it \nappears some folks think the 35-percent tax rate is too low of a top \nrate.\n  Well, guess what. Repealing the marginal tax rates hits small \nbusiness, the biggest source of new jobs in America. It hits that class \nof people the most.\n  The Treasury Department estimates 33 million small business owners \nwho are taxed on their business income at the individual rate benefits \nfrom the marginal tax rate cuts. Repealing these cuts would cause 33 \nmillion small business owners to pay a 13-percent penalty. Why do we \nwant to kill the goose that laid the golden egg, and that is small \nbusiness, where most of the jobs are created in America? It is the \nbackbone of our economy.\n  Do Democratic leaders want to raise taxes on those taxpayers? \nTreasury also projects that small business gets over 80 percent of the \nbenefits of the cut in the top two rates. Do we want to raise the tax \nrates of small business by 13 percent? Does that make any sense? \nDemocratic leaders, what would you say about raising that amount of \nmoney from small business, a 13-percent tax increase, if Congress does \nnothing?\n  So obviously I am recommending we take action between now and that \nsunset to make sure a tax policy that has been good for the entire \neconomy, according to Chairman Greenspan, stays in place to continue to \ncreate jobs above and beyond the 7.8 million jobs that are already \ncreated in this recovery.\n  Now, what about death tax relief? That package scores $102 billion \nover 5 years. Most of the revenue loss is attributable to increasing \nthe exemption amount and dropping the rate to 45 percent on already-\ntaxed property. Is it unreasonable to provide relief from the death \ntax? Why should death be an incident of taxation? Why should you have a \nfire sale, when you do not get as much for assets when someone dies in \norder to pay the taxes? Why not let the willing buyer or willing seller \nmake a decision when the marketplace is going to work? Death is not the \nmarketplace working. Is it unreasonable to provide that sort of relief, \nor should we raise the death tax on small business and family farms? \nThat is what will happen if the bipartisan tax relief package is not \nextended.\n\n  Now we have the child tax credit. That is the fourth one down on the \nchart. Mr. President, 31.6 million families benefit from the child tax \ncredit according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. How about the \nrefundable piece that helped 16 million kids and their families? That \nproposal loses $41 billion over 5 years. I didn't think we would have a \nlot of takers on letting that one expire, but the Democratic leadership \nmay be proving me wrong.\n  The next item on the list is the lower rates on capital gains and \ndividends. Thirty-three million Americans, a good number of them low-\nincome seniors, benefit from the lower tax rates on capital gains and \ndividends. Some people try to portray this tax reduction as only for \nthe idle rich. But the beneficiaries of this provision include working-\nclass Americans who have spent a lifetime building up equity in \nproperty and securities and probably have their pension funds and their \n401(k)s invested in the stock market.\n  Does the Democratic leadership think we should raise taxes on these \n33 million families and individuals?\n  Take into consideration the fact that 25 years ago, only about 12, 15 \npercent of Americans had any investment in the stock market. Today it \nis between 55 and 60 percent because of 401(k)s, IRAs, and pensions.\n  Then we have the marriage penalty. Why would we ever think there \nshould be a penalty on people being married? We finally did something \nabout the marriage penalty. It is the first relief we delivered to that \nclass of people in over 30 years. This proposal scores at $13 billion \nover 5 years. The Treasury estimates nearly 33 million married couples \nbenefit from the abolition of the marriage penalty. Again, I don't \nthink many folks would want to raise taxes on people just because they \nare married. Most of the folks who do want to raise taxes on married \ncouples must be serving in the House and Senate because that is what is \ngoing to happen when this sunsets.\n  Another proposal is expensing for small business, meaning expensing \nof depreciable property, depreciable equipment, among other things. \nThis is a commonsense bipartisan proposal. According to the Internal \nRevenue service, 6.7 million small businesses benefited from this \nprovision in 2004. That is the most recent year for which we have \nstatistics. If we don't make this provision permanent, small businesses \nface a tax increase of $12 billion in 5 years. When this sunsets--and \nthe majority wants it to sunset--do they want to hurt small business? I \nthink that is unwise tax policy.\n  Continuing on through the bipartisan tax relief package, let's look \nat the education tax relief provisions. This package helps Americans \ncope with college education costs. It scores at $2 billion over 5 \nyears, and 16 million families and students benefited from this tax \nrelief in 2004. In this era of rising higher education costs, should we \ngut tax benefits for families who want a college education for their \nkids? In order to keep competitive in the global economy, we ought to \nthink about having the most educated workforce we can. Especially in \nthe runup to the last election, I heard a lot about the importance of \nhigher education and helping to ensure that costs do not keep people \nout of college. But college education is going to increase for middle-\nincome people who are taking advantage of this tax exemption for \ncollege tuition. These provisions put those ideas into action and help \npeople afford a college education. Does the Democratic leadership think \nscrapping them is good for our young people, good for our economy, good \nfor middle-class families?\n  The last item on this chart is where both parents work and have to \ndeal with childcare expenses. The tax relief package includes enhanced \nincentives for childcare expenses, and 5.9 million families across \nAmerica benefit, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. These \nprovisions helped working mothers and fathers remain in the workforce \nwhile having a family. Does the Democratic leadership think we ought to \ntake away these childcare benefits from working families?\n  I have taken my colleagues through about $407 billion of tax relief. \nIt sounds a lot like an abstraction, but it provides relief to almost \nevery American who pays income tax. I ask any of those who want to \nadjust or restructure the bipartisan tax relief, where would they cut \nin this package? Where would they cut? It would be very difficult, \nconsidering how this tax package has contributed to the revitalization \nof this economy, according to Chairman Greenspan, to touch it at all. \nIt seems to me they would not want to kill the goose that laid the \ngolden egg. Wouldn't they want to keep that goose laying those golden \neggs into the next decade and do it today instead of waiting until 2010 \nto do it before it sunsets? The principle of the predictability of tax \npolicy to get business to create jobs is very important. It is very \nunpredictable now. We get to 2009 and 2010, and we are not going to get \nthe long-term investment until people know what the tax policy is. Some \neconomists tell us this has a very detrimental impact on the economy.\n  When you ask what you would restructure or adjust, would you hit the \n10-percent bracket, drive up taxes for low-income people, or would you \nhurt small business tax relief and kill the engine that creates most of \nthe jobs, or would you eliminate the refundable child tax credit so \nparents, where both parents work, would have additional costs of \nworking, and maybe one of them would have to leave the workforce, or do \nyou want to kill small business and farmers by not reforming\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\nthe estate tax, or do you want to penalize married people again by \ndoing away with the marriage penalty relief?\n  What about dividend and capital gains relief, one of the tax bills \nthat has brought $708 billion of new revenue because of increased \neconomic activity, because we are letting 70, 80 million taxpayers \ndecide how to spend their money instead of 16,000 corporate executives, \nif it is retained in the corporation instead of being given out in the \nform of dividends, or do you want to hurt people who are getting a \ncollege education because of the tuition tax credit or childcare \ngenerally?\n  In a smooth-running, with above-average levels of individual income \ntax as a percentage of gross domestic product, even with this tax \nrelief package in place since 2001 and 2003, what area, I ask the \npeople who want this to sunset and bring in more revenue because they \nwant to spend more, would they adjust? Where would they restructure? \nWhy undo a bipartisan tax cut that makes the Tax Code more progressive?\n\n  I say that without any hesitation whatsoever based upon the judgment \nof the Joint Committee on Taxation that those making more than $200,000 \na year are paying a higher percentage of income tax than they were \nprior to the 2001 tax cut. As things stand right now, based upon the \nbudget resolution that passed this body last month, bipartisan tax \nrelief is in danger. The Democratic Senate has only provided for 44 \npercent of the tax relief beyond 2010, and the Democratic House has not \nprovided for any. I am sure much will be said of the high cost of tax \nrelief, but those comments are inherently misleading. My colleagues \nneed to think about the high cost to the American taxpayers when they \nare hit with the largest tax increase in the history of the country \nthat is going to happen without even a vote of the Congress.\n  Federal revenues are already at historically high levels, and if \nsomething is not done soon Americans will be hit with an additional \nwall of tax increases, January 1, 2011. If what some have called tax \ncuts for the rich expire, a family of four with incomes of $40,000 will \nface an average tax increase of $2,052.\n  In order to protect the interests of working Americans, our \ncollective Republican leadership has introduced a bill, S. 14, called \nthe Invest in America Act, to ensure that this largest tax increase in \nhistory does not go into effect. This bill will help small businesses. \nIt is going to help families afford college. It will help seniors who \nrely on capital gains or dividends for income. It will help working \nparents take care of their children.\n  Why doesn't the Democratic House want to do any of these things? \nWhich 44 percent of tax relief does the Democratic Senate have in mind? \nWhen I say this Republican leadership bill invests in America, it \nmaintains existing tax policy. It is going to make sure the taxpayer \ndoesn't run up against this tax increase wall.\n  I want to end today, as I did in some remarks I made last week, by \nurging the Democratic caucus to tear down this wall. The Republican \nCongress is eager to work with them in bipartisan cooperation to \npromote a progressive and fair Tax Code and to prevent a wall of tax \nincreases from crushing the American taxpayer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, may I ask, what is the business, what is \nthe regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to S. 378.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                   Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the vote we had earlier today on the Medicare noninterference \nprovision, which prohibits the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services from getting involved in the negotiations between \nthe private plans offering the Medicare drug benefit and the drug \nmanufacturers.\n  I did not vote for cloture today because I support the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. The benefit is working well. Seniors have \naccess to drugs. They are saving money, and most beneficiaries are \nhappy with the benefit. Removing the noninterference provisions, as the \nDemocrats want to do in S. 3, would jeopardize the Medicare drug \nbenefit and could force beneficiaries to rely on a one-size-fits-all \nbig Government bureaucracy for their prescription drugs.\n  I was a strong supporter of the 2003 Medicare drug bill and worked \nvery hard to get it passed. For too long, Medicare had not covered \nprescription drugs for seniors, even though many of these drugs are \nlife sustaining and life enhancing. Since the drug bill was enacted, \nall Medicare beneficiaries have access to prescription drug coverage, \nand low-income beneficiaries receive substantial help in affording \ntheir prescription drugs.\n  One of the most important elements in the 2003 bill was allowing \nprivate plans to offer the prescription drug benefit. Under the bill, \nthese plans negotiate with drug manufacturers for the prices on \nprescription drugs, and then market their benefits to beneficiaries.\n  Medicare beneficiaries have a choice of plans to select. In my State \nof Kentucky, there are 24 companies offering 54 plans. All of these \nplans are different, and each one of them offers a different formulary. \nPlans compete with each other by offering the best benefit, which may \nnot mean the same thing to all 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. Some \nbeneficiaries may not have many drug expenses each month, so they can \ngo with a cheaper plan. Other beneficiaries may have more costly drug \nexpenses and may need a plan that offers more coverage.\n  The point of having private companies offer the drug benefit was so \nseniors could pick the plan that works best for them. It is working, \nand seniors are saving a substantial amount of money. In fact, the \naverage beneficiary is saving about $1,200. Ninety percent of Medicare-\neligible beneficiaries have drug coverage, and 80 percent of them are \nsatisfied with the program.\n  To me, this sounds like a success--a real success. Part of this \nsuccess comes from the fact that we kept the Medicare bureaucrats out \nof the program. Traditionally, Medicare is a one-size-fits-all program \nthat sets prices for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, hospice care, \nambulance providers--you name it.\n  Medicare beneficiaries should ask their doctors the next time they \nsee them how fairly Medicare reimburses them. I suspect most doctors \nwould say their reimbursements fall short of their actual costs, and \nthey are constantly on the lookout for ways Medicare may try to change \ntheir reimbursement for the services they offer.\n  The drug benefit, however, is different. It allows the drug plans to \nnegotiate directly with the manufacturers for prescription drugs. These \nplans, then, have to attract Medicare beneficiaries to join their \nprogram by offering the best possible benefit. A plan that does not \noffer a competitive benefit will not attract members. A plan that \noffers an attractive benefit will attract members to its rolls.\n  It is simple--really, it is--and it is working. The Democrats would \nhave you believe Government negotiation is going to save money for \nMedicare and seniors. Unfortunately, they are wrong.\n  First of all, saying Medicare will ``negotiate'' is a \nfallacy. Medicare does not negotiate; it sets prices. Just ask your \ndoctor how often the Medicare Program negotiates.\n\n  Second, the Democrats haven't said a word about how this new \nauthority would actually work. There wasn't one word in S. 3 about what \nthis negotiation would look like. Is Medicare going to negotiate for \nonly a few drugs, as some Members have suggested? No one knows. Are \nthey negotiating prices for all drugs? No one knows. Will the Secretary \nactually deny access to certain drugs if he doesn't get the price he \nwants? No one knows. It seems to me that before you undermine a \nsuccessful, well-received program such as the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit, you better have the guts to tell people exactly how it is \ngoing to change.\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\n  Third, there is a real concern by experts in this area that \nGovernment price-setting for Medicare drugs could cause drug prices to \nincrease for other payors, including Medicaid, the Veterans' \nAdministration, and private purchasers. This hardly seems like a good \nplan.\n  Finally, the Congressional Budget Office has said repeatedly over the \nyears that removing this provision has a negligible effect on Federal \nspending. In fact, CBO Directors under both Republican- and now \nDemocratic-controlled Congresses have come to the same conclusion. \nWithout Medicare creating a national formulary and limiting access to \ndrugs, it is unlikely they would be able to get a significant discount \non drugs.\n  I also wish to point out that this provision isn't new. In fact, \nprior to the passage of the 2003 Medicare drug bill, many Members of \nCongress had proposals to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. \nMany of these bills, including those by Democratic lawmakers, included \na noninterference provision. For example, the former Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, in the Senate had a bill in 2000 that included such a \nprovision. This bill was cosponsored by 26 Democratic Members still \nserving in Congress, including the current chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus. It is curious that this language was fine \nfor Democratic bills but for some reason isn't fine presently for this \nbill.\n  The Medicare drug bill we passed in 2003 is working well. \nBeneficiaries have access to drugs, and people are saving money. Now is \nnot the time to significantly alter the program and rip out the \ncompetition that is working so well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Cloture Motions\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning, in one of the newspapers \nthat covers Capitol Hill, there was a story with some complaints by the \nminority and the leader of the minority that the majority is filing \nwhat are called cloture motions. We are, in fact, filing cloture \nmotions, and the reason we are doing it is because the minority doesn't \nwant to move to debate the issues.\n  To give you an example, in recent days, we have had to file a cloture \nmotion to have a vote on the Intelligence Authorization Bill. It turned \nout the minority, in nearly a unanimous vote, succeeded in blocking our \nability to even debate the bill. That was the motion to proceed on the \ndebate, not the debate itself. The question is: Shall we proceed to \ndebate reauthorization of intelligence? The minority said we won't give \nyou the permission to approve the motion to proceed. We are going to \nhave to have you file cloture on that. We will then have a cloture vote \nand 40-plus will decide to march in against it. So you cannot proceed \non the intelligence reauthorization.\n  On the issue of negotiating lower prescription drug prices, the \nminority says we won't allow you to go to the bill to negotiate lower \ndrug prices under Medicare. You have to vote on a motion to proceed. \nThey come over and, by and large, oppose the motion to proceed so we \ncannot go to negotiating lower drug prices for Medicare.\n  About an hour or two ago, we had to have a vote on going to the issue \nof court security--security in our court system. They required us to \nfile cloture and have a vote on the motion to proceed to going to \nsecurity for America's court system. It is unbelievable.\n  Let me go back for a moment on this issue of intelligence. They \nrequired us to file cloture on the motion to proceed. If there is \nanything critically needed by this Congress and this country--\nespecially this country--it is to get this issue of intelligence right. \nWhy is that important? We live in a very dangerous world. We face a lot \nof threats and challenges. We have been through the last half decade or \nmore in a circumstance where the intelligence function in our \nGovernment has dramatically failed. The consequences of that have been \nlife or death. Here are some examples:\n  We went to war with Iraq. We had many top secret briefings prior to \nthe war given by our intelligence officials and top members of the \nadministration. They told us, for example, that the country of Iraq \nthreatened this country because it had mobile chemical weapons labs. \nThey gave us substantial information about mobile chemical weapons labs \nin Iraq. It turns out now, much later, we discover that in fact those \nso-called laboratories didn't exist. The information our intelligence \ncommunity gave Congress came from one source, a man who was named \n``Curve Ball,'' who was largely considered to be a drunk and a \nfabricator. A single source--someone considered to have been a drunk \nand a fabricator--convinced our intelligence community and this \nadministration to tell us and the American people that Iraq threatened \nthis country because they had mobile chemical weapons labs. We now \nunderstand that wasn't true, but it was part of the foundation upon \nwhich a decision was made to go to war.\n  Aluminum tubes for the reconstruction of a nuclear weapons program in \nIraq--we were told there was a nuclear weapons program, the \nreconstruction of which will threaten our country and threaten the \nworld. It turns out the administration and the intelligence community \ntold us a half truth. Some in the administration felt the aluminum \ntubes specifically ordered by Iraq were for the purpose of \nreconstructing a nuclear capability. Others in the administration felt \nequally strongly that there was no such thing involved, that it was for \nrocketry; it didn't have anything to do with the reconstruction of a \nnuclear weapons program. The intelligence community did not tell \nCongress about that portion of the debate.\n  Yellowcake from Niger. The President told the Congress in briefings \nand intelligence sources upstairs that Iraq was attempting to procure \nyellowcake from Niger for the purpose of reconstituting its nuclear \ncapability. It turns out that was based on falsified documents, \nfraudulent documents. Based on a lot of information, including \nyellowcake from Niger, and allegations about Iraq trying to secure it, \naluminum tubes purchased it was alleged for the purpose of \nreconstructing a nuclear capability, or mobile chemical weapons labs, \nreports of which came from apparently one source, a single source, a \ndrunk and fabricator who used to drive a taxicab in Baghdad. That was \nthe basis, at least in part, on which to build a foundation that told \nthis country a threat exists against the United States and we must take \nmilitary action against the country of Iraq.\n  We know what has happened in the interim. This war with Iraq has cost \nan unbelievable amount of money and lives. It has cost this country \ndearly around the world. Now we are in a situation where, according to \nthe latest National Intelligence Estimate that there is a civil war in \nIraq. That is a combined judgment of all of the intelligence sources in \nour country and the top intelligence officers and folks in the \nadministration.\n  It is not, as the President seems to suggest, the fight against al-\nQaida in Iraq. Our National Intelligence Estimate tells us what it is. \nIt is sectarian violence. There is some presence of al-Qaida in Anbar \nProvince in Iraq, but principally what is happening in Iraq is not \nabout al-Qaida and terrorists; it is about sectarian violence, \ncommitting acts of terror--Sunni against Shia and Shia against Sunni--\nand the most unbelievable acts of terror you can imagine.\n\n  In fact, the head of our intelligence has since said this, that the \ngreatest terrorist threat to our country is with al-Qaida and its \nleadership, which is in a secure hideaway in Pakistan. These are the \npeople who boasted about murdering innocent Americans on 9/11/2001. No, \nthey have not been brought to justice. They are, according to the head \nof our intelligence services, in a secure hideaway in Pakistan.\n  What, then, should be our greatest goal? What should be our priority? \nContinuing in a civil war in Iraq, having our troops in the middle of a \ncivil\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nwar in Iraq? Or deciding we are going to go after the terrorists who \nrepresent the greatest threat to our country, al-Qaida? That is not \nfrom me. The description of that comes from the head of our \nintelligence services in this country.\n  I have described the mistakes that were made. In fact, there was no \noversight, of course, in the last few years in the Congress, none at \nall--no hearings, no oversight to talk about this. So I held oversight \nhearings as chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee. One day, I had \nfour people come before the committee who previously had worked for the \nCIA, and others. One of whom was COL Larry Wilkerson, who served 17 \nyears as a top assistant to Colin Powell, including when he was \nSecretary of State. He was there when the presentation was made at the \nUnited Nations. He said later that was the perpetration of a hoax on \nthe American people.\n  I cannot pretend to know what went wrong or how. I know in the \naftermath that this Congress, with the majority that existed last year, \nheld no oversight hearings and didn't seem to care, wanted to keep it \nbehind the curtain. I know this, however: Going forward, this country's \nfuture and this country's security depends on good intelligence. It \ndepends on our getting it right, and it depends on our knowing what is \nhappening. Reauthorizing the intelligence functions of our Government \nis critical.\n  It undermines our soldiers, in my judgment, for us not to take action \nto provide the very finest intelligence that can be available to us \nthrough reauthorizing our intelligence functions. It should have been \ndone before, but it wasn't. It is brought to the floor now, but it will \nnot be allowed to be debated because the minority says they don't want \nto reauthorize the intelligence functions under these conditions. I \ndon't understand that. I think that shortchanges the American people.\n  But it is not just intelligence. Earlier today, the minority said we \nwill not allow you to move forward on a domestic issue, and that is \nhaving the American people feel as though their Government is giving \nthem the best deal possible by negotiating decent prices with the \npharmaceutical industry for drugs that are purchased under Medicare. We \nhoped to have a debate about that. In 2000, the drug companies, the \npharmaceutical companies, ran an advertising campaign in this country \nin support of creating a Medicare drug benefit. This is what they said: \nThey touted a study that said private drug insurance will lower prices \n30 to 39 percent. That is what they said.\n  We understand about prices. Mr. President, let me, if I might, show \nyou two bottles that formerly contained medicine. This is Lipitor. The \nAmerican people understand about drug pricing and the unfairness to the \nAmerican people. This is a drug produced in Ireland. A lot of people \ntake it to lower their cholesterol. These bottles are, as you can see, \nidentical. They held tablets of Lipitor, made in the same plant, FDA \napproved--exactly the same medicine. The difference is this one was \nactually sent to Canada to be sold. This one was sent to the United \nStates. Well, this one was twice as expensive to the U.S. consumer. The \nsame pill made by the same company, made in the same manufacturing \nplant, sold in two different places--one in Canada and one in the \nUnited States--and Americans were told you pay double. And it is not \njust Canada. Almost any country I could name will be paying lower \nprices for the same drugs, because the American consumer is charged the \nhighest prices.\n  We have legislation to try to respond to that. There is plenty of \nopposition in this Chamber. The first step in dealing with this is for \nthe Government, as the institution that created the prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare, to be using its capability to buy in large \nquantities to reduce the price by negotiating with the pharmaceutical \nindustry. But when the prescription drug plan for Medicare was put into \nplace in this Chamber, then the Republicans in the majority said: We \nare going to prohibit the Federal Government from negotiating lower \nprices with the pharmaceutical industry.\n  That is almost unbelievable, when you think about it. Can you think \nof anybody in your hometown doing that--saying we are going to do \nbusiness with somebody, but we are going to be prohibited from \nnegotiating the best price? Well, nonetheless, that was the law, and so \nnow we are trying to change it to say, no, we believe the Federal \nGovernment ought to be allowed to negotiate better prices for quantity \ndiscounts. Yet, now the minority party will not even allow us to \ncontinue because they force a cloture vote on a motion to proceed--not \nthe bill itself, but on a motion to proceed to the bill--and they block \nit.\n  Well, the pharmaceutical industry had said if we pass prescription \ndrug benefits in the Medicare Program, it would lower prices 30 to 39 \npercent. Has it done that? Well, no. I will give you examples: From \nNovember 2005 to April 2006--that is a half year--the prices charged \nfor the 20 drugs most frequently prescribed to senior citizens \nincreased by 3.7 percent, or about four times the rate of inflation. In \nthe first quarter of 2006, drug prices shot up 3.9 percent, the highest \nfirst quarter increase in drug pricing in 6 years.\n  Now, some of my colleagues will argue that private plans are doing a \nterrific job of negotiating with drug companies. Well, we recently did \na study on this subject. We did a study of 53 stand-alone Part D plans \nthat are available in my State. We looked at the prices these plans \npaid for the 25 drugs most frequently prescribed to senior citizens. If \nthose senior citizens bought the drugs at average Part D prices, it was \n$829. If you walked into the pharmacy downtown, it was $845. At Costco, \nit was $814. Where is the 30 to 39-percent discount here because the \nFederal Government has now become a giant purchaser? We used to get \ndiscounts under Medicaid--still do, in fact, under Medicaid, but those \nlow-income senior citizens who migrated from Medicaid to Medicare mean \nwe now pay more because we don't negotiate for lower prices with the \nprescription drug industry under Medicare. And that is the problem.\n\n  If all Secretary Leavitt would do as Secretary of HHS is to buy part \nD prescription drugs from Main Street pharmacies, Medicare will save \nmoney. I don't understand why those who are self-labeled as \nconservative would not be on the side of having the Federal Government \nmake the best deal it can to save money when it is making bulk \npurchases of prescription drugs.\n  I understand part of what is happening. Part of what is happening is \nthe pharmaceutical industry has a great deal of clout, and there is \nsupport for them in this Chamber. I don't come to the floor denigrating \nthe industry. I don't like their pricing policies. I have told them \nthat. The pharmaceutical industry produces some lifesaving medicine, \nsome of it with research paid for by the American taxpayers through the \nNational Institutes of Health and other venues, and some of it through \ntheir own research investment. They produce lifesaving medicines, and \ngood for them. But lifesaving prescription drugs offer no miracles to \nthose who can't afford to buy them, and pricing is an issue for all \nAmericans.\n  With respect to the issue of senior citizens who are getting their \nprescription drugs now under the Medicare Program, pricing is an issue \nfor the taxpayers because we are paying a much higher price than we \nshould if we were to buy prescription drugs as we do in the veterans \nsystem, in the VA system. They are allowed to negotiate for lower \nprices in the VA system, and the result is dramatic.\n  We pay much lower prices for those prescription drugs because the \nFederal Government, as a very large producer, has the clout to \nnegotiate lower prices. The Government is prevented specifically by law \nfrom doing the same thing with respect to the Medicare Part D Program, \nand it makes no sense at all.\n  I started by saying the minority party is now complaining in the \nnewspapers this morning about the number of cloture motions that are \nfiled in this Chamber. That is inconvenient, apparently, or they don't \nlike it. I understand. But the fact is, the very party that complains \nabout the cloture motions is objecting even to moving to a motion to \nproceed.\n  The motion is not shall we debate this issue, the motion is shall we \nproceed to the issue for a debate, and they are requiring that we file \na cloture motion because they will not debate the motion to proceed, \nlet alone the issue itself.\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\n  It was interesting that after the cloture motion failed on the motion \nto proceed because the minority blocked it, we had some people come to \nthe floor to speak about the issue this morning to defend the \npharmaceutical industry and say: No, the Federal Government shouldn't \nnegotiate. It seems to me if they wanted to speak about the issue, why \nwouldn't they support the motion to proceed so we could actually get on \nthe debate and they could debate on the issue rather than debate \noutside of what they have prevented?\n  I don't understand that. Maybe I shouldn't say that. I guess I do \nunderstand it. The complaint about our being required to file cloture \nmotions comes from those who don't want to apparently go to \nintelligence reauthorization. They don't want to debate that bill, so \nthey blocked it. They don't want to debate a provision that will allow \nus to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, so they blocked that \nbill. They forced us to have a vote on the motion to proceed on \nproviding court security, for God's sake, in the shadow of the \nunspeakable tragedy and the heartbreak all of us feel with what has \nhappened at Virginia Tech. The issue of court security ought not be \ncontroversial. Why on Earth should we be forced to file a cloture \nmotion? Why should there be required a vote on the motion to proceed to \nsomething such as this issue? It doesn't make any sense.\n  The fact is, I have always said I think both political parties \ncontribute something to this country. I believe that. We ought to get \nthe best of what each can contribute to this country rather than what \nwe often do, the worst of each. The best of what both parties can \ncontribute to this country would give this country something to feel \nproud about. We ought to bring these issues to the floor of the Senate. \nYes, reauthorize intelligence, yes, allow us to debate the issue of why \nshouldn't we negotiate lower priced prescription drugs on behalf of the \ntaxpayers and on behalf of the American citizens. I held a hearing this \nmorning on international trade. Yes, let's have that debate on the \nfloor of the Senate. Why are we drowning in an $832 billion trade \ndeficit? Why are American jobs being shipped off to China?\n  Let's have these debates on the floor of the Senate. Let's bring the \nbills out and have these debates rather than have exercises to try to \nblock anybody from getting anything done. That is what has been \nhappening. Block people from getting anything done and then go complain \nto the press that nothing is getting done--that is a very self-\nfulfilling prophecy but not very genuine, in my judgment.\n  I hope in the coming days and weeks--we have 6 weeks or so before \nthere is a period of a few days off during the Memorial Day break--my \nhope is that during this period of time, we can move forward on some of \nthese issues on the floor of the Senate, have aggressive debates, and \ntry to get the best ideas that could come from both Republicans and \nDemocrats and put them in legislation that will advance this country's \ninterests.\n  This country deserves that debate on fiscal policy, on trade policy, \non foreign policy, on a whole range of issues. This country deserves \nthat from this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                        Tragedy at Virginia Tech\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with an incredibly heavy \nheart to talk about the tragedy at Virginia Tech. Today families and \nloved ones across the Nation are grieving. A community, a college, and \na nation are struggling to mourn the loss of more than 30 of its best \nand brightest.\n  I rise to speak today because, as we know, it is not just Virginia \nthat is suffering, but this is a pain that is felt all across the \ncountry. This tragedy hit particularly close to home in New Jersey. At \nleast three New Jersey families have suffered unspeakable losses. They \nare enduring any parent's worst nightmare--losing a child.\n  These three young people had yet to carve out their path in life, but \neach had promising ambitions, dreams they hoped to fulfill, and diverse \ninterests that would, no doubt, have left their mark in this world.\n  Matt LaPorte, a 20-year-old from Dumont, was a talented student and \nmusician who hoped to serve in the Air Force. He was in the Air Force \nROTC attending Virginia Tech on a scholarship. A former Boy Scout, Matt \nwas known as a gifted cellist and was a drum major in his school's \nmarching band.\n  Julia Pryde, from Middletown, had graduated from Virginia Tech with a \ndegree in biological systems engineering and was working on her \nmaster's degree. She was drawn to environmental engineering and was \ninterested in clean water issues in South America, a passion that would \nno doubt have led her to further travel and work abroad. Friends have \ndescribed her as having a bright spirit and as someone who loved to see \nthe world.\n  Michael Pohle, Jr., from Flemington, was preparing to graduate in \njust a few weeks. A biochemistry major, he was working on finding a job \nthat was a good fit for him and that would keep him close to his \ngirlfriend Marcy, whom he had planned to marry. A natural athlete, he \nwas known for his outgoing personality and a glowing smile.\n  These were young, innocent, and promising lives lost in Monday's \nvicious attack. Those who knew and loved them may never be the same. We \ncannot mend the hole in the hearts of the families who are suffering, \nbut we can honor each life lost and carry on their memory.\n  I join all of my fellow New Jerseyans in offering my condolences to \nthe families and friends who knew and loved these three young people.\n  I also extend my thoughts and prayers to a fourth New Jersey family \nwho has been watching over their son, Sean McQuade. I join them in \nhoping and praying for his full recovery.\n  My heart goes out to all the families who are suffering because of \nthis senseless tragedy. Our Nation grieves with them, and we share in \ntheir sorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, this morning the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to proceed to the court security bill. Ninety-four \nSenators voted for cloture to bring debate to a close on the motion to \nproceed to the bill. Yet here we are still stuck in postcloture debate \nor, in fact, nondebate on that procedural step of going to the bill.\n  I have heard rumor that one Senator, a Senator on the Judiciary \nCommittee the panel that unanimously reported this very bill, now has \n10 amendments to propose. I say to him and to all Senators, that no \namendments can be offered until we get to the bill. This objection is \napparently what is preventing that.\n  Today, we may finally make progress on security in another important \nsetting by turning to the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, S. \n378. Frankly, this legislation should have been enacted last year but \nwas not. It should not be a struggle to enact these measures to improve \ncourt security. We are fortunate that we have not suffered another \nviolent assault on judges and their families.\n  It was 2 years ago when the mother and husband of Judge Joan Lefkow \nof Chicago were murdered in their home. Judge Lefkow's courageous \ntestimony in our committee hearing in May 2005 is something none of us \nwill forget. We witnessed the horrific violence at the courthouse in \nAtlanta in which a Georgia State court judge was killed. And then last \nyear there was the violence against a State judge in Nevada. Despite \nour efforts and the commitment of Senator Durbin and Senator Reid, \ndespite Senate passage of this measure twice last year, Congress has \nyet finally to enact these measures to improve court security.\n  I introduced this bipartisan measure on January 24, 2007, along with \nSenator Specter, the majority leader, Senator Durbin, Senator Cornyn, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator Schumer and Senator Collins. \nSenator Cardin also joined the bill as a cosponsor. House Judiciary \nChairman John Conyers introduced an identical measure in the House also \nwith bipartisan support. We hoped to send a signal with our bicameral, \nbipartisan introduction at the beginning of this year that we intended \nto move quickly to complete our work and increase legal protections for \nthe Judiciary and their families.\n  The Judiciary Committee then held a remarkable hearing in February \nwith Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That hearing reminded us \nall of\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\nthe need to provide resources and protections crucial to our Federal \nand State courts. We also discussed the critical need to preserve the \nindependence of our Federal Judiciary so that it can continue to serve \nas a bulwark protecting individual rights and liberty. As the Judiciary \nCommittee discussed in our hearings, the independent Judiciary faces \nmany types of threats. I take all of these threats seriously, from the \nthreats to judges' physical safety to rhetorical attacks by some \naffiliated with the political branches upon their independence. We \ncannot tolerate or excuse violence against judges, their families and \nthose who serve our justice system.\n  Nor should we excuse the overheated rhetoric that has become so \nprominent in political campaigns lately. During the last few years, \neven as judges have come under physical attacks, we have seen federal \njudges compared to the Ku Klux Klan, called ``the focus of evil,'' and \nin one unbelievable instance referred to as a threat ``more serious \nthan a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings.'' A prominent \ntelevision evangelist proclaimed the Federal Judiciary ``the worst \nthreat America has faced in 400 years--worse than Nazi Germany, Japan \nand the Civil War.'' We have seen some in Congress threaten the mass \nimpeachments of judges with whom they disagree and heard comment that \nviolence against judges could be brought on by their own rulings. That \nis irresponsible and dangerous.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has spoken out in recent years about the \ndanger of this rhetoric and criticized the uncivil tone of attacks on \nthe courts, noting that they pose a danger to the very independence of \nthe Federal Judiciary. Like Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy urged us \nto find a more civil discourse about judges and their decisions. This \nhigh-pitched partisan rhetoric should stop, not just for the sake of \nour judges, but also for the independence of the Judiciary. Judicial \nfairness and independence are essential if we are to maintain our \nfreedoms. During the last few years it has been the courts that have \nacted to protect our liberties and our Constitution. We ought to do all \nwe can to protect them, physically and institutionally.\n  We can take a significant step today by passing the Court Security \nImprovement Act. This bill responds to the needs expressed by the \nFederal Judiciary for a greater voice in working with the U.S. Marshals \nService to determine their security needs. It would enact new criminal \npenalties for the protections of judges, their families, and others \nperforming official duties, expand resources available to state courts \nfor their security, and provide additional protections for law \nenforcement officers.\n  Our Nation's Founders knew that without an independent Judiciary to \nprotect individual rights from the political branches of Government, \nthose rights and privileges would not be preserved. The courts are the \nultimate check and balance in our system. We need to do our part to \nensure that the dedicated women and men of our Judiciary have the \nresources, security, and independence necessary to fulfill their \ncrucial responsibilities. We owe it to our judges to better protect \nthem and their families from violence and to ensure that they have the \npeace of mind necessary to do their vital and difficult jobs. Our \nindependent Judiciary is the envy of the world, and we must take care \nto protect and preserve it so that it may preserve, protect and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States and the rights and liberties that \ndefine us as Americans.\n  I thank the majority leader for recognizing the significance of this \nbill and seeking to move to it. The Judiciary Committee voted \nunanimously to report the bill after its consideration. I have taken \ncare to report the bill favorably to the Senate with a committee \nreport, which has been available since last month.\n  I was disappointed that we could not gain the consent of the other \nside to adopt this measure, pass it and send it to the House for its \nconsideration last month. An anonymous Republican objection has stalled \nSenate action in that regard. Last week, the majority leader sought \nconsent to proceed to the bill, but that was prevented by Republican \nobjection. The Senate has been required to file a cloture petition in \norder to consider the majority leader's motion to move to this \nbipartisan, court security legislation.\n  I do not know exactly who has objected or why. It is unfortunate. I \nhave heard rumors that someone objects to the authorization for States, \nlocal governments, and Indian tribes to create and expand witness and \nvictim protection programs to prevent threats, intimidation, and \nretaliation against victims of, and witnesses to, violent crimes. That \nwas a provision contained in the court security bill we passed last \nyear. While other useful programs were required to be stripped from the \nbill, that one was retained when the Senate passed this measure last \nfall. I do not know why someone who agreed to that provision last year \nnow finds authorizing a victim program objectionable. We are about to \nhonor and recognize the importance of crime victims by commemorating \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week beginning this Sunday, April 22. I \nhope we can pass this bill with the authorization to prevent threats, \nintimidation and retaliation against victims of violent crime intact.\n  I look forward to Senate consideration and passage of this worthwhile \nlegislation. I hope that secret holds and extraneous proposals will not \nbe used to complicate its passage by the Senate and enactment by the \nCongress. We have a great deal to do. We have an ambitious agenda to \nassist the judicial branch. We need to extend needed temporary \njudgeships that are otherwise expiring and expired. We need to consider \nthe important issue of judicial pay. We will need next year to take a \ncomprehensive look at what additional judgeships are needed in the \nFederal Judiciary. I hope that those who have acted to delay us will \nwork with us and get down to business. It is past time to enact this \njudicial security legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for stating that the debate we are having on this bill isn't \nreally about the bill. The debate is about the process.\n  We had an election in November, and one of the things outlined by \nthat was that Americans are concerned with excessive spending. There \nare some big facts that face us. Our judiciary is not nearly as at risk \nas our children and grandchildren are from the lack of cogent and \ndisciplined spending by this body.\n  The reason we are at the place we are today is because I believe, and \nthe vast majority of Americans agree with me, that we have to have \npriorities in how we spend our money. For us to be good stewards of the \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars, we ought to establish priorities. This \nbill is a priority. I support the concepts behind the bill, and I will \ngo through them in a minute. But what should be a greater priority for \nus is that we offer our children and grandchildren the same \nopportunities, the same freedoms, and the same liberties we enjoy.\n  The way the Senate works is something I believe needs to be changed, \nand I am willing to stand out here on every bill that comes to this \nfloor to do exactly the same thing as I am going to do today. Here is \nthe little problem that nobody--or very few in the Senate--wants to \naddress. We react and create a good piece of legislation. This is a \ngood piece of legislation. But we don't do the other half of our job, \nand the other half of our job is to get rid of the things that aren't \nworking well.\n  Assume for a minute that every bill we authorize every year is done \nin a manner that says everything else in the Federal Government is \nworking well. First of all, you ask the average citizen, and they would \nsay: No, that isn't quite right. You go down, and everybody has a \ndifferent complaint. But the fact is, we continue to authorize, we \ncontinue to authorize, and we continue to authorize, but we never go \nback and look at what isn't working and deauthorize.\n  My complaint with this bill isn't with the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nHe was very cooperative in trying to address my desires for us to \ndeauthorize certain things that either have excess monies or programs \nthat aren't efficient or aren't working as they were intended to. \nHowever, when approaching the chairman of the committee, he refused to \neven consider the idea that\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nwe ought to deauthorize something that isn't working in order to create \nthis thing we all know is needed. It is a good piece of legislation, \nand we ought to pass it, and we will pass it. But the point that needs \nto be made to the American people, a point they agree with, is that \nauthorizing a new piece of legislation is only half of our job. As a \nmatter of fact, it shouldn't even be half. We ought to spend three-\nquarters of our time looking at what we are doing already that is \nauthorized and making sure it is working efficiently. I don't think \nanybody in their right mind would disagree with that.\n  We, in my subcommittee in the 109th Congress, along with Tom Carper, \nheld 49 oversight hearings on the Federal Government. What we found is \nthat of the discretionary budget, the non-Medicare, non-Social \nSecurity, non-Medicaid budget, $1 in every $5 we spend is either \nwasted, abused, defrauded, or duplicated. It hardly seems fair to a \nmiddle-income taxpayer out there, who only yesterday paid their taxes \nand got hit with an extra $1,500 or $2,000 under the AMT, that they \nwould have to pay that extra money at a time when we are allowing $1 \nout of every $5 to be wastefully spent, misspent, abused, or defrauded.\n  So the idea behind what I sent to all of my fellow Senators at the \nbeginning of the year--and the Senator from Vermont knows very well why \nI objected to coming to the floor without a motion to proceed, without \na cloture on that; it is because he represents what I think has to be \nchanged--that we have to be responsible stewards of the American \ntaxpayers' dollars, and we are not.\n  The idea is to change the culture of how we work. How do we do that? \nWell, we don't do it by continuing to pass new authorizations without \never looking at what could be deauthorized to pay for what we are \nauthorizing anew. What we do is we fail the test of being good stewards \nto the very people we represent. As I said, Senator Specter, the \nranking member on the Judiciary Committee, was very cooperative in \ntrying to find those offsets. I think he basically agrees with my \ncontention that we ought to be about doing good things, but we also \nought to be about getting rid of the things that aren't working.\n  It saddens me to think that all through this 110th Congress, I am \ngoing to be doing this on every new authorization that comes out here \nif my colleagues don't believe we ought to be changing the way we work. \nIt is a simple request. It is easy to find the offsets. As the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania knows, we had offsets for this bill in terms of \ndeauthorizations. They weren't acceptable to the chairman because he \ndisagrees with the underlying fundamental premise of what I believe is \nan absolute obligation for us in terms of being good stewards.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I sent a letter to every Member of \nthis body, and I outlined some principles under which I was going to \nwork in this Congress. I am dedicated to those principles, and it \ndoesn't have anything to do with me or anything to do with the parties. \nI don't care who is in the majority or who is in the minority.\n  It has to do with our future. That is what this is about. This is \nabout fighting for our future and having a long- range vision rather \nthan a short-term vision of putting out a fire somewhere.\n  The principles I outlined said that I would put a hold--and, by the \nway, the chairman this morning said there was an anonymous hold. That \nis not true. I very eloquently and directly communicated my hold on \nthis bill. And the letter I sent to everybody in the Senate at the \nbeginning of this Congress directed that I would be the one holding the \nbills. I said this:\n  If a bill creates or authorizes a new Federal program or activity, it \nmust not duplicate an existing program or activity without \ndeauthorizing the existing program. That is No. 1. And several bills I \nhad last year were duplications.\n  No. 2 is, if a bill authorizes new spending, it must be offset by \nreductions in real authorized spending elsewhere. How are we ever going \nto control our deficit? And we do not have, as the administration said, \na $170 billion deficit. Our real deficit, what we actually added to the \ndebt last year, what we actually added to our children's debt, \nwas about $340 billion. So when we are adding $340 billion every year \nto our kids' and grandkids' debt, isn't it incumbent upon us to do the \nnecessary things to make sure that doesn't happen in the future? Well, \none of the ways to do that is to look at programs which aren't working \nand are not effective and which do not need authorization.\n\n  What happens in the Senate is that the appropriators decide what will \nget spent and what won't get spent. But the authorizing committee, the \ncommittee that is charged with that area, never deauthorizes anything. \nSo we have this continuing mounting of authorization, with limited \ndollars to go for it, which never forces real priorities or a debate \nover the priorities by the authorizing committees.\n  The third point I made is that if a program or activity currently \nreceives funding from sources other than the Federal Government--i.e., \na match--then we shouldn't increase the role of the Federal Government \nin terms of increasing the percentage the Federal Government pays. Take \nour $340 billion deficit. Every State, save one, has a surplus. They \ndid last year, and they will this year. So if States have surpluses and \nwe have a deficit, we shouldn't increase our role. We shouldn't be \ndoing that.\n  Finally, if we create a new museum or some new cultural program, then \nwe ought to endow it rather than set it up for its continuing cost. We \nshould use the power of compound interest to help us save money in the \nfuture. If we really think something is important enough to invest in, \nwe should endow that and use the power of compound interest with the \nidea that the endowment will earn enough money to take care of that \nprogram in the future rather than passing that new program off to our \nkids.\n  Four very simple things that I ask.\n  I also stated in that letter that if I thought something was \nunconstitutional, then I would object to it, also. However, that \ndoesn't apply in this instance. There is a legitimate role for us here. \nThis is a good piece of legislation. But it does lack one of the \ncriteria under which I stated I would try to hold bills up. I have no \nintention of filibustering this bill. I have no intention of making it \ndifficult to pass the bill. I have every intention to make it an issue \nwith the American people that we are not doing our job and that we are \nbetter than that. We are better than that. The people in this body \ncare. The question is, Do we care enough to put the elbow grease into \ndoing what is necessary to preserve the future? I believe we do care. I \nbelieve we can, and I believe, with persistence--and the chairman and \nthe ranking member know that if there is anything I am about, it is \nabout being persistent--if it requires this type of structure in terms \nof bringing bills to the floor, then I am happy to oblige the Senate in \nthat to continue to make the point.\n  Almost 2 years ago, maybe more than 2 years ago, the infamous bridge \nto nowhere was brought to light, which bought about the changes we are \nseeing in earmarks. It was one example, which really wasn't a fair \nexample to the Senator who had that, but nevertheless it characterized \nand became the caricature for the bad habits we have in Congress.\n  My hope is that the American people will look at the commonsense \napproach I am trying to propose for us as we authorize new programs and \nsay: That makes sense. Why would you continue funding things that don't \nwork? Why would you continue authorizations for programs that aren't \neffective? Why would you continue authorizations for programs that are \nduplicative? Where one works good and one not so good, why shouldn't we \nput money into something that works good rather than not quite so good?\n  So the question is not whether we should have court security. Of \ncourse we should. The question is not whether this bill should pass. It \nshould. The question is, How do we address this fact?\n  Every child who is born in this country today, every one of them, has \na birth tax on them. It is now at $453,000 a child.\n\n  People say: How do you get that?\n  You take the $70 trillion in unfunded liabilities that we are going \nto transfer to this next 200 million children, and you can see what \nthey are liable for.\n  Take 10 percent interest. If you took a 10-percent interest rate on \n$453,000,\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nsimple interest, to pay the interest on the debt, to cover what we are \nleaving to our children and grandchildren, is $45,300 a year.\n  The greatest moral question in our country today is not the war in \nIraq, it is not who marries whom, it is not abortion, it is not child \nabuse, it is stealing the opportunity and the heritage this country has \ngiven us and taking that away from our children and grandchildren.\n  I know the Senator from Vermont is not happy with me for doing this. \nHe believes it is fruitless. But it is the very real difference between \nhe and I. I believe there is plenty in the Federal Government that is \nnot working right that we ought to be about fixing, and one of the ways \nwe do that is by forcing ourselves, before we do a new program, to look \nat the old programs and see what is wrong with them and clean them up. \nYou can debate that. You can object to it. But the fact is, the vast \nmajority of Americans agree with that.\n  We are going to be going through this multiple times this year until \nwe get to the fact that we are doing what our oath tells us to do. That \noath is to the Constitution. We cannot fulfill that oath if we continue \nto waste money on ineffective programs and authorize programs that are \nnot accomplishing their goals. It is an oath that we violate, an oath \nto the Constitution but, more important, it is an oath we violate to \nthe very people who sent us here.\n  Every dollar we waste today is a dollar that is not going to reduce \nthat $453,000 for our children and grandchildren. One of the greatest \njoys I have in life today is that I have four grandchildren, each one \nof them unique, and the great pleasure of seeing your children through \nyour grandchildren and reliving memories. That is always couched in the \nidea of what can I do to make sure the future is fair and a great \nopportunity is made available to them and all their peers throughout \nthis country, no matter where they come from, what family they come \nfrom. Shouldn't they all have the same opportunities?\n  If you read what David Walker, the Comptroller General of the United \nStates, has to say--and all you have to do is go on the Web site of the \nGovernment Accountability Office--what you find is we are on an \nunsustainable course. It is not what Tom Coburn says, it is what the \nhead of the Government Accountability Office says. Things have to \nchange. Every day we wait to change them costs us money and makes it \nmore painful when we get around to changing them.\n  I plan, in a moment, on offering to proceed to the bill. We are out \nhere today because the vision that was created for us, and the heritage \nthat was created for us, is at risk. It is at risk because we do not \nwant to change our culture. We don't want to be responsible. We want to \npass but not oversee. We want to do the easy but not the hard. The hard \nis the thing that is going to secure the future for our children and \nour grandchildren.\n  It is easy for us to pass a port security bill. It is bipartisan. It \nis hard for us to do the very real work of making sure every penny, of \nthe American taxpayers' dollars is spent in an efficient way, that it \nis not wasted.\n  Mr. President, if you think $1 in $5 of the discretionary budget of \nthis country should not be wasted, if you think the Congress ought to \nbe about looking at everything and saying, is it working, ought to be \nabout getting rid of the $200 billion of waste, fraud, abuse, and \nduplication that is in our Federal Government today, then there is no \nway you could disagree with the principles I outlined to all the \nSenators in this body. Yet we find ourselves here at this point in time \nbecause the chairman of the Judiciary Committee refuses to agree with \nthe premise that we owe it to our children and grandchildren. That is \nbasically it because I am not about to do that. We do not believe that \nis necessary.\n  Something has to change if we are going to give our children and our \ngrandchildren the benefits and the opportunity we have all experienced. \nI think that is worth taking some time on the floor, pushing the \nenvelope to raise the awareness of the American people. I know I can't \nchange this body through persuasion, through words. But what does \nchange this body is the American people. The American people are the \nones who send us here. If they will act, if they will put pressure on, \nthen we will do what we are supposed to do. It is a shame we have to \nwork it that way, but this last election proved that. It proved when we \nare not doing what we are supposed to be doing, the American people \nawaken, and they change who has the power, who has the representation.\n  What I am calling for is let's do that for the American people. Let's \ndo it ahead of time. Let's not make them force a change, let's do what \nwe were sent up to do.\n  With that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I make a motion to proceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending. Is there further \ndebate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4653-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4653-S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COURT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of S. 378, the \nCourt Security Improvement Act. But before I do, I wish to address \nremarks made this morning by the majority whip, the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, for whom I have a lot of respect, but I have to \ntell you, I disagree with those comments, and I wish to take a few \nmoments to explain why.\n  Throughout his comments, the Senator repeated the theme that \nRepublicans were stopping debate on the floor and not allowing bills to \nbe debated. I disagree with him, and I believe nothing could be farther \nfrom the truth. The truth is, as I see it, the majority has tried to \nforce things through the Senate, and they have done so in a way that \nhas denied the minority an opportunity to offer amendments and to allow \nthis body, the so-called world's greatest deliberative body, to\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\neven have votes and make decisions on those important amendments.\n  This morning, the Democratic whip talked about our Founders' intent \nthat ``minority rights would always be respected.'' In this body, \nminority rights are not being respected. That is the problem. So we \nhave no choice but to assert the last protection against majority \ntyranny; that is, to object or vote against invoking cloture or closing \noff debate.\n  In the past, the majority has used cloture when necessary to move a \nbill forward, after debate has been exhausted, but the minority refuses \nto allow movement on the legislation. I think that is a perfectly \nlegitimate use of the cloture motion.\n  By this date in the 109th Congress--the Congress just preceding the \ncurrent Congress--Republicans, when they were in the majority, had \nfiled cloture four times. In the 108th Congress--the immediately \npreceding Congress--at this point in time, when Republicans were in the \nmajority, Republicans had filed cloture five times. In the 107th \nCongress, Republicans only filed cloture one time at this point in \ntime.\n  By comparison, since the Democrats have now become the new majority \nin the Senate, Democrats have filed cloture 22 times. The question \nnaturally arises: Why are Democrats using this divisive tactic so \nfrequently to close off debate?\n  Well, I think my colleague from Illinois disclosed the reason this \nmorning when he stated:\n\n       Ultimately, they will be held accountable for their \n     strategy. That is what elections are all about.\n\n  It is the view from this Senator, from my perspective, the Democrats \nare using this tactic to paint Republicans as obstructionists, when the \nexact opposite is true. The new Democratic majority in the Senate is \nrefusing to allow full and fair debate on issue after issue and, more \nimportantly, denying us an opportunity to offer amendments on important \nlegislation and to simply have an up-or-down vote on those amendments.\n  I can tell you, from my perspective, Republicans do not enjoy the \nprocedural clash any more than Democrats do. But it is necessary to \nprotect this institution and, even more importantly, necessary to \nprotect the rights afforded in the Senate to the minority.\n  We have been eager to engage in full debate, and we understand the \nrules that majorities will prevail when majorities have an opportunity \nto vote. But the rules do not permit the new majority, the Democrats, \nto unilaterally set the terms for the debate. Until the Democratic \nmajority recognizes all Members of this body have the right to debate \nlegislation, to offer amendments, and to have votes on those \namendments, we will continue in this standoff.\n  It is true, I believe, that only the majority--the new Democratic \nmajority--can fix this problem by simply allowing full debate to go \nforward and by allowing up-or-down votes on amendments on the Senate \nfloor, which requires discussions, which requires negotiations, and, \nyes, it requires compromise.\n  Filing cloture--closing off debate--is an intensely aggressive move. \nIt says: We do not want to hear your opinions. We do not want to hear \nyour views. We do not want to consider your ideas on how to improve the \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate. We want to shut down the \ndebate, and we want to shove this legislation through the Senate. It is \na ``my way or the highway'' approach to legislation. And do you know \nwhat. It does not work.\n  I would point out--and I guess it is fair to say if you have been in \nthe Senate long enough--and I have not--but I have been told, if you \nhave been in the Senate long enough, you will find yourself, at some \npoints in your career, on the side of the majority, and at other times \nyou will find yourself on the side of the minority. It is the way it \nworks.\n  Last Congress, when Democrats were in the minority, they insisted \nthat the filing of cloture turned the Senate into the House of \nRepresentatives--a refusal to allow open and broad debate, with hard \nmajority rule. Here they are now, though, attempting to cut off debate \nat, it seems, almost every possible turn. It is the reason--and this is \nthe consequence of it; it is not just complaining about it; this is the \nconsequence that has a very real impact on the American people because \nthe new majority, the Democratic majority, has refused an opportunity \nfor full and fair debate and votes on amendments--that is the reason \nwhy Democrats have not sent any real legislation to the President for \nhis signature after 3 months in power. They have chosen the hard edge \nof party politics instead of bipartisanship.\n\n  Our Democratic friends have chosen to pursue this agenda driven by \ncampaign rhetoric instead of seeking the broad middle ground and trying \nto negotiate and to pass legislation on behalf of the American people. \nIt is true that Democrats won the last election--and my congratulations \nto them--on a message of bipartisanship, on a message of, let's get \nthings done. But their choices to date have not reflected any effort to \nseriously reach across the aisle to do that.\n  One example that comes to mind is on Iraq. My colleague from Illinois \nclaimed:\n\n       We were stopped, stopped by the Republican minority. They \n     would not allow us to go to the substance of that debate. \n     They didn't want the Senate to spend its time on the floor \n     considering a resolution, going on record as to whether we \n     approve or disapprove of the President's action.\n\n  The fact is, completely the opposite occurred. Republicans on this \nincredibly important debate asked only that we be allowed to discuss \nthe issue fully, and the Democratic majority repeatedly attempted to \nram through their resolution without offering any alternatives or any \nopportunity for alternative resolutions to be considered and voted on. \nWe explained this on the Senate floor over and over during that \ndiscussion, but our colleagues in the majority simply turned a deaf ear \nto our concerns. When they finally allowed several options to be \nconsidered, we were able to have a full debate we had been asking for \nall along, and then the process moved forward.\n  I would point out that was on the 20th iteration of the resolutions \non Iraq before we had an opportunity to have that debate, a vote, and \nto move the process forward.\n  My colleague from Illinois repeated several times this morning his \nhope that we could ``find some ways to establish bipartisan \ncooperation.''\n  I say to my colleague, there is a way to do that. The majority must \nstop trying to ram legislation through and allow us to debate openly \nand to file relevant amendments and allow an up-or-down vote on those \namendments.\n  My colleague from Illinois talked about the ``do-nothing Congress'' \nof last year--that was his phraseology--and placed sole blame for the \ncurrent majority's lack of accomplishments on the minority's refusal to \ninvoke cloture or close off debate. The Washington Post just this \nmorning reported that only 26 percent of the public thinks the current \nDemocratic majority in Congress has accomplished ``a great deal'' or \n``a good amount.''\n  The fact is, this approach to legislating has not produced a single \npiece of significant legislation so far in this Congress due to the \nlack of bipartisanship and due to the lack of opportunity the minority \nhas had to fully participate in the debate and shaping of legislation. \nOf the 17 laws enacted this Congress, 10 of those are naming of Federal \nproperties. Let me say that again. Of the 17 pieces of legislation \nenacted in this Congress so far, 10 of them involve naming of Federal \nproperties, Federal buildings, post offices and the like. Not one of \nthe ``six for '06'' campaign promises has been passed by Congress.\n  The majority, to be sure, is blaming the minority for the lack of \nprogress here based on the result of cloture votes, but let's look at \nthe facts.\n  On the 9/11 bill, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the \nHouse and the Senate passed different bills. Democratic leadership in \nneither body has brought up the other's bill so that those might be \nresolved in a conference committee.\n  On the minimum wage bill, the House and the Senate passed different \nversions, but no conferees have been appointed by either body.\n  On the emergency war supplemental, perhaps the most urgent piece of \nlegislation we could possibly pass and send to the President to support \nthe troops who are in harm's way as I speak, the House and the Senate \npassed different versions of the bill. The House, fresh off of a 2-week \nrecess, has yet to appoint conferees to start working out\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nthe differences between the bills to get funding to our troops. This is \nespecially damaging and reckless, considering the majority is insisting \nwe send a bill to the President that has a timeline for withdrawal, a \nprovision that has caused the President to promise to veto that \nlegislation. That means before the troops can get the money they need--\nin other words, to get them the equipment they need during this war--\nbefore we can get them the money, we have to come up with a bill the \nPresident will sign. Yet the Democratic majority has continued to play \npolitics and stall the bill.\n  On stem cell research, no conferees have been appointed. The same for \nthe budget. The same for lobbying reform. The list goes on and on.\n  The distinguished Senator from Illinois, the Democratic whip, \nexplained that due to the numbers in this body:\n\n       On any given day, if we're going to pass or consider \n     important legislation, it has to be bipartisan.\n\n  And that:\n\n       If we're going to be constructive in the United States \n     Senate, we need much more bipartisan cooperation.\n\n  He continued, saying:\n\n       We should come together, Democrats and Republicans, and \n     compromise and cooperate.\n\n  And asking,\n\n       Isn't it time we really start out on a new day in the \n     Congress trying to find bipartisan ways to cooperate and \n     solve the real problems that face our country?\n\n  To that I say amen. It is past time for the new majority in this body \nto stop acting like they are Members of the House of Representatives \nwho are going to be able to force their will by a simple majority \nthrough the Senate because this is not the House. This is the Senate. \nThe only way we are going to be able to get any legislation passed is \nthrough bipartisan cooperation. The only way we are going to get that \ncooperation is to meet in the middle somehow, to debate as our \nconstituents would expect us to debate, to take positions--yes, firmly \nheld positions--based on our convictions. But then ultimately we need \nto have votes on amendments and votes on legislation and let the \nmajority prevail. Let's send the bills to the President for his \nsignature. That is the way it is supposed to work. That is the way it \nhas not been working, but we know the way forward.\n  I have to tell my colleagues that I and my Republican colleagues \nwould welcome the opportunity to sit down on a bipartisan basis and to \nreach a consensus on important issues such as how to preserve our \nentitlement programs, including Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare \nby protecting their long-term solvency. How do we avoid passing the \nbills incurred by the baby boomer generation on down to our children \nand grandchildren? How can we expand health care access to more \nAmericans? How can we solve our broken immigration system, along with \nthe broken borders that pose a national security risk to each and every \nAmerican citizen? After all, I have to believe that is the reason we \nran for public office. That is the reason we wanted to be elected to \nserve in the Senate--whether we are a Republican or a Democrat--to make \na difference for the American people, to make our country a better \nplace, and to make tomorrow better for our children and grandchildren \nthan it is today. Instead, we spend day after day taking partisan votes \nthat lead to nothing but gridlock. This is the choice of the majority, \nnot the choice of the minority.\n  After the first 100 days, the Congress is, again, at a fork in the \nroad. So far the new majority has taken the path of partisanship, but \nwe know that will not get us down the road to progress. I hope during \nthe second 100 days of this new Congress, the new majority will pause \nand decide to take the road less traveled--the road of cooperation and \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on the Court Security \nImprovement Act, a bill of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. As we \nhave already heard, this bill is designed to address the critical issue \nof the security of our judges and courthouse personnel. I have to add \nas a personal note, this is not a matter of just some academic interest \nto me. I believe I am correct in that I am the only current Member of \nthe Senate who has served as a member of the judiciary, in my case for \n13 years in our State court system in Texas, both at the trial bench \nand at the Texas Supreme Court level. So this is more than a matter of \nacademic interest to me. Protecting our men and women who personify the \nrule of law and all that it means is very important.\n  The dedicated men and women who work in America's courthouses, from \nthe judges to the court reporters to the bailiffs, preside each day \nover difficult, contentious, and sometimes very emotional disputes.\n  These public servants, just like our police, are placed in harm's way \nby the very nature of their jobs. They fulfill essential roles that \nkeep our democracy running smoothly, and I have the greatest respect \nfor the people who try to do this job and try to do it well.\n  Unfortunately, violence directed at public servants is on the rise, \nfrom escalating violence against police officers to courthouse \nattacks--including in my State of Texas--these despicable actions \nthreaten the administration of justice and threaten our ability to \ninvoke the rule of law.\n  This Congress has the power, and now we must exercise it, to ensure \nthat certain and swift punishment awaits those who engage in these \nunconscionable acts of violence. The administration of justice--indeed, \nthe health of our very democracy--depends on our ability to attract \ndedicated public servants to work at our courthouses. So we must do \neverything in our power to provide adequate security to these men and \nwomen who are too often targeted for violence or harassment simply \nbecause of the position they hold and the decisions they are called \nupon to make.\n  As a former attorney general in my State, I had the responsibility of \ndefending sentences on appeal of certain defendants who had been found \nguilty of violent acts. So I am acutely aware of the devastating \neffects criminal acts of violence have on not only the victims \nthemselves but also on their families. Because I also used to be a \njudge, I am fortunate to have a number of close personal friends who \ncontinue to serve on our benches and work at our courthouses. I \npersonally know judges and their families who have been victims of \nviolence, and I have grieved with those victims and their families.\n  Our judges are impartial umpires of the law. We know they cannot help \nbut disappoint some people because that is what they do--they make \ndecisions. They determine winners and losers. Judges, witnesses, and \ncourthouse personnel must not face threats and violence for simply \ndoing their job.\n  The protection of the men and women who compose our judicial system \nand serve the public and law enforcement is essential to the proper \nadministration of justice in our country. This important bill takes big \nsteps toward providing additional protections on these dedicated public \nservants. I urge my colleagues to give it their full support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Supreme Court Ruling on Abortion Ban\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this morning, I heard my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Brownback, on the floor speaking about the decision \nof the Supreme Court. He and I both chair the Senate's Cancer \nCoalition, so it has been a great pleasure for me to work with him. But \nwe have very different views when it comes to a woman's right to \nchoose, and I would like to rise today to express my concern and deep \ndismay regarding the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Gonzales \nv. Carhart.\n  This judgment today is a major strike against a woman's right to \nchoose. The Court, in this case, by a narrow 5-to-4 margin, has \nessentially enacted the first Federal abortion ban in this country and \nhas struck down a primary requirement of Roe v. Wade--protection of the \nhealth of a mother.\n  In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\n\n       Today's decision is alarming. It refuses to take Casey and \n     Stenberg seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, Federal \n     intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary \n     and proper in certain cases by the American College of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecologists. It blurs the line firmly drawn \n     in Casey between pre-viability and post- viability abortions. \n     And for the first time since Roe, the court blesses a \n     prohibition with no exception safeguarding a woman's health.\n\n  This is simply shocking. It is shocking because this can affect any \nsecond-trimester abortion.\n  Just 7 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down this very ban in \nStenberg v. Carhart in the year 2000. It struck it down out of concern \nthat it did not provide adequate protections for a woman's health and \nthat the law enacted was too vague. The Federal courts, the Fifth and \nthe Ninth Circuits, have all examined this and opposed it. No Federal \nCourt has upheld this abortion ban until today.\n  Now, what has changed in the 7 years? The answer is nothing, except \nthe composition of the Court. The additions of Chief Justice Roberts \nand Justice Alito have accomplished what the Bush administration has \nsought from its earliest days--a court willing to further restrict a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  When they appeared before the Judiciary Committee during their \nconfirmation hearings, both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito \naffirmed their respect for stare decisis as preeminent and a \ncontrolling factor. In these hearings, Chief Justice Roberts said, and \nI quote:\n\n       People expect that the law is going to be what the court \n     has told them the law is going to be. And that's an important \n     consideration.\n\n  Justice Alito said, and I quote:\n\n       I've agreed, I think numerous times during these hearings, \n     that when a decision is reaffirmed, that strengthens its \n     value as stare decisis.\n  With Justice O'Connor no longer on the Court, the majority of \nJustices ignored what Senator Specter referred to as ``super \nprecedent'' in these hearings.\n  As Justice Ginsburg points out:\n\n       The Court admits that ``moral concerns'' are at work, \n     concerns that could yield prohibitions on any abortions.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       Instead, the Court deprives women of the right to make an \n     autonomous choice, even at the expense of their safety. This \n     way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women's place \n     in the family and under the Constitution--ideas that have \n     long since been discredited.\n\n  The Court, now filled with Bush appointees, is replacing the judicial \nprecedent that they promised to respect for their definition of \nmorality. That is where I see us as being today. With this ruling, the \nSupreme Court has substituted the medical decisions of politicians for \nthat of doctors.\n  In the Congressional findings of the legislation creating this ban, \nas well as the majority opinion of the Court, politicians and Justices \ndecided what procedures are medically necessary and which are not. \nJustice Kennedy wrote, in today's majority decision, that the Court \nassumed the abortion ban would ``be unconstitutional if it subjected \nwomen to significant health risks.'' He goes on to declare ``safe \nmedical options are available.''\n  However, doctors who perform these procedures disagree. The American \nCollege of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the group that represents more \nthan 90 percent of all OB/GYN specialists in the country, assembled an \nexpert panel that identified several specific instances in which this \nprocedure, intact dilation and extraction, has meaningful safety \nadvantages over other medical options.\n  The procedure is safer for women with serious underlying medical \nconditions, including liver disease, bleeding and clotting disorders, \nand compromised immune systems.\n  Experts also testified that this procedure is significantly safer for \nwomen carrying fetuses with certain abnormalities, including severe \nhydrocephalus. That is when the head fills with water and is very often \nlarger than the body. In these rare and heartbreaking cases in which a \nwoman learns that something has gone tragically wrong in a pregnancy \nshe very much wanted, no woman should be forced to bear the added \nburden of undergoing a medical procedure that is not the safest option.\n  The decision today unquestionably breaks new ground. I am extremely \nconcerned that this has opened the door to a further judicial \ninterference in what should be private medical decisions made by women, \ntheir partners, their religious beliefs, and their doctors. With this \ndecision, the Roberts Court is signaling a new willingness to uphold \nadditional restrictions on abortion, even those that do not expressly \nprotect a woman's health. This is dangerous.\n  The Roberts Court has also opened the door for a major change in how \nit will determine whether a law unconstitutionally restricts a woman's \nrights. Generally, laws have been struck down when they are \nunconstitutional on their face, because if a law is unconstitutional \nfor 10 people or 10 million people, then it should not stand. The Court \nis turning that analysis on its head. The Court's opinion today says it \nmay uphold laws, even when they may be unconstitutional.\n  This means that in the future a woman could be put in an untenable \nsituation. A woman facing a health crisis needs to act within days or \nweeks but instead would need to depend on the legal system. Let me give \nyou an example.\n  A woman learns her pregnancy has gone tragically wrong and her health \nis at risk. She is told by the doctor that there exists a medical \nprocedure that would help her, but it is banned. The alternatives will \nrisk her health.\n  She has to go to court and argue that her constitutional rights, in \nthis specific instance, have been violated.\n  We all know the wheels of justice spin slowly. It is doubtful the \nsystem could respond in a timely manner to a woman in this kind of \ncrisis. If she can prove her case, she might be allowed to have the \nprocedure, but the ban itself would still remain in place, requiring \nthe next woman in a similar situation to have to successfully \ndemonstrate that the law is unconstitutional. This is amazing. The \nCourt, in effect, is requiring that women's health be at risk until it \ndeems enough women have demonstrated the negative impact of the law on \nthem. Requiring this type of legal challenge to any restriction on \nabortion will impact women in the most vulnerable situations.\n  I would like, for a moment, to quote Justice Ginsburg. She points \nout:\n\n       Those views, this Court made clear in Casey, ``are no \n     longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the \n     individual, or the Constitution.'' . . . Women, it is now \n     acknowledged, have the talent, capacity, and right ``to \n     participate equally in the social life of this Nation.''\n\n  In this, incidentally, she is quoting Sandra Day O'Connor in places \nin an earlier decision.\n\n       Their ability to realize their full potential, the Court \n     recognized, is intimately connected to ``their ability to \n     control their reproductive lives.'' . . . Thus, legal \n     challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do \n     not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; \n     rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her \n     life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature.\n       In keeping with this comprehension of the right to \n     reproductive choice, the Court has consistently required that \n     laws regulating abortion, at any stage of pregnancy and in \n     all cases, safeguard a woman's health.\n\n  This is now out the window. It is monumental.\n  In conclusion, I remember what it was like when abortion was illegal \nin America. It was when I was a college student at Stanford. I watched \nthe passing of the plate to collect money so young women could go to \nTijuana for an abortion. I knew a woman who ended her life because she \nwas pregnant. In the 1960s, while abortion was still illegal, as a \nmember of the California Board of Terms and Parole, I sentenced women \nconvicted of illegally performing abortions. I saw the morbidity that \nthey caused by their procedures. It was barbaric in those days. So I am \nvery concerned with this ruling.\n  The Court is taking the first major step back to these days of 30, 40 \nyears ago. Young women today have not had these experiences. They have \nlived only in an era in which the Court recognized their autonomy, \ntheir right to make their own medical decisions. If I were a young \nwoman today, I would be incredibly concerned that this era is drawing \nto a close. The threat on reproductive freedom is no longer \ntheoretical. Today it is very real. All those who care about protecting \na woman's right to privacy should take notice and make their voices \nheard.\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the minority allowing \nus to move to this bill, this most important bill, dealing with court \nsecurity. But here we go again; nothing happening on it. I am willing \nto have Democrats and Republicans debate these amendments. There have \nbeen some that have been filed but not offered.\n  I just left a meeting in my office with the head of the U.S. Marshals \nService. His name is John Clark. He indicated to me, among other \nthings, that this year there has been a 17-percent increase in the \nthreats against our Federal judges, Supreme Court Justices, and all our \nother Federal judges; about 11,000, I think that is what he told me. I \nmay have that number a little bit wrong; I just left him a minute ago.\n  This is important legislation. It allows our Federal judges not to \nhave to list the names of their children, where they live, where the \nindividual judge lives. We had in Illinois a terrible situation where \none of these disgruntled defendants in a criminal case went to some \njudge's home and waited for the family to come home and killed them.\n  We need to move this bill. I don't want a hue and cry from the \nminority that we are not allowing amendments; we want amendments. If \npeople want to amend this bill, let them do it. But I am going to file \ncloture on this bill tonight for a Friday cloture vote. We have got to \ncomplete legislation around here. We cannot come here each day and sit \naround looking at each other. We should be doing some legislating.\n  If people do not like this bipartisan bill that is now before the \nSenate, offer an amendment to change it. I am not going to give my \nspeech--I have given it too many times--on our being thwarted in \nefforts to move forward on improving the intelligence services of this \ncountry. I don't need to give a speech about our inability to negotiate \nfor lower prices of prescription drugs. But we are now on court \nsecurity. I had to file cloture on that. After cloture was invoked, \nthey allowed us to move to the bill, saving us 27 hours or 28 hours on \nit. I do not think it is appropriate that we stand around here today \nand tomorrow.\n  We have a bill that is bipartisan to its very core, a competitiveness \nbill. Senator Bingaman, a Democrat, and Senator Alexander, a \nRepublican, have worked on this bill. This is their pride and joy. It \nis the legislation that will improve this country's ability to be more \ncompetitive scientifically. I want to move to that bill and finish it \nthis week. I cannot while this is still around with nothing being done \non it.\n  I alert everyone within the sound of my voice, if you don't like this \nbill, come and amend it. Lay down an amendment and we will debate it, \nwe will table it, we will approve it, we will vote, and it won't be \npassed.\n  But our judges, our U.S. Marshals, our U.S. attorneys need this. In \nmy heart I so understand the importance. I said this morning here, this \nlegislation will also help State courts, not only Federal courts. In \nWashoe County, Reno, NV, a divorce proceeding was going forward. A very \nrich man, quite frankly, didn't like what was happening in the divorce \nproceeding, so this man killed his wife in her home--they were \ndivorced, his ex-wife. The child was in the house, and he took her in \nthe garage, slit her throat, killed her, took the car, drove to a \ngarage, took his hunting rifle, and from 200 yards from a parking lot \nshot through a window and hit the judge.\n  That window should have had bulletproof glass in it. It didn't. This \nbill will allow local jurisdictions to have the ability to obtain items \nsuch as bulletproof glass.\n  We are living in a violent society. We have to, with our judiciary, \nwhich is so independent and strong, do what we can to protect it. I was \nin Ecuador with a congressional delegation. The President of that \ncountry, when I told him a little story--and we were in the Embassy. \nThe President of Ecuador was standing next to me, and I told him about \nthe 2000 Presidential election.\n  I said: You know, that is an interesting election. President Bush got \nless votes than the person he beat. The matter went to Florida where \nthere was so much confusion and consternation in counting the votes \nthere. The matter worked its way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt decided that George Bush would be President of the United States. \nThe minute that was done, I said, in Ecuador: George Bush became my \nPresident.\n  In our great country, which is ruled by law, not by men, there was \nnot a tire burned, a window broken, a demonstration held, because we \nare a country of laws, and George Bush became everybody's President. I \ndid not like the decision of the Supreme Court; I disagreed with it. \nBut that is the law, that is the law of our country.\n  When I finished, the President of Ecuador said: I only wish we had a \ncourt system like yours.\n  That is what this bill is all about, to try to have our court system \none that is as strong as it has been.\n  So if my friends on the other side of the aisle come here and say, as \nthey have done on a number of occasions: Well, we didn't have a chance \nto offer an amendment--we finished this vote early today. They have had \nall day to offer all of the amendments they wanted. Democrats had every \nopportunity, if they do not like this bill, to offer an amendment to \nchange it. But we are going to complete this bill by Friday one way or \nthe other.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is possible under the rules that when we vote \non Friday on cloture on the bill--we are on the bill now. It could be \n30 hours, but everyone here should understand, we are going to be in \nsession 30 hours after cloture is invoked.\n  We are not going to play around here, and think, well, we will finish \nit next week. We are going to finish this bill this week, if it takes \nSaturday or Sunday or whatever it takes, and everyone should understand \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate at this time is \na bill to make our courts safer. This is an issue we take personally in \nChicago because in 2005, one of our most respected Federal judges had \nher mother and husband killed in her home, murdered by an upset \nindividual who didn't like the way he was treated in a courtroom. He \nstalked her family, invaded her home, killed her aging mother, and \nhusband, who was the love of her life. I know this judge because I \nappointed her to the Federal bench. I have met her daughters and I know \nher close friends in Chicago. I think about her every time the issue of \ncourt security comes up. She is a wonderful woman who has devoted her \nlife to public service. She has put in the time that we expect from \nreal professionals. She has done her best to be fair and just. She \nworks hard. We owe her security in the workplace and security for her \nfamily.\n  That is why Senator Obama and I introduced an appropriations bill \nright after this happened, trying to put some money into the U.S. \nMarshals Service to protect judges across the United States. That is \nwhat this bill is all about. There is nothing partisan about this \nlegislation. There is nothing even controversial about it. This bill \nshould have been passed quickly, sent to the House and approved because \nit makes a better effort to protect these judges in their homes, gives \nmore resources to U.S. marshals, puts stiffer penalties in for those \nwho harass and shoot at and kill those who serve us in the judiciary. \nThis is basic common sense. Instead of taking up this bill and passing \nit quickly, as we should have to get it in place and to put the \nprotections in place, it has been slowed down.\n  One of our colleagues is exercising his rights under the Senate \nrules. I said earlier I will fight for him to have the right to speak \nit, on any bill, to offer\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nan amendment to it, to express himself, and to have the Senate decide \nfinally what the decision will be on his amendment. I respect his right \nto do that. But instead we are going to slow this bill down for 2 days. \nWe will have amendments filed, six, and they are just going to sit on \nthe desk while the clock runs. Instead of moving to other legislation \nwhich is critically important we will just sit here. That is unfair. I \ndon't think that is consistent with what the American people expect of \nthe Senate.\n  I have called on my colleagues, the one who has six amendments filed \nand any who have other amendments, please bring them to the floor right \nnow, within the next hour. Let's start the debate right now. Let's set \nthem for a vote as quickly as possible. Let's stop these stall tactics \non bills as basic as this, protecting the personal security of judges \nacross America.\n  It is time for us to get down to business in the Senate. Look around \nat all the empty chairs. Look for the person who sponsored the \namendments to this bill. You won't find him.\n  It is time for us to get down to business in the Senate. People \nexpect us to. This week has been a pretty horrible week when you look \nat it. We came in here trying to pass a bill that would authorize \nintelligence agencies across our Government to make America safer, 16 \ndifferent intelligence agencies, a bipartisan bill, worked on long and \nhard by Senator Rockefeller, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nand his staff, and Senator Bond and his staff. The bill was ready to \ngo, a bill which should have passed years ago, stopped in its tracks by \nthe Republican minority that said, no. Vice President Cheney objects to \na provision in the bill relative to the interrogation of prisoners; \nimagine that he would raise that issue again. Therefore, all \nRepublicans, with maybe a couple exceptions, are going to stop debate \non the bill. That was strike 1.\n  Strike 2, a provision to amend the Medicare Prescription Drug Act so \nthat we could have more competition and lower prices for seniors and \ndisabled when they buy drugs. Some agree with it; some disagree. The \npharmaceutical industry hates it; it cuts into their profits. It was \nworth a debate to see whether we could help seniors pay for their drugs \nand lower prices. But, no, the Republican minority said: No, we are not \ngoing to even debate that. We won't let you go to that. It is within \ntheir power to stop us, and they did it again.\n  Now comes this bill for court security, and for the third strike this \nweek, the Republicans have said: No, we want to slow you down. We want \nto run out the clock. We want to put amendments on the table and not \ncall them for consideration.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear what the Republican game plan is. \nWe have seen it this week on three pieces of legislation. We see it \nwith this bill. I have spoken to majority leader Senator Reid who spoke \nmoments ago. We have important business to do. In fact, we have \nbusiness which is very bipartisan. This bill, which has been slowed \ndown by one Republican Senator, has as cosponsors Senators Specter, \nCornyn, Collins, and Hatch, all Republican Senators. It is a bipartisan \nbill. It is not even controversial. Why aren't we doing this? It isn't \nas if there are other things going on on the Senate floor. We are \nwaiting on the Senators who want to stop or slow down this bill to \nfinally come and do their business. It is not too much to ask. I \nunderstand we are all busy. From time to time we have to leave the Hill \nto go to a committee meeting. I know I filed an amendment and waited a \nwhile to call it. But now this Senator has had his time. He has had the \nwhole day. We should call up one amendment before we go home, just in \ngood faith, to indicate that this is really a serious effort, that \nthere is a substantive reason to slow down this important legislation. \nWe need to remind our colleagues of our responsibility to do the \npeople's business.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  I just joined the majority leader and others in meeting with the \nPresident of the United States to talk about the war in Iraq. I am glad \nwe had this meeting. We didn't reach a new agreement or compromise. I \nwish we had. We started a dialog, and that is important. There were \nheartfelt emotions expressed at that meeting by many of us on both \nsides of the issue, by the President, as well as by Senator Reid and \nmyself and many others. Speaker Pelosi was there. The majority leader \nof the House, Steny Hoyer, was in attendance, as was Jim Clyborn, the \nmajority whip, and the Republican leadership. We talked about the war \nin Iraq at length and where we need to go.\n  It is our belief that if we don't include language in the \nappropriations bill which says to the Iraqis that we are not going to \nstay there indefinitely, they are going to drag their feet forever when \nit comes to making the political reforms that are necessary. We are \ngoing to leave our soldiers stuck in the middle of a civil war. Mr. \nPresident, 3,311 Americans have died in service to this country while \nserving in Iraq. These are our best and bravest. They have given their \nlives, and they continue to give their lives while we debate and delay. \nIt is time for us to move forward.\n  I suggested to the President in the moments that I had to express my \npoint of view, if he won't accept a timetable for starting to bring \nAmerican troops home, can't we at least hold the Iraqis to the \ntimetable that they have offered us for political reform? They have \nmissed deadline after deadline. They promised to bring their country \ntogether. They promised to bring their army into a leadership that will \nbe effective. They have promised to try to resolve the old differences \nfrom the Baath Party under Saddam Hussein. Promise after promise after \npromise they have failed to keep while our soldiers fight and die every \nsingle day.\n\n\n                                 Darfur\n\n  Despite the obvious differences from that meeting, there was one \nhopeful sign. We started the meeting, and I began by praising President \nBush for delivering a speech today at the U.S. Holocaust Museum on the \nsubject of the genocide in Darfur. It was the appropriate venue for the \nspeech. The Holocaust Museum offers a powerful backdrop to consider the \nhorrors of genocide. I am glad the President made this speech. I \napplaud him for making it. I had hoped that he would be a little bit \nstronger, but I understand, speaking personally with the President, \nthat he wants to give new U.N. General Secretary Ban Ki-moon some time \nto use his office effectively.\n  The President essentially today, though, by every measure, gave Sudan \na final warning, and it is about time. The President stated that within \na ``short period of time,'' to use his words, President Bashir of Sudan \nmust take the following steps: Allow the deployment of the full joint \nAfrican Union-United Nations peacekeeping force in the area of Darfur \nwhere somewhere near 400,000 people have been murdered and over 2 \nmillion displaced. The President of Sudan must also end support for the \nJingaweit militia, reach out to rebel leaders, allow humanitarian aid \nto reach the people of Darfur, and end his obstructionism. If he does \nnot, President Bush stated, the United States will respond.\n  First, the U.S. will tighten economic sanctions on the Sudanese \nGovernment and the companies it controls. Second, the President will \nalso levy sanctions against individuals who are responsible for the \nviolence. Third, the U.S. will introduce a new U.N. Security Council \nresolution to apply multilateral sanctions against the Government of \nSudan and impose an expanded arms embargo. This resolution will impose \na ban on Sudanese offensive military flights over Darfur.\n  Last fall the President's special envoy talked about a January 1st \ndeadline after which the United States would impose sanctions that \nwould cripple the Sudanese oil industry. That deadline is months behind \nus, and the sanctions the President outlined are not as potent as they \nmight be in terms of truly hitting the oil industry as I hoped they \nwould.\n  The U.N. resolution and multilateral sanctions would be a major step \nforward. If we don't see rapid progress from the Sudanese Government, I \nurge the President to both introduce the U.N. resolution and to call \nfor a vote. Let's put the countries of the world on notice that they \nmust stand and be on the record on ending this genocide in Darfur.\n  As I said, I understand President Bush is responding to a special \nrequest\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nfrom U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who asked for some more time to \nnegotiate. All I can say is, I hope the Secretary General's faith that \nreal progress is being made is justified. At least on paper there has \nbeen a breakthrough in the last few days. The Sudanese Government has \nreportedly agreed to allowing 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers to deploy. But we \nhave had promises like this in the past and no action.\n  China, Sudan's biggest supporter and biggest customer for its oil, \nhas also started taking mutant, limited, but proactive steps in recent \nweeks to convince the Sudanese to move forward on peacekeeping. China's \nAssistant Foreign Minister recently toured refugee camps full of people \nfrom Darfur who had fled their homes. That is not a typical stop on a \nChinese Government tour, a positive sign that China is not blind to the \nhuman rights abuses going on in Sudan. China has reportedly played an \nimportant role recently in urging the Sudanese Government to move \nforward.\n  At the same time, however, China continues to oppose sanctions even \nif Khartoum continues to obstruct peacekeeping. The Chinese Defense \nMinister recently announced that China is interested in developing \nmilitary cooperation with Sudan, whatever that could possibly mean. As \nfor Sudan, while Khartoum has said it will allow deployment of 3,000 \nU.N. peacekeepers, a new U.N. report details how the Sudanese \nGovernment is flying arms of heavy military equipment into Darfur.\n  This morning's New York Times has photographs of the Sudanese \npainting their airplanes to appear to be United Nations aircraft and \nAfrican Union aircraft so that they can deceptively ship arms into this \nregion that will be used to kill innocent people. That is the \ngovernment we are dealing with in Khartoum. Sudan has promised to allow \n3,000 U.N. peacekeepers and their equipment into Darfur. If it keeps \nthe promise this time, it would be a start, but what is needed, as the \nPresident said today at the Holocaust Museum, is the full 21,000 \ncombined U.N.-African Union force with the means and mandate to protect \nthe people of Darfur. The people of Darfur have waited long enough for \npeace and security and the end of genocide. Now is the time to act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am about to call up the managers' \namendment the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania and I have \nworked on.\n  So, Mr. President, I send to the desk, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Specter, an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is already a pending committee \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is currently \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is currently pending is a committee-\nreported amendment to the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would that be the Feinstein-Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the language on page 20, starting at \nline 22: ``Federal Judges For Courts Of Appeals.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 896\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe the managers' amendment is at the \ndesk. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 896.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                  (Purpose: To make technical changes)\n\n       On page 5, line 5, strike ``any other court'' and insert \n     ``the United States Tax Court''.\n       On page 5, line 10, after ``otherwise provide'' insert ``, \n     when requested by the chief judge of the Tax Court,''.\n       On page 5, line 13, strike ``person'' and insert \n     ``persons''.\n       On page 5, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       (c) Reimbursement.--The United States Tax Court shall \n     reimburse the United States Marshals Service for protection \n     provided under the amendments made by this section.\n       On page 7, line 13, strike ``Sec.  118.'' and insert \n     ``Sec.  119.''.\n       On page 9, strike line 1 and all that follows through the \n     matter following line 4 and insert the following:\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``119. Protection of individuals performing certain official duties.''.\n\n       On page 19, strike line 18 and insert the following:\n       (b) Construction.--For purposes of construing and applying \n     chapter 87 of title 5, United States Code, including any \n     adjustment of insurance rates by regulation or otherwise, the \n     following categories of judicial officers shall be deemed to \n     be judges of the United States as described under section \n     8701 of title 5, United States Code:\n       (1) Bankruptcy judges appointed under section 151 of title \n     28, United States Code.\n       (2) Magistrate judges appointed under section 631 of title \n     28, United States Code.\n       (3) Territorial district court judges appointed under \n     section 24 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1424b), \n     section 1(b) of the Act of November 8, 1877 (48 U.S.C. 1821), \n     or section 24(a) of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin \n     Islands (48 U.S.C. 1614(a)).\n       (4) Judges retired under section 377 of title 28, United \n     States Code.\n       (5) Judges retired under section 373 of title 28, United \n     States Code.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by\n       On page 20, line 6, strike ``magistrates'' and insert \n     ``magistrate judges''.\n       On page 20, line 9, strike ``MAGISTRATES'' and insert \n     ``MAGISTRATE JUDGES''.\n       On page 20, strike lines 17 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 505. FEDERAL JUDGES FOR COURTS OF APPEALS.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Specter, irons out a few remaining technical and jurisdictional \nissues relating to our Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. We are \noffering a managers' amendment that contains a few technical fixes, \nincluding grammatical changes and proper references to ``magistrate \njudges.''\n  This bipartisan amendment will make clear that additional protection \nprovided to the Tax Court by the Marshals Service shall be reimbursed \nby the funds allocated to the Tax Court. We also clarify the \nconstruction of which officers qualify as ``judges'' so that all \nFederal judges are treated the same with regard to life insurance.\n  Senator Lieberman raised an objection with regard to section 505, \nwhich provided for the reauthorization of the Ethics in Government Act. \nI understand that Chairman Lieberman is currently working to \nreauthorize that legislation, so Senator Specter and I have agreed to \nremove it from our court security bill.\n  I note for my colleagues that no major policy changes relating to \nimproving the security that our Federal judges receive appear in this \nmanagers' package. I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Specter, for working with me on this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment--\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there is a concern on the \nother side of the aisle, and as the one who has the floor at this \npoint, I withhold that request and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 891\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 891 be called up for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 891.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n                    offset the cost of new spending)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--(1) the national debt \n     of the United States of America now exceeds \n     $8,500,000,000;000;\n       (2) each United States citizen's share of this debt is \n     approximately $29,183;\n       (3) every cent that the United States Government borrows \n     and adds to this debt is money stolen from future generations \n     of Americans and from important programs, including Social \n     Security and Medicare on which our senior citizens depend for \n     their retirement security;\n       (4) the power of the purse belongs to Congress;\n       (5) Congress authorizes and appropriates all Federal \n     discretionary spending;\n       (6) for too long, Congress has simply borrowed more and \n     more money to pay for new spending, while Americans want \n     Congress to live within its means, using the same set of \n     common sense rules and restraints Americans face everyday; \n     because in the real world, families cannot follow Congress's \n     example and must make difficult decisions and set priorities \n     on how to spend their limited financial resources; and\n       (7) it is irresponsible for Congress to authorize new \n     spending for programs that will result in borrowing from \n     Social Security, Medicare, foreign nations, or future \n     generations of Americans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress has a moral obligation to offset the cost of \n     new government programs, initiatives, and authorizations.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It says: \nit is the sense of the Senate that we should not create new spending \nprograms when we have to borrow money to pay for them; that, in fact, \nwe ought to create priorities, that the priorities ought to be the same \ntype of priorities that everybody in this country has to face every day \nwith their own personal budget, that they cannot go out and use their \ncredit card without having a consequence.\n  This is a very simple amendment. I wish to read it thoroughly so \neverybody understands what the amendment says. It says the following:\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the national debt of the United States of America now \n     exceeds $8,500,000,000,000;\n       (2) each United States citizen's share of this debt--\n\nfrom the oldest to the youngest--\n\n       is approximately $29,183;\n       (3) every [penny] that the United States Government borrows \n     and adds to this debt is money [that will be borrowed] from \n     future generations of Americans and from important programs, \n     including Social Security and Medicare on which our senior \n     citizens depend for their retirement security;\n\n  It also states:\n\n       (4) the power of the purse belongs to Congress;\n       (5) Congress authorizes and appropriates all Federal \n     discretionary spending;\n       (6) for too long, Congress has simply borrowed more and \n     more money to pay for new spending, while Americans want \n     Congress to live within its means, using the same set of \n     common sense rules and restraints [every American faces] \n     everyday; because in the real world, families cannot follow \n     Congress's example and must make difficult decisions and set \n     priorities on how to spend their limited financial resources. \n     . . .\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would this also include the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars we have borrowed so far for the war in Iraq?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely. I agree with that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would this mean we would not be able to continue to borrow \nmoney for the war in Iraq?\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a sense of the Senate. I would be happy for us \nnot to borrow money. We had $200 billion a year in waste, fraud, abuse, \nand duplication outlined by the Federal Financial Management \nSubcommittee last year. Appropriators refused to look at that, ways to \nfund it. Mr. President, $200 billion--we could spend $100 billion on \nthe war and $100 billion to lower the deficit. I would be very happy to \napply this to everything we do. Every American has to do exactly the \nsame thing with their own budget every day.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could continue for a moment, without \nthe Senator losing his right to the floor. I share his concern about \nexpenditures. I wish we were back in the days of President Clinton, \nwhere we built up a surplus and started paying down the Federal debt; \nother than what a Republican-controlled Congress voted for, which has \ntripled the national debt.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator makes a great point. The realistic fact is, \nwe decreased the Federal debt $2 billion under the entire Clinton \nadministration. Mr. President, $2 billion. One year we had a true \nsurplus--a true surplus. That was the extent of it. And since then, and \nbefore then, we have borrowed the future of our children away.\n  To continue, this resolution states:\n\n       (7) it is irresponsible for Congress to authorize new \n     spending for programs that will result in borrowing from \n     Social Security. . . .\n\n  I say to Social Security recipients, we borrowed $140 billion, last \nyear, from Social Security to pay for things we were not willing to \neither trim down, make more efficient or eliminate in duplicative \nprograms.\n  We also are borrowing from foreign governments. That is affecting our \nfinancial status. But most importantly, we are borrowing from future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  The amendment states:\n\n       (b) . . . It is the sense of the Senate that Congress has a \n     moral obligation to offset the cost of new government \n     programs, initiatives, and authorizations.\n\n  It is very simple. A resolution has no impact of law. It says: We \nagree, here are the rules under which we ought to operate. It does not \nbind anybody. It says, if we are going to create new programs, we \neither ought to find a way where we do not borrow to pay for them or we \nought to offset them by eliminating ineffective programs.\n  In 2001, as the Senator rightly noted, the Federal debt per person in \nthis country was $21,000. It has risen almost $10,000 since 2001. A lot \nof people are quick to dismiss that figure, say it does not matter, we \nonly need to worry about the debt and the deficits as compared to the \neconomic growth in the size of our economy. A better rule of thumb is \nhow Government growth compares to the growth of wages and earnings. \nLast fiscal year alone, the real Federal deficit increased in excess of \n$300 billion--a debt our children and grandchildren will repay. So $7.2 \nbillion was spent each day, or $84,000 was spent per second--per \nsecond. If regular Americans must tighten their belts to live within \ntheir means, the Federal Government should do the same instead of \nauthorizing new spending without offsetting similar spending.\n\n  Last year's interest costs alone were 8 percent of the total Federal \nbudget. In contrast, the average American spends about 5 percent of \ntheir income as a percentage of their interest costs. The Federal \nGovernment spent $226 billion on interest costs alone. According to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, by the year 2030, interest will \nconsume 25 percent--25 percent--of the Federal debt.\n  So why do I bring this resolution to the floor? I bring the \nresolution to the floor to make the point that when we authorize new \nprograms, we ought to find the money to pay for them and we ought to \nreduce programs that aren't effective. We ought to look at the programs \nthat aren't accomplishing what we want them to, we ought to eliminate \nduplicate programs where one works well and one doesn't work quite so \nwell and put the money into the one that works well so we get good \nvalue for our dollars, and we ought to change the habits under which we \nwork so we can all accomplish what we would like to see.\n  I would like to see middle-income wages rise in this country at a \nrate faster than they rise for the wealthy\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nclass. I would like to see opportunity enhanced in this country. I \nwould like to see a balanced budget so we don't steal opportunity from \nour children and our grandchildren. I don't think most people disagree \nwith that.\n  The reason we are out here debating this is I had a simple request: \nLet's just find some deauthorization amendments so that when we bring \nthis new and very needed bill to the floor--and I agree and I think \neverybody on the Judiciary Committee agrees this is a good bill; it is \ngoing to pass--shouldn't we make some hard choices, just like every \nfamily makes? Instead, we choose not to. We decide we will pass a new \nbill. We will add $40 million a year to the cost to run the Government, \nbut we won't deauthorize anything that is out there that is not working \neffectively. We won't fix the improper payments that are going on in \nthis country to the tune of about $40 billion--that is billion with a \n``b.'' That is a thousand times more in improper payments than this \nbill costs. We won't do the hard work that is necessary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield to the Senator. By the way, I enjoyed \nthe Senator's speech on Darfur, and as the Senator from Illinois knows, \nI agree with him very much. I thank him for his efforts on the genocide \nthat is now occurring in Darfur.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. He has been a stalwart \nin the effort for Darfur.\n  I would like to read a sentence to the Senator from Oklahoma and ask \nhim what it means. It is a sentence from the underlying bill, which is \nan authorization bill. It relates to section 105. Here is what it says:\n\n       In addition to any other amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated for the U.S. Marshals Service, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated for the U.S. Marshals Service \n     to protect the judiciary $20 million for each of the fiscal \n     years 2007 through 2011.\n\n  Now I would like to ask the Senator this: If we pass this bill \nauthorizing $20 million to be appropriated to the U.S. Marshals Service \nto protect judges and then do not appropriate the money for that \npurpose, how much money will come out of the Federal Treasury going to \nthe U.S. Marshals pursuant to this bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. None.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator another question.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to answer it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Isn't that what this is all about?\n  Mr. COBURN. No, it is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. You were claiming a reauthorization----\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, here is what it is \nabout. The Senator from Illinois is a great advocate for those who are \nless fortunate in this country. That is what this is about. It is about \nchanging the habits of the Senate.\n  I understand the appropriations process. I understand the \nauthorization process. Changing the habits says we are not going to \nauthorize new programs until we have done our homework on the programs \nthat aren't effective. That is the whole purpose of this amendment.\n  I understand the Senator's consternation with my desire. I understand \nthat most people inside Washington disagree. But I also understand that \nmost people outside of Washington say that if you increase spending--\nauthorized spending, not appropriated spending but authorized \nspending--$40 million and never look at what you can deauthorize, \nwhenever we get to a surplus or when we get to a balanced budget, we \nare going to spend more money. We are not going to make the hard \nchoices. That is exactly what happens. We can disagree with that but, \nin fact, that is how we got an $8.9 trillion deficit. That is how we \nran a $300 billion-plus deficit this year. It is the process. It is the \nprocess where we have decided that authorization has minimal power to \ninfluence in this body and that appropriations has all power.\n\n  My point in making us debate this resolution on this bill and \nbringing it up is to say: Let's start the process where we start \nlooking, as our oath charges us to do, at what doesn't work. Let's \nbring a bill that authorizes something that is very good and bring a \nbill that deauthorizes something that might get funding even though it \nis not effective.\n  I will give an example: the COPS Program. It is a very good program. \nIt helps a lot of cities. Why shouldn't it be competitively bid? Why \nshouldn't the cities with the most need get the help with their police \nforce rather than the cities whose Members put an earmark in for the \nCOPS Program, and any money that doesn't go to true need comes back to \nthe Federal Treasury? Why wouldn't we do that? Because that is hard \nwork. Because we might alienate one group as we do what is best for \neverybody in America.\n  I understand the resistance to my efforts in challenging the way we \noperate in the Senate, and I understand the opposition to my techniques \nand methods in trying to accomplish that. However, as the Senator from \nIllinois knows, if I am a champion for anything, I am a champion for \nmaking sure we don't waste one penny anywhere. The best way to do that \nis to start having good habits in how we arrange what we are going to \nspend.\n  The fact is, it is very easy to find offsets in authorization because \nwe have three times as much authorized as we actually spend. So the \nSenator's point is exactly true, but it doesn't direct us down to the \nproblem. If we get in the habit of making the decision we are going to \nlook at the programs that don't work, we are going to deauthorize the \nprograms that don't work, guess what we will do. We eventually might \nget rid of the one $1 of every $5 on the discretionary side today that \nis either waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication--$1 in $5. No one in this \nbody blows 20 percent of their personal budget on stuff that doesn't \nmean anything or have any return. Yet in the discretionary budget, \neverything except Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, that is \nexactly what we do. It is exactly what we do. So why would we not say: \nLet's change. Let's fulfill an obligation to two generations from us \nnow. I know what I am doing today isn't going to have a great impact on \nthe next appropriations bill or the next one after that or the one \nafter that, but 5 years from now, it might have an impact.\n  The point is, let's live like everybody else out there. Let's not \ntake the credit card and not look at the things we really should be \nlooking at. Let's do some extra work. Let's try to accomplish what is \nbest for everybody in this country, no matter what their economic \nstation in life, no matter what their background, no matter what their \nposition is. They all have a limited budget. They have to make choices. \nThey have to make choices, and they have to prioritize things. The \nSenate doesn't; they just authorize another bill and never deauthorize \nanything else.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nrespect his fiscal conservatism. I respect his belief that our budget \ndeficit is a source of growing concern for all of us. He says we need \nto start with good habits. I believe we need to start with the right \nlanguage. We need to understand what the Senator is asking us to \nconsider.\n  He started by saying that no family in America has the luxury the \nFederal Government has of spending more than they bring in year after \nyear after year, which is what our deficit does at the Federal level. \nNo argument there. Let me use another family example. My wife and I \nhave raised three children. Occasionally, we have given them some \nchoices. A father could say to his son: You have $200 coming up for \nyour birthday. Here are the choices you can make: You can buy a new \nsuit--it wouldn't be a bad idea if you are going to go out for an \ninterview--or you can buy that bicycle you have had your eye on for a \nlong time that you want to take to college or I know you want to buy an \niPod. OK. Make a choice, but you only get $200. Make one of those \nchoices. I authorize your birthday gift to be spent on those three \nthings, but I will not appropriate--I will not give you the $200 for \nall three, only for one. Three choices are on the table; you only get \nto choose one.\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\n  Authorization bills put choices on the table, and then the \nappropriations bills make a choice. It doesn't mean my son is going to \nget $600 at the end of the day; he only gets $200. He has to make a \nchoice from the gifts I have authorized. The Senator from Oklahoma is \narguing that giving my son a choice of three things means he is going \nto demand all three and get them. Wrong. It is a matter of discipline \nwhen it comes to the appropriations process. The authorization process \nis not the problem. We could authorize much more than we ultimately \nspend, and we do, but in the final reckoning, the budget resolution \nsays you can only spend so much money. You can only spend $200 on your \nbirthday, I say to my son, even though you are being given three \nauthorized choices.\n\n  So when the Senator offers us this sense of the Senate, it sounds an \nawful lot like pay-go, which is now the process we are following in the \nSenate which says: If you want to spend some money, you have to find a \nway to increase a tax or cut spending in other areas. It is pay as you \ngo. But the Senator from Oklahoma applies it to authorizations. It is a \ndifferent world. Confusing the two is not going to help us reach a \nbalanced budget; confusing the two creates confusion. Authorization is \nnot appropriation.\n  Earmarks can be appropriations. I have seen them. I have done them. I \nhave announced them in press releases. I am happy to do so to bring \nmoney back to my State as best I can for good reasons, and I stand by \nthem and defend them. People challenge them. That is the nature of this \nbusiness as I consider it.\n  The bottom line is, if I am authorized to have three bridges in \nIllinois, authorized to have three bridges in Illinois and only have \nmoney for one bridge to be appropriated, I have to make a choice. The \npeople in my State have to make a choice. Life is about choices. It is \nnot about what I might choose; it is what I ultimately have to choose--\none bridge, one birthday gift. That is the appropriation. That is why \nthis is so different.\n  Ordinarily, this resolution, until it gets to its resolved sense-of-\nthe-Senate clause, is pretty easy to take. I might disagree with some \nof the rhetoric here and there, but when you end by arguing that an \nauthorization is an expenditure of money, it is just not accurate. It \ndoesn't state what happens here in Congress.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. COBURN. Under your premise, only bills that are authorized get \nfunded, correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. But all bills that are authorized do not get \nappropriated.\n  Mr. COBURN. Except you are wrong. Last year, $220 billion of \nunauthorized programs were appropriated.\n  If I may--will the Senator yield to me? I am happy to yield back in a \nmoment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sure.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let's carry your analogy a little further. What has \nreally happened is you give your son $200, but the mandate is--you are \ngoing to spend $100 on a broken iPod or a used iPod, and you have $100 \nto buy down towards a good one, but you mandate that you spend $100 on \nthe bad one. That is the analogy. That is why we ought to deauthorize \nprograms that aren't working. That is why we ought to oversight \naggressively every area of the Federal Government.\n  Let me take one other exception, and then I will be happy to yield \nback to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I interrupt the Senator just to say this: This is \ngetting painfully close to a debate, which rarely occurs on the floor \nof the Senate, so please proceed.\n  Mr. COBURN. I love it. I love to debate the Senator from Illinois.\n  I take a different tact, and the Senator knows that. I look at the \noath I took when I came to the Senate. It didn't say ``Oklahoma'' in \nit; the Senator's didn't say ``Illinois.'' What the oath says is to \ndefend the Constitution of the United States and do what is best for \nthe country as a whole and in the long term.\n  Now, the Senator--and I admire him greatly--admitted that he plays \nthe game the way it is played. I am telling him that the American \npeople are ready for the game to be played a different way--a totally \ndifferent way. Part of that is looking at the authority under which we \nallow money to be spent and recognizing that if we are going to \nauthorize something new, given the jam we are in, all you have to do is \ntalk to David Walker and look at what is going to happen in the next \ntwo generations. Don't we have an obligation to look at the programs \nthat are not authorized?\n  Would the Senator answer this question: When was the last time he saw \na program deauthorized in this body?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to respond. I think the Senator has asked a \ngood question but not the right question. When we fail to appropriate \nmoney for an authorized program, we are saying there is a higher \npriority. We are saying that authorized program may not be as valid or \nas valuable today as when it was enacted, and we make the choice. The \nSenator referred to this, and I know he didn't mean to demean the \nprocess in saying that I am ``playing the game.'' I don't think I am \n``playing the game'' when I do the best I can to help the 12\\1/2\\ \nmillion people I represent. If the Senator ran into a problem--and \noccasionally Oklahoma has a challenge--I will be there to help him, \ntoo. That is the nature of it. We try to represent our States and also \ndo what is good for the Nation.\n  Secondly, if authorization is broken, as the Senator from Oklahoma \nsays, the obvious answer is, either don't appropriate money for it, or \nwhen the appropriations bill comes to the floor, strike it and move the \nmoney to another program. You have the right to do that as a Senator. \nBut the fact that the options or choices are out there doesn't mean \nthat every one of them is going to be honored and appropriated.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, if I might, the \nthing that strikes me is the Senator is a wonderful debater, except \nwhen he says the appropriators appropriating money on an authorized \nprogram--that is great, except the American public needs to know that \n22 percent of what we appropriate has never been authorized. Never.\n  So the fact is, we say authorization means something, but it means \nnothing as far as the appropriations process goes. The real point of \nthis debate is how do we grab hold of this problem, this behemoth of a \nproblem that will face our children and grandchildren in the next 20 to \n25 years, and do it in a way that will give us the greatest opportunity \nfor them?\n  My idea--and obviously many people disagree with it--is I think we \nought to start looking at every program. We ought to ask a couple of \nquestions: Can we measure its effectiveness? Is there a metric on it \nthat says this program is supposed to do this? Is there a metric there \nso we can measure it? I am of the mind to say that if you cannot \nmeasure something, you cannot manage it. Ninety percent of the programs \nhave no metric in the Federal Government, so we don't know if they are \nworking.\n  No. 2, is it a program that is still needed? We don't ever look at \nthe authorizing level. The Senator would have us defer everything to \nappropriations, and that is what we actually do because 20 percent of \nwhat we appropriate is not authorized and everything we authorize isn't \nappropriated. So, obviously, authorizations are meaningless. So what we \nshould do is eliminate authorizing committees and just have \nappropriations committees and we will all be on appropriations \ncommittees.\n  Third, we should ask, is this still a legitimate function of the \nFederal Government? When we ran a $300 billion-plus true deficit last \nyear and every State, save one, had big surpluses, should we not ask \nthe question: If we are doing things that really are not the Federal \nGovernment's role to do, and we have a deficit and the States have a \nsurplus, should we not let them do it without our fingers taking 15 \npercent of the money as we send it back?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I will make a constructive \nsuggestion, not to make a debate point or anything else, but to serve \nhis purposes. Can I suggest that instead of a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, the Senator from Oklahoma, when an authorization bill comes \nalong, offer a sunset provision to be added to it to say that at a \ncertain period of time this authorization ends and has to be\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\nreauthorized? Would that not serve his purpose?\n  Mr. COBURN. As a matter of fact, I did just that on the last 9/11 \nbill, and the Senator from Illinois voted against it. I voted to sunset \nit. I actually offered the amendment that said we should sunset it and \nlook at it in 5 years, and the Senator from Illinois disagreed. He \nthought, no, we should not do that. This Senator must admit that he \ndoes have a constructive suggestion. I just wish he had voted that way \nwhen we had the amendment up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was reluctant to do this, but I am going to refer to a \ncouple of votes of the Senator from Oklahoma. His amendment was to \nsunset the entire Department of Homeland Security. Also, on two \nseparate occasions he voted against pay-as-you-go requiring 50 votes. \nHere are two different rollcalls where the Senator's vote would have \nmade the difference.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. My amendment did not sunset the whole Department of \nHomeland Security. It was the grants process.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is what keeps our country safe.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is made up of how we dole money out to the States \nrather than looking at the best interests of the country and looking at \nthe risk base for national security and homeland security. I am \nbasically for a true pay-go that says the options are two. One option \nsaid the only option is, if we won't cut spending, we will raise taxes. \nThat is a pay-more, not a pay-go. It is pay more.\n  I am proud of those votes. I had consternation over it because I want \nto try to hold to those things. But the pay-go as outlined two times in \nthe language was a vote for pay-more.\n  Will the Senator agree with me that there is waste, fraud, and abuse \nin the duplication of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator agree that since we had a $300 billion-\nplus deficit last year--$200 billion-plus if we weren't in the war in \nIraq--if we took that off the table, would it not make sense for us to \ntry to get rid of the waste, fraud, duplication, and abuse?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course. But I include the war in Iraq----\n  Mr. COBURN. It doesn't include the war. Let me finish my point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I said I do include the war in Iraq.\n  Mr. COBURN. It was in there, but say we were not in the war and we \nwere still down to $200 billion--let's take that off the table. Say we \nhave a $200 billion deficit, and we can demonstrate from our \nsubcommittee hearings $200 billion a year in waste, fraud, and abuse. \nYet we did nothing about it. We did nothing.\n  I have enjoyed my debate with the Senator from Illinois. I ask that \nwe vote on the question at hand. I thank him for his kindness.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand Senator Specter may have a \ncomment he wants to make. I respect the Senator's view on the budget, \nthough we disagree. We both understand the seriousness of the deficit. \nI don't think authorizations are the problem. For that reason, I will \nvote against this amendment. When we vote on a pay-go amendment, I hope \nyou can join us.\n  Mr. COBURN. As long as it is not a pay-more amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Frankly, it has to include taxes instead of spending.\n  I will yield the floor to the Senator from Pennsylvania, if he is \nprepared to speak. If not, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have an amendment in my hand by Senator \nJohn Ensign. I will send it to the desk. I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment and to have this called up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I may, we are about to \nhave a vote in connection with the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma. If we are going to start talking about amendments for a \ncouple of hours and bring up another one, we are not going to get \nanywhere on the bill for court security, which has been passed twice by \nthis body. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, a great deal of what the Senator from \nOklahoma has offered, I agree with; that is, that we ought to live \nwithin our means as a society. I have consistently supported \nconstitutional amendments for balanced budgets, to require the Congress \nto live within its means, like States, cities, and we personally must \nlive within our means. I have supported the line-item veto. I think the \ntransparency for awards, also known as earmarks, will be an improvement \nof the current system.\n  I agree with what the Senator from Oklahoma has said about the \nproblems created by the national debt and by the deficit. But the \nsense-of-the-Senate conclusion, I think, goes further than we can, \nrealistically. The last paragraph says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress has a moral \n     obligation to offset the cost of new government programs, \n     initiatives, and authorizations.\n\n  When you talk about living within our means and a balanced budget, in \nthe line-item veto, I would agree with that; but when you talk about \noffsetting the authorizations, that goes to a point that I think goes \ntoo far because the legislative process has two steps. One step is the \nauthorization and the second step is the appropriation.\n  It is common practice to have authorizations that will be \nsubstantially beyond what an appropriation will be. The real decisive \nfactor is what money is appropriated, what money is spent, not what \nmoneys can be authorized. But in structuring programs and \nauthorizations, it is the common practice to put a figure in that is \nlarger than may be used, but it is there for purposes of contingency, \nif more should be used, so that the real critical factor is the \nappropriations process.\n  I cannot agree with what the Senator from Oklahoma seeks to \naccomplish on tying the hands of the authorizers because of the \nestablished practice that I think is appropriate. For that reason, I \nregrettably cannot support what my colleague has offered, although I \nthink the underlying purpose is very valid.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if this was our Department of Justice \nauthorization bill, these kinds of amendments could certainly be \nconsidered.\n  We are talking about a court security bill which has passed this body \ntwice, which is urgently needed. I am trying to keep extraneous matters \noff it and have them offered on legislation where it is more \nappropriate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 896\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that the managers' package be considered and \nagreed to, and we revert to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 896) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 891\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my understanding is the managers' package \nhas been agreed to and we are back on the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 896 is agreed to, and the Coburn \namendment is pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I don't want to surprise my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, I will in a moment move to table his amendment. Again, \nif this was a DOJ authorization bill--and I have presented and passed \nin this body DOJ authorization bills before--then if he wanted to bring \nthe amendment up, we could vote it up or down. This is a different \nbill. We want it to be a clean bill.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But Friday \nmorning occurs at 1 a.m. We have to finish this bill as soon as we can. \nI am alerting everyone, there could be a vote Friday morning at 1 a.m.\n  I also suggest that I have been trying for some time now to do a \nbipartisan bill that has been worked on by many Senators. There are 50 \ncosponsors of this legislation, dealing with competitiveness. On our \nside it will be managed by Senator Bingaman. It is my understanding on \nthe other side it will be managed by Senator Alexander. I hope we can \nhave an agreement to move to that.

We have had vile things done \nto judges all over the country, even in the State of Nevada, and we \nneed to give Federal courts and local courts protection.

Today is a little different approach \nto it, though, because earlier today the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions began marking up S. 1082, the Food and \nDrug Administration Revitalization Act. For the first time in almost a \ndecade we have an opportunity to reform, to improve, and to reestablish \nthe FDA as an institution committed to making patient safety as \nimportant as bringing new drugs to the market.\n  S. 1082 presents a framework for the future of drug and device \nsafety. I am gratified by some of its current contents and I express \nsome disappointment about others. That is the purpose of my speaking to \nmy colleagues.\n  First, I am gratified the bill attempts to address some of the \noverarching issues plaguing the FDA that have been repeatedly revealed \nby the investigations I conducted of the FDA over the last 3 years. In \nparticular, S. 1082 takes a number of steps to address the issue of \ntransparency, the issue of accountability, and the issue of respect for \nthe scientific process that has been lacking for some time at the FDA. \nS. 1082, for example, requires that within 30 days of approval, the \naction package for approval of a new drug must be posted on the FDA's \nWeb site. This requirement, however, only applies to a drug with an \nactive ingredient that has not been previously approved by the FDA. The \naction package would contain all documents generated by the FDA related \nto the review of a drug application, including a summary review of all \nconclusions and, among other things, any disagreements and how these \ndisagreements were resolved. If a supervisor disagreed with the review, \nthen the supervisor's opposing review would be available to the public. \nAnd to address the many allegations that the Food and Drug \nAdministration safety reviewers are sometimes coerced into changing \ntheir findings, I greatly welcome the provision that states a \nscientific review of an application is considered the work of the \nreviewer and must not be changed by FDA managers or the reviewer once \nthat review is final.\n\n  The bill also takes steps to bring more resources to the FDA for drug \nsafety, another matter I have been discussing for years. In addition, \nthe bill requires the Food and Drug Administration's Drug Safety and \nRisk Management Advisory Committee to meet\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nat least two times a year to address safety questions and to make \nrecommendations regarding post-market studies.\n  I am also heartened to see that the bill incorporated several \nelements from the Dodd-Grassley bill entitled the Fair Access to \nClinical Trials Act of 2007. S. 1082 ensures that the clinical trial \nregistry includes trials of devices approved by the FDA. The bill \nrequires a drug sponsor to certify at the time of the submission of a \ndrug, biologics, or device application to the agency, that the sponsor \nhas met all of the clinical trial registry requirements.\n  Last but not least, S. 1082 attempts to give the Food and Drug \nAdministration some teeth by requiring specific civil penalties, \nmonetary penalties for submission of false certification, and false or \nmisleading clinical trial information.\n  These are, in my mind, some of the good things that are proposed in \nS. 1082. I wish to thank Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi in \nthis regard.\n  I hope additions such as these, which strengthen S. 1082, will make \nit through the HELP Committee's vote as the committee considers further \nchanges. As I said earlier, I am both gratified and disappointed by the \ncontents of S. 1082.\n  I turn now to some of what I consider to be lacking in the bill, that \nin my mind fails to address some of the issues that are critical to \nreestablishing the FDA's mission and putting John Q. Public and not \nPhRMA at the helm of the FDA.\n  I commend the HELP Committee's attempt to ensure that the office \nresponsible for post-market drug safety is involved in, among other \nthings, decisions made regarding labeling and post-market studies by \nmaking specific references to that office throughout S. 1082. However, \nthe bill does not address the outstanding critical problem that the \noffice responsible for post-market drug safety lacks the independence, \nlacks the authority to promptly identify serious health risks and take \nnecessary steps that will protect the public.\n  As I think we all agree, the Federal Drug Administration is in \ndesperate need of major overhaul. Over the past 3 years, my \ninvestigations have demonstrated that the depth and the breadth of the \nproblems plaguing the FDA on both the drug and device side ought to \nstand out in everybody's mind as something Congress ought to be dealing \nwith. Senator Dodd and I have written two bills that we believe will \ngreatly enhance drug and device safety and improve transparency at the \nFDA and, most importantly, prevent another Vioxx debacle.\n  The Federal Drug Administration's Safety Act of 2007 and the Fair \nAccess to Clinical Trials Act of 2007 are intended to address some of \nthe problems plaguing the FDA at its very core. Those are the bills \nthat are the Grassley-Dodd bill and the other is a Dodd-Grassley bill.\n  Let me be clear: Big PhRMA does not like these bills. FDA management \ndoes not like these bills. Lobbyists are spending hours upon hours \nlobbying against these bills. The Food and Drug Administration \nRevitalization Act does not embrace all the critical elements of the \nDodd-Grassley and the Grassley-Dodd bill.\n  Let me ask each and every Member of the Senate the following: What is \nwrong with establishing a separate center within the FDA--not outside \nthe FDA, within the FDA--with its only job being that of a watchdog for \nthose drugs already in the market? What is wrong with supporting a \ngroup of committed FDA scientists who only watch for serious adverse \neffects that may pop up only occasionally, perhaps only 1 in 10,000 or \n1 in 20,000? What is wrong with ensuring that all clinical trial \nresults, regardless of their outcome, are available to the scientific \ncommunity, health care practitioners, and the public? What is wrong \nwith supporting a clinical trial registry and results database that \nalso requires sponsors to reveal their negative trials? And what is \nwrong with giving the FDA strong enforcement tools to combat bad \nplayers?\n  I propose there is nothing wrong with any of these proposals, \nparticularly the proposals that a new, separate, and independent center \nbe created to address post-market surveillance, a proposal supported by \nSenator Dodd and me, not once but twice.\n  I have heard the naysayers and the naysayers' many bogus arguments \nabout why a new post-market drug safety center will not work. The \narguments range from the absurd to the ridiculous.\n  I will also address a few of those for you today. One argument is the \ncreation of a separate center will slow down the drug approval process \nand delay much needed drugs from those who need them.\n  This argument is, in plain English, a nonstarter. Why? Because this \nnew center will be devoted to keeping an eye on drugs once they are \nalready on the market, postmarketing surveillance.\n  Another argument is that a new postmarket drug safety center will \ncreate an unmanageable bureaucracy at the FDA. That is a bogus \nargument. Why would taking an already existing office at the Food and \nDrug Administration, moving it on an organizational chart and providing \nit with new authority to watch for unknown and unexpected adverse \nevents be bad? It does not make sense.\n  These arguments at first blush made an impression on Dr. Steven \nNissen, chair of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland \nClinic and immediate past president of the American College of \nCardiology, who was not an original supporter of establishing a \nseparate center within the FDA to address postmarketing surveillance.\n  But, over time, his views have changed. Dr. Nissen probed more, \nevaluated the facts more, and as he talked more to on-the-ground FDA \nstaff members, Dr. Nissen changed his mind and told the American public \nso.\n  Dr. Nissen recently sent me a letter stating that not only does he \nsupport the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act but also the Food and \nDrug Administration Safety Act. In other words, Dr. Nissen said:\n\n       In particular, I support the creation of a new independent \n     center within the FDA called the Center for Post-Market \n     Evaluation and Research for drugs and biologics. Although I \n     had previously expressed some concern about creating this \n     center, I have become convinced that the separation of post-\n     market surveillance from the Office of New Drugs represents \n     the best opportunity to improve the performance of the FDA in \n     handling drug safety issues.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Cleveland Clinic,\n\n                                    Cleveland, OH, March 29, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I share your concern about the need \n     for a significant overhaul of the Food and Drug \n     Administration to improve drug safety. Over the last several \n     years, we have endured a series of disturbing revelations \n     about the lack of vigilance by the FDA in monitoring drugs \n     following approval. I have reviewed the two Bills that you \n     and Senator Dodd introduced, the Food & Drug Administration \n     Safety Act of 2007 and the Fair Access to Clinical Act of \n     2007. I strongly support the passage of both of these Acts \n     and believe that they will help protect the public health.\n       In particular, I support the creation of a new and \n     independent center within the FDA called the Center for Post-\n     Market Evaluation and Research for drugs and biologics \n     (CPER). Although I had previously expressed some concern \n     about creating this center, I have become convinced that the \n     separation of postmarket surveillance from the Office of New \n     Drugs represents the best opportunity to improve the \n     performance of the FDA in handling drug safety issues.\n       Finally, I want to thank you and Senator Dodd for your \n     tireless efforts to promote public health through aggressive \n     oversight of the Food and Drug Administration. Your \n     leadership in this vital area has been invaluable and all of \n     the 300 million Americans who rely upon drugs to protect \n     their health are grateful for your steadfast efforts.\n       The views expressed in this letter are my own personal \n     opinion and do not necessarily reflect the official views of \n     my employer or the American College of Cardiology.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steven E. Nissen, M.D.,\n       Chairman, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Cleveland \n     Clinic, Immediate Past President, American College of \n     Cardiology.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Coupled with Dr. Nissen's letter of support, I also \nreceived a letter from Dr. Curt Furberg, professor of public health \nscience at\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nWake Forest University School of Medicine. Dr. Furberg is not only a \nprofessor of medicine, but he is also a member of the Food and Drug \nAdministration Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.\n  Dr. Furberg knows the FDA from the inside, and you might say he knows \nit inside-outside, in and out. In fact, even Dr. Furberg has written me \nto say he is supportive of creating a new center, and he is \nparticularly supportive of creating a new enforcement tool to be used \nagainst bad players in the drug industry.\n  I also have that letter and would ask unanimous consent to have it \nprinted in the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      Wake Forest,\n\n\n                                           School of Medicine,\n\n                                                   March 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am pleased that members of the \n     U.S. Congress are taking constructive actions to address the \n     major problems with drug safety. Your Bills--FDASA and the \n     FACT Act--are excellent and, if passed, would greatly benefit \n     the U.S. public.\n       My major concern relates to the FDA's lack of enforcement \n     tools. Regulations and commitments of any kind have limited \n     value if major and repeated violations involve no \n     consequences. Drugmakers who suppress or delay submission of \n     safety information to the FDA, stall label changes \n     (especially new Black Box warnings) or fail to honor their \n     commitments to complete post-market safety studies are rarely \n     (if ever) penalized for their unacceptable behaviors. Thus, I \n     particularly applaud the way your FDASA Bill would give the \n     Director of the Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research \n     for Drugs and Biologics wide-ranging authority to take \n     corrective action.\n       If I can be of any assistance in facilitating passage of \n     this legislation, do not hesitate to call me.\n           Respectfully,\n     Curt D. Furberg, MD, PhD,\n       Professor of Public Health Sciences, Member of the FDA Drug \n     Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, if these two thoughtful leaders can \ncome forward and support a new center that is devoted to watching drugs \nonce they are on the market so that American consumers and their \ndoctors know about a problem promptly, what is wrong with that? That is \nwhy I hope the HELP Committee will take a second look at the Dodd-\nGrassley bill. We have seen time and again that the FDA is not as good \nat this function as it should be. However, the reality is that the FDA \nneeds to perform this function well because lives of American citizens \nand maybe around the world depend on it.\n  I wish to see a bill passed that prevents another Vioxx debacle. This \nCongress has an opportunity to make meaningful and positive changes. \nLet's not allow that opportunity to slip through our fingers.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Madam President, I have another set of remarks that I wish to make \ndealing with the issue that we had before the Senate today, and that we \nhad a cloture vote on, S. 3. Members on the other side of the aisle, \nincluding the assistant majority leader, said that Republicans do not \nwant this debate. What are they talking about, do not want a debate \nabout anything dealing with Medicare prescription drugs and all those \nsorts of things?\n  This body has debated the so-called prohibition on Government \nnegotiation. The Senate had four votes on this issue. What is rather \namusing to me about the statement that we do not want the debate is \nthat they did not seem to want the debate when the Senate considered S. \n1.\n  S. 1 was the Senate version of the Medicare drug law. That bill had a \nnoninterference clause in it just like the current law does. It is that \nclause that the other side has distorted to come up with the absurd \nclaim that no negotiations occur under the Medicare drug benefit. Not \nonce, I repeat, not once during the entire time that S. 1 was on the \nSenate floor in the year 2003 did anyone on the other side of the aisle \nbring up this issue.\n  That is because this is not an issue of merit, it is simply one born \nout of political pandering. The assistant majority leader also talked \nabout how Medicare should look like the VA because the VA seems to get \nlower prices.\n  The VA gets lower prices because the Government passed a law to \nguarantee itself an automatic discount that no one else can get. By \nlaw, that price is automatically 24 percent less than the average price \npaid by basically all non-Federal purchasers. That is not negotiation, \nthat is a federally mandated price dictation, or you might call it a \n24-percent discount, but it is federally mandated.\n  I agree that the logical question then is: Why not have Medicare get \nthat price? Experts who testified at the Senate Finance Committee, even \nthe VA itself at a 2001 hearing before the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs gave us the answer: They said that giving the Medicare VA \nprices will increase prices for veterans. Now, why would anybody in \nthis body want to increase prices for veterans?\n  Now I wish to turn to how the VA uses its own pharmacy benefit \nmanager or PBM as we refer to them. The pharmacy benefit manager for \nthe VA--the VA has one. In 1995, as part of an effort to better manage \nand monitor drug usage and purchasing and utilization oversight across \nthe entire Veterans' Administration, the VA established its own benefit \nmanager.\n  The VA did it because it wanted to have its pharmacy operation work \nsimilar to the private sector. They did it because, as stated in the VA \nnews release, they wanted to maximize a developing business strategy in \nthe private sector. That business strategy was getting lower prices on \ndrugs in the private sector.\n  So here we have people holding out the VA as a model, which uses its \nown PBM to negotiate, and at the same time they are saying: Using PBMs \nin Medicare is wrong.\n  Remember, that process has brought 35-percent lower costs on the 25 \nmost used drugs by seniors under the Medicare Program. I cannot help \nbut see how that is a bit of irony when people say they want Medicare \nto negotiate like the VA negotiates.\n  Well, the VA negotiates through its PBM. So the funny thing is, the \nVA actually negotiates similar to Medicare drug plans. You heard that \nright, but let me state it again. The VA system for negotiating is just \nlike the one already used by Medicare through prescription drug plans \nthat seniors join.\n  If the VA's PBM looked at itself in the mirror, it would see a \nMedicare drug plan's PBM staring right back at it. There is another \nimportant difference between the VA and Medicare. The VA prescription \ndrug benefit is just one part of the VA's health care delivery system. \nIt is a very different system than Medicare.\n  The VA system requires veterans to use VA hospitals, to use VA \nphysicians, to use the VA national formulary, to use their pharmacies, \nand to use their mail order pharmacy. Now, don't get me wrong. The VA \nhas a good system that works for veterans. But what it comes down to is \nchoice. So I have a chart I want you to look at. Under the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, beneficiaries have choices. They can choose \nthe plan they want, a plan that covers all their medicines. They can \nchoose the doctor and the hospital they want. They can go to their \nlocal pharmacy.\n\n  Even the VA recognizes this fact. On its own Web site in a \n``frequently asked questions'' page, the VA does not recommend that \nveterans cancel or decline coverage in Medicare because a veteran may \nwant to consider the flexibility afforded by enrolling in both the VA \nplan and the Medicare plan.\n  For example, veterans enrolled in both programs may obtain \nprescription drugs that are not on the VA formulary if prescribed by a \nnon-VA physician and filled at a local pharmacy.\n  Making all Part D programs look like the VA and its formulary then \nwill severely restrict access and will severely restrict choice to the \n44 million Medicare beneficiaries. Now, the other side says: No. No. We \nare not going to limit access to drugs. Yes, as I pointed out this \nmorning, every Democrat on the Finance Committee cast a vote against my \namendment that would have prohibited the Secretary from creating a \nnational preferred drug list.\n  I had thought, for all the talk about not allowing a Government \nformulary, the proponents of S. 3 would embrace a\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\nprovision banning preferred drug lists. If they do not want to limit \nbeneficiaries' access to drugs, my amendment should have been easy for \nthem to support.\n  But by voting against my amendment, they were voting in favor of the \nGovernment setting a preferred drug list. Now, the preferred drug list \nmight sound like a good thing, but in reality it is not. It is a \nGovernment-controlled list of drugs that you can or cannot have because \nthe Government is not going to pay for what they say you cannot have.\n  The preferred drug list then operates similar to a formulary. In my \nopinion, if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, then it is \na duck. But that is not what the courts have found. So what does that \nmean for Medicare beneficiaries? It means that even though S. 3 \nprohibits the Secretary from using a formulary, it does not prohibit \nthe Secretary from using a preferred drug list. It is clear now then \nfrom all this analysis and their votes on this amendment that \nsupporters of this Senate bill want the Government to set a preferred \ndrug list. They want the Government to determine for what seniors can \nget coverage.\n  A number of States have implemented preferred drug lists. Michigan, \nfor example, has a preferred drug list. Here is what the Kaiser Family \nFoundation found in a 2003 case study on that preferred drug list:\n\n       Fearing opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, the \n     State sought virtually no input from providers, pharmacists, \n     beneficiaries and manufacturers.\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       Ultimately the department [meaning Michigan] made only a \n     few changes to the list of drugs on the Michigan preferred \n     drug list in response to beneficiaries and provider concerns.\n\n  Both the Illinois House and the Illinois Senate resolutions were \nintroduced in 2002 to establish a committee to oversee that State's \npreferred drug list.\n  The resolution noted that the creation of Illinois' preferred drug \nlist ``could lead to unintended consequences such as inferior health \ncare, increased hospitalizations and emergency care, increased \nadmissions into long-term care, and unnecessary patient suffering and \npotentially death.''\n  In a statement about this bill, S. 345, the assistant majority leader \nsaid that: The Medicare-administered plan envisioned under this bill \nwould have a preferred drug list.\n  So this morning I talked about fitting all of the pieces of a \nlegislative puzzle together.\n  Here are some of those pieces: The bill approved by the House allows \nprice controls. The bill that was before the Senate does not prohibit \nthe Secretary from dictating the drugs beneficiaries can get. We have \nSenator Durbin's statement about his own bill and how he envisioned a \npreferred drug list.\n  So despite claims by those on the other side of the aisle, this bill \nis not harmless to senior citizens. If this Trojan horse attack \nsucceeds in a Government takeover of the drug benefit, here is what \nseniors can look forward to: They can look forward to fewer choices. \nThey can look forward to fewer opportunities to choose a plan that best \nmeets their needs--the needs of 44 million senior citizens in America.\n  If the Senate bill were to pass, seniors will get only the drugs some \nGovernment bureaucrat determines they can have. All other Americans \nwill see the prices of their prescription drugs going up. That is not \nme saying it. Professor Scott Morton of Yale University testified \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee to that mathematical fact, that if \nyou have 44 million senior citizens, and you have the Government \ndictating the price, when you deal with that number of people, the \nprice is going to go up for everybody. If that is what the other side \ncalls harmless, I shudder to think what their definition of ``harmful'' \nmight be.\n  We should have and did stop this bill in its tracks. Voting no was a \nvote against Government-controlled drug lists, Government setting \nprices, and Government restrictions on seniors' access to drugs. That \nwas the right thing to do today, and I am glad the vote came out the \nway it did. I hope it stays that way because if it ain't broke, don't \nfix it.\n  (Mr. Casey assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4669-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL INFANT IMMUNIZATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of National Infant \nImmunization Week, which is being held this year from April 21-28. In \nNevada and throughout the country, State and local health departments, \nhealth care providers, parents, and other partners will be working \ntogether to make sure that all infants are protected against vaccine-\npreventable diseases. This week is also an opportunity for all of us to \nspread the message about getting immunized. Not only do immunizations \ngive our children a healthy start to life, they also save lives and \nprotect the American public's health.\n  Immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases is a tremendous \nsuccess story. Due to the development of vaccines and immunization \ncampaigns, infectious diseases that used to devastate entire \ncommunities have been reduced to record lows or eradicated outright. \nThanks to immunizations, few Americans today have any direct knowledge \nof once commonplace scourges like polio, smallpox, measles, and \ndiphtheria. For most of us, the deaths, suffering, and disability \nassociated with these diseases are now known only through textbooks and \nold newspaper accounts.\n  The National Infant Immunization Week is a time to reflect on these \nachievements. More importantly, this week is also a reminder that we \ncannot lose ground by becoming complacent or taking the benefits of \nimmunizations for granted. Approximately 1 million children in this \ncountry are not fully immunized by age two and many regions of the \ncountry have disturbingly low immunization rates. In my home State of \nNevada, the immunization rate for infants and young children is ranked \nlast in the country.\n  Fortunately, there are Federal and State programs that work to \nprovide lifesaving vaccinations to children and adults who would \notherwise have to go without. During this year's National Infant \nImmunization Week, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support these \nefforts. By promoting access to immunizations against serious but \npreventable diseases, we can work to ensure that all Americans will \nbenefit from this invaluable public health tool for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4669-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4669-S4670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Sunday is the 37th anniversary of Earth Day. \nI have been pleased to read reports that people across the country are \nplanning to come together to celebrate our environmental \naccomplishments and to renew their environmental commitment to future \nand current generations. Everyone should celebrate the major steps \nforward we have taken to achieve clean air and water, to reduce \npollution, and to clean up hazardous waste sites.\n  Earth Day is celebrated because of the great work of former Senator \nGaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. In 1970, he founded Earth Day to celebrate \nthe environment and to bring attention to the legislative challenges \nfacing those who want to want to protect the environment. Senator \nNelson also cosponsored the Wilderness Act of 1964, a law that has been \namazingly important to protecting Nevada's beauty.\n  Nevada is one of the many States that has greatly benefited from the \nincreased environmental awareness that former Senator Nelson helped to \ncultivate. Nevada's dramatic landscapes from the high alpine lakes of \nthe Ruby Mountains to the stark open spaces of the Black Rock Desert to \nthe incredible Joshua tree forests in the Piute Valley have provided \ninspiration to generations of Nevadans. Protecting Nevada's wild lands \nensured that those who follow us will have the same opportunity to find \nand experience these incredible places as we had.\n  The Wilderness Act of 1964, which was cosponsored by former Senator \nNelson, has done tremendous things in Nevada. I have been proud to help \ndesignate nearly 2 million acres of wilderness across Nevada, in \naddition to creating the Sloan Canyon, Red Rock Canyon, and Black Rock \nDesert-High Rock Canyon National Conservation Areas and Great Basin \nNational Park.\n  Protecting and serving our environment has always been one of my \npassions, and I have twice had the privilege to chair the Environment \nand\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nPublic Works Committee. During that time, I had the chance to write the \nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, to revise the Clean Air \nAct, and to improve the Endangered Species Act, Superfund, and the \nClean Water Act. In each case, I advocated for laws that not only \nprotect the environment but that are flexible, take advantage of market \nmechanisms, and reflect the unique needs and circumstances of the West.\n  I was always pleased that I was able to work in a bipartisan manner \nwith my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents all understood that protecting \nthe environment did not have to be a partisan issue, and I was glad \nthat various presidents joined in our efforts. That is why it is so \ndistressing today to see the current administration's policies pursued \nin such a manner because environmental issues could and should be \nbipartisan.\n  Each year, our understanding grows about how important it is to \nconserve and protect our land and its rich resources. While the current \nadministration's environmental rollbacks are far too numerous to count, \nit started with attempts to loosen arsenic standards for drinking water \nand centers today around their total unwillingness to work together on \na plan that will first stabilize and then reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Global warming and climate change is the single greatest \nenvironmental challenge that will confront current and future \ngenerations. We have a moral obligation to address this issue and \nchoosing to ignore this problem is madness and a luxury we do not have \nthe time for. I once again urge my colleagues not to fall for the \ntemptation of the administration's voluntary ''technology-only'' \nstrategy. That strategy has only increased emissions and the risks \nassociated with global warming.\n  The negative impacts that have been linked to global warming and \nclimate change are also far too numerous to mention, but I am \ncontinually concerned about the impacts that climate change will have \non water in Nevada. Most recently, the National Resources Conservation \nService recorded that snowpack throughout the Sierra Nevada Mountains \nis only at 40 to 50 percent or normal. In eastern Nevada, due to \ndecreases in the snowpack, the stream flow for the Humboldt River is \nexpected to only be at 34 percent and the lower Colorado River at 19 \npercent of its average. A recent study published in Science said all \nbut one of the 19 major climate models project that the Southwest is at \nthe beginning of a deepening drought largely due to greenhouse gas \nconcentration increases and global warming.\n  The challenge of eliminating our Nation's overdependence on oil and \nother greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels will be a great test for our \ncountry and for the world. I believe that America can lead the way in \ndeveloping new technologies to meet and pass this test. We can and must \nbecome more energy independent through the rapid development and \ndiversification of clean, alternative, and renewable sources of energy. \nThey will provide a steady, reliable energy supply, bolster our \nnational security, protect the environment, and create new jobs and \nwhole new industries. We must tap into our Nation's spirit of \ninnovation and bring a new environmental ethic to our energy policy.\n  Every day, not just on Earth Day, we have to work together to protect \nour environment from threats so our children and our grandchildren and \nso on can drink clean water, breath clean air, and enjoy the vast open \nspaces and the natural beauty of Nevada, America, and the world. That \nmuch is for certain, and I look forward to bringing that commitment to \neverything that I and this Senate undertake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4670-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN L. KIRKWOOD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I honor the distinguished career of \nJohn L. Kirkwood and to congratulate him on his upcoming retirement. \nJohn Kirkwood is the current president and chief executive officer of \nthe American Lung Association.\n  Mr. Kirkwood graduated from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. \nSince then, his life has been dedicated to improving the health of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Kirkwood served as executive director of the American Lung \nAssociation of Metropolitan Chicago from 1975 to 2001. During his \ntenure, he was instrumental in organizing the American Lung Association \nAsthma Clinical Research Network, the International Tuberculosis \nFoundation, the Illinois Coalition against Tobacco, the Chicago Asthma \nConsortium and the Combined Health Appeal of Illinois. His efforts have \nmade it possible for more Illinoisans in the Chicago metropolitan area \nto breathe better today.\n  Luckily for the rest of the country, Mr. Kirkwood decided to expand \nhis commitment beyond the Chicago area to improving the health of the \nentire Nation. As president and CEO of the American Lung Association, \nMr. Kirkwood has expanded the ALA's commitment to research nationwide, \nstrengthened the organization's advocacy programs, and improved \nknowledge and information transfer systems to assist patients suffering \nfrom lung disease.\n  As the leader of America's oldest national voluntary health \norganization, Mr. Kirkwood has shown an exemplary commitment to the \nhealth and social well-being of all Americans. Thanks to his work and \nhis heartfelt dedication to the public's health, individuals in my \nState of Illinois and the Nation as a whole will breathe cleaner air \nand lead healthier, happier lives. We are fortunate for his years of \ndedication to the American Lung Association, and his leadership will be \ndeeply missed.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Kirkwood on his many \naccomplishments throughout a long and successful career.

Mr. President, today I wish to discuss an issue that has \nheld a special place in my life for many years, the preservation of our \nNation's civil war battlefields. Our historic battlefields--outdoor \nclassrooms where visitors may walk in the very footsteps of heroes from \npast generations--are\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\nunder threat. More than 200,000 acres of historically significant \nbattlefield land remain unprotected and are threatened by development \npressures. That is why I urge my colleagues to fully fund the Civil War \nBattlefield Protection Program. This arm of the National Park Service \nis an invaluable tool to preserve our Nation's history.\n  In 1990, Congress established the Civil War Sites Advisory \nCommission, a blue-ribbon panel empowered to investigate the status of \nAmerica's remaining Civil War battlefields. Congress also tasked the \nCommission with the mission of prioritizing these battlefields \naccording to their historic importance and the threats to their \nsurvival. The Commission ultimately looked at the 10,000-plus battles \nand skirmishes of the Civil War and determined that 384 priority sites \nshould be preserved. The results of the report were released in 1993 \nand they were not encouraging.\n  The 1993 Commission report recommended that Congress create a $10 \nmillion-a-year emergency program to save threatened Civil War \nbattlefield land. The result was the Civil War Battlefield Preservation \nProgram. To date, the Preservation Program, working with its partners, \nhas saved 14,100 acres of land in 15 States.\n  The key to the success of the Preservation Program is that it \nachieves battlefield preservation through collaborative partnerships \nbetween State and local governments, the private sector and nonprofit \norganizations, such as the Civil War Preservation Trust. Matching \ngrants provided by the program protect lands outside of the National \nPark Service boundaries and do not add to the Park Service's \nmaintenance costs.\n  But for the Preservation Program and their partners with the Civil \nWar Preservation Trust, we would have lost key sites from such national \nshrines at Antietam. Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, Manassas, \nHarpers Ferry, Bentonville, Mansfield, and Champion Hill. Their names \nstill haunt us to this day. Had the Civil War Battlefield Preservation \nProgram not intervened, the sites would have been lost forever to \ncommercial and residential development. Now they have been protected \nfor future generations to enjoy and learn about our Nation's history. \nThey are islands of greenspace in a seemingly endless sea of commercial \nsprawl.\n  The need to protect our Nation's battlefields is far too great for \nany one well-intentioned Federal program. That is why the partnership \nwith the Civil War Preservation Trust is so critical. This visionary \npreservation group is able to work with other foundations, State and \nlocal governments and their membership to match Federal funds by 100 \npercent. How often can we tout such an achievement with other Federal \nprograms? The trust receives no financial gain from the Preservation \nProgram and, working with their non-Federal partners, has raised more \nthan $30 million to secure key battlefield sites in 15 States. They are \nin this fight for all the right reasons. This partnership truly serves \nas a model in bringing all stakeholders to the table to tackle pressing \nnational issues.\n  For me, these hallowed grounds, these living memorials to the 620,000 \nAmericans who sacrificed their lives to fight in the Civil War, have \nspecial, personal significance. Ancestors of mine fought on both sides \nduring the war, including William Jewell, who was wounded in the Battle \nof Cedar Mountain in Culpeper County, VA, wounded again at Antietam and \nwas finally killed in action at Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863. It is \nnot every day you can visit these battlefield sites and have an \nimmediate, direct connection with your ancestors. We must preserve \nthese sites so that future generations might see and touch the very \nplaces where so many sacrifices were made, by soldiers and civilians \nalike, to settle the unresolved issues from the American Revolution of \nslavery and sovereignty. We are a stronger, more diverse and genuinely \nfree nation because of these sacrifices.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the Preservation Program has \nenjoyed bipartisan, bicameral support since its creation. In 2002, \nprogram funding was authorized through the Civil War Battlefield \nPreservation Act at the level recommended by the Civil War Sites \nAdvisory Commission--$10 million a year. The clock is ticking against \nthese threatened historical sites given the pace of commercial \ndevelopment. Just last month, the Civil War Preservation Trust released \nits list of the 10 most threatened battlefield sites. Among them: \nGettysburg; Fort Morgan, Alabama; Marietta, Georgia and three sites in \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. In 5 years there may be little left to \nprotect. That is why I am here today to urge my colleagues to join me \nin requesting the full, authorized amount for the Preservation Program. \nThese Federal funds will leverage millions more in private and other \ncharitable donations; thereby increasing the trust's ability to \npreserve more threatened battlefield sites.\n  When the ``Soldiers' National Cemetery'' was dedicated at the \nGettysburg battlefield in November 1863, President Lincoln spoke \neloquently of the imperative to honor those who had given their ``last \nfull measure of devotion'' 4 months earlier. The Civil War Battlefield \nPreservation Program allows us to carry on Lincoln's vision. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in seeking full funding for the program this \nfiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4671-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4671-S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING GARY J. LANG\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nhonor the distinguished civil service career of a particularly \nremarkable senior law enforcement official. Mr. Gary J. Lang recently \nretired from his position as chief of staff of U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security and in doing \nso, this special agent will leave behind a legacy of exceptional \naccomplishment and dedication to his country.\n  Over the years, Mr. Lang has successfully handled a series of \nprofessional challenges that truly distinguish him as one of our \nNation's outstanding leaders. His entry into the Federal service in \n1978 as an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration began a \ntradition in law enforcement to protect the public interest that exists \nto this day.\n  From his time at the FDA, through the Defense Investigative Service, \nand as a special agent with the U.S. Customs Service working in south \nFlorida during an era known for its smuggling, drug trafficking and the \nrelated criminal violence, Mr. Lang demonstrated courage, honesty, and \nleadership in positions of increasing responsibility that have become \ndefining characteristics of his career. He earned the respect of his \ncolleagues and supervisors for his operational and managerial expertise \nin the field.\n  The Hill benefited from Mr. Lang's expert Federal law enforcement \nknowledge during the more than 4 years he spent supporting me through \nhis work on various committees, including serving as special assistant \nfor the Caucus on International Narcotics Control, as well as his time \nworking with staff on the Judiciary and Finance Committees. The \npositive impact Gary had upon our initiatives through his expertise, \ndedication and memorable dignity was truly meaningful to me and our \nwork effort.\n  More recently, in a headquarters management position as deputy \nexecutive director of operations/transition teams, Mr. Lang \nparticipated at the very center of the decision making that defined the \ninvestigative role the DHS would have in its mission to protect the \npublic against acts of terror, and resulted in the creation of U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, the second largest investigative \nagency in the Federal Government. And, as a senior executive, Mr. Lang \nserved as assistant director for ICE's Office of Investigations, \nmanaging the operational activities of a staff of 7,000 across the \nNation and around the world.\n  Mr. Lang most recently served as the chief of staff at ICE, where he \nspearheaded the advancement of the Assistant Secretary's mission-\ncritical goals across the full spectrum of the agency's operations and \nadministrative lines of business, through its staff of 16,000. He \nworked diligently to ensure that ICE maximizes the application of its \nstrategic resources to enforce U.S. trade and immigration laws and to \ntarget and neutralize national-level homeland security risks under \nICE's legal authorities. Mr. Lang leads by example, by holding himself \nand others accountable in achieving ICE's highest\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\npriority goals, in demanding a proactive approach in addressing \nemerging homeland security issues, and by setting the standard for \ndedication, morale and integrity throughout the ICE workforce.\n  Mr. Lang has distinguished himself at every level of Federal law \nenforcement and has engendered respect and appreciation from \nsubordinates, peers, and leadership alike. I am glad to be able to \ncongratulate him and honor his memorable career as it comes to a close \nafter nearly 29 years in the Federal Government. We on the Hill wish \nboth Gary and his wonderful wife Karyn the very best of luck for the \nfuture and thank them for their years of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4672-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On March 20, 2007, in Polk County, FL, Ryan Skipper, a gay man, \npicked up William Brown walking along the side of the road. Some time \nlater Brown stabbed Skipper to death, then bragged about the killing. \nAccording to police, witnesses have said that Brown and another man \nplanned the murder in advance and that their motivation was based on \nSkipper's sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4672-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PEARL HARBOR\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

They made it to the final by \ndefeating Kansas State in triple overtime.\n  This historic win was the first WNIT championship for the Cowgirls \nand was witnessed by a record crowd of over 15,000 fans at the \nUniversity of Wyoming Arena-Auditorium.\n  But as any Cowgirl fan can tell you, this victory was the result of \nmonths of hard practice, courageous leadership by the players and \ncoaches, and a commitment to excellence both on the court and in the \nclassroom. The teamwork and discipline demonstrated all year by the \nWyoming Cowgirls allowed them to be successful on game day. And we do \nnot have to look far to see examples of this success: This year, the \nWyoming Cowgirls won the most games in program history, including \nthrilling late-game comebacks and overtime wins.

Mr. President, on Monday my colleagues, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Domenici, Senator Thomas and I introduced \nlegislation, S. 1116, the More Water, More Energy, and Less Waste Act \nof 2007, to facilitate the use of water produced in connection with \ndevelopment of energy resources for irrigation and other beneficial \nuses in ways that will not adversely affect water quality or the \nenvironment.\n  The bill is similar to one that has been introduced during this \nCongress in the House by Representative Mark Udall, H.R. 902, More \nWater and More Energy Act of 2007.\n  The bill's purpose is to help turn what is today an energy-industry \nproblem into an opportunity. The development of energy resources \nfrequently results in bringing to the surface water from underground \nsources. Energy producers seek to minimize the waters that are produced \nduring extraction operations, but inevitably waters are produced and \nthey must either be treated before being released to the surface or \nreturned to the ground. In a few cases, the waters are clean enough to \nbe used for livestock watering, irrigation or other beneficial \npurposes.\n  Especially in the water-short West, increasing the amount of water \nthat can be used without adversely affecting water quality or the \nenvironment can increase water supplies for irrigation of crops, \nlivestock watering, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. \nEveryone will benefit from increased supplies of useable water, even if \nthe supplies are temporary in nature, provided that the new water is of \ngood quality and will not adversely affect the environment now or in \nthe future.\n  Our bill would do two things:\n  First, it would direct the Commissioner of Reclamation, the Director \nof the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Director of the Bureau of Land \nManagement to conduct a study to identify the technical, economic, \nenvironmental, and other obstacles to, one, reducing the quantity of \nproduced water and, two, increasing the extent to which produced water \ncan be used for irrigation and other purposes, without adversely \naffecting water quality or the environment, during or after energy \ndevelopment. The study would consider the legislative, administrative, \nand other actions that could reduce or eliminate those obstacles and \nthe costs and benefits associated with reducing or eliminating those \nobstacles. Results of the study are to be reported to Congress within a \nyear after enactment.\n  Second, it would provide grants for at least five projects to \ndemonstrate, one, ways to optimize energy resource production by \nreducing the quantity of produced water generated or, two, feasibility, \neffectiveness, and safety of processes to increase the extent to which \nproduced water may be recovered and made suitable for use for \nirrigation, municipal, or industrial uses, or other purposes without \nadversely affecting water quality or the environment.\n  The bill directs these pilot plants to be located in each of the \nUpper Basin States of the Colorado River, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and \nNew Mexico, and in at least one of the Lower Basin States of the \nColorado River, Arizona, Nevada or California. This is to assure that, \ntogether, the projects would demonstrate techniques applicable to a \nvariety of geologic and other conditions.\n  Under the bill, the Federal Government could pay up to half the cost \nof building each plant. However, no more than $1 million would be paid \nfor anyone project, and no Federal funds would be used for operating \nthe projects.\n  In the water-short West, the produced waters are a virtually untapped \nresource, and the benefits of using them for irrigation and other \npurposes could be substantial. It is estimated\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nthat up to 18 million barrels of produced waters are generated each \nyear from oil and gas operations. Finding ways to minimize the waters \nthat are produced during oil and gas extraction and then putting to \nbeneficial use those waters that are produced, is a win/win for \neveryone.\n  However, there are significant hurdles that must be overcome before \nproduced waters can be used as a water resource in ways that do not \nadversely affect our water quality or harm our environment. The study \nrequired in our bill will bring our country closer to using this \nimportant untapped resource.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues, here is a summary of the bill's \nprovisions:\n\nSection by Section Summary of the ``More Water, More Energy, Less Waste \n                         Act of 2007''--S. 1116\n\n       Section One--provides a short title (the ``More Water, More \n     Energy, Less Waste Act of 2001''), sets forth several \n     findings regarding the basis for the bill, and states the \n     bill's purpose: ``to optimize the production of energy \n     resources by minimizing the amount of produced water, and by \n     facilitating the use of produced water for irrigation and \n     other purposes without adversely affecting water quality or \n     the environment, and to demonstrate ways to accomplish these \n     results.''\n       Section Two--defines terms used in the bill.\n       Section Three--requires the Secretary of the Department of \n     Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, the \n     Director of the United States Geological Survey, and the \n     Director of the Bureau of Land Management, to conduct a study \n     to identify (1) the technical, economic, environmental, and \n     other obstacles to reducing the quantity of produced water; \n     (2) the technical, economic, environmental, legal, and other \n     obstacles to increasing the extent to which produced water \n     can be used for irrigation and other purposes, without \n     adversely affecting water quality or the environment; (3) the \n     legislative, administrative, and other actions that could \n     reduce or eliminate those obstacles; and (4) the costs and \n     benefits associated with reducing or eliminating those \n     obstacles. Results of the study are to be reported to \n     Congress within a year after enactment.\n       Section Four--provides that, subject to appropriation of \n     funds, the Interior Department is to provide financial \n     assistance for development of facilities to demonstrate the \n     feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of processes to \n     increase use of produced water for irrigation, municipal or \n     industrial uses, or other purposes without adversely \n     affecting water quality or the environment.

A bill to enhance nuclear safeguards and to provide \nassurances of nuclear fuel supply to countries that forgo certain fuel \ncycle activities; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nIndiana, Senator Bayh, to introduce the Nuclear Safeguards and Supply \nAct of 2007.\n  The future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the larger \nnonproliferation system it supports is in doubt. The existing \nsafeguards regime used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \nhas succeeded in forestalling nuclear weapons programs in the world's \nadvanced industrial states, several of which were weighing the nuclear \noption 40 years ago. Unfortunately, this regime has failed to keep pace \nwith the increase in the global availability of nuclear weapons \ntechnology, especially the technology and equipment for uranium \nenrichment and spent nuclear reactor fuel reprocessing, which can \nproduce fissile material for weapons. Now the road to nuclear weapons \ncan be traveled by determined countries with only a minimal industrial \nbase. While the number of recognized nuclear weapon states has not \ndramatically increased over the years, the dangers of proliferation \nhave become all too apparent as demonstrated by the A.Q. Khan network, \nthe Iranian, North Korean, and Libyan examples.\n  The construction of facilities for the enrichment of uranium and \nreprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in new states, even for ostensibly \npeaceful purposes, poses an unacceptable long-term risk to the national \nsecurity of the United States. The enrichment technology intended to \nproduce fuel for reactors can also be used to create highly-enriched \nuranium for a nuclear weapon, and the plutonium that is produced from \nreprocessing spent fuel is also suitable for nuclear weapons and \nsusceptible to diversion to terrorists. The spread of enrichment and \nreprocessing capabilities will dangerously increase the chances that \nnew nations will develop nuclear weapons and that terrorists might \nobtain fissile or radiological materials for crude devices. It is \ntherefore incumbent on the United States to lead an international \neffort to halt the expansion of enrichment and reprocessing to new \ncountries.\n  We know President Bush shares our assessment of this situation. On \nFebruary 11, 2004, he stated, ``The world's leading nuclear exporters \nshould ensure that states have reliable access at reasonable cost to \nfuel for civilian reactors, so long as those states renounce enrichment \nand reprocessing. Enrichment and reprocessing are not necessary for \nnations seeking to harness nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.''\n  The threats posed by new nuclear fuel cycle facilities in new states \nare made worse by the fact that the use of nuclear power is likely to \nincrease, both in developed and developing countries. As energy costs \nhave soared in recent years, many states are reexamining nuclear power \nas a potential source of electricity. Importantly, however, the \nexpansion of nuclear power does not require--either technically or \neconomically--the construction of enrichment or reprocessing facilities \nin countries that do not currently have them.\n  Senator Bayh and I believe the United States should adopt as a basic \nnonproliferation principle that countries who give up their own \nenrichment and reprocessing programs have an assurance, either \nbilateral or multilateral or both, of nuclear reactor fuel at \nreasonable prices. Today, the market provides the basic framework for \ncommerce in and access to nuclear fuel, and should not be interrupted \nby government action, but the exchange of nuclear fuel and fuel \nservices for enrichment and reprocessing capabilities is not currently \nexplicit. This would also require that states agreeing to accept fuel \nservices and leasing of fuel, in return for giving up joining the group \nof states possessing reprocessing and enrichment capabilities, would \nalso consent to wide access and close monitoring of their nuclear \nenergy activities, exceeding the requirements of the IAEA Additional \nProtocol. Related efforts in this area should also move forward in the \n[Nuclear Suppliers Group, where various nations have advocated a \ncriteria-based approach to nuclear fuel supply.\n  Unfortunately, as the world looks to increase the number of civilian \nnuclear power plants, the IAEA, charged with ensuring that energy \nprograms do not stray into weapons efforts through the verification of \nsafeguards agreements, operates on a shortsighted budget with old \nequipment. This situation threatens the institution, and to some degree \nthe nuclear stability that the IAEA's safeguards verification mandate \nsupports. The IAEA is responsible for verifying that states do not \nviolate their obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty \n(NPT). The IAEA monitors states' nuclear programs through safeguards \nagreements and additional protocols to ensure that nuclear material, \nequipment, and technology are used for declared, peaceful purposes.\n\n  Last November, I visited the IAEA and its Safeguards Analytical \nLaboratory (SAL), located just outside Vienna, Austria. Samples \ncollected by IAEA inspectors during inspections are brought to the SAL \nto verify that safeguards obligations are being met and that there are \nno undeclared materials and activities. Unfortunately the laboratory's \naging equipment and dangerous working conditions will hamper the \nimportant work done there, particularly as more samples arrive there \nand as more states expand their nuclear power infrastructure. Such a \nsituation could, in the future, shut down a critical nonproliferation \nfacility. The IAEA's nuclear materials analysis capability is \nvulnerable to a single point of failure given the situation at SAL. \nLaboratory staff is also severely limited in the time they can spend \nanalyzing evidence in the ``hot'' or nuclear part of SAL because of the \ndilapidated air purification system in one part of the laboratory. \nEqually disturbing, SAL is still using equipment manufactured in the \n1970's. If the IAEA is supposed to be the world's nuclear watchdog, the \nleast we can do is to provide the people who work there with \nappropriate and effective tools to do their job.\n  Absent refurbishment of SAL, or the construction of a new IAEA \nfacility with modem equipment, President Ronald Reagan's charge ``trust \nbut verify'' will be abandoned because we have not taken action.\n  The SAL helped to discover the inconsistencies in Iran's cover-up of \nits nuclear weapons program. The analysis and questioning by inspectors \nprompted stonewalling by Tehran. The Iranian failure to provide \ninformation and access led the IAEA Board of Governors to refer the \nmatter to the United Nations Security Council. While I wish this might \nhave happened more quickly, the fact is that SAL, the network of \nlaboratories in other Member States, and the IAEA's inspectors provided \nthe evidence necessary to build consensus on Iranian violations.\n  The Lugar-Bayh legislation works to create both bilateral and \nmultilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply by specifically \nauthorizing the President to pursue such mechanisms. Importantly, our \nlegislation takes note of the fact that merely ensuring fuel supply is \nnot enough to truly deal with the potential proliferation that could \narise as a result of many more nuclear reactors being built around the \nworld. Proliferation of fuel cycle technologies may continue, \nregardless of the ability of our Nation and others to craft layers of \nassurance in fuel supply. Our bill makes an important point--that fuel \nsupply for new nuclear power is as important as the safeguards applied \nto nuclear power.\n  The Lugar-Bayh legislation makes it the policy of the United States \nto discourage the development of enrichment and reprocessing \ncapabilities in additional countries, and to encourage the creation of \nbilateral and multilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply,\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\nand ensure that all supply mechanisms operate in strict accordance with \nthe IAEA safeguards system and do not result in any additional unmet \nverification burdens for the system. To ensure that SAL does not cease \nto function, we authorize an additional $10,000,000 for the \nrefurbishment or possible replacement of the IAEA Safeguards Analytical \nLaboratory. We also authorize the Secretary of State, in cooperation \nwith the Secretary of Energy and the Directors of the National \nLaboratories, and in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the \nDirector of National Intelligence, to pursue a program that will \nimprove nuclear safeguards technology development.\n  With regard to fuel supply, our bill authorizes the President to \ncreate, consistent with existing law, bilateral and multilateral \nmechanisms to provide a reliable supply of nuclear fuel to those \ncountries and groups of countries that adhere to policies designed to \nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and that decide to forgo a \nnational uranium enrichment program and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing \nfacilities. Such mechanisms must confront the challenges of \ninternational politics, thus the authority contained in the bill is \ndesigned to provide a flexible framework, rather than a final set of \nrequirements, for such mechanisms. The bill embraces both bilateral and \nmultilateral fuel supply mechanisms, and calls for a report on the \nestablishment of an International Nuclear Fuel Authority.\n  The United States cannot fix the IAEA's problems alone, but we must \nlead. An international diplomatic effort is required to raise the funds \nnecessary to ensure that the IAEA has the resources and leadership it \nneeds to continue its important mission. But the IAEA, its Member \nStates and Board of Governors must also act. The Board must review and \nrevise SAL staffing policies as they apply to professional staff \nworking at SAL to ensure that it attracts and retains key personnel. \nCurrent policies are self-defeating and force experts out just as they \nare accumulating the level of experience and expertise necessary to \nsucceed.\n  Not only is the existing IAEA infrastructure in desperate need of \nmodernization, but a global nuclear power expansion will require a \ncommensurate increase in IAEA capability. We must strengthen the \norganization to ensure that multiplying nuclear power facilities are \nnot diverted to weapons work. This can and should be accompanied by \nbetter support to our own efforts in verification activities and \ntechnologies, such as through the Key Assets Verification Fund at the \nDepartment of State and the U.S. Program of Technical Assistance to \nIAEA Safeguards or POTAS.\n  If the world is at the dawn of a new nuclear power age, then there \nwill be more facilities and materials for the IAEA to inspect and \nverify. The IAEA is not prepared for such a future, but there is still \ntime to put the necessary investments in place to ensure that it \ncontinues its important role. The United States and other Member States \nhave the ability to plan and make decisions now that will ensure a \nsafer nuclear power option in the future. It is incumbent upon the \nUnited States to assist in the construction of the best possible \nsafeguards system to provide for international peace and security. \nPeaceful uses of nuclear energy are only as good as the means to verify \nthem.\n  The current budget of the IAEA cannot sustain further stress, nor can \nthe world afford to allow another state to develop nuclear weapons in \nsecret. The IAEA is underfunded to perform its current tasks and would \nbe required to do much more should nuclear energy become more \nwidespread. The Bush Administration must significantly increase funding \nto the IAEA to improve its ability to exercise its rights and meet its \nobligations. We hope this legislation will begin that process.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee on \nForeign Relations on these important matters. I thank Senator Bayh for \nhis partnership in this endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. \n        Sanders):\n  S. 1139. A bill to establish the National Landscape Conservation \nSystem; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, together with Senators Salazar, \nCantwell, and Sanders, I am pleased today to introduce legislation to \ncodify the National Landscape Conservation System, the collection of \nnational monuments, national conservation areas, wilderness areas, wild \nand scenic rivers and other remarkable landscapes on our public lands \nadministered by the Bureau of Land Management.\n  The National Landscape Conservation System was established \nadministratively by the Department of the Interior in 2000 and consists \nof all areas the BLM administers for conservation purposes. The concept \nbehind grouping all of these areas into one system was to increase \npublic awareness of the importance of these lands and to highlight the \nBLM's conservation of these areas and their cultural, historical, \nscientific, and ecological significance to the Nation.\n  Within my own State of New Mexico, the National Landscape \nConservation System encompasses several nationally significant areas, \nincluding the rugged lava flows of El Malpais National Conservation \nArea, the unique cone-shaped rock formations of the Kasha-Katuwe Tent \nRocks National Monument, the Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River, the \nContinental Divide National Scenic Trail and the El Camino Real de \nTierra Adentro and Old Spanish Trail National Historic Trails, as well \nas over one million acres of wilderness and wilderness study areas.\n  However, because the NLCS was established administratively, it does \nnot have the permanence that it would have if enacted legislatively. In \naddition, legislative enactment of the NLCS will help increase the \nattention to these important, congressionally protected areas, and \nhopefully will help ensure that the system remains a high priority \nwithin the BLM and the Department of the Interior. The bill does not \ncreate any new management authority and does not change the authorities \nfor any of the previously designated areas within the system.\n  Given the broad public support for these areas, I expect this bill to \nbe non-controversial and it is my hope that it will be able to move \nquickly through the Congress and enactment into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Landscape \n     Conservation System Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (2) System.--The term ``system'' means the National \n     Landscape Conservation System established by section 3(a).\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION \n                   SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--In order to conserve, protect, and \n     restore nationally significant landscapes that have \n     outstanding cultural, ecological, and scientific values for \n     the benefit of current and future generations, there is \n     established in the Bureau of Land Management the National \n     Landscape Conservation System.\n       (b) Components.--The system shall include each of the \n     following areas administered by the Bureau of Land \n     Management:\n       (1) Each area that is designated as--\n       (A) a national monument;\n       (B) a national conservation area;\n       (C) an outstanding natural area;\n       (D) a wilderness study area;\n       (E) a component of the National Trails System;\n       (F) a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \n     System; or\n       (G) a component of the National Wilderness Preservation \n     System.\n       (2) Any area designated by Congress to be administered for \n     conservation purposes, including--\n       (A) the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and \n     Protection Area, as designated under section 101(a) of the \n     Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act of \n     2000 (16 U.S.C. 460nnn-11(a));\n       (B) the Headwaters Forest Reserve; and\n       (C) any additional area designated by Congress for \n     inclusion in the system.\n       (c) Management.--The Secretary shall manage the system--\n       (1) in accordance with any applicable law (including \n     regulations) relating to any component of the system included \n     under subsection (b); and\n       (2) in a manner that protects the values for which the \n     components of the system were designated.\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. Salazar. Mr. President, today Senator Bingaman and I are \nintroducing the National Landscape Conservation System Act, a bill that \nwill help protect some of our Nation's most treasured landscapes.\n  This bill, which we are introducing with Senators Cantwell and \nSanders, will make permanent a system of management for the 26 million \nmost spectacular acres of the 260 million acres that the Bureau of Land \nManagement oversees.\n  The National Landscape Conservation System was created \nadministratively in 2000 to guide the management of the national \nmonuments, national conservation areas, national wild and scenic \nrivers, wilderness areas, wilderness study areas, and national historic \nand scenic trails that are under the BLM's authority.\n  Many of these lands are on par with our national parks in their \nbeauty and value to the American people. Unfortunately, the National \nLandscape Conservation System has taken a backseat in our country's \nland conservation efforts. The NLCS has been shortchanged in funding in \nthe President's budget year in and year out. There are not enough \nresources or staff to properly manage these lands, and we are hearing a \ngrowing number of reports that natural, cultural, and archaeological \nsites on NLCS lands are being overrun or destroyed. Last year, a report \nby the National Trust for Historic Preservation painted a disappointing \nportrait of how cultural resources are being managed on BLM lands.\n  At Colorado's Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, home to the \nhighest density of cultural sites in America, 47 ancestral Puebloan \nsites were looted in the first half of 2006. With only one law \nenforcement officer for the entire monument, it is almost impossible to \nprevent this type of vandalism.\n  At McInnis Canyon National Conservation Area, also in Colorado, the \none law enforcement officer splits his time with other lands overseen \nby the BLM field office. How is one officer to be expected to protect \n1.3 million acres of BLM land?\n  This same unit of the NLCS shares an archaeologist with the Grand \nJunction, CO, field office. There is no way that an individual can \noversee the archaeological surveys under way in the area's booming oil \nand gas fields while still ensuring that the conservation area's \npetroglyphs, fossils, and archaeological treasures are documented and \nprotected.\n  The Secretary of the Interior took a good step in 2000 when he \nestablished the National Landscape Conservation System. The BLM should \nhave additional resources and tools for the management of lands that \nthe American people have determined to be of exceptional natural, \ncultural, recreational, scenic, or historic value. Unfortunately, this \nsystem has not come far in the last 7 years.\n  The administration provides no line item in the President's budget \nfor the system, NLCS units have endured repeated funding cuts, and \nthere are meager plans for where the system is going over the coming \ndecades.\n  The bill that Senator Bingaman and I are introducing today takes the \nfirst step in improving the stewardship of these crown jewel BLM lands. \nIt is a straightforward bill: it simply writes the National Landscape \nConservation System into law, making it permanent for the enjoyment of \nfuture generations.\n  The bill does not change how any of the units in the system are \nmanaged. Grazing rights, water rights, and public access to the \nnational monuments, the wilderness areas, and the conservation areas \nare unchanged.\n  The bill does, however, recognize that these landscapes are of great \ninterest to the American people and should be managed to protect their \nvalues.\n  Over the coming decades, these lands will become more widely used and \nknown. Americans are already coming to see these landscapes--places \nlike canyons of the Ancients National Monument or Gunnison Gorge \nNational Conservation Area--as treasures that match our great national \nparks and wildlife refuges.\n  This bill is a logical and needed step toward improving the \nmanagement of the units that comprise the National Landscape \nConservation. I thank Chairman Bingaman for his leadership on this \nissue, and I hope we will have an opportunity to move this bill through \nthe Senate as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reed, \n        Mrs. Murray, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 1142. A bill to authorize the acquisition of interests in \nundeveloped coastal areas in order better to ensure their protection \nfrom development; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Lautenberg \nto introduce the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act. We are \nintroducing this much needed coastal protection act along with Senators \nCochran, Warner, Wyden, Kennedy, Lieberman, Snowe, Boxer, Kerry, \nMenendez, Cantwell, Feinstein, Reed, Murray, Collins, and Sununu. In \naddition, this legislation is supported by the Trust for Public Land, \nThe Nature Conservancy, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the \nLand Trust Alliance, The Conservation Fund, Restore America's \nEstuaries, The Ocean Conservancy, American Fly Fishing Trade \nAssociation, Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, \nNational Estuarine Research Reserve Association, Association of \nNational Estuary Programs, Coastal States Organization, New Jersey \nAudubon Society, and the NY/NJ Baykeeper.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act promotes coordinated \nland acquisition and protection efforts in coastal and estuarine areas \nby fostering partnerships between non-governmental organizations and \nFederal, State, and local governments. As clearly outlined by the U.S. \nCommission of Ocean Policy, these efforts are urgently needed. With \nAmericans rapidly moving to the coast, pressures to develop critical \ncoastal ecosystems are increasing. There are fewer and fewer \nundeveloped and pristine areas left in the Nation's coastal and \nestuarine watersheds. These areas provide important nursery habitat for \ntwo-thirds of the Nation's commercial fish and shellfish, provide \nnesting and foraging habitat for coastal birds, harbor significant \nnatural plant communities, and serve to facilitate coastal flood \ncontrol and pollutant filtration.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act pairs willing sellers \nthrough community-based initiatives with sources of federal funds to \nenhance environmental protection. Lands can be acquired in full or \nthrough easements, and none of the lands purchased through this program \nwould be held by the Federal Government. This bill puts land \nconservation initiatives in the hands of State and local communities. \nThis new program, administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, would provide Federal matching funds to states with \napproved coastal management programs or to National Estuarine Research \nReserves through a competitive grant process. Federal matching funds \nmay not exceed 75 percent of the cost of a project under this program, \nand non-Federal sources may count in-kind support toward their portion \nof the cost share.\n  This coastal land protection program provides much needed support for \nlocal coastal conservation initiatives throughout the country. In New \nHampshire, we have worked collaborative1y with local communities, \nenvironmental groups, willing sellers, and the State to conserve lands \naround Great Bay, Sagamore Creek, Massacre Marsh, Hurd Farm, Moose \nMountain, Winnicut Headwaters, Marden Woods, Sleeper Wetlands, and the \nPiscassic River Greenway. These lands are home to a wide variety of \nplants and animal species that are particularly threatened by \nencroaching development and environmental pollutants. By working with \nlocal communities to purchase lands or easements on these valuable \nparcels of land, New Hampshire has been able to successfully conserve \nthe natural and scenic heritage of this vital estuary.\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\n  Programs like the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection program will \nfurther enable other states to participate in these community-based \nconservation efforts in coastal areas. This program was modeled after \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture's successful Forest Legacy Program, \nwhich has conserved millions of acres of productive and ecologically \nsignificant forest land around the country.\n  I welcome the opportunity to offer this important legislation, with \nmy good friend from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg. I am thankful for \nhis leadership on this issue, and look forward to working with him to \nmake the vision for this legislation a reality, and to successfully \nconserve our coastal lands for their ecological, historical, \nrecreational, and aesthetic values.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Gregg in \nour introduction of legislation that would help protect and preserve \nthe valuable coastal and estuarine lands of our Nation.\n  Development of the Nation's coastal and estuarine areas poses an \nincreasing threat to water quality, wildlife habitat, flood protection, \nand recreational opportunities. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy \nemphasized that intact coastal lands are vital to ensuring the \necological and economic health of coastal communities. However, as \nthese areas are fragmented and disappear, so do the benefits they \nprovide. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act (CELP) would \nauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as \nthe lead Federal agency supporting State, local or private acquisition \nof land or conservation easements in undeveloped coastal areas in order \nto ensure their protection from development. The Joint Ocean Commission \nInitiative has identified enactment of the Coastal and Estuarine Land \nProtection Act as a high priority for improving our coastal resource \nmanagement. This legislation builds upon the existing Coastal and \nEstuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP) within NOAA. The Program \nallows States to compete for matching funds to acquire land or \neasements for the protection of sensitive coastal ecosystems. The \nFederal funds provided through this program help leverage additional \nState, local and private funding.\n  The CELCP complements private, Federal and State conservation \nprograms. This program is based on the highly successful Forest Legacy \nprogram which is a Federal-State partnership program that supports \nefforts to protect environmentally sensitive forest lands. Permanent \nprotection of lands in the coastal zone is also necessary to maintain \nand enhance coastal and estuarine areas for the benefit of the Nation, \nincluding protecting water quality, keeping public beachfront \naccessible, conserving wildlife habitat, and sustaining sport and \ncommercial fisheries.\n  Coastal and estuarine areas are some of the most productive \necosystems on earth. They are home to countless plants, animals, birds, \nand fish. These are complex ecosystems that provide a foundation for \nmarine life as well as protection of inland areas from storm damage. \nOver the last 150 years the national system of estuaries has decreased \nin size because of our growing coastal populations and short-sighted \nland-use planning. Today our coastal areas are home to over 150 million \nAmericans, about 53 percent of the U.S. population, and over 180 \nmillion people visit the coasts each year. Due to the increasing \npressures from development in low-lying areas, NOAA has estimated 80 \npercent of our Nations' coastal waters are impaired for human use and \nmarine life.\n  The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established \nunder the Coastal Zone Management Act is a network of 27 protected \nestuaries throughout the United States, including the Jacques Cousteau \nNERRS site in New Jersey. These are pristine areas that provide public \neducation and conservation awareness, and serve as living laboratories \nfor scientific research. The funds provided through the CELP program \nestablished by our legislation would promote the expansion of these \nestuarine areas and assist in keeping coastal ecosystems healthy and \nproductive.\n\n  Federal funds help make New Jersey conservation possible. New \nJersey's treasured natural resources--from the Meadowlands to the \nmarshlands of Barnegat Bay--have substantially benefited from Federal \nsupport. The existing CELCP has aided in securing protection for over a \nthousand acres in New Jersey including lands for Gunning Island, \nTuckerton Creek, and the Harbor Herons project. This week there will be \na formal dedication of a 115-acre property, acquired with the aid of \nCELCP, on Potter Creek in Berkeley Township for public use and \nrecreation. Lands have been protected in the Manahawkin Marsh, for \nwildlife habitat, including migratory birds along the Atlantic Flyway. \nIn Ocean County, the CELCP helped secure the acquisition of 800 acres \non Tuckerton Creek in Little Egg Harbor which is vital to protecting \nAtlantic white cedar stands and improving the water quality of the \nBarnegat Bay. These projects have successfully protected our coasts \nwhile sustaining human activity.\n  The coastal zone is essential to our country's prosperity and well-\nbeing. The coastal and estuarine lands are areas of national importance \nand they are vulnerable to human activities. From 2002 through 2006 \ntwenty-five States have benefited from the CELCP. Now is the time for \nCongress to authorize this program to conserve lands that are vital to \nour Nation.\n  The bill Senator Gregg and I are introducing today, the Coastal and \nEstuarine Land Protection Act, will ensure an ongoing partnership \nbetween Federal, State, and local governments to support the economic \nand natural resource base of communities through the acquisition of \ncoastal and estuarine lands. This legislation offers the opportunity \nfor States to protect coastal and estuarine areas that have significant \nconservation, recreation, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values \nand are threatened by conversion to other uses.\n  The organizations supporting this legislation include The Trust for \nPublic Land, The American Littoral Society, NY/NJ Baykeeper, \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Land Trust Alliance, Restore \nAmerica's Estuaries, American Fly Fishing Trade Association, Society \nfor the Protection of New Hampshire's Forests, National Estuarine \nResearch Reserve Association, Association of National Estuary Programs, \nThe Ocean Conservancy, Coastal States Organization, The Conservation \nFund, The Nature Conservancy, and the New Jersey Audubon Society. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter of support from these groups be printed \nin the Record.\n  I would like to thank Senator Gregg for his long-time leadership on \nthis issue. I would also like to thank Senator Mikulski for her many \nyears of support for this legislation. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with Senator Gregg and my colleagues in the Senate to ensure its \npassage so that we can fill this vital need for coastal and estuarine \nprotection.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Gregg and Lautenberg: On behalf of the \n     organizations listed below, we would like to thank you for \n     your longstanding support of coastal zone management and \n     coastal land conservation. We are writing today in support of \n     the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act (CELP), which \n     would formally codify the Coastal and Estuarine Land \n     Conservation Program. This program was created by Congress in \n     FY 2002 in order to ``protect those coastal and estuarine \n     areas with significant conservation, recreation, ecological, \n     historical or aesthetic values, or that are threatened by \n     conversion from their natural or recreational states to other \n     uses.'' Thus far, this program has invested over $177 million \n     towards 119 conservation projects in 25 of the nation's 35 \n     coastal states. This federal investment has leveraged more \n     than an equal amount of state, local and private funding, \n     demonstrating the importance of coastal protection throughout \n     the nation and the critical role of federal funding to its \n     success.\n       Our nation's coastal zone is under significant pressures \n     from unplanned development. In fact, it is estimated that by \n     2025, nearly 75 percent of the nation's population will live \n     within 50 miles of the coast, in addition to millions more \n     who enjoy America's storied coastlines. Across the nation, \n     beaches and waterfronts have always been the destination of \n     choice for Americans. Fully one-half of the nation's gross \n     domestic product, $4.5\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\n     trillion annually, is generated in coastal watershed \n     counties, inexorably linking our coastal zone with the \n     economic health of the nation.\n       As a result of this economic boom, rapid, unplanned \n     development has marred the once-pristine viewshed and \n     substantially reduced public access to the coast. The \n     resulting increase in impervious surfaces has correspondingly \n     increased non-point source pollution and seriously degraded \n     coastal and estuarine waters. The loss of coastal wetlands \n     has drastically impaired estuaries, some of the most \n     productive habitat on earth, and has exacerbated damage from \n     coastal storms. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy has also \n     stressed the importance of land conservation as part of its \n     broader recommendations to Congress and the nation.\n       From our first-hand experience at the local level, we know \n     that CELP will significantly leverage ongoing community-based \n     conservation, and will provide a much needed boost to local \n     efforts. Given the importance of healthy, productive and \n     accessible coastal areas, a federal commitment to state and \n     local coastal protection is a sound investment. The new \n     legislation codifies the existing investment that Congress \n     has already made to coastal protection and authorizes the \n     program formally. We believe this is an important and \n     necessary step to enhance efforts to ensure safe and \n     accessible coastal waters.\n       We thank you for introducing this legislation, and look \n     forward to working with you towards its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gary J.

A bill to designate the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse and the \nsurrounding Federal land in the State of Florida as an Outstanding \nNatural Area and as a unit of the National Landscape System, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \ndesignating the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse and the 126 surrounding acres \nin Jupiter, Florida, as an ``Outstanding Natural Area.'' The Jupiter \nLighthouse is a local and regional icon, full of rich history and home \nto many endangered plant and animal species. Designating the lighthouse \nas an ``Outstanding Natural Area'' will preserve the rich cultural \nheritage and important ecological value of the site. This designation \nwould give the Jupiter Inlet the distinction of being the sole East \nCoast representative of the National Landscape Conservation System--the \neastern counterpart to the Yaquina Head Lighthouse in Oregon.\n  This bill is the product of the hard work and cooperation of many \npeople in Florida, including the Town of Jupiter Island, the Town of \nJupiter, the Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County, the \nLoxahatchee River Historical Society, and numerous others. I am also \npleased that Representative Tim Mahoney is introducing similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1143\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for an assessment of the achievements by \nthe Government of Iraq of benchmarks for\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\npolitical settlement and national reconciliation in Iraq; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the monumental and \nconsequential matter regarding the future course of the United States \nand our courageous men and women in uniform in Iraq.\n  Today, we are at a profoundly challenging moment in time, and at a \ncritical crossroads with respect to our direction in this war. I know \nthat none of us arrive at this question lightly. In my 28-year tenure \nin Congress, I have witnessed and participated in debates on such vital \nmatters as Lebanon, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, and \nKosovo. And indisputably, myriad, deeply-held beliefs and arguments \nwere expressed on those pivotal matters--some in concert, some \ncomplementary, some in conflict. Yet, without question, all were rooted \nin mutual concern for--and love of--our great Nation. And there was--\nand should not be today--no question about our support for our brave \nand extraordinary troops.\n  It is therefore with the utmost respect for our troops that I today \nintroduce a bill which allows them the ability to complete the mission \nthey have selflessly undertaken, while assuring them that their valor \nshall not be unconditionally expended upon an Iraqi government which \nfails to respond in kind. This amendment requires that government to \nactually achieve previously agreed political and security benchmarks \nwhile the Baghdad Security Plan--commonly referred to as the \n``surge''--is in effect, or face the redeployment of those U.S. troops \ndedicated to that plan.\n  Specifically, this legislation would require that, 120 days after \nenactment--a point in time at which our military commanders have stated \nthat they should know whether the surge will succeed--the Commander of \nMulti-National Forces, Iraq would report to Congress as to whether the \nIraqi government has met each of six political and security-related \nbenchmarks which it has already agreed to meet by that time. These six \nbenchmarks are:\n  Iraqi assumption of control of its military . . .\n  Enactment of a Militia Law to disarm and demobilize militias and to \nensure that such security forces are accountable only to the central \ngovernment and loyal to the constitution of Iraq . . .\n  Completion of the constitutional review and a referendum held on \nspecial amendments to the Iraqi Constitution that ensure equitable \nparticipation in the government of Iraq without regard to religious \nsect or ethnicity . . .\n  Completion of provincial election law and preparation for the conduct \nof provincial elections that ensures equitable constitution of \nprovincial representative bodies without regard to religious sect or \nethnicity . . .\n  Enactment and implementation of legislation to ensure that the energy \nresources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other \nIraqi citizens in an equitable manner; and\n  Enactment and implementation of legislation that equitably reforms \nthe de-Ba'athification process in Iraq.\n  The Iraqi Government must know that any opportunity gained from our \nincreased troop levels in Baghdad is a window that we will soon close \nif it fails to take urgent action and show tangible results in tandem. \nIf, at the end of 120 days, the Commander of Multi-National Forces, \nIraq reports the Iraqi Government has not met the benchmarks, then the \nCommander should plan for the phased redeployment of the troops we \nprovided for the Baghdad Security Plan, period.\n  That is why, under this amendment, after 120 days, should the \nCommander report that the Iraqi Government has failed to meet the \nbenchmarks listed, he will then be required to present a plan for the \nphased redeployment of those combat troops sent to Iraq in support of \nthe Baghdad Security Plan and to provide plans detailing the transition \nof the mission of the U.S. forces remaining in Iraq to one of \nlogistical support, training, force protection, and targeted counter-\nterrorism operations--i.e., those functions set forth in the Iraq Study \nGroup Report. As General Petraeus stated in March, ``I have an \nobligation to the young men and women in uniform out here, that if I \nthink it's not going to happen, to tell them that it's not going to \nhappen, and there needs to be a change.''\n  The message must be loud and clear--the Iraqi government must \nunderstand in no uncertain terms that our presence is neither open-\nended nor unconditional, and I support setting conditions for a phased \nwithdrawal. My concern with the supplemental appropriations bill stems \nfrom the fact that it mandates a specific date for troop withdrawal by \nrequiring it to occur within 120 days of passage. This arbitrary \ntimeline would telegraph a precise and immediate departure date to our \nenemies that I believe would jeopardize the security of our men and \nwomen remaining on the ground.\n  Moreover, this mandated, 120-day timetable does not place the \nnecessary pressure and conditions on the Iraqi government to implement \nnational reconciliation and solidify their own security. Rather, we \nshould require that the Iraqi government complete work within 120 days \non the specific, concrete benchmarks they have already agreed to that \nwould lead to national reconciliation. If the Iraqis cannot meet these \nbenchmarks within this 120-day period, our commanders should begin \nplanning for the phased redeployment of the troops we deployed for the \nBaghdad Security Plan.\n  My colleagues may recall that I opposed the surge because I did not--\nand still do not--believe that additional troops are a substitute for \npolitical will and capacity. General Petraeus said last month that a \npolitical resolution is crucial because that is what will determine in \nthe long run the success of this effort. I could not agree more. The \nfact is, America and the world require more than Iraq's commitment \nto accomplishing the benchmarks that will lead to a true national \nreconciliation--we must see actual results. The Iraqi Government must \nfind the will to ensure that it represents and protects the rights of \nevery Iraqi.\n\n  After our four-year commitment, Iraq's Government should not doubt \nthat we must observe more than incremental steps toward political \nreconciliation we require demonstrable changes. While limited progress \nhas been made on necessary legislative initiatives such as the \nHydrocarbon Law, it is in fact a sheaf of laws and not just a single \nmeasure that must pass to ensure that all Iraqis have a share and stake \nin their government. Chief among these are constitutional amendments \nwhich will permit Iraqis of all ethnicities and confessions to be \nrepresented at the local level of government. Yet, so far, the review \ncommittee has yet to even finish drafts of these critical amendments.\n  I believe we were all encouraged by the recent Ambassadorial meetings \nin Baghdad and the follow-on ministerial conference called at the Iraqi \ngovernment's request. These talks are vital to securing Iraq's border, \nreversing the flow of refugees, and stemming the foreign interference \nwhich exacerbates sectarian divisions. But we also look for the Iraqi \ngovernment's leadership in dismantling the militias and strengthening \nthe National Army so that it is truly a national institution that can \nprovide the security so desperately desired by all Iraqis in every \nprovince.\n  We are now three months into the surge, and our troops have made \ngains in reducing the still horrific levels of violence on Baghdad \nthrough their heroic efforts. Yet it is deeply concerning to me that--\nmirroring the slowness with which the Iraqi government has moved on \npolitical reforms--their sacrifice remains by and largely unmatched by \ntheir Iraqi counterparts.\n  Two weeks ago, Leon Panetta, a member of the Iraq Study Group, wrote \nthe following in a New York Times Op-Ed, ``. . . every military \ncommander we talked to felt that the absence of national reconciliation \nwas the fundamental cause of violence in Iraq. As one American general \ntold us, `if the Iraqi government does not make political progress on \nreforms, all the troops in the world will not provide security.' `` He \nwent on to enumerate the progress or, more to the point, the lack of \nprogress toward the agreed upon benchmarks and concluded that `unless \nthe United States finds new ways to bring strong pressure on the \nIraqis, things are not likely to pick up any time soon.'''\n  In fact, over the past few months, many have come to the realization \nthat political action by the Iraqi government is a paramount precursor \nto\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\nnational reconciliation and stability and, without it, the Baghdad \nSecurity Plan is only a temporary, tactical fix for one specific \nlocation. And while we are hearing about incremental successes, I agree \nwith Thomas Friedman who said recently in an interview, ``there's only \none metric for the surge working, and that is whether we're seeing a \nnegotiation among Iraqis to share power, to stabilize the political \nsituation in Iraq, which only they can do . . . telling me that the \nviolence is down 10 percent or 8 percent here or 12 percent there, I \ndon't really think that's the metric at all.''\n  To this day, the public looks to the United States Senate to temper \nthe passions of politics and to bridge divides. And if ever there were \na moment when Americans are imploring us to live up to the moniker of \n``world's greatest deliberative body,'' that moment is upon us.\n  If I had a son or daughter or other family member serving in Iraq, I \nwould want at least the assurance that someone was speaking up to tell \nthe Iraqi government--and frankly our government as well--that my \nfamily's sacrifice must be matched by action and sacrifice on the part \nof the Iraqi government. I would want to know that the most profound of \nall issues was fully debated by those who are elected to provide \nleadership. For those of us who seek success in Iraq, and believe that \na strategy predicated on political and diplomatic solutions--not merely \nincreased troop levels--presents the strongest opportunity to reach \nthat goal, let us coalesce around this bill, which will allow us to \nspeak as one voice strong . . . together . . . and united in service to \na purpose we believe to be right.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, \n        and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1145. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to provide for \npatent reform; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our patent system is grounded in the \nConstitution. Among the specifically enumerated powers of Congress in \nArticle I, Section 8, stands the command to ``promote the progress of \nscience and the useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors \nand inventors the exclusive right to their respective discoveries.'' \nThose discoveries have, since the founding of our Nation, made us the \nenvy of the world. Our inventors, our research institutions, and the \nmany companies that commercialize those discoveries have brought a \nwealth of new products and processes to our society; we have all been \nthe beneficiaries of that creativity and hard work.\n  Vermont has long played an important role in bringing such inventions \nto the public, combining `Yankee ingenuity' with lots of sweat equity. \nIn fact, the very first U.S. patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins, a \nfarmer in Pittsford, VT, who discovered a process for making potash. \nThat ethic continues to the present day; just last year, inventors in \nIBM's Essex Junction plant received 360 patents 10 percent of IBM's \ntotal U.S. patents.\n  Vermont is special, of course, but not unique in this regard. \nAmerican inventors are in every community, every company and school. \nThey are individuals tinkering on the weekends in their garages. They \nare teams of PhDs in our largest corporations. They are scientists \ntraining students in laboratories at our colleges and universities. Our \npatent laws should support and reward all American innovators--\nindependent inventors, small businesses, venture capitalists, academic \nresearchers, and large corporations. To do so, we must update our \npatent laws. Crafted for an earlier time, when smokestacks rather than \nmicrochips were the emblems of industry, those laws have served well \nbut need some refinements.\n  Senator Hatch and I introduced an earlier version of this bill, S. \n3818, last August. At that time, I said we had taken the first step \ndown a road to real, constructive patent reform, which could reduce the \nunnecessary burdens of litigation in the patent system and enhance the \nquality of patents granted by the Patent and Trademark Office. Senator \nHatch wisely noted that we would have to have continuing conversations \nabout issues that remained unresolved. We have spent the time since \nthen hearing from all manner of interested parties, and indeed we have \nlearned as much since we introduced S. 3818 as we had in the two years \nprior to its introduction.\n  In this Congress, the partnership is not only bipartisan but \nbicameral. We have reached not only across the aisle but across the \nHill to work out a bill that joins the Senate and the House, Democrats \nand Republicans, so that today we are introducing a Leahy-Hatch bill in \nthe Senate that mirrors a Berman-Smith bill in the House. The message \nis both strong and clear: We have a unified and resolute approach to \nimproving the nation's patent system. We will all have time to focus on \nthe bill's many provisions in the weeks to come, but I would highlight \nthree significant changes we have made since last summer, aided by the \nmany stakeholders in this process.\n  First, the Patent Reform Act of 2007 now includes a pure ``first-to-\nfile'' system, which will inject needed clarity and certainty into the \nsystem. The United States stands alone among nations that grant patents \nin giving priority for a patent to the first inventor, as opposed to \nthe first to file a patent application for a claimed invention. The \nresult is a lack of international consistency, and a complex and costly \nsystem in the United States to determine inventors' rights. At the same \ntime, our legislation provides important protections for inventors at \nuniversities, by permitting them to discuss publicly their work without \nlosing priority for their inventions.\n  Second, poor patent quality has been identified as a key element of \nthe law that needs attention. After a patent is issued, a party seeking \nto challenge the validity and enforceability of the patent has two \navenues under current law: by reexamination proceeding at the USPTO or \nby litigation in federal district court. The former is used sparingly \nand some see it as ineffective; the latter, district court litigation, \ncan be unwieldy and expensive. S. 3818 had created a new, post-grant \nreview to provide an effective and efficient system for considering \nchallenges to the validity of patents. The Patent Reform Act of 2007 \nhas improved that system, and in particular, we have addressed concerns \nabout misuse of the procedure. Post-grant review will include \nprotections to avoid the possibility of misuse of the post-grant \nprocess. The Director is instructed to prescribe rules to prevent \nharassment or abuse, successive petitions are prohibited, and \npetitioners are barred from raising the same arguments in court.\n  Third, we are keenly aware that a sound patent system needs fair and \nequitable remedies. As products have become more complex, often \ninvolving hundreds or even thousands of patented aspects, litigation \nhas not reliably produced damages awards in infringement cases that \ncorrespond to the value of the infringed patent. Our bill last summer \nwas our first effort to ensure that damages awards accurately reflected \nthe harm caused by infringement. Subsequent conversations with many \naffected parties have led us to language that, we believe, better \nserves that purpose and avoids potential pitfalls.\n  The Patent Reform Act of 2007 is also significant for what is not \nincluded. S. 3818 would have made three considerable changes to the \npatent laws that, upon further consideration and after listening to the \naffected parties, we have decided not to make in this year's \nlegislation. First is the requirement that patent applicants not \nintentionally misrepresent a material fact or fail to disclose material \ninformation to the PTO. Candor and truthfulness are the backbone of the \npatent application system, and are protected by the inequitable conduct \ndoctrine. S. 3818 would have weakened that doctrine, but it is \npreserved this year. Second, we maintain the traditional rule on \nattorneys' fees, instead of shifting fees and other expenses to the \nnon-prevailing party as was proposed in S. 3818. Finally, we do not \ninject Congress into the ongoing litigation over the extra-territorial \nprovision, section 271(f). S. 3818 would have repealed the provision in \nits entirety; the Patent Reform Act of 2007 does not, while the \ninterpretation of the provision is currently pending before the Supreme \nCourt. If the Court does not resolve that issue, we will revisit it in \nthe legislative process.\n  If we are to maintain our position at the forefront of the world's \neconomy, if\n\n[[Page S4686]]\n\nwe are to continue to lead the globe in innovation and production, if \nwe are to continue to enjoy the fruits of the most creative citizens, \nthen we must have a patent system that produces high quality patents, \nthat limits counterproductive litigation over those patents, and that \nmakes the entire system more streamlined and efficient. This bill is an \nimportant step towards that goal. I look forward to immediate and \nintense debate that will inform both the Members of Congress and the \npublic about these improvements, that will allow us to further refine \nour legislation, and that will lead us to consideration on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1145\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senate \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy the Patent Reform Act of \n2007, S. 1145. S. 1145 represents years of careful negotiation and \ninput from a wide-spectrum of stake holders. In fact, the 2006 Hatch-\nLeahy bill has served as a blueprint for this year's legislation and \ncontains substantially similar language. Chairman Leahy's desire to \nhave a piece of legislation that is both bipartisan and bicameral is a \ngreat undertaking and represents a tremendous commitment by Congress to \nmove forward in streamlining and strengthening our patent system.\n  The patent system is the bedrock of innovation, especially in today's \nglobal economy. Last year, more than 440,000 patent applications were \nfiled at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The \nsheer volume of patent applications reflects the vibrant, innovative \nspirit that has made America a world-wide leader in science, \nengineering, and technology. Because America's ingenuity continues to \nfund our economy, we must protect new ideas and investments in \ninnovation and creativity. Patents encourage technological advancement \nby providing incentives to invent, invest in, and disclose new \ntechnology. Now, more than ever, it is important to ensure efficiency \nand increased quality in the issuance of patents. This in turn creates \nan environment that fosters entrepreneurship and the creation of jobs: \ntwo significant pillars in our economy. In my home State of Utah alone, \nthere are over 3,200 technology and 500 life science companies, and \neight percent year-over-year growth. Utah leads the western States \nregion in creating and sustaining these companies.\n  Additionally, the concentration of college graduates in Utah is \ncontributing to the State's technological friendliness, attracting \ngrowth companies to Utah and creating new ones. There is a large, young \nadult population in Utah attending not only the two world-class \nresearch universities of the University of Utah and Utah State \nUniversity, but also Brigham Young University, Utah Valley State \nCollege and Weber State University. These universities and colleges are \nstrong economic drivers that encourage technology industry growth in my \nState.\n  For years, Chairman Leahy and I have been working together to craft \nmeaningful patent reform to address problems that have been identified \nthrough a series of hearings and discussions with stake holders. This \nbill addresses many of the problems with the substantive, procedural, \nand administrative aspects of the patent system, which governs how \nentities here in the United States apply for, receive, and eventually \nmake use of patents.\n  The Patent Reform Act of 2007 includes provisions to improve patent \nquality. Many complaints about the current patent system deal with the \nnumber of suspect and over-broad patents that are issued. Because bad \npatents are generally of little value to productive companies, in many \ncases their value is maximized by using them as a basis for \ninfringement suits against deep-pocket defendants. This bill institutes \na robust post-grant review process so that third parties can challenge \nsuspect patents in an administrative process, rather than through \ncostly litigation. In the bill we introduced today, Section 6 has been \ntightened by including an anti-harassment provision to discourage \ncompanies from colluding and perpetually harassing one company. I am \nhopeful this will serve as a deterrent to those who seek to abuse post-\ngrant review process.\n  In addition, S. 1145 is designed to harmonize U.S. law with the law \nof other countries by instituting a first-to-file system. The United \nStates is the only significant country following the first-to-invent \nsystem, in which the right of the patent lies with the first inventor, \nrather than the first inventor to file for a patent. The Patent Reform \nAct of 2007 provides greater certainty because the filing date of an \napplication can very rarely be challenged.\n  S. 1145 also seeks to provide fair and equitable remedies. Some claim \nthat courts have allowed damages for infringement to be based on the \nmarket for an entire product when all that was infringed is a minor \ncomponent of the product. The bill's language preserves the current \nrule that mandates that a damages award shall not be less than a \nreasonable royalty for the infringed patent, and further requires the \ncourt to conduct an analysis to ensure that when a reasonable royalty \nis the award, it reflects only the economic value of the patent's \nspecific contribution over the prior art.\n  There are a few provisions I believe need further discussion. I was \ndisappointed that the inequitable conduct provision from last year's \nbill was removed. Attorneys well know that the inequitable conduct \ndefense has been overpleaded and has become a drag on the litigation \nprocess. I think last year's language struck the correct balance by \nfocusing on the patentability of the claims in dispute and properly \nprevented parties from asserting the defense frivolously. Let me hasten \nto add that I do believe there should be consequences for misconduct. I \nbelieve that reforms to the inequitable conduct defense should focus on \nthe nature\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\nof the misconduct and not permit the unenforceability of a perfectly \nvalid patent on a meritorious invention. And, sanctions should be \ncommensurate with the misconduct.\n  Moreover, establishing inequitable conduct is supposed to require \nindependent proof that: (1) the information at issue was material; and \n(2) the person who failed to disclose it or made the misrepresentation \nhad the specific intention of misleading the USPTO. The two elements \nhave become linked, and courts often discount the intent requirement by \nfinding that the information is ``highly material.'' In fact, the \nmateriality standard has become so inclusive that virtually anything \nnow is portrayed as material. Information should only be considered \nmaterial when it causes the USPTO to improperly grant patent claims. \nUsing a standard of whether USPTO examiners would reject the claims is \na good approximation of materiality because of the prima facie standard \nthey use to determine whether the claims meet the requirements for \npatentability. Unfortunately, this bill preserves the status quo.\n  A provision that would provide attorneys' fees and costs to a \nprevailing party was also left out of this bill. I included this \nprovision in last year's bill to discourage weak cases from clogging \nthe already-burdened judicial system. This is not a new concept in the \nrealm of intellectual property. In fact, I note, Section 505 of the \nCopyright Act clearly provides courts the discretion to award \nattorneys' fees and costs. It seems logical that we would provide the \nsame discretion in S. 1145 and I look forward to discussing this issue \nwith Chairman Leahy.\n  We opted this year not to include a provision that would repeal \nSection 271(f) of Title 35, pending a Supreme Court decision that is \nexpected soon. Section 271(f) creates a cause of action for \ninfringement due to foreign sales when a component of a patented \ninvention is supplied from this country, knowing that a component will \nbe combined in an infringing manner outside the United States. In the \nevent of an unfavorable ruling, Chairman Leahy and I are committed to \naddressing this issue using the legislative process.\n  Patent law is vital to our Nation's ability to compete in the global \neconomy. S. 1145 is designed to ensure that the United States remains \nat the forefront of developing and translating new ideas into tangible \ngoods and services through an effective patent review and protection \nsystem\n  This bill represents a commitment from Congress to move forward in \nstreamlining and strengthening our patent system. I am hopeful that \nfurther refinements will be made to this bill during the legislative \nprocess. I am committed to moving this legislation forward and hope \nthat we can join efforts to refine and enact this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mr. Tester, Mr. Burr, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Collins, Mr. Pryor, \n        Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1146. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nhealth care for veterans who live in rural areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rural Veterans \nHealthcare Improvement Act of 2007, with my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Thune, and my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester. \nWe are pleased to be joined by Senators Burr, Murray, Grassley, Wyden, \nCollins, Pryor, Enzi, Lincoln, Snowe, Kerry, Bingaman, Smith, Baucus, \nand Dorgan.\n  Over the last two years my colleagues have heard me speak repeatedly \nabout the challenges that are facing rural America. In the America \nwhere I grew up--the America of farmers, ranchers, small business \nowners, and generations of close-knit families--it is getting more \ndifficult to make a living, to access affordable healthcare, and to \nprovide opportunities for kids to learn and grow.\n  The challenges facing veterans in rural communities are particularly \ngrave. For generations, men and women from rural America have devoted \nthemselves to the cause of freedom without hesitation and in numbers \ngreatly beyond their proportion of the U.S. population. Yet we \nconsistently overlook the unique challenges these men and women face \nafter they return home to their families and friends in the heartland \nof America. When it comes to the VA healthcare system, we fail our \nNation's rural veterans by not doing more to ensure they can access the \nhigh-quality health care they have earned. We owe them much better.\n  Over and over, I hear from veterans in my state about obstacles to \ncare. In northwest Colorado, veterans must brave three and four hour \ndrives on winding mountain roads to reach the VA hospital in Grand \nJunction.\n  In northeast Colorado I have heard from a veteran who must travel 500 \nmiles round trip just to get a simple blood test at a VA hospital. I \nthink most of my colleagues would agree with me that this is ludicrous.\n  I wish I could say these are isolated circumstances. Unfortunately, \nthey are not. Because of gaps in the network of VA hospitals and \nclinics, we hear stories like this all the time.\n  Every day, veterans from rural communities throughout the country are \nforced to put off crucial treatment because they live too far from VA \nfacilities and can't get the care they need. As a result, rural \nveterans die younger and suffer from more debilitating illnesses--all \nbecause our system is not equipped to address their needs and provide \ncare accordingly. A 2004 study of over 750,000 veterans conducted by \nDr. Jonathan Perlin, the Under Secretary for Health at the VA, \nconsistently found that veterans living in rural areas are in poorer \nhealth than their urban counterparts.\n  Last year, we took an important first step in improving care for \nrural veterans. Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of my colleagues on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, we were able to create the Office of \nRural Health within the VA. The Office of Rural Health is charged with \nworking to reduce the wide disparities between care for rural and non-\nrural veterans by developing and refining policies and programs to \nimprove care and services for rural veterans. Because nearly one in \nevery four veterans is from a rural area, the creation of this Office \nof Rural Health is crucial if we are to live up to our promise to \nprovide all of our Nation's veterans with high-quality services.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Rural Veterans Healthcare and \nImprovement Act of 2007, builds on last year's work by giving direction \nand resources to the Office of Rural Health and by making healthcare \nmore accessible to veterans in rural areas.\n  The bill tasks the Office of Rural Health with developing \ndemonstration projects that would expand care in rural areas through \npartnerships between the VA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, and the Department of Health and Human Services at critical \naccess hospitals and community health centers. The bill also instructs \nthe Director of the Office of Rural Health to carry out demonstration \nprojects in partnership with the Indian Health Service to improve \nhealthcare for Native American veterans.\n  In addition, the Rural Veterans Healthcare Improvement Act of 2007 \nestablishes centers of excellence to research ways to improve care for \nrural veterans. The centers would be based at VA medical centers with \nstrong academic connections. The Office of Rural Health would establish \nbetween one and five centers across the country with the advice of an \nadvisory panel.\n  The Rural Veterans Healthcare Improvement Act includes two key \nprovisions that will help veterans in rural areas reach healthcare \nfacilities.\n  First, the bill establishes the VetsRide grant program to provide \ninnovative transportation options to veterans in remote rural areas. \nThe bill tasks the Director of the Office of Rural Health to create a \nprogram that would provide grants of up to $50,000 to veterans' service \norganizations and State veterans' service officers to assist veterans \nwith travel to VA medical\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\ncenters and to improve healthcare access in remote rural areas. The \nbill authorizes $3 million per year for the grant program through 2012.\n  Secondly, the bill increases the reimbursement rates for veterans for \ntheir travel expenses related to VA medical care so that they are \ncompensated at the same rate paid to federal employees.\n  Finally, our bill requires the VA to report to Congress on the \nassessment it is conducting of its fee-based healthcare policies. We \nneed to improve the VA's fee-based healthcare policies to be more \nequitable and efficient in helping veterans in rural areas get the care \nthey deserve.\n  With almost one-quarter of our Nation's veterans living in rural \ncommunities, and with the obstacles they face in accessing high-quality \ncare, it is evident that we need to do a better job of making sure they \nreceive the care they deserve. The creation of the Office of Rural \nVeterans Healthcare was a first step, and this legislation will move us \nfurther down the path toward improved care.\n  I want to again thank my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, \nand my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, for their efforts on \nthis bill. We have a strong group of 17 Senators from both sides of the \naisle behind this bill so far.\n  I know that each and every one of my colleagues deals with veterans' \nissues and feels a deep sense of gratitude towards the brave men and \nwomen who have fought for our freedom. I hope we can join together to \nmove this legislation through Congress and send it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1147. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, To terminate \nthe administrative freeze on the enrollment into the health care system \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs of veterans in the lowest \npriority category for enrollment (referred to as ``Priority 8''); to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Honor Our \nCommitment to Veterans Act.\n  More than four years ago, the Bush Administration cut off enrollment \nof Priority 8 veterans in the VA healthcare system. Priority 8 veterans \nare those veterans without service-connected disabilities whose income \nis above a means tested level that varies across the country. Many of \nthese so-called ``high-income veterans'' have annual incomes as low as \n$26,902.\n  When the Administration announced its intention to suspend healthcare \nenrollment for new Priority 8 veterans, they said that they were doing \nso in order to reduce the backlog and alleviate a longstanding funding \ncrisis within the VA.\n  There is no doubt that the VA has problems. Nearly five years into \nthis war, our veterans are facing lengthy waits just to get in the door \nto see a primary care physician. They are having trouble accessing \ncritical mental health services, and some are waiting up to two years \nfor benefits claims to be processed. These are real problems facing \nreal people, and they deserve real solutions.\n  But instead of cutting off enrollment to veterans of modest means \nfour years ago, the Bush Administration should have asked Congress for \nthe resources necessary to address its shortcomings and increase access \nto this high quality health care system.\n  It is absolutely unacceptable that veterans in need of care are being \nprohibited from enrolling in the system that is supposed to serve them. \nVeterans who have fought hard to secure our freedoms shouldn't have to \nfight for access to health care at home. Our veterans deserve better.\n  That is why I am introducing the Honor Our Commitment to Veterans Act \ntoday, which would permit new Priority 8 veterans to enroll in the VA \nhealthcare system.\n  According to a recent Congressional Research Service report, the VA \nestimates that if the enrollment freeze was lifted, approximately \n273,000 Priority 8 veterans would have been eligible to receive medical \ncare from VA in FY2006, and 242,000 Priority 8 veterans would be \neligible in FY2007.\n  This legislation, which has been introduced in the House by \nCongressman Steve Rothman of New Jersey, would correct the injustice \nperpetrated in 2003 by allowing all new Priority 8 veterans to enroll \nin the VA healthcare system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1149. A bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the \nPoultry Products Inspection Act to authorize the interstate \ndistribution of State-inspected meat and poultry if the Secretary of \nAgriculture determines that the State inspection requirements are at \nleast equal to Federal inspection requirements and to require the \nSecretary to reimburse State agencies for part of the costs of the \ninspections; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am today introducing with Senators Baucus \nand Conrad a bill that will eliminate the prohibition on interstate \ncommerce in State-inspected meat and poultry products. Senator Hatch is \nalso introducing a State meat inspection measure and I congratulate him \non his bill. We are working together and in collaboration with the \nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture and a \ncoalition of national, State, and local agricultural organizations on \nthis effort. I expect our coalition to grow over time. Together, we \nintend to push for changes that will protect public health and safety \nand at the same time help state-inspected meat and poultry processors \ncompete in new markets.\n  Removing the current prohibition will help level the playing field \nfor small businesses and spur additional competition in the \nmarketplace. It will help main street businesses--who often specialize \nin local, organic, grass-fed or artisinal products--meet emerging \nmarkets. And it will help livestock producers who want more options for \nmarketing their livestock.\n  For too long, processors with State-inspected facilities have been \nunfairly constrained to selling only within their home States. \nMeanwhile, foreign-processed meat can be shipped anywhere in the United \nStates so long as the originating Nation's inspection program is deemed \nequivalent to U.S. Federal standards. We want our State-inspected \nprocessors to be treated at least as well. This is an effort to give \nmain street businesses the same opportunity our Government confers on \nforeign processors.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Hatch, Baucus and Conrad and \na number of our House colleagues on this topic in the months to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 1153. A bill to require assessment of the impact on small business \nconcerns of rules relating to internal controls, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nColeman, to introduce the ``Small Business Regulatory Review Act.'' \nThis is a targeted, non-controversial measure. It would ensure that the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) fully consider the impacts of their \nfinal rules mandating how small public companies must comply with the \ninternal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n  Our Nation's small stock companies are the cornerstone of our \nentrepreneurial economy, and it is essential that we carefully address \nthe regulatory barriers that impede their growth.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was essential in restoring investor confidence \nafter accounting fraud and massive company deceptions shook the \npublic's trust in U.S. markets. The horrendous debacle of corporate \ngreed from companies like Enron and Worldcom forced not only thousands \nof employees to lose their jobs, but also wiped out the life savings of \nmany retirees. Now, as we refine Sarbanes-Oxley's regulations, we must \ncarefully preserve investor protections and ensure company transparency \nand accountability.\n  In my home State of Maine, small publicly-traded companies are \nindispensable to the strength and renewal of our economy. However, the \nfact is that many of these small stock companies are struggling \nmightily with the cost and regulatory burden imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley \ncompliance, regardless of\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\ntheir industry. Whether it's a utility company, a dairy pharmaceutical \ncompany that makes large animal vaccines, or a community bank that \nfears being smothered by the combined weight of Sarbanes-Oxley and \nbanking regulations, it is crucial that Maine's home grown companies \nfocus their energies on developing new products, entering new markets, \nand creating jobs--not on compliance.\n  This is why I rise today, with Senator Coleman, to introduce the \n``Small Business Regulatory Review Act of 2007.'' Our bill would \nrequire the SEC to conduct a small business analysis, consistent with \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), before the SEC publishes its \nfinal rules on small business internal controls compliance. This non-\ncontroversial provision simply restates existing law, ensuring that the \nSEC conducts a final RFA analysis. As the SEC should already be \nconducting this analysis as part of its final rulemaking process, this \nbill will impose no additional delay.\n  Our bill would also require the SEC to publish a small business \ncompliance guide, consistent with the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA). This compliance guide would explain, \nin plain language, the small business requirements under the rule. The \nSEC should publish this small businesses compliance guide when it \npublishes its final rule, so that small business understand the new \nrequirements. As this non-controversial provision also restates \nexisting law, this measure would impose no additional delay on the \nSEC's rulemaking process.\n  Regulations disproportionately affect small businesses and \nsignificantly hinder their competitiveness. In 2004, Senator Enzi and I \njointly requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) study \nthe effects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on small public companies' access \nto capital. The study found that the costs for complying with Sarbanes-\nOxley were nine times greater for smaller companies than for large \nstock companies. We must reduce the burden imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley so \nthat our small stocks in Maine, Minnesota, and across the country can \ncontinue to be some of the world's fastest growing and most innovative \ncompanies.\n  Finally, to address this disproportionate regulatory burden on small \nbusinesses, our bill would require that the GAO re-analyze the impact \nof these rules on small public companies two years after final rules \nare published. The GAO's report would include an assessment of the \ncosts and time commitments the SEC and PCAOB requirements impose on \nsmall businesses and whether these costs are expected to decrease or \nincrease in the future. Additionally, the final report would include \nrecommendations, and regulatory alternatives, on how to simplify or \nimprove the process of complying with SEC and PCAOB small company stock \nrequirements. This provision simply ensures that the rules do not \nimpose unintended, undue burdens on small businesses.\n  The ``Small Business Regulatory Review Act of 2007'' will help to \nensure that small stock companies do not suffer from additional \nunintended consequences which harm their ability to compete, innovate, \nand grow--and, most importantly, create jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1155. A bill to treat payments under the Conservation Reserve \nProgram as rentals from real estate; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Brownback and \nten of our colleagues in introducing the Conservation Reserve Program \nTax Fairness Act of 2007. This legislation clarifies once and for all \nthat Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) payments received by active or \nretired farmers, or other landowners for that matter will be treated \nfor Federal tax purposes as rental payments that are not subject to \nself-employment taxes.\n  Let me take a moment to describe this problem. For many years now, \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been taking the erroneous \nposition that CRP payments received by farmers are self-employment \nincome derived from a trade or business and therefore are subject to \nSelf-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) taxes. Regrettably, the IRS \nand the Treasury Department proposed a new ruling late last year that \nnot only requires active farmers to pay SECA taxes on CRP payments but \nexpands similar tax treatment to CRP payments received by retired \nfarmers and other landowners.\n  This latest ruling proposed by the IRS would impose a significant \nfinancial hardship on family farmers and others who have voluntarily \nagreed to take environmentally-sensitive lands out of farm production \nand place them in the Conservation Reserve Program in return for an \nannual rental payment from the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Today, North Dakota has some 3.4 million acres with about $112 \nmillion in rental payments in the CRP program. Left intact, the IRS's \nruling would mean that farmers in North Dakota may owe an additional \n$16 million in Federal taxes this coming year. A typical North Dakota \nfarmer with 160 acres of CRP would owe nearly $750 in new self-\nemployment taxes because of the agency's ill-advised position.\n  If the IRS decides to pursue back taxes on returns filed by farmers \nin past years, the amount of taxes owed by individual farmers for CRP \npayments could amount to thousands of dollars. That would be \ndevastating to many farmers and others who depend on CRP rental \npayments to make ends meet. As a result, the proposed change in our \nbill applies to CRP payments made in open tax years before, on, or \nafter the date of its enactment.\n  We believe the IRS's position on the tax treatment of CRP payments is \ndead wrong. In our judgment, forcing CRP recipients to pay self-\nemployment taxes on CRP payments is not what Congress intended, nor is \nit supportable in law. The U.S. Tax Court, the Federal court with the \nmost expertise on tax issues, shares our view that the IRS position is \nimproper. In fact, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in the late 1990's that CRP \npayments are properly treated by farmers as rental payments and, thus, \nnot subject to self-employment taxes. Unfortunately, the IRS challenged \nthe Tax Court decision and the Tax Court was later reversed by a \nFederal appellate court.\n  In February, IRS Commissioner Mark Everson sent a letter to me and a \nnumber of our colleagues who are concerned about this issue. In his \nletter, Commissioner Everson made clear that the IRS would not change \nits position that CRP payments are subject to self-employment tax as \nincome derived from a trade or business--absent new statutory language \npassed by the Congress and enacted into law.\n  With the legislation we are introducing today, Congress will send a \nclear message to the IRS that its misguided effort to subject CRP \npayments to self-employment taxes is inappropriate and will not be \nallowed to stand. Our bill also makes sure that Federal trust funds \nthat would have received SECA revenues but for the enactment of our \nbill are held harmless through the use of revenue transfers from the \nTreasury general fund.\n  Senator Brownback and I ask our colleagues to support this much-\nneeded tax relief for family farmers and other CRP recipients by \ncosponsoring the Conservation Reserve Program Tax Fairness Act. And we \nhope you will work with us to get this legislation enacted into law \nwithout delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1156. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nreauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children program; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Amendments of 2007, which is a bill to \nreauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act--BPCA. If \nCongress doesn't act, this successful program will expire on October I, \n2007. I thank my colleagues Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Bingaman, Murray, \nClinton and Brown who are joining me as original cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation.\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n  I am pleased that Senators Kennedy and Enzi, the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Health Education Labor, and \nPensions--HELP--Committee, have included this bill in the chairman's \nmark for S. 1082, which is expected to be voted on today in the HELP \nCommittee.\n  I would also like to recognize the contributions and leadership of \nformer Senator Mike De Wine, a friend and colleague, who always fought \nto ensure children would not be treated as second-class citizens when \nit came to drug and device development. He was a champion of BPCA along \nwith me even when it wasn't popular to hold that view.\n  The story of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act is one of huge \nsuccess for children and their families. Children with a wide range of \ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, allergies, asthma, neurological and \npsychiatric disorders, and obesity can now lead healthier, more \nproductive lives as a result of new information about the safety and \nefficacy of drugs they use to treat and manage their diseases where \npreviously there was none.\n  Children are not simply little adults and results of the drug studies \nconducted under the BPCA have shown us that they should not be treated \nas such. Pediatric drug studies conducted. under the BPCA showed that \nchildren may have been exposed to ineffective drugs, ineffective \ndosing, overdosing, or side effects that were previously unknown.\n  Since the BPCA's passage in 1997 and its reauthorization in 2002, FDA \nhas requested nearly 800 studies involving more than 45,000 children in \nclinical trials. Useful new pediatric information is now part of \nproduct labeling for 119 drugs. By comparison, in the 7 years prior to \nthe BPCA's passage, only 11 studies of marketed drugs were completed. \nIn the past 10 years, there has been a twentyfold increase in the \nnumber of drugs studied in infants, children, and adolescents since \nBPCA was enacted.\n  Labeling changes resulting from clinical studies under the BPCA have \ninformed physicians of the proper dosing in the examples of Viracept, a \nprotease inhibitor used in a combination therapy for the treatment of \nHIV, and Neurontin, a pain relief medication used to treat children \nwith chronic pain. For children with epilepsy, the BPCA studies \ninformed physicians that the drugs Keppra and Trileptal could be used \nsafely and effectively at an even earlier age than previously known. \nStudies of Imitrex as a result of the BPCA showed no better results \nthan placebo for the treatment of migraine headaches in adolescents. \nThese same studies also showed serious adverse events due to Imitrex in \npediatric populations and therefore the drug is not recommended to \ntreat migraines in anyone less than 18 years of age.\n  Recent studies of the BPCA by the Government Accountability Office--\nGAO--and by several authors from Duke University in an article which \nappeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association--JAMA--have \ndemonstrated that the program is a success and have identified \nopportunities to strengthen the program. Authors of the recent JAMA \narticle found that outside of the BPCA, the FDA is limited in the \nnumber and scope of studies for which it can require pediatric data for \nexisting products on the market.\n  Data from this article showed that only a minority of drugs studied \nunder the BPC, about 20 percent, had more than $1 billion in annual \nsales. In fact, the median drug granted exclusivity was a small-market \ndrug with annual sales of $180 million and 30 percent of drugs studied \nhad sales less than $200 million. This article went on to say that a \nuniversal reduction in the length of pediatric exclusivity from 6 to 3 \nmonths would mean that products with small profit margins may not be \nsubmitted for pediatric testing.\n  The BPCA has always tried to strike the right balance between cost to \nconsumers and benefits to children. I believe there is an ongoing need \nto evaluate the cost of the incentive as it relates to reaching the \ngoal of having medications properly studied and labeled for children. \nIn fact, that is why I strongly support a 5-year sunset of the BPCA.\n  After 10 years, experience and data has shown us that for a small \nnumber of drugs, pediatric exclusivity has far exceeded the ``carrot'' \nit was intended to provide for manufacturers. As the authors of the \nrecent JAMA article noted, ``our study shows that the Pediatric \nExclusivity Program overcompensates blockbuster products for performing \nclinical trials in children, while other products have more modest \nreturns on investment under this program.''\n  The bill I am introducing today contains a reasonable, workable \nproposal to address cost concerns without jeopardizing the \nextraordinary success of BPCA. I have worked closely with the chairman \nand ranking member of the HELP Committee to craft this proposal into \nthe form it appears in this legislation and in the bipartisan \nchairman's mark which is expected to be voted on in the HELP Committee \ntoday.\n  On March 27, the HELP Committee held a hearing, which I chaired, \nentitled ``Ensuring Safe Medicines and Medical Devices for Children.'' \nWe learned from pediatricians and a parent of five children, four of \nwhom are HIV-positive, Mrs. Susan Belfiore, about the tremendous impact \nBPCA has had on the quality of life for countless numbers of children \nand their families. We received testimony with many suggestions for \nimprovements to BPCA which I believe are reflected in this bill. I \nwould also add that in the month since I circulated this bill as a \ndraft, I received comments from several pharmaceutical companies. Some \nhave been strongly supportive of this effort and many of their ideas \nand suggestions are incorporated in this bill.\n  The success of the BPCA has transformed the drug development process \nfor children. It is my hope that we will achieve similar success with \nanother piece of legislation I recently introduced called the Pediatric \nMedical Device Safety and Improvement Act. It is also contained within \nthe chairman's mark to S. 1082 and I thank Chairman Kennedy and Ranking \nMember Enzi for working with me to ensure that medical devices used in \nchildren are safe and are designed specifically for their use.\n  The BPCA has had a long history of bipartisan support and it has been \nmy longstanding hope that this initiative will continue to be \nbipartisan as the chairman's mark to S. 1082 moves to the Senate floor. \nThe safety of our Nation's children is not a partisan issue.\n  As the parent of two young children, I know that it is essential that \nproducts used in children's growing bodies, whether they be drugs or \ndevices, are appropriately tested and designed specifically for their \nuse. We must continue the tremendous success of BPCA and its \ncomplementary program, the Pediatric Research Improvement Act, of which \nI am an original cosponsor, by strengthening both programs through the \nreauthorization process this year. It is essential that we use the past \nexperience of both programs to ensure they will continue to thrive in \nthe future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 155\n\n       Whereas warring parties in Guatemala ended a 36-year \n     internal armed conflict with a peace agreement in 1996, but \n     the country has since faced alarming levels of violence, \n     organized crime, and corruption;\n       Whereas the alleged involvement of senior officials of the \n     National Civilian Police in the murder of three Salvadoran \n     parliamentarians and their driver, and the subsequent killing \n     of four of the police officers while in custody underscored \n     the need to purge and strengthen law enforcement and judicial \n     institutions in Guatemala;\n       Whereas high-level officials of the Government of Guatemala \n     have acknowledged the infiltration of organized criminal \n     networks into the state apparatus and the difficulty of \n     combating these networks when they are deeply entrenched in \n     public institutions;\n       Whereas, in its 2006 Country Report on Human Rights \n     Practices in Guatemala, the Department of State noted that \n     police corruption was a serious problem in Guatemala and that \n     there were credible allegations of involvement by individual \n     police officers in criminal activity, including rapes, \n     killings, and kidnappings;\n       Whereas, in its most recent report on Guatemala, the United \n     Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights notes that \n     impunity continues to undermine the credibility of the \n     justice system in Guatemala and that the justice system is \n     still too weak to confront organized crime and its powerful \n     structures; and\n       Whereas, the Government of Guatemala and the United Nations \n     signed an agreement on December 12, 2006, to establish the \n     International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala \n     (Comision Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala--\n     CICIG), to assist local authorities in investigating and \n     dismantling the illegal security groups and clandestine \n     organizations that continue to operate in Guatemala: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the International \n     Commission against Impunity in Guatemala is an innovative \n     mechanism to support local efforts to confront the entrenched \n     and dangerous problem posed by illegal armed groups and \n     clandestine security organizations in Guatemala and their \n     infiltration into state institutions;\n       (2) the Senate commends the Government of Guatemala, local \n     civil society organizations, and the United Nations for such \n     a creative effort;\n       (3) the Senate encourages the Guatemalan Congress to enact \n     necessary legislation required to implement the International \n     Commission against Impunity in Guatemala and other pending \n     legislation needed to fulfill the 1996 peace agreement;\n       (4) the Senate calls on the Government of Guatemala and all \n     sectors of society in Guatemala to unreservedly support the \n     investigation and prosecution of illegal armed groups and \n     clandestine security organizations; and\n       (5) the Senate reiterates its commitment to support the \n     Government of Guatemala in its efforts to strengthen the rule \n     of law in that country, including the dismantling of the \n     clandestine groups, the purging of the police and judicial \n     institutions, and the implementation of key justice and \n     police reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4699-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4699-S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 156--COMMENDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE RUTGERS \n  UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM AND APPLAUDING THE CHARACTER AND \n              INTEGRITY OF THE PLAYERS AS STUDENT-ATHLETES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Obama) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 158\n\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day is an annual \n     public awareness and education campaign that highlights the \n     valuable contributions that young people make to their \n     communities;\n       Whereas the goals of National and Global Youth Service Day \n     are to--\n       (1) mobilize the youth of the United States to identify and \n     address the needs of their communities through service and \n     service-learning;\n       (2) support young people in embarking on a lifelong path of \n     service and civic engagement; and\n       (3) educate the public, the media, and policymakers about \n     contributions made by young people as community leaders \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day, a program of \n     Youth Service America, is the largest service event in the \n     world and is being observed for the 19th consecutive year in \n     2007;\n       Whereas young people in the United States and in many other \n     countries are volunteering more than in any other generation \n     in history;\n       Whereas children and youth not only represent the future of \n     the world, but also are leaders and assets today;\n       Whereas children and youth should be valued for the \n     idealism, energy, creativity, and unique perspectives that \n     they use when addressing real-world issues such as poverty, \n     hunger, illiteracy, education, gang activity, natural \n     disasters, climate change, and myriad other issues;\n       Whereas a fundamental and conclusive correlation exists \n     between youth service and lifelong adult volunteering and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas, through community service, young people of all \n     ages and backgrounds build character and learn valuable \n     skills sought by employers, including time management, \n     decisionmaking, teamwork, needs-assessment, and leadership;\n       Whereas service-learning is a teaching and learning \n     strategy that integrates meaningful community service with \n     academic curriculum;\n       Whereas service-learning supports young people in mastering \n     important curriculum content by helping them make meaningful \n     connections between what they are studying and the challenges \n     that they see in their own communities;\n       Whereas high quality service-learning has been found to \n     increase student academic engagement, academic achievement \n     scores, civic engagement, character development, and career \n     aspirations;\n       Whereas a report by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent \n     of high school dropouts reported boredom as a primary reason \n     for dropping out;\n       Whereas service-learning has been found to increase \n     students' cognitive engagement, motivation to learn, and \n     school attendance;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support service-learning as a means to develop \n     the leadership and workforce skills necessary for the \n     competitiveness of the United States in the 21st century;\n       Whereas a report by America's Promise found that 94 percent \n     of young people want to be involved in making the world a \n     better place, but 50 percent say there should be more \n     volunteer programs for people their age;\n       Whereas the same report found that one-third of young \n     people say they lack adult role models who volunteer and help \n     others;\n       Whereas a sustained investment by the Federal Government, \n     business partners, schools, and communities could fuel the \n     positive, long-term cultural change that will make service \n     and service-learning a common expectation and a common \n     experience for all young people;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day engages \n     millions of young people worldwide with the support of 51 \n     lead agencies, 40 international organizations, and 110 \n     national partners;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day inspired Global Youth \n     Service Day, which occurs concurrently in more than 100 \n     countries and is now in its 8th year;\n       Whereas a growing number of Global Youth Service Day \n     projects involve youth working collaboratively across \n     national and geographic boundaries, increasing intercultural \n     understanding and promoting the sense that they are global \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas both young people and their communities will \n     benefit greatly from expanded opportunities to engage youth \n     in meaningful volunteer service and service-learning: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S4701]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions \n     of the youth of the United States and encourages the \n     cultivation of a common civic bond between young people \n     dedicated to serving their neighbors, their communities, and \n     the Nation;\n       (2) designates April 20, 2007, as ``National and Global \n     Youth Service Day'';

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Recidivism Reduction \n     and Second Chance Act of 2007'' or the ``Second Chance Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2002, over 7,000,000 people were incarcerated in \n     Federal or State prisons or in local jails. Nearly 650,000 \n     people are released from Federal and State incarceration into \n     communities nationwide each year.\n       (2) There are over 3,200 jails throughout the United \n     States, the vast majority of which are operated by county \n     governments. Each year, these jails will release more than \n     10,000,000 people back into the community.\n       (3) Recent studies indicate that over \\2/3\\ of released \n     State prisoners are expected to be rearrested for a felony or \n     serious misdemeanor within 3 years after release.\n       (4) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \n     expenditures on corrections alone increased from \n     $9,000,000,000 in 1982, to $59,600,000,000 in 2002. These \n     figures do not include the cost of arrest and prosecution, \n     nor do they take into account the cost to victims.\n       (5) The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative \n     provided $139,000,000 in funding for State governments to \n     develop and implement education, job training, mental health \n     treatment, and substance abuse treatment for serious and \n     violent offenders. This Act seeks to build upon the \n     innovative and successful State reentry programs developed \n     under the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative, \n     which terminated after fiscal year 2005.\n       (6) Between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a \n     parent in a Federal or State correctional facility increased \n     by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to \n     approximately 2,000,000. According to the Bureau of Prisons, \n     there is evidence to suggest that inmates who are connected \n     to their children and families are more likely to avoid \n     negative incidents and have reduced sentences.\n       (7) Released prisoners cite family support as the most \n     important factor in helping them stay out of prison. Research \n     suggests that families are an often underutilized resource in \n     the reentry process.\n       (8) Approximately 100,000 juveniles (ages 17 years and \n     under) leave juvenile correctional facilities, State prison, \n     or Federal prison each year. Juveniles released from secure \n     confinement still have their likely prime crime years ahead \n     of them. Juveniles released from secure confinement have a \n     recidivism rate ranging from 55 to 75 percent. The chances \n     that young people will successfully transition into society \n     improve with effective reentry and aftercare programs.\n       (9) Studies have shown that between 15 percent and 27 \n     percent of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon \n     release from prison.\n       (10) Fifty-seven percent of Federal and 70 percent of State \n     inmates used drugs regularly before going to prison, and the \n     Bureau of Justice Statistics report titled ``Trends in State \n     Parole, 1990-2000'' estimates the use of drugs or alcohol \n     around the time of the offense that resulted in the \n     incarceration of the inmate at as high as 84 percent.\n       (11) Family-based treatment programs have proven results \n     for serving the special populations of female offenders and \n     substance abusers with children. An evaluation by the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of \n     family-based treatment for substance-abusing mothers and \n     children found that 6 months after such treatment, 60 percent \n     of the mothers remained alcohol and drug free, and drug-\n     related offenses declined from 28 percent to 7 percent. \n     Additionally, a 2003 evaluation of residential family-based \n     treatment programs revealed that 60 percent of mothers \n     remained clean and sober 6 months after treatment, criminal \n     arrests declined by 43 percent, and 88 percent of the \n     children treated in the program with their mothers remained \n     stabilized.\n       (12) A Bureau of Justice Statistics analysis indicated that \n     only 33 percent of Federal inmates and 36 percent of State \n     inmates had participated in residential in-patient treatment \n     programs for alcohol and drug abuse 12 months before their \n     release. Further, over \\1/3\\ of all jail inmates have some \n     physical or mental disability and 25 percent of jail inmates \n     have been treated at some time for a mental or emotional \n     problem.\n       (13) State Substance Abuse Agency Directors, also known as \n     Single State Authorities (in this paragraph referred to as \n     ``SSAs''), manage the publicly funded substance abuse \n     prevention and treatment system of the Nation. SSAs are \n     responsible for planning and implementing State-wide systems \n     of care that provide clinically appropriate substance abuse \n     services. Given the high rate of substance use disorders \n     among offenders reentering our communities, successful \n     reentry programs require close interaction and collaboration \n     with each SSA as the program is planned, implemented and \n     evaluated.\n       (14) According to the National Institute of Literacy, 70 \n     percent of all prisoners function at the lowest literacy \n     levels.\n       (15) Less than 32 percent of State prison inmates have a \n     high school diploma or a higher level of education, compared \n     to 82 percent of the general population.\n       (16) Approximately 38 percent of inmates who completed 11 \n     years or less of school were not working before entry into \n     prison.\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\n       (17) The percentage of State prisoners participating in \n     educational programs decreased by more than 8 percent between \n     1991 and 1997, despite growing evidence of how educational \n     programming while incarcerated reduces recidivism.\n       (18) The National Institute of Justice has found that 1 \n     year after release, up to 60 percent of former inmates are \n     not employed.\n       (19) Transitional jobs programs have proven to help people \n     with criminal records to successfully return to the workplace \n     and to the community, and therefore can reduce recidivism.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 158, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 158) designating April 20, 2007, as \n     ``National and Global Youth Service Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I commend to my colleagues this \nresolution designating April 20, 2007, as National and Global Youth \nService Day. This resolution recognizes and commends the significant \ncommunity service efforts that youth are making in communities across \nthe country and around the world on April 20 and every day. This \nresolution also encourages the citizens of the United States to \nacknowledge and support these volunteer efforts.\n  Over the weekend, beginning this Friday, April 20, youth from across \nthe United States and the world will carry out community service \nprojects in areas ranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. \nThrough this service, many will embark on a lifelong path of service \nand civic engagement in more than 100 countries around the world.\n  This event is not isolated to one weekend a year. National and Global \nYouth Service Day is an annual public awareness and education campaign \nthat highlights the valuable contributions that young people make to \ntheir communities throughout the year.\n  The participation of youth in community service is not just a nice \nidea for a way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Youth who are engaged in \nvolunteer service, according to recent studies, do better in school \nthan their classmates who do not volunteer. Youth who engage in \nvolunteering and other positive activities are also more likely to \navoid risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use, crime, and \npromiscuity.\n  A recently released study conducted by the Corporation for National \nand Community Service points out some interesting findings about the \nattitudes and behaviors of youth toward volunteering and other forms of \ncivic engagement.\n  The study found that: 74 percent of youth who volunteer do so at \nleast in part through a religious organization, a schoolbased group, or \na youth leadership organization such as Scouts or 4H. A youth from a \nfamily where at least one parent volunteers is almost twice as likely \nto volunteer as a youth with no family members who volunteer, and \nnearly three times as likely to volunteer on a regular basis. Youth \nfrom disadvantaged circumstances who volunteer demonstrate more \npositive civic attitudes and behaviors than similar youth who do not \nvolunteer.\n  In an effort to recognize and support youth volunteers in my State, I \nwould like to recognize some of the activities that will occur this \nyear in Alaska in observance of National and Global Youth Service Day:\n  No. 1, Anchorage's Promise, which works to mobilize all sectors of \nthe community to build the character and competence of Anchorage's \nchildren and youth is again sponsoring the annual Kids' Day event in \nAnchorage this year. Seventy different nonprofits and businesses will \nprovide free kid-friendly activities to help families build an \nunderstanding of the importance of safe places for kids, providing a \nhealthy start and future, the value of having a caring adult in the \nlife of each youth, and why effective education can ensure that all \nyouth have the skills needed to pursue college, vocational training and \nthe field of work that they are interested in.\n  No. 2, Eielson Youth Programs will sponsor a Knit-a-Thon to benefit \nthe women's shelter and the senior center. Volunteers will help \ninstruct preteen and teenage knitters and will also knit projects. All \nparticipants are also asked to bring personal hygiene items to be \ndonated to the shelter/center as part of the project.\n  No. 3, Aurora Elementary School on Elmendorf Air Force Base will be \nsponsoring a canned food drive in conjunction with a school dance. The \nprice of admission to the dance is one can of food.\n  No. 4, Alaska Winter Stars, members of the cross-country ski teams \nfrom both Alaska Pacific University and University of Anchorage Alaska, \nwill be hosting a fitness challenge and pledge booth at Kids Day this \nyear. The goal is to bring awareness to the importance of good health \nand physical activity. Participants will be given the opportunity to \ntest their fitness level and sign a pledge promising to be more active. \nMore than 5,000 youth are expected to participate.\n  No. 5, on April 8, annual Prudential Alaska Spirit of Community \nStudent Volunteer Service Recognition Ceremony will honor more than 150 \nAlaskan students for making a difference through outstanding volunteer \nservice on National Youth Service Day. This ceremony highlights the \noutstanding partnerships between Alaskan nonprofit organizations and \nthe business community. The ceremony is conducted in partnership with \nthe Points of Light Foundation, President's Council on Service and \nCivic Participation, USA Freedom Corps, Prudential Financial, \nCorporation for National Service, the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals, Prudential Jack White Vista Real Estate, Key Bank of \nAlaska, Anchorage Daily News, Wells Fargo Bank, Anchorage Municipal \nLight and Power, Home State Mortgage, Alyeska Title Guaranty Agency, \nJewel Lake Tastee Freez, Friends of Alaska Prudential Youth Leadership \nInstitute, and other caring community organizations and individuals.\n  No. 6, teens in the Alaska Youth for Environmental Action program of \nthe National Wildlife Federation will be urging individuals to take the \n``3-2-1 Pledge--change three incandescent lightbulbs to compact \nfluorescents, turn the thermostat down 2 degrees in cold weather, and \nunplug one appliance when not in use. The ``3-2-1 Pledge'' project has \na goal to collect 5,000 signatures by April 2007. The goal will reduce \ncarbon emissions in Alaska by an estimated 19.8 million pounds \nannually. Alaska Youth for Environmental Action is working in six \ncommunities: Sitka, Yakutat, Homer, Juneau, Anchorage and Fairbanks.\n  No. 7, Nerf Balls for Soldiers of Foreign Turf--students across \nAnchorage are invited to help build positive relations between our \nsoldiers and the children they come in contact with in Iraq. Youth are \nencouraged to bring or purchase a new Nerf toy to the Egan Center \nduring Kids Day. Funds will be used to raise money for more shipping, \nand the Nerf Balls will be shipped to Iraq for soldiers to use for \nrelationship building.\n  No. 8, Pen Pal Cards For Kids--Clark Middle School students will help \nAnchorage's Promise Kids Day participants make cards and letters for \nchildren that can be used to encourage those who are over seas or in \nlocal hospitals.\n  No. 9, Boy Scouts--Scouting for Food Project--Boy Scouts of Troop 205 \nin Anchorage will be collecting canned food at Kids Day events for \ndonation to the Alaska Food Bank.\n  No, 10, students from the West High School Junior ROTC and King \nCareer Center Public Safety and Security Assistants programs will be on \nhand for Kids Day to help monitor exit doors, assist with handing out \ndoor prize tickets, and monitor elevators for safety. Students will \nalso have the opportunity to mentor with adults in a variety of \nsettings such as first aid, search and rescue, fire fighters, and Egan \nCenter security.\n  No. 11, Cook Inlet Tribal Youth Council will share Alaska Native \nheritage by demonstrating Native games and by encouraging healthy \nactive lifestyles at three locations in Anchorage on April 20.\n  No. 12, Summer Reading Program Work Party involves teen volunteers \nfrom the Anchorage Municipal Libraries in stuffing 4,000 bags with \nmaterials for the summer reading program. This program will help \nmaintain student progress in reading by keeping kids reading all summer \nlong.\n  No. 13, the Girl Scouts Susitna Council will be planting 95 tree \nseedlings in honor of Girl Scouts of the USA's 95th anniversary. The \nseedlings will be planted at the Bureau of Land Management's Campbell \nCreek Science Center in June. Every tree planted produces oxygen, \nremoves air pollution, and fights soil erosion. In addition, the act of \nplanting tree seedlings will instill a sense of stewardship among Girl \nScouts that will be passed on to future generations. Future of Life, an \norganization whose mission is to ensure the future\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\nof life on Earth for all species, is providing 95 tree seedlings to \neach Girl Scout council across the United States, beginning in April \nand scheduled to coincide with the planting season for each area.\n  Many similar and wonderful activities will be taking place all across \nthe Nation. I encourage all of my colleagues to visit the Youth Service \nAmerica website--www.vsa.org--to find out about the selfless and \ncreative youth who are contributing in their own States this year.\n  I thank my colleagues--Senators Akaka, Alexander, Baucus, Bayh, \nBoxer, Brown, Burr, Cantwell, Casey, Clinton, Cochran, Coleman, \nCollins, Corker, Craig, Dodd, Dole, Domenici, Durbin, Feingold, \nFeinstein, Gregg, Hagel, Kennedy, Kerry, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Levin, \nLieberman, Lincoln, Lott, Martinez, Menendez, Mikulski, Murray, Ben \nNelson, Bill Nelson, Obama, Salazar, Sanders, Specter, Stabenow, and \nStevens--for standing with me as original cosponsors of this worthwhile \nlegislation, which will ensure that youth across the country and the \nworld know that all of their hard work is greatly appreciated.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 158) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 158\n\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day is an annual \n     public awareness and education campaign that highlights the \n     valuable contributions that young people make to their \n     communities;\n       Whereas the goals of National and Global Youth Service Day \n     are to--\n       (1) mobilize the youth of the United States to identify and \n     address the needs of their communities through service and \n     service-learning;\n       (2) support young people in embarking on a lifelong path of \n     service and civic engagement; and\n       (3) educate the public, the media, and policymakers about \n     contributions made by young people as community leaders \n     throughout the year;\n\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day, a program of \n     Youth Service America, is the largest service event in the \n     world and is being observed for the 19th consecutive year in \n     2007;\n       Whereas young people in the United States and in many other \n     countries are volunteering more than in any other generation \n     in history;\n       Whereas children and youth not only represent the future of \n     the world, but also are leaders and assets today;\n       Whereas children and youth should be valued for the \n     idealism, energy, creativity, and unique perspectives that \n     they use when addressing real-world issues such as poverty, \n     hunger, illiteracy, education, gang activity, natural \n     disasters, climate change, and myriad other issues;\n       Whereas a fundamental and conclusive correlation exists \n     between youth service and lifelong adult volunteering and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas, through community service, young people of all \n     ages and backgrounds build character and learn valuable \n     skills sought by employers, including time management, \n     decisionmaking, teamwork, needs-assessment, and leadership;\n       Whereas service-learning is a teaching and learning \n     strategy that integrates meaningful community service with \n     academic curriculum;\n       Whereas service-learning supports young people in mastering \n     important curriculum content by helping them make meaningful \n     connections between what they are studying and the challenges \n     that they see in their own communities;\n       Whereas high quality service-learning has been found to \n     increase student academic engagement, academic achievement \n     scores, civic engagement, character development, and career \n     aspirations;\n       Whereas a report by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent \n     of high school dropouts reported boredom as a primary reason \n     for dropping out;\n       Whereas service-learning has been found to increase \n     students' cognitive engagement, motivation to learn, and \n     school attendance;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support service-learning as a means to develop \n     the leadership and workforce skills necessary for the \n     competitiveness of the United States in the 21st century;\n       Whereas a report by America's Promise found that 94 percent \n     of young people want to be involved in making the world a \n     better place, but 50 percent say there should be more \n     volunteer programs for people their age;\n       Whereas the same report found that one-third of young \n     people say they lack adult role models who volunteer and help \n     others;\n       Whereas a sustained investment by the Federal Government, \n     business partners, schools, and communities could fuel the \n     positive, long-term cultural change that will make service \n     and service-learning a common expectation and a common \n     experience for all young people;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day engages \n     millions of young people worldwide with the support of 51 \n     lead agencies, 40 international organizations, and 110 \n     national partners;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day inspired Global Youth \n     Service Day, which occurs concurrently in more than 100 \n     countries and is now in its 8th year;\n       Whereas a growing number of Global Youth Service Day \n     projects involve youth working collaboratively across \n     national and geographic boundaries, increasing intercultural \n     understanding and promoting the sense that they are global \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas both young people and their communities will \n     benefit greatly from expanded opportunities to engage youth \n     in meaningful volunteer service and service-learning: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions \n     of the youth of the United States and encourages the \n     cultivation of a common civic bond between young people \n     dedicated to serving their neighbors, their communities, and \n     the Nation;\n       (2) designates April 20, 2007, as ``National and Global \n     Youth Service Day''; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe the day by encouraging youth to participate in \n     civic and community service projects and by joining them in \n     such projects;\n       (B) recognize the volunteer efforts of the young people of \n     the United States throughout the year; and\n       (C) support the volunteer efforts of young people and \n     engage them in meaningful learning and decisionmaking \n     opportunities today as an investment in the future of the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/18/senate-section/article/S4719-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4719-S4720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING THE ASSOCIATION FOR ADVANCED LIFE UNDERWRITING ON ITS 50TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 161 which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 161) honoring the life of Oliver \n     White Hill, a pioneer in the field of American civil rights \n     law, on the occasion of his 100th birthday.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Virginia, Senator \nWebb, in recognition of the 100th birthday of an exceptional American, \nOliver White Hill. I am proud to say that this champion of civil rights \nis a fellow Virginian whom I have come to know personally over these \nmany years. It is my privilege today to join Senator Webb in honor of \nthis great man.\n  After earning his law degree from Howard University School of Law \nwhere, I might add, he finished as the salutatorian to none other than \nfuture Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall--Oliver White Hill began \nhis law practice in Roanoke, VA, moving soon thereafter to Richmond to \nserve the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \nor NAACP, as the leader of its legal team in our Commonwealth. In his \nwork with the NAACP from 1940 to 1961, Mr. Hill contributed \ntremendously to the progression of civil rights in our country, \nparticularly in his role as a principal attorney on the landmark case \nof Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.\n  Working diligently for the NAACP, Mr. Hill was legal counsel for many \nhistoric cases regarding equal opportunity in education, employment, \nhousing, transportation, and justice.\n  As a person who has spent many years in public service, I have a \nspecial appreciation for the dignity with which Mr. Hill answered the \ncall to duty throughout his career, first as a veteran of World War II, \nas the first African American elected to the Richmond City Council \nsince the Reconstruction era, and later as a Federal appointee to the \nFederal Housing Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  It is my honor today to stand before the Senate in appreciation for \nthe efforts of Mr. Hill on behalf of his country and his Commonwealth. \nCertainly, the legacy of his strong career in support of equal rights \nwill continue to be felt through the determination of the many \nAmericans mentored or inspired by Oliver White Hill, and I join with \nSenator Webb in gratitude for his dedication and longevity.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues a Senate \nresolution that I have cosponsored with my esteemed colleague, the \nsenior senator from Virginia.\n  As my home State celebrates its 400th anniversary, this resolution \nrecognizes one of Virginia's most esteemed citizens, as he is preparing \nto celebrate an important milestone of his own. Oliver White Hill, a \npioneer in the field of American Civil Rights law, will soon celebrate \nhis 100th birthday at a gathering of hundreds of his friends, family \nand other admirers in Richmond, VA. I am honored to be counted among \nthe list of guests, and it is with immense pride and an even greater \nsense of humility that I filed this resolution honoring the life and \nwork of Mr. Hill.\n  Oliver Hill was born on May 1, 1907 in Richmond, and his family later \nmoved to Roanoke, VA, and then Washington, DC, where he graduated from \nDunbar High School. After leaving Dunbar, Mr. Hill enrolled at Howard \nUniversity, earning both an undergraduate and law degree from that fine \ninstitution. As a testament to his brilliance, he graduated second in \nhis class, a group whose valedictorian was none other than legal giant \nand future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n  Although much of America was racially segregated, Mr. Hill \nnonetheless became a member of the Virginia Bar in 1934, and began his \nlaw practice in Roanoke. He later moved to Richmond and began a \nremarkable tenure leading the Virginia legal team of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People from 1940 to 1961. \nOften forgoing lucrative legal work in pursuit of equal rights under \nthe law for African Americans, Mr. Hill worked as one the principal \nattorneys on the historic Brown vs. Board of Education case in 1954. \nHis dedication to this nation was further demonstrated when, in the \nmidst of World War II, Mr. Hill interrupted his private law practice to \nserve in the Armed Forces from 1943 to 1945.\n  Mr. Hill was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to a committee to \nstudy racism in the United States. In 1948, Mr. Hill made history as \nthe first African-American elected to Richmond's City Council since the \ndays of Reconstruction. His public service career also included stints \nat the Federal Housing Administration and at the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development during that agency's early days.\n  Over the years, Mr. Hill acted as legal counsel in numerous landmark \ncivil rights cases. His work encompasses equal opportunity in \neducation,\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\nemployment, housing, transportation, and the justice system. Mr. Hill's \nage has not deterred him from continuing to actively engage in civic \nactivities throughout the United States and the world. He has been \nreceived countless awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom \nfrom President William Jefferson Clinton in 1999, the prestigious \nSpingarn Medal from the NAACP in 2005, the dedication of a building in \nhis honor on the grounds of the Virginia State Capitol in 2005 and \nprofessional accolades too numerous to count. Oliver Hill is living \nhistory, and an American of the finest order.\n  Generations of attorneys, activists and public servants, including \nmyself, have been inspired and mentored by Oliver Hill. In recognition \nof his outstanding service to our country advancing the cause of \nfreedom for all Americans, I am proud to have submitted this resolution \nin his honor on the occasion of his 100th birthday.\n  Mr. SALAZAR.
