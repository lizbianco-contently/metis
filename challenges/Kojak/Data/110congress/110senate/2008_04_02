BARBERO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the U.S. Army will soon say farewell to one \nof its most honorable officers, COL Michael P. Barbero. The colonel \nwill retire after 26 years of service to the Army and to the Nation. \nFor the last 5 years, I have come to know him as Chief of the Army's \nSenate Liaison Office.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Barbero has always put the well-being \nof our soldiers and our country first. Of primary concern to him and \nhis team at the Liaison Office has been helping soldiers, Guard and \nReserve, navigate the bureaucracy to solve the problems that can be \ncommon to a soldier's life.\n  Sometimes this has meant guiding them through the bureaucracy to \naccess Government benefits for their families. Sometimes it has meant \ndealing with a family emergency during deployment. Sometimes it has \nmeant helping whistleblowers who report fraud or abuse that needs \nfurther investigation.\n  No matter what the challenge, Colonel Barbero always treated our \ncitizen soldiers who seek help from Congress with care, fairness, and \nthe respect they deserve.\n  As Senate minority and majority leader, I had the privilege to ask \nthe Army to support my foreign travel. For the last several years, \nColonel Barbero was a central part of these efforts. He handled high-\nprofile and sensitive congressional delegation visits that I led to \nIsrael, Jordan, Iraq, Georgia, Ukraine, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, \nParaguay, Colombia, Mexico, and Guatemala. These missions were \nsuccessful because of the careful planning of Colonel Barbero and his \nexcellent team.\n  On these long trips, I also came to know Mike Barbero as a person, \nnot as a soldier. He is a gourmet chef. He remembers birthdays and \nmakes sure there is a cake--even when it means the cake is packed on \ndry ice and stored for 6 days on an airplane.\n  I also learned he is a loving father and husband. In sacrifice for \nhis service to our country, his wife Vicki and his daughter Mary and \nson Michael have not seen as much of him as probably they wanted.\n  Our loss with his retirement will be his family's gain, and, \nhopefully, they will soon get their father back for all the ball games \nand school events that his duties here have required him to miss.\n  We in the Senate honor the service and contributions of COL Michael \nBarbero.\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\n  Always thinking of his soldiers and the interests of the Army and the \nNation he loves, Colonel Barbero is an example for generations of \nofficers to come.\n  So on behalf of all my colleagues who know this good man, I thank him \nfor his outstanding service and wish him well in the next chapter of \nhis life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2314-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Tribute to Colonel Michael P. Barbero\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I add my commendation to the leaders' \ncommendation of COL Michael Barbero.\n  Colonel Barbero is an extraordinary soldier, a family man, someone \nwho has dedicated his whole life to the service of this Nation in the \nuniform of the U.S. Army. He has done it with distinction. He has done \nit with fidelity to the basic ideals of this country. He has \ndemonstrated not only great competence but extraordinary character in \ndoing that.\n  Mike graduated from West Point in 1982. I was teaching his class. \nFortunately for Mike, he avoided my class and therefore prospered as a \nsoldier and as a scholar. He later himself went on to the Georgia \nInstitute of Technology to receive a master's degree. He returned to \nWest Point and taught as a professor in the Department of Systems \nEngineering.\n  His military career began as an armor officer. He qualified as a U.S. \nArmy Ranger. He served in a succession of demanding responsibilities as \nan armor officer, a troop commander, a battalion staff officer, with \nserious contributions as an armor officer in the U.S. Army.\n  His career represents a continued commitment to excellence as a \nprofessional and someone who has maintained the highest standards of a \nmilitary officer.\n  I first got to know Mike when he assisted me on several trips \noverseas. Not only was he extraordinarily competent and well organized, \nhe was a decent, cheerful, innovative, and enthusiastic colleague on \nthese trips. He made them all work. They were in very difficult \ncircumstances in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in every moment--sometimes \nin duress, sometimes in great difficulty--he was unflappably cheerful \nand ingenious and extraordinarily helpful to me.\n  We all stop and note his service. We also thank him and commend him \nand his family: his lovely wife Vicki, his two children Mary and \nMichael. They are the example of what Americans should be in their \ndedication to country.\n  The motto of West Point is: Duty, Honor, Country--and no one has \nlived it more significantly than Mike Barbero. I thank him for his \nservice and wish him well as he retires.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a \nfew minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to say \nthank you to COL Michael Barbero. I have been in the Senate now for \nonly a little over 3 years. During that time, I have had the great \nhonor and privilege of traveling to Iraq and to the Middle East with \nColonel Barbero on two separate occasions. He is, first of all, a great \nsoldier. He is someone who makes us all proud for his long service to \nthe U.S. Army.\n  Part of his career in the U.S. Army has been to serve at Fort Carson, \nthe home of the Mountain Division in the State of Colorado. As we \ntraveled to the Middle East, we often would talk about Fort Carson and \nhis experience there and the beauty of my State and the beauty of our \nmountains.\n  Colonel Barbero has been a great example of service. He has always \nput the interests and concerns of others ahead of himself. I think in \nthat fashion he exemplifies the selflessness that comes from the very \nbest of the best we have in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  He has been a great example in the Senate as he has worked with all \nof us, with many of our colleagues, demonstrating the excellence and \nthe commitment of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces \ntoday.\n  I also want to voice my appreciation for the great sacrifices he has \nmade because, as he has worked not only in the Senate for the last \nseveral years, but beyond that, his family has also sacrificed a great \ndeal to our Nation. I think about his wife Vicki and his children Mary \nand Michael. Mary and Michael are still young people at home. I am sure \noften they missed their father when he would be gone on journeys into \ntroubled areas of the world, sometimes for more than a week at a time.\n  So I come to the floor this morning simply to salute Colonel Barbero \nand to tell him thank you on behalf of the Senate for the great \ncontribution he has made to our country and to the relationship between \nour legislative branch of Government--this Chamber, the Senate--and the \nU.S. Army.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe majority leader to be recognized at 12:30 today be modified for the \nmajority leader to be recognized at 2 p.m. today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Senate to take \naction on a bipartisan housing opportunity bill. I know that as we \nspeak,\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nSenator Dodd and Senator Shelby are working hard on a compromise bill. \nIt is about time that our national leadership went to bat for \nstruggling working families instead of just looking out for the fat \ncats.\n  I also commend the leadership of Senator Reid and Senator McConnell \nfor agreeing to allow Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby to roll up their \nsleeves and work together to address some of the problems that now \nexist in our Nation's housing market. Since I first joined the Senate \nlast year, I have noticed that far too often the people's business \nfalls victim to partisan politics. So I appreciate the spirit of \ncooperation that has resulted in the agreement to move to debate on an \nissue on the forefront of so many Americans' minds.\n  We need to debate these issues and shine a spotlight on the actions \nof the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department in recent weeks. \nWhat we have seen recently breaks new ground and sets precedents that \nwill be followed for years to come. We need to look closely at the \ndetails and make sure this is the right track we are taking.\n  Folks throughout Montana are talking about these issues because they \nfeel the impact in their daily lives. Working families struggle to \nafford quality housing and pay for gas that is $3-plus a gallon and \ndiesel that is $4 a gallon and struggle to pay for medical costs, \nwhether in the form of excessive insurance premiums or the cost of \nsickness due to no insurance or too high deductibles. Folks paying $4 \nfor a box of cereal know all too well that the Government is not there \nto bail them out when times get tough.\n  Just the other day, I spoke to a packed room in Kalispell, MT, at a \nforum on financial investments. This was the day after the announcement \nof JPMorgan Chase's acquisition of Bear Stearns. The very first \nquestion asked was from a local man who wanted to know why the \nGovernment felt it necessary to risk nearly $30 billion to aid one of \nWall Street's largest banks but families or farmers or small businesses \nin the same situation were simply out of luck. His point hit home with \nme, and it pointed out the fact that we, the Government, need to \naddress the problems that plague the housing market. I am very pleased \nthat Chairman Dodd is holding a hearing on this deal tomorrow to \naddress the bailout of Bear Stearns, a hearing I called for when I was \ntalking to those Montanans in Kalispell.\n  Concerns about this issue are growing and getting louder in my State \nof Montana, which many local economists have noted is resistant to the \nimmediate effects of many national economic trends. We are all very \naware of the housing crisis that is rippling across this country, \naffecting homeowners and the economy as a whole. To date, we have been \nlucky. Montana has not fared as poorly as many of the other States \nwhich have seen whole communities torn apart by foreclosure after \nforeclosure, hurting families and lowering property values.\n  But we are still concerned. I am concerned for the families in \nBozeman, MT, who work hard and play by the rules, yet can't find a \ndecent place to live that they can afford. I am concerned for the \nworkers in Bonner, MT, who lost their jobs at the Stimson lumber mill \nbecause the collapse of the housing market has depressed the demand for \nlumber. I am concerned for communities throughout rural America where \nopportunity is slipping away because of the failure of our national \nleadership to invest in basic infrastructure that connects us to one \nanother.\n  The current housing market is widely considered to be the worst since \nthe Great Depression. It has spread from home prices to student loans, \nto municipal bonds, to commodities, and to virtually every sector of \nthe economy. Unfortunately, the administration has put a larger \npriority in taking care of Wall Street's big bankers than the millions \nof folks who are struggling to pay the bills, make their mortgages, \nsave for their children's college tuition, or invest some money for a \nsecure retirement, and that needs to change. We must take action to \nstrengthen the economy for all Americans and prevent this crisis from \nspreading.\n  The administration needs to quickly nominate a new Secretary for the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, one who is responsive to \nthe needs of average Americans, not another who is tainted by \ncorruption and cronyism. The American people deserve honorable public \nservants tending to the public business to help navigate the economy \nout of this murky situation.\n  We need to help borrowers who were steered into abusive loans but not \nbail out speculators who were looking for a quick buck and got burned \nby the changing marketplace. I do not believe in a government bailout \nof the undeserving, but I do believe in aiding those families who face \nunfair foreclosures through no fault of their own. This Congress must \npass legislation that can make that distinction and help families and \ncommunities that have been adversely affected by this slowing economy.\n  I am very pleased that at least we are working on a bipartisan \nagreement for this housing bill. I look forward to working with \nChairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby to pass a good bill that will \ndo right by working families in Montana and throughout America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this moment in the Senate, we are \nawaiting a bill that is being written by Senator Chris Dodd of \nConnecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee, and Senator Richard \nShelby of Alabama, who is the ranking Republican on that committee. It \nis an attempt to come up with a bipartisan bill to deal with the \nhousing crisis in America. We hope this is going to be successful. We \nare anxious for this bill to come to the floor. It is needed--\ndesperately needed. We felt at least this effort to work together on a \nbipartisan basis was a move in the right direction.\n  A few feet away from here in front of what we call the Ohio Clock out \nin the corridor, Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, \nand Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who represents the Republican \nMembers, had a joint press outing yesterday and announced this effort \nin the hopes that we can come up with a bill. This is overdue, and it \nreflects the fact we observed, over the 2 weeks of our Easter recess, \nthat there has been a lot of activity in this country at the executive \nlevel when it comes to our economy and the housing crisis.\n  We all recall that the head of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, \ncame forward and opened what they call the discount window for \nnondepository banks. To try to put that in common words, banks across \nthe United States, which are regulated and are facing oversight by the \nFederal Government, have a way of borrowing money from the Federal \nGovernment so they are solvent and can continue to do their business.\n  A few years back, there was a change in what is known as the Glass-\nSteagall law, which gave nondepository banks--in other words, banks \nthat are basically investment houses--lending opportunities, credit \nopportunities. There has been a dramatic increase in this activity. \nMuch of that activity from nondepository banks has created credit \nacross America but also has fueled the fires of this subprime mortgage \ncrisis.\n  One of the major institutions, Bear Stearns, got into trouble a \ncouple weeks ago and faced what appeared to be failure or bankruptcy. \nThe Federal Government stepped in at that point and put a $30 billion \nguarantee so Bear Stearns would not fail. It allowed JPMorgan Chase to \nstep forward in that circumstance and to back up Bear Stearns.\n  At the time, Bear Stearns, an investment house, was leveraged \ndramatically, which means that for virtually every dollar of assets \nthey had, they had $30 in debt. So there was a fear\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\nthat if they failed, the stock market and the American economy would \nsuffer.\n  I give this by way of background because this all occurred while we \nwere out of session. When we returned, the Democratic leadership said: \nWe have to get into this housing issue from a much more local and a \nmuch more personal level. If we are going to stand as a Nation to back \nup investment banks, if we are going to put the full faith and credit \nof America to the tune of $30 billion and more behind major \ninstitutions so they do not face the pain and dislocation that might \ncome from their bad decisions, the obvious question is: What are we \ngoing to do for 2 million Americans who are about to lose their homes?\n  If America is going to ride to the rescue of investment banks on Wall \nStreet, will it at least provide some shelter, some rescue to those who \nare about to lose their homes on Main Street? I think it should because \nit is not just a matter of those poor, unfortunate people facing \nforeclosure. A mortgage foreclosure is not an isolated, single-family \nevent. It is not just a matter of a family losing their home. That lost \nhome foreclosed upon, sold in your neighborhood, brings down the value \nof your home.\n\n  So 2 million Americans facing foreclosures has a ripple effect. It \nmeans 44 million homeowners who are making their mortgage payments \nevery single month will see the value of their homes decline. As I said \non the floor yesterday, what is the value of my home in Springfield, \nIL? If I ask an appraiser, they will say: I will look around your \nneighborhood; let's see what similar houses are selling for. If the \ncomparable values are going down because there is a foreclosure, a \ndistress sale involved, the value of my home has diminished. That will \nhappen to 44 million homeowners across America because of 2 million \nmortgage foreclosures. So this has a negative impact on a lot of \ninnocent people and innocent families.\n  It is not a matter of crossing our arms and saying: Well, those folks \nmade a bad decision; they are going to lose their homes, and isn't it a \ndarn shame; maybe they will be more careful next time. It has an impact \non the community, neighbors, and neighborhoods, and it has an impact on \nconsumer confidence. Over 70 percent of Americans today say they will \nnot buy a home, not because they cannot find financing, but because \nthey don't think it is a good investment. They don't want to stretch \nthemselves, as many of us have in our lives to get into a home, for \nfear that investment of $500,000 today may be worth only $450,000 a \nyear from now.\n  As a result, our housing industry is flat on its back. It is not just \ndevelopers. It is not just realtors. It is homebuilders, it is skilled \ncraftsmen, it is the suppliers of carpeting, furniture, and all the \nitems that make a new home. They are all hurting because of the housing \nindustry.\n  We returned to Washington and said: What can we do to stimulate the \nhousing industry that will be positive? And we came up with a package \nto present.\n  First, we provide counselors who are available to those facing \nforeclosure to tell them what their options might be, to find a way out \nof this situation.\n  Second, we found tax provisions to help these homebuilders who are \nfacing hard times get through it.\n  Third, we want to change the way people buy homes in America so there \nis more disclosure and transparency.\n  I had been a lawyer for a number of years before I came to Congress. \nI used to sit through these real estate closings. I would watch as the \nbank would bring out that stack of papers, plop them on the table in \nfront of the new homeowners and say: Start signing. We will turn the \npages, you sign. They would stop once in a while and say to the \nlawyers: What is this? Just another Federal form, a disclosure form; it \nis Form 237. At the end of the day, few, if any, homeowners knew what \nthey were signing.\n  Jack Reed of Rhode Island, my colleague, has a simple provision that \nwe would have a disclosure statement on the top of that stack written \nin English so people could understand what is the interest rate; how \nmuch am I borrowing; what will the monthly payment be; can this \ninterest rate go up; can my monthly payment go up; can I prepay without \na penalty? Some basics. I hope we adopt that proposal.\n  There is another provision that I think is critically important and \nhas become very controversial. I don't understand why it is \ncontroversial. I cannot understand why, if someone facing bankruptcy \nwants to go into court under what we call Chapter 13 and take a look at \nall their debts and all their income and restructure their debt so they \ncan pay back in a reasonable way, I do not understand why you cannot \nput your mortgage on your home in that court proceeding for \nmodification. You cannot now. You are prohibited by law, under Chapter \n13, from the court modifying the terms of the mortgage on your home. \nBut the court can rewrite the terms of a mortgage on your vacation \ncondo. The court can rewrite the terms of your mortgage on your farm. \nThe court can rewrite the terms of your mortgage on a ranch. The court \ncan rewrite the security instrument you used to buy that boat that is \nout in the harbor. All of those things can be modified, but not your \nhome. I have asked why. Why in God's name would you prohibit the \nmodification of a mortgage on a home? There is no explanation. And so \nthe provision I put in the bill said that the court would have that \nauthority. They wouldn't be required to, but they would have that \nauthority.\n\n  Now, what is the protection here? The lenders want to know if they \nwill be protected. Will they end up with a mortgage being rewritten in \nterms they do not like? So here is what we put in as protection:\n  First, you have to qualify to go to bankruptcy court. It isn't easy. \nWe rewrote the rules for that a few years ago, and I don't change them \nat all. In order to get into court, it is a question of what your \nincome is, what your debts are, and whether you have a chance of \nworking it out. That is step No. 1.\n  Step No. 2, the real estate we are talking about has to be your home \nand primary residence. I am not interested in helping real estate \nspeculators. Frankly, they may have some advocates here, but I am not \none of them. I want to be sure we are dealing with home ownership.\n  Third, it only applies to mortgages which are in existence at the \ntime this bill is enacted into law. So it doesn't project into the \nfuture, it is a specific group right now.\n  Fourth, this court--this bankruptcy court--cannot lower the principal \non your mortgage in modifying it lower than the current fair market \nvalue of the home. There is a protection for the lender. You know that \nthe principal can't be pushed down below fair market value.\n  Let me add as a footnote that many of these lenders facing \nforeclosure would be darned lucky to get fair market value on the \nproperty. If you have ever seen how these homes in foreclosure are \nsold, if they are sold, it takes a long time and sometimes results in \nan auction. We are finding in my State of Illinois that people are not \neven bidding for fair market value. So fair market value is the low-end \nprotection of the lender.\n  Next, the interest rate the bankruptcy court can put on the \nmodification cannot be lower than the prime rate on interest plus a \npremium for risk.\n  Next, the mortgage itself can't be for a term longer than 30 years.\n  Next, if in the 5 years after the modification in court the value of \nthe home appreciates or goes up, that increase in value goes to the \nlender--not to the home owner, to the lender.\n  How many more protections can we build into this? We have narrowed \nthe people who would qualify, and we have tried to do it in a way that \nis sensible and protects lenders in the process. So who would oppose a \nbill that is that narrow in changing the Bankruptcy Code? I will tell \nyou: The mortgage bankers oppose it. The same people who brought us the \nsubprime mortgage crisis are now telling the Members of the Senate: We \nfind this unacceptable; we don't want the bankruptcy court to have this \nnew authority. And what is their argument? The sanctity of the \ncontract. Sanctity. When I grew up, sanctity connoted holiness, a \nsacred quality. Have you taken a look at some of these subprime \nmortgages, the ones we are talking about? I have. I have sat down with \nsome of the borrowers in Illinois to see what they went through\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nand what they ended up signing up for. Time and again, these were \nelderly people, the ones I have met, who ended up signing up for \nmortgages which made no sense at all--misled, deceived into signing on \nto a mortgage they could not sustain personally.\n  The elderly lady who had retired in Chicago saw a number on a \ntelevision ad, called the number, and in 24 hours there is a fellow at \nthe door saying: You bet, we are going to consolidate your debt. This \npoor lady goes into a closing--she had limited education, she had \nretired, and she was trying to save her home--she signed all the \npapers, and in a matter of a year the monthly payment doubled on her \nhome. Here she is living on Social Security and about to lose her home. \nThe sanctity of the contract. The holiness of the contract. The sacred \ndocument the mortgage bankers want us to honor, bow to. Obeisance.\n  Another case. This poor lady, her husband had a serious illness. He \ncould no longer climb the stairs in their home to get upstairs to the \nbedroom. He was sleeping on the couch in the living room. His wife was \nbeside herself. They were both retired. She sees a nice little one-\nstory bungalow, a smaller home but one story, with the bedroom on the \nfirst floor for her husband. She goes to buy it, and a so-called \nbusiness adviser says to her: Oh, this is your chance to consolidate \nall your debt in this new mortgage. Do you know what this charlatan \ndid? He took a zero-percent loan this lady had from the city of Peoria \nto put insulation in her home and consolidated it into the new \nmortgage, so she is now paying interest on the zero-percent loan. The \nsanctity of the contract. The holiness of the contract. This sacred \ndocument.\n  The mortgage bankers say we can't touch these things. My goodness, \nthey have to be protected. Where were these mortgage bankers 3 years \nago when we rewrote the Bankruptcy Code, when we said all existing \ncontracts in America that are taken into the bankruptcy court will be \ntreated differently? I didn't hear one word about the sanctity of the \ncontract. No. Why? Because the changes in the Bankruptcy Code were to \ntheir advantage. So now, on the chance that they may have to keep a \nfamily in a home facing foreclosure, they are opposing it, opposing \nthis change.\n  What a real test of the Senate this will be if we end up letting the \nmortgage bankers--the people who brought us this subprime mortgage \nmess--dictate to the Senate about changing the Bankruptcy Code. Shame \non us. Why in the world, if we can stand up for saving an investment \nbank on Wall Street, can we not stand up to save the homes of millions \nof people who are about to lose them across America? A lot of them will \nnever qualify for this assistance in this bill. I know it. But for \nsome, a limited group, it is the only way they can keep their homes. \nThat is what this debate is all about.\n\n  I read in the paper this morning that many of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle said this is a poison pill; changing the \nBankruptcy Code, invading the sanctity of these contracts is a poison \npill; we can't consider it. I don't want to be unreasonable about this. \nI want an up-or-down vote. I want people on the record. I want Senators \nto stand up and say whether they believe families facing this kind of \nforeclosure, with communities facing the impact of these foreclosures, \nwill have a fighting chance.\n  This isn't just my theory, incidentally, on what we need to do. \nRecently, Newsweek magazine, in its March 31 issue, asked a lot of \nprominent people in different walks of life what we should do about the \neconomy and particularly the housing crisis. I wish to quote a few for \nthe record.\n  First, Bob Rubin, chief of the executive committee of Citigroup and \nformer Treasury Secretary, maybe one of the most successful Treasury \nSecretaries in the history of this Nation. This is what Bob Rubin said:\n\n       We should consider higher capital requirements for banks \n     and investment banks, plus higher margin requirements for \n     other investors. Putting up more of their own money would \n     make people focus on risk.\n\n  That is a balanced and sensible statement. What he is saying is when \nwe get into this whole question about the future of our economy, let's \nunderstand that there is risk on both sides and let's demand \nresponsibility on both sides.\n  Carly Fiorina. Now, she is an adviser of Senator McCain's campaign, \nchairperson of the Republican Victory '08 committee, and former CEO of \nHewlett-Packard. Listen to what she says:\n\n       I think the mortgage companies and the banks should step to \n     the plate and say, ``We have put products out there that have \n     harmed our customers, either because we didn't explain them \n     well or because we pushed them into homes or mortgages that \n     they couldn't afford.'' And those lenders need to sit down \n     with their creditworthy but cash-strapped customers and say, \n     ``How do we help you?''\n\n  She is the adviser to Senator McCain's campaign. She is a person with \na background in business. Her suggestion is consistent with my change \nin the Bankruptcy Code. It is exactly what I am saying.\n  Some of the others. Gene Sperling, an adviser to Senator Clinton's \ncampaign:\n\n       How can you have a housing-led recession and have no \n     housing-based remedies?\n\n  He gets to the heart of it. The housing-led recession was the \ncatalyst for our economic problems. Ignore it, and I am afraid our \neconomy won't get well very soon.\n  Joseph Stiglitz, university professor from Columbia, former chief \neconomist of the World Bank, and economic adviser to Bill Clinton. Here \nis what he says:\n\n       There needs to be an immediate write-down of mortgages--\n     perhaps encouraged through a homeowners' Chapter 11, which \n     would allow them to discharge a part of their debt and still \n     stay in their homes.\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment does.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Of course, there is something peculiar about what has been \n     going on. While the administration has been vetoing any \n     suggestion of a bailout for poor homeowners who have been \n     taken advantage of by predatory lenders, there has been a \n     bailout for investment banks. The Fed has lent money to \n     facilitate JPMorgan's takeover of Bear Stearns, and has \n     evidently underwritten the risk. It has accepted risky \n     mortgages as collateral--again putting taxpayers' money at \n     risk. These bailouts for those responsible for the mess \n     have been done in a totally nontransparent way. We really \n     don't know much about the values assigned to the \n     collateral and what the risks are. It seems fairer to help \n     poorer American households, rather than putting taxpayers' \n     money at risk without even charging appropriate insurance \n     premiums for bearing this risk.\n\n  Mr. Stiglitz has hit the nail on the head. We are ready, with few \nquestions asked, to put $30 billion in taxpayers' money behind a \nfailing investment bank, but when I come to the floor and suggest we \nought to try to stand behind a few homeowners across America who stand \nto lose their homes, oh no, the mortgage bankers won't hear of it; some \nof these people may not be worthy borrowers in the future. Was Bear \nStearns a worthy borrower? I don't even know if the question was asked, \nand neither does Mr. Stiglitz.\n  Robert Shiller, Yale professor of economics and founder of \nMacromarkets LLC. Among the things he says, he quotes a woman I respect \nvery much, Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor, who has proposed \nthat the Government create a Financial Product Safety Commission which \nwould work like the Consumer Product Safety Commission but would \nmonitor lending and financial practices.\n  How in the world can this Senate stop and say we give tacit approval \nto the decisions of the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury \nDepartment to put the credit of the United States behind investment \nbanks that we literally don't know their circumstances and then turn \naround and say we would not let a bankruptcy court even consider \nchanging the terms of a mortgage for someone facing foreclosure? If it \nis a vacation condo, fine; if it is a farm, fine; if it is a ranch, \nfine; if it is a big boat, fine, but not your home. You have to lose \nyour home. That is what the law says today. Is that reasonable? Is that \nwhat we are all about? Is that what the Senate is all about? Are we \nhere to follow the agenda of the Mortgage Bankers Association that \ncreated this mess, or are we here to serve the needs of families across \nthis country struggling to keep a roof over their heads? I hope that \nanswer will be obvious to my colleagues, and I hope that when we get \nthis bipartisan bill that is\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\nbeing worked on very soon that it includes this provision so that we \ncan have an up-or-down vote.\n  This provision is limited. It will not impact future borrowers in any \nway. The Georgetown Law study said it will have little or no impact on \ninterest rates to come. I think it is fair for us to consider it. It is \nsupported by a substantial group: the AARP, Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights, the NAACP, the National Council on La Raza, Consumer \nFederation of America, Center for Responsible Lending, SEIU, AFL-CIO, \nand many others. It has the diverse support of Jack Kemp, former \nconservative Republican Congressman and candidate for Vice President, \nand Larry Summers, who was Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton \nadministration and who wrote op-eds in support. It has the support of \nthe Credit Union National Association and the National Association of \nFederal Credit Unions.\n  Who opposes it? The big banks that created this mess in the first \nplace. I am sorry, they have had their day. They have had their chance. \nMost of them have made plenty of money, and their CEOs are going to \nescape unscathed from this terrible economy. But for the rest of \nAmerica that is paying the price for their bad lending practices, all I \nam asking is a chance, a chance that in court the bankruptcy judge will \nallow these people to stay in their homes.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMaryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for his \nstatements and leadership on this issue. I serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee with him. I thank him for bringing forward this proposal. I \nthink it is critically important to a large number of homeowners who \nfind themselves in bankruptcy that they get the help the bankruptcy \ncourts were designed to create. It was to take a look at the financial \nability of the person going into bankruptcy, to take a look at their \nassets and to make a fair arrangement for the creditor and the debtor. \nBut the bankruptcy courts today cannot do that in regard to your \nprimary residence. As my colleague points out, if it is your boat and \nyou have a chattel mortgage on it, they can work that out. If it is \nyour vacation home, they can make accommodations. But for your \nprincipal residence, they cannot do that. That makes no sense at all, \nand I thank my colleague for bringing this forward. I think it is a \ncritical part of the legislation before us, and I look forward to \nsupporting the effort to make sure that stays in the legislation.\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I visited a Baltimore neighborhood, Ednor \nGardens. That is near the Memorial Stadium, the old stadium where the \nBaltimore Orioles and Baltimore Colts played, and it is in the \nneighborhood where I went to high school, Baltimore City High School. \nIt is a middle-class neighborhood, but today there are vacant homes and \na lot of ``for sale'' signs. The entire neighborhood is affected by our \ncurrent housing crisis. Some are in danger of losing their homes. \nObviously, that is the most dramatic impact all of us hear and we want \nto do something about. We do not want to see people lose their homes.\n  It was James Truslow Adams who first coined the term ``the American \ndream'' in his book ``The Epic of America'' in 1931. He talked about \nthe American dream as the opportunity to achieve in this great Nation, \nthat every family should have that opportunity. The most visible sign \nof achievement is owning your own home. It is devastating if you lose \nyour home.\n  Many Americans are in danger of losing their homes today because of \nthe housing crisis. It not only affects individual homeowners who could \nlose a home through foreclosure or the inability to pay the mortgage \nand they just walk away from their home, but it affects every home in \nthat neighborhood. There is a Chicago study that shows a single \nforeclosure, just one foreclosure in your neighborhood, will have the \nimmediate impact of reducing your property value by about 1.5 percent \nor about $3,000, on average. The U.S. Conference of Mayors pointed out \nthat the current decline in home values across the Nation reflects a \nloss of value of over $1.2 trillion, having a major impact on property \ntax revenues of local governments. The whole community is affected by \nthe housing crisis, not just the individual homeowner who may lose his \nor her home.\n  If you happen to live in a home that you need to sell--you move, \nthere is a change of life and you need to deal with putting your house \non the market; maybe you have a contract to buy another house and you \nplan to sell your house--I tell you, the housing market is not good \ntoday; you are affected by the housing crisis. It is hard to find \npeople who are willing to buy a home. They are concerned about \ndeclining values. Everyone is affected by this housing crisis.\n  Home ownership is critically important to the safety of our \nneighborhoods. Study after study shows that where you have a large \npercentage of home ownership, you have better schools and you have less \ncrime. That was actually documented in that Chicago study I referred to \nearlier, where they showed there was a direct relationship between \nforeclosures in a neighborhood and the increase of violent crime in a \nneighborhood.\n  I have heard many people say: Isn't this the problem of people who \nentered into mortgages they should not have entered into or bought \nhomes they should not have bought or couldn't afford? In some cases, \nthat is true. In many cases, it is not. But the declining economy and \nthe housing crisis affects all of us. We have a responsibility to help \nand to do something that is positive for our economy and the housing \ncrisis.\n  This is not an isolated situation, what was happening in this \nBaltimore neighborhood. In Maryland, the foreclosures have increased--\nsince June, where Maryland ranked 40th in the Nation, doing fairly well \ncompetitively, to now 18th in the Nation in the number of foreclosures. \nThere was a 39-percent increase in foreclosures in the last quarter in \nthe State of Maryland.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association tells us that nationally the third \nquarter of 2007 was not only a record for the number of foreclosures, \nit was the highest ever recorded in the number of foreclosures in this \ncountry. Nationally, it is estimated that 2.2 million subprime \nmortgages, entered into between 1998 and 2006, are in jeopardy of \nforeclosure during the next 2 to 3 years, representing $160 billion of \npotential loss of wealth. The National Realtors Association has told us \nthat home sales have dropped for the sixth consecutive month. Home \nprices are down, and they quantitated it, between February 2008 and \nFebruary 2007, a decline of 8 percent. Our economy is hurting. It is \nnot just the homeowner.\n  Let me just give one example. Housing starts are down. New housing \nstarts are clearly down. It is difficult to see investors moving \nforward building new residential homes when we have a glut on the \nmarket of existing homes. What does that mean? I was talking to some \npeople who work at the light truck transmission facility located in \nWhite Marsh, MD--General Motors. They are in danger of losing jobs \nbecause the people who work in the building sector, building of homes, \nuse light trucks, and they are not buying as many light trucks because \nbusiness is down. This is affecting jobs in Maryland and jobs in each \none of our States.\n  The bottom line is that Congress needs to act. We need to act \nquickly. The Fed acted quickly to protect Wall Street. We have to act \nquickly to protect Main Street. There is a lot of question as to \nwhether the Fed did the right thing for Bear Stearns. They acted \nquickly. We have middle-class communities, middle-class families who \nare in danger of losing their homes if Congress does not act quickly. \nWe need to act quickly to help middle-class families who are caught in \nthis economic downturn.\n  I am proud to have cosponsored provisions included in this underlying \nbill we are talking about. It is a very important bill. It includes \nprovisions that I believe will really help the people in our States.\n\n  First, it provides counseling services--$200 million. We can help \nanother half a million families get counseling.\n  One of the figures I find shocking is that for about half of the \nvacant homes we have today, people have just walked away from their \nmortgages, walked away from their homes. They have not even tried to \nwork out their financial\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nproblems. They have not sought counseling. They have not talked to the \nmortgage company. They have not made any effort to try to save their \nhome. They think there is no possibility. In reality, there may be \npossibilities. We should be providing the wherewithal so that people \nwho are in a distressed situation can get the counseling help they \nneed.\n  When I had my gathering in the Baltimore neighborhood, there were \nrepresentatives from the different counseling services that are \navailable to the people of Baltimore--Healthy Neighborhoods, St. \nAmbrose Housing Aid Center. These are people who have found the number \nof people seeking help doubling and tripling since the middle of last \nyear. They are being overwhelmed today by people seeking help. They \nneed a Federal partner. They asked me specifically whether this part of \nthe legislation can be enacted quickly. They need the help to keep the \ncenters open and expand the centers.\n  Remember, I said half the people are not seeking counseling. If the \nnumber of people who could use counseling actually stepped forward, \nthere would not be the counselors available to handle this. That is why \nit is very important for the Federal Government to be a partner in \nproviding adequate counseling, independent information to homeowners as \nto what their options may be.\n  The second provision of this bill allows for the refinancing of \nsubprime mortgages by giving our local revenue authorities additional \nrevenue bond help from the Federal Government--$150 billion--so that \nthey can be more actively involved. We know we have a credit crunch. \nEverybody knows that. You can't find mortgages today. You can't find \nways of financing. This will help, by using revenue bonding authority \nwith very little cost to taxpayers. I say that because in many cases \nthe local revenue bonding authority, operating under the State, will be \nable to go in and purchase a distressed mortgage at market value. \nMarket value is less than its full value. The person who made the loan \nis going to get a fair value for their investment. It is going to be a \nlower value than they want, but it is a fair value.\n  We are not bailing out the investor. What we are doing, then, is \ngiving the homeowner an opportunity to have that mortgage refinanced \nthrough the State revenue bond authority at a fair amount, at a fair \nreturn, allowing that homeowner to stay in his or her home, protecting \nthe home for the family--not protecting the investor, not protecting \nthe person who made the loan, but protecting the homeowner. That is \nwhat we should be doing. That certainly is a tool I hope all of us will \nsupport, and we need to get that done quickly because of the credit \ncrunch.\n  There is a lot of talk about whether individuals went into this with \nfull knowledge of the problems. Let me tell you, there have been a lot \nof people who have been victimized by the practices that are out there. \nThere are many people who could have gone into traditional mortgages \nwho went into subprime mortgages. It is particularly true in minority \ncommunities. Between 2005 and 2006, 50 percent of all the mortgages \nsold in the African-American community were subprime--50 percent to \nAfrican Americans; 40 percent to Latinos. My point is this: There were \nneighborhoods that were targeted for subprime mortgages that could have \nqualified for traditional mortgages. These individuals have been \nvictimized. I think allowing our revenue bonding authorities, our local \nhousing authorities, to be able to do more to restructure those \nmortgages is the right thing for Congress to do.\n  I hope we will provide block grant authority, to give block grants to \ncommunities that have been impacted by foreclosures. As I said earlier, \nif you have a foreclosure in a community, the entire community is \nimpacted by it. We need to do something to help it.\n  I was very impressed when I talked to people at St. Ambrose when they \nexplained to me that when you have a foreclosed property, the house \ndeteriorates and the neighborhood needs help. A Federal block grant to \nthe community will allow it to get the housing in the condition it \nneeds in order to put new home buyers into these houses. That is \nanother very positive thing we can do to help communities.\n  The legislation provides the relief from bankruptcy that my friend, \nSenator Durbin, talked about, a provision I strongly support. I don't \nneed to go through all the provisions he went through, but it is \ntargeted to residential mortgages that are in bankruptcy, it is \ntargeted to mortgages that are currently in existence, targeted to \nthose who can financially afford a refinancing structure. It is \ntargeted in that if there is a resale and money that comes in that \nwould have the lender held harmless, the money goes first to the \nlender.\n  All this is targeted relief to provide some degree of equity in a \nmortgage proceeding between mortgages that are taken out for our \nvacation homes and our large boats and those that are for residential \nmortgages. As Senator Durbin pointed out, a bankruptcy judge can adjust \nthe mortgages for your vacation home and your chattel mortgage on your \nboat but cannot, today, on your residential mortgage. That makes no \nsense at all, and we should certainly include that provision.\n  There are provisions in this bill that will provide disclosure so, \nmoving forward, homeowners have much more information before they enter \ninto a mortgage.\n  I wish to refer to another provision I intend to offer as an \namendment to the underlying legislation when we get an opportunity, and \nthat is to provide a tax credit for first-time home buyers. I think we \nneed to do something to stimulate the housing market from the point of \nview of more people willing to come out to a buy a home. Senator Durbin \npointed out that today there are people reluctant to buy a home, who \nwant to buy a home, but they are worried that the value may decline. If \nwe give a tax credit, put money on the table, I think it is much more \nlikely that individuals will want to take advantage of that. You do \nthat and you help stimulate the economy with the exact sector that \ntriggered the economic downturn, the housing market. Let's get the \nhousing market reenergized. Let's put a tax credit out that helps home \nbuyers buy a home in these distressed times.\n\n  Now, the legislation that I am going to propose is going to be \ntargeted; it is going to be for principal residences only. I think that \nis what we should do. It will be middle class. We will have an income \ncap so it goes to those who need the help.\n  It will be first-time home buyers. Today, it is estimated that 40 \npercent of our market is first-time home buyers. In Baltimore City, we \nknow about two-thirds are first-time home buyers. So it is to go to \nthat part of the market that needs the help, that we need to get back \ninto the market. It is temporary. It will expire in 2008 because we \nwant people moving now, going back into the market now.\n  This is not a new concept. It has been used in the Nation's capital. \nWe provided a tax credit that has helped 3,000 to 4,000 home buyers a \nyear. I think it was a good policy for the Nation's capital. I think it \nis a good policy now for our country on a temporary basis.\n  I do acknowledge there are several of my colleagues who are \ninterested in this legislation who have a slightly different approach. \nI hope we can come together, as Senator Stabenow has been interested in \na housing credit for many years. Senator Isakson has come forward with \nhis proposals.\n  I hope we all will be able to work together to bring forward a tax \ncredit proposal that can help stimulate our economy. We need to act \nnow. Two months ago, in a bipartisan action in this body, we passed the \neconomic stimulus package. We did it quickly. That is what we needed to \ndo. Well, we need to show the same commitment on the housing crisis. We \nneed to work in a bipartisan manner to help middle-class families save \ntheir homes and to help our economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up quickly this legislation. Let's \nconsider the amendments. Let's move forward. There are too many \nhomeowners in our States who are depending upon us to act quickly for \nus to delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                       Pharma Payments to Doctors\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity in the last \nseveral years that I have been in the Senate to look into how drug \ncompanies may be improperly influencing\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\nmedical care. It is no secret that drug and device companies have \nsubstantial financial relationships with the health industry and \nspecifically with physicians.\n  In addition to multimillion dollar royalty payments and lucrative \nconsulting contracts, I found that drug and device companies often \nprovide perks to doctors. These would include things such as expensive \ntrips, lavish speaking fees, and other benefits that are too numerous \nto mention at this point.\n  These relationships, as you might expect, can motivate doctors to \nmodify their treatment practices. It can motivate doctors to do \npractices that may not be in the best interests of the patient.\n  Because these financial relationships are so common, I have had the \nhelp of Senator Kohl of Wisconsin in the introduction of a bipartisan \nbill called the Physicians Payment Sunshine Act. We introduced that in \nthe latter half of last year.\n  Now, this bill is not aimed at stopping money flowing to the doctors, \nthe results of which I have spoken about. But it ought to throw a \nlittle sunshine on this issue. And that sunshine on this issue will go \na long way toward curbing bad behavior.\n  I am proud to report the bill is gaining support from industry and \nfrom many physicians. In fact, medical device maker Zimmer recently \nannounced their support. I expect even more companies to come onboard \nvery soon.\n  You might say that these companies coming on board must like this, \nthat it is not going to do any good. Well, it will do a lot of good. I \nthink companies coming on board at this point are recognizing that if \nthey are in a public debate on this issue where there is evidence that \ntheir payments to doctors may influence practice, that is not going to \nstand up in the theater of public debate, and so they ought to help \ntheir public relations and get behind this legislation. They know it is \nthe right thing to do. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will look at \nthis bill and see it as the right thing to do as well.\n  Since last summer, I have been investigating dozens of physicians to \nsee if they are reporting their outside income to universities they are \naffiliated with. These physicians are at public as well as private \nuniversities and are working at institutions of higher learning across \nthe United States today.\n  I am going to report on the action of one physician. I do this to \nexplain how industry payments to medical experts can affect medical \npractice. Last summer, the New York Times ran an article about several \ndrugs called atypical antipsychotics. These drugs are very powerful. \nThe New York Times reported they are widely prescribed for children.\n  In the case of Seroquel, this drug became widely prescribed to treat \nchildren for bipolar disorder in the year 2005. It is important to \nexamine this drug because we have paid billions of taxpayers dollars \nfor Seroquel in the last years under various programs that the Federal \nGovernment has that provide help for people who cannot otherwise afford \nit.\n\n  Now, this happened after a group of experts decided that drugs such \nas Seroquel worked in kids and then published new guidelines in the \nJournal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n  But this panel based its guidelines on a single inconclusive study \nthat was done in the year 2002, paid for by AstraZeneca. The study \nconcluded kids did well on Seroquel, even though half of them dropped \nout of the study because of bad side effects.\n  The lead author of this study was Dr. Melissa DelBello, a professor \nat the University of Cincinnati. After reading about this story, I sent \na letter to the University of Cincinnati and asked to see Dr. \nDelBello's reports on outside income.\n  I found out Dr. DelBello received over $100,000 from AstraZeneca in \n2003, the year after she did this study. The following year, the \ncompany paid her over $80,000. These payments were for things such as \nlectures, consulting fees, services on advisory boards, and \nreimbursement for travel-related costs.\n  After the university sent me these records, I then asked AstraZeneca \nto account for money the company had sent to Dr. DelBello. The numbers \nafter they all came in simply did not add up.\n  Between 2005 and 2007, Dr. DelBello reported about $100,000 in \noutside income to her university. But I found out AstraZeneca had paid \nher over $238,000, and obviously $138,000 of reported income is a big \ndifference. Of course, I am finding out the money keeps trickling in. \nLast week, AstraZeneca reported to me they had discovered an additional \n$1,800 in payment to Dr. DelBello, and who knows if we will ever know \nthe full accounting of this money paid between AstraZeneca and the \nprofessor.\n  So her own university, her very own university which is supposed to \nbe monitoring her conflicts of interest, did not even know about these \nadditional payments. It seems to me they did what many universities \naround the country do: They trusted their faculty to provide accurate \ninformation.\n  Even worse, I found out Dr. DelBello received grant money from the \nNational Institutes of Health. According to Federal regulations, \nuniversities are supposed to monitor conflicts of interest when their \nresearchers receive National Institutes of Health grants. Obviously, \nthe university has engaged in the practice of trust but did not verify, \nwhere the rule is: Trust but verify.\n  Another interesting thing happened while I was looking into Dr. \nDelBello. According to the letter I received from the University of \nCincinnati, Dr. DelBello failed to report other money she also received \nfrom big drug companies.\n  So it turns out Dr. DelBello has a company which she established for \n``personal financial purposes.'' AstraZeneca was involved here. Let me \nremind you that AstraZeneca is the maker of Seroquel. They paid MSZ \nAssociates, Inc., an Ohio corporation, over $60,000.\n  Where do you think the address of MSZ Associates is? Well, you \nprobably have figured it out, the Department of Psychiatry, University \nof Cincinnati.\n  This situation is unfortunate on so many levels. It is unfortunate \nfor the University of Cincinnati relying on the representations of its \nfaculty, it is unfortunate for patients who once believed their doctors \nwere not for sale, and it is unfortunate we are in a day and an age \nwhere a bill promoting transparency for millions and millions of \ndollars going from big drug companies to American doctors is necessary.\n  In other words, I am saying to my colleagues in the Senate: The bill \nSenator Kohl and I put in last year that is picking up steam, even from \ncompanies in the medical business, should not have had to be \nintroduced. The checks and balances that are out there between \nuniversities, between the NIH and universities that get their grants \nought to be enough to make sure the ethics are properly followed.\n  This information is available, and, most importantly, the information \nis public, because this is the public's business. The public has a \nright to know whether people who doctor them might have a financial \ninterest in the treatment that is prescribed for them.\n  Now, I have given you one example of a doctor who has been receiving \nlarge amounts of money from drug companies. In this area, as in many \nothers, I hope a little bit of sunshine will go a long way. That is \nwhat the Kohl-Grassley legislation is all about. The fact that a \nphysician can promote a drug to other doctors and receive NIH funding, \nwhile hiding a very clear conflict of interest, ought to be very \ndisturbing to all of us.\n  That is why this bill is very needed. Because nobody is watching this \nmoney, and it is having a bad effect on medical practice as evidenced \nby this drug made by AstraZeneca.\n  Before closing, I wish to give this compliment to the University of \nCincinnati. This university has and continues to be very cooperative in \nthis investigation. I very much appreciate this. Thank you to the \nUniversity of Cincinnati.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of S. Res. 494, \nwhich is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution I introduced yesterday \ncalling upon the international community to fulfill previous pledges to \nprovide reconstruction assistance to Iraq. I am joined in introducing \nthis resolution by my colleague,\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\nSenator Corker, from the great State of Tennessee. I am honored to have \nhis support.\n  Our message is simple. It is long past time for other nations, \nespecially Iraq's neighbors, to carry through on past promises and \ndeliver the type of assistance that can help stabilize Iraq and allow \nfor an orderly redeployment of U.S. combat troops from Iraq. Over the \ncourse of the next 2 weeks, the Senate will once again return to the \nIraq war and the debate over future U.S. military presence in that \ncountry. It is no secret there is a sharp divide in the Congress over \nthe next steps in Iraq. We have some fundamental differences, and it is \nessential that we debate these differences in an open manner. However, \nthere is some common ground that all of us can find when it comes to \nIraq. We can agree that America has already sacrificed too many of our \nfinest and bravest young men and women in this conflict. We recently \nmarked the grim toll of 4,000 Americans killed in combat there, \nincluding 183 natives of my home State of Pennsylvania. But the United \nStates is also bearing the majority of the burden when it comes to \nfinancial assistance to the Iraqi Government for reconstruction \nactivities. We bear this burden even though other nations and \nmultilateral organizations, including the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund, have pledged but failed to implement \nsignificant sums toward Iraq's reconstruction. The United States bears \nthis burden even as we spend millions of dollars every day on our \nmilitary presence in Iraq. That is not right, and it cannot continue.\n  Our resolution calls upon other nations to carry through on previous \npledges of reconstruction assistance to the Iraqi people who have been \nlargely ignored. The resolution has been inspired by two recent \nreports, a December 2007 report from the Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO, and a January 2008 report from the inspector general \nfor Iraqi reconstruction. The two reports document the following \nfacts--just two, but they are alarming and disturbing--the United \nStates has already spent roughly $29 billion on reconstruction \nassistance to Iraq, with another $16.5 billion in the pipeline having \nbeen authorized by Congress. That is fact No. 1, $29 billion spent, \n$16.5 billion on the way. As of last October, international donors have \npledged a combined total of approximately $16 billion to support Iraq's \nreconstruction, but only $7 billion of the $16 billion has actually \nbeen disbursed to Iraqi governmental entities. This is a less than 50-\npercent return when it comes to carrying out previous pledges, many of \nwhich date back to the year 2003.\n  There are some plausible explanations for why reconstruction funding \nhas not flowed as quickly as we would like. Certainly corruption in the \nIraqi Government remains a serious problem. The hazardous conditions in \nmany parts of Iraq have impeded reconstruction projects. But these same \nconstraints apply to the U.S. Government and our construction funding. \nThere is no reason the United States has spent more than four times \nwhat the rest of the world combined has spent when it comes to \nreconstruction assistance to the Iraqi Government. I don't need to \nremind anyone in this Chamber or in the country of our economic \nchallenges at home. The war in Iraq is exacting a significant toll on \nour Nation's Treasury. The United States cannot afford to continue to \nsubsidize reconstruction assistance to Iraq while other nations remain \non the sidelines.\n  The lack of participation by other international donors, especially \nIraq's neighbors, incurs diplomatic and political costs as well. When \nthe United States is seen as the principal source of reconstruction \nfunding in Iraq, and when those reconstruction activities falter, it is \nAmerica that is unfairly blamed in the eyes of the Iraqi people. Five \nyears after we invaded Iraq, much of the nation continues to experience \npower shortages and rolling blackouts. The Iraqi people view this state \nof affairs as America's responsibility. That is why the Iraq Study \nGroup, more than a year ago, recommended multilateral support for Iraqi \nreconstruction, including ``greater involvement by and with \ninternational partners who should do more than just contribute money. \nThey should actively participate in the design and construction of \nprojects.'' So said the Iraq Study Group more than a year ago.\n  It is all too rare for a Democrat and a Republican to find some \nshared ground today on the issue of Iraq. The fact that two Members of \nthe Senate, both members of the Foreign Relations Committee from \ndifferent parties, have found common cause on one aspect of our \npresence there should tell us something. There is no reason the United \nStates, already having borne a massive cost in terms of military \nresources expended and precious lives of our bravest men and women \nlost, should continue to be on the hook for the majority of \nreconstruction funding in Iraq. Reconstruction funding for Iraq is \nimportant, and it is time Iraq's neighbors, major international \norganizations, and other nations step to the plate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I understand we are in morning \nbusiness; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. We are under cloture on the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I will use such time as I might use that I am \nentitled under that procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, a few minutes ago, I was over at the \nJoint Economic Committee, where we had Mr. Bernanke, who is the head of \nthe Federal Reserve, talking about the economic challenges we are \nfacing in this country and what the administration, and Federal Reserve \nare going to do about it. I must say, we were long in analysis in terms \nof how we got here but very short in terms of giving a great deal of \nhope to the American people as to the next steps that are going to be \ntaken by the administration to help resolve this problem. That is, I \nfind, enormously distressing.\n  I think American families ought to be certainly encouraged by the \nefforts that are being made in this body to try to develop a housing \nprogram, led by Senator Dodd and also by Senator Shelby and a number of \nothers. I understand the leaders are going to have some announcements \nlater on in the day about the progress that is being made, which is, I \nthink, a very important and significant effort. Hopefully, it will \nresult in providing some help and assistance to families so they can \nremain in their homes and, hopefully, permit some of those who have \nbeen foreclosed on to regain the opportunity to return to their homes.\n  We have seen in recent weeks a widespread breakdown in the financial \nmarkets. The crisis has had far-reaching effects on the rest of the \neconomy, leaving 7.4 million Americans unemployed and 2 million \nfamilies at risk of foreclosure. Approximately 7,000 families a day are \nfacing that. It is true in my State of Massachusetts. It is true \nthroughout New England and other parts of the country.\n  We need to act quickly now to keep families in their homes. We are \nlooking forward to our committees making a recommendation on \nlegislation that will permit us to do so.\n  It is time to restore confidence in our credit markets. That means \ncracking down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry and shining \nmore light on the operations of investment companies such as Bear \nStearns.\n  The Federal Government stepped in with nearly $30 billion to bail out \nBear Stearns. That is a lot of corporate welfare coming before any \nrelief for the millions of families on the brink of losing their \nhomes. Hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidized loans are being \ngiven out freely to banks and investment houses, but the administration \nis telling millions of Americans struggling to find work that it is too \nsoon to give them additional unemployment benefits. That is \nunacceptable, and Congress needs to act.\n\n  I reviewed at the meeting earlier today the general economic \ncircumstance we find ourselves in as a result of these costs over these \nlast\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\nyears. Since the President took office, the dollar has lost a third of \nits value. The Federal debt has skyrocketed by nearly $4 trillion. Our \ndebt to foreign investors has increased by $1 trillion. The stock \nmarket on average has grown by only 2.5 percent each year since 2001, \nfar lower than the 7.5-percent annual returns it averaged since 1968, \nand it lost $2.7 trillion in value since last May--$2.7 trillion in \nvalue since last May. Finally, this crisis has wiped out $2.7 trillion \nin home values in the past year alone. Some economists believe we could \nlose as much as $8 trillion before the crisis is over.\n  So I reminded Mr. Bernanke of what I hear from my constituents in \nMassachusetts who see their hard-earned savings being wiped out. Now we \nare reading in the papers that older workers are being forced to put \noff their retirement because of losses in the values of their home and \nretirement savings. So we ought to know what we can do to help respond \nto the staggering loss of the Nation's wealth and how working families \ncan cope with their lost savings and wealth. That is a fair question, \nand I must say I didn't feel we got much of an answer during the course \nof the hearing this morning.\n  Some have said we have a devalued dollar and this will increase our \nexports. But it is true that after the dollar has been weakening for 6 \nyears, the value of our imports is still roughly twice that of our \nexports, and we are still running a huge trade deficit. Some have said \nthe Fed is taking appropriate steps by lowering interest rates and \noffering discount loans, but it is true that even after an extended \nperiod of lowering interest rates, the economy is still floundering.\n  One of the very important and significant consequences of this whole \neconomic dilemma is its impact upon the States. States are finding \nenormous challenges in dealing with their economic situation, and they \nhave two alternatives. They have two alternatives and both of them are \nbad and will have very adverse impacts on middle-class and working \nfamilies. First, they can raise their taxes which, at a time when \nfamilies are hard-pressed to make ends meet, is the wrong policy. \nSecondly, they can reduce or cut back on services such as Medicaid and \nother programs that reach out to the neediest in the community. That, \nobviously, has enormously adverse impacts.\n  There are ways of helping the States. We have done it in the past. \nWhen I asked Mr. Bernanke whether he would favor this administration \nproviding some help and assistance to the States so they don't have to \nreduce services for their neediest people, he said that is a decision \nfor Congress to make. Well, I asked him. He is the head of the Federal \nReserve. Where is the administration? What is their position? I know \nthe power of the Congress on fiscal policy, but where is the \nadministration? We want to work with the administration to try and \nrestore our economy. When Mr. Bernanke says: Well, we are trying to \ndevelop a policy of economic growth and price stability, we are all for \nthat. We have seen that. We saw it in the early 1960s with President \nKennedy and we have seen it at other times, including in the 1990s. \nThat is a desired goal. But just stating that as being the desire for \nthe administration at a time when we are facing these serious economic \nchallenges remains, I think, an inadequate answer. The idea that the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve would state to the Congress that he \neffectively has no position and the administration has no position on \nfiscal policy, on providing help and assistance to the States, is mind-\nboggling to me--mind-boggling--a complete failure to understand the \neconomic challenges people are facing.\n  I asked the Chairman whether he thought we ought to have a system to \neffectively regulate the safety of financial products at a time when \nthe financial community has been involved in products that are risky \nfor consumers. We have a regulatory agency--the FDA--that tries and \ndoes a pretty good job of addressing the increasing challenge in terms \nof food safety. We have an FDA to try to deal with and make sure our \nprescription drugs are going to be safe and efficacious. It does a \npretty good job. We are working to try to strengthen those agencies. We \nhave a regulatory agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to \ntry to keep toys that are dangerous to children away from children. So \nwe have a tradition of establishing regulations and regulatory agencies \nto help protect the consumer. Given the abuses we have seen with \nfinancial products in recent times, should we not have a similar agency \nto help protect consumers from unsafe financial products? Consumers are \nhard working. They spend a good deal of their time working all day and \nthe rest of the time trying to look after their children. They spend \nsome time with their children helping them to read and with their \neducation, and they don't have a lot of time to go through the various \ncomplex financial statements that have become the common rather than \nthe rare. Generally, we had what I consider to be kind of a wishy-washy \nanswer on this one: That the Federal Reserve has some powers--it is \nuseful to have some power--but no precision with regard to what can be \ndone in order to protect average working families from the existing \nabuses that are out there.\n  I was discouraged by these responses at a time when we have a serious \neconomic challenge. Families in my State are working and trying to keep \ntheir homes, trying, even at this time of the year, to get sufficient \nresources for home heating oil. Families who may experience the joy \nthat many have in the last week when they receive the notices from \ncolleges in my part of the country that have accepted their children to \ngo on to higher education and then are sobered up by the extraordinary \ncosts and wondering whether they can afford it. Frequently, they use \ntheir house as collateral, and now they wonder whether they can afford \nit. They see the ever-increasing cost of gasoline, and they are \nstruggling and wondering if they can hold onto their jobs, let alone \ntheir health insurance.\n\n  Serious economic times demand leadership at the executive level and \ndemands leadership in the Congress and demands a bipartisan response to \nthese challenges. We do not have that at this time.\n  I will review briefly for the Senate about where we are in terms of \nour economic challenges.\n  I was asked yesterday morning--or 2 mornings ago, Monday morning--in \nBoston whether we were in an economic recession. I answered yes. When \nasked how one would describe it, Americans surveyed think the economy \nnow is in recession; 76 percent say there is good reason why they \nshould believe so. We have seen the response to these economic \nchallenges. We have seen some $260 billion in subsidized loans to banks \nby the Federal Reserve. We don't know how the public taxpayer is being \nprotected with these loans. We don't understand how the public interest \nis being protected. We have seen public loans at other times, and the \nmost dramatic one was the automobile industry when the Congress \nactually was repaid for the loans. It was a successful negotiation, \nwithout which we would have seen the complete collapse of the \nautomobile industry in this country and the loss of millions of jobs. \nIt was carefully worked out and the public interest was protected. We \ndon't know what those $260 billion in subsidized loans now will mean. \nYet when we asked: Could we get the administration to help and assist \nus with the extension of the unemployment benefits, the answer was no. \nNo. No to $10 billion to help individuals who work and who want to \nwork, who have a history of working and are losing their jobs because \nof the economic downturn and need to have that help and assistance in \nthe interim before they get the next job. Would the administration help \nthem? The answer was no. Yet there is $260 billion in loans to the \nbanks. This isn't right. This isn't fairness. This isn't being \nresponsive to the needs of families and working people in this country.\n  This chart gives an idea about what is happening. While wages have \nbeen stagnating, consumers have been facing increasing costs, including \nthe 84-percent increase in gasoline. We have seen health insurance \ncosts continue to rise by 44 percent, college tuition by 47 percent, \nand wages effectively stagnant over this period, putting enormous \npressure on these families.\n  This chart shows that millions of American families face losing their \nhomes. The number of foreclosures were in the thousands in January of \n2006, 100,000 in 2007, and 150,000 in January of 2008; it is up 124 \npercent from 2006. These are families who are losing\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\ntheir homes. This is a reflection of the loss of homes by hard-working \npeople in this country.\n  We have now seen the growth of a tent city, something that I think \nnone of us ever thought would again take place in this country. All of \nus are mindful of the extraordinary pressures that still exist on \nfamilies as a result of Hurricane Katrina and the hardships those \npeople are facing. But by and large, we don't generally think that \nbecause people are going to lose their houses to foreclosure, they are \ngoing to be pushed outside. The growth of this tent city has been a new \nphenomenon in the landscape of America.\n  This shows that home prices in major cities have fallen now by 11 \npercent in the last year alone. This chart shows what has been \nhappening in different parts of the country, and it has generally been \ngoing down across the country. Some areas are suffering a great deal \nmore than others. The losses in California, Las Vegas, and some of the \nStates in the South have gone down a good deal more than others, but \nnonetheless it has been across the board, and it has been serious.\n  This chart demonstrates that the economy is shedding more and more \njobs. In January of 2008, 22,000 jobs were lost. In February of 2008, \n63,000 jobs, meaning 85,000 jobs were cut in just the past 2 months. We \nare going to get more jobs numbers on Friday of this week, and most \nbelieve we will see this continued trend of individuals losing their \njobs. How many more indicators do we need? When you find out you are \nlosing your home, you are unable to keep your job, the costs of all \nkinds of essentials which you need to have any quality of life are \ngoing through the roof--not to recognize we have some important \nresponsibilities to our fellow citizens.\n  This chart shows 7.4 million Americans are competing for 4 million \njobs. These are the numbers of Americans who are unemployed. These are \nthe job openings that are out there at the present time. So we have \nmany more unemployed than there are job openings. If that is the case--\nand these people want to work, they are glad to work, we want to give \nthem an opportunity to work. Historically, we have said to those \npeople: We are going to give you some unemployment compensation to \ncarry you for a while until we get this number of job openings up, a \nrestoration of our economy, and then you will be able to get the job. \nBut these same people who have worked hard to try to provide for their \nfamily, they need to be eligible for some unemployment compensation. \nThe trust fund itself is in surplus at this time. Workers have paid \ninto the fund--and if they haven't paid in, they are unable to gain \nresources, generally speaking.\n  So this is the reason we have been struggling to get some help and \nassistance in unemployment. This is a rather ominous chart because this \nsays economists predict unemployment will skyrocket next year. This \nsays in 2007 the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, 4.8 percent in \n2008, and in 2009 it will be 6.5 percent. The lag time, historically, \nhas reflected itself in the increasing numbers of unemployed. In 2009, \nwe are going to see increasing unemployment across this country. That \nis the phenomenon.\n  If we know unemployment will continue to increase--and that was the \ntestimony before the Joint Economic Committee--why aren't we preparing \nourselves to reach out and make sure this kind of pressure that is on \nthese families is reduced or at least accommodated to some extent? We \nknow what is going to happen.\n  This administration missed the boat, so to speak, in understanding \nwhere we are going in terms of the economy. They should have known, but \nthey didn't know. For some of us who look at the record of the \nadministration, whether it is on Katrina or Iraq, we can understand how \nthey have missed the boat on a number of different issues. We are \nfinding out they certainly missed the economic boat.\n  Millions of Americans could lose their health insurance in a \nrecession. We are seeing job losses and workers' declining bargaining \npower and benefit cuts. In a mild or moderate recession, 4.2 million \nAmericans will lose their health insurance. We know when that happens, \nwhen they lose it, effectively the waiting room becomes the emergency \nroom; that becomes their primary care. The average cost is $423 for a \nvisit to the emergency room. When families lose health insurance, they \ngo to the emergency room. And who picks up the tab if they don't have \nthe money? It is the taxpayers who pay for it one way or the other. \nThis will mean additional pressure on local taxpayers who are going to \nbe increasingly pressured themselves because they will lose benefits \nand they are going to have to pay more in taxes, and the spiral \ncontinues.\n  Yet we have very little willingness from the administration to assist \nStates and local communities to help permit these families to retain \ntheir health insurance, which they could do, and which we have done at \nother times.\n  This chart is a sad indicator. This says food stamp use nears record \nlevels as the crisis squeezes workers. We have 28 million Americans who \nare projected to receive food stamps in 2009--record numbers in the \nhistory of this country, with families needing to use food stamps \nbecause they are desperate. This program was meant to be an emergency \nprogram, and it is. But we are finding more and more Americans \ndependent upon it. Just visit the food banks as I have. We have such \nsuperb food banks in Boston and in Massachusetts which have been \nenormously effective. They are well run, and they involve the \ncommunity. We are finding out about the difficulty they have in getting \ngood food and also the kind of pressures they are seeing every single \nday at the food banks.\n  This is what is happening. This puts millions more into poverty by \n2011. The number of people in poverty has grown during this \nadministration by nearly 5 million people, and over 1 million children \nhave gone into poverty. This is going to get even worse in a recession. \nThese numbers are growing.\n  I listened this morning with a good deal of interest about the \nincreasing number of school dropouts. Colin Powell was on most of the \nmorning programs talking about it. It is directly attributable to the \nincreased poverty. When you get increased poverty in communities, you \nare going to have increasing numbers of children who will drop out, \nincreasing amounts of gangs, and increasing amounts of violence, make \nno mistake. We have seen the complete insensitivity of the \nadministration to providing assistance to local communities, whether it \nwas in the COPS community policing program which was such a success or \nthe Byrne grant programs that assist local law enforcement. The \nadministration says: no, no, we have to cut those programs back. We are \nseeing increasing poverty, with all of its dangerous aspects.\n  These are very interesting charts. This one shows 22 percent more \nworkers are exhausting Federal unemployment benefits today than at the \nstart of the 2001 recession. Since 1991, we have extended unemployment \ncompensation by 13 weeks some seven times. That's seven times. In the \nlast 20 years--listen to me now--we have not had as high of a rate of \nlong-term unemployment at any time Congress has first extended benefits \nas we have at the present time. This is an extraordinary phenomenon. \nThese are fellow citizens who have worked hard, want to work, are \ncontinuing to look for jobs. They haven't even dropped out of the job \nmarket. Yet they are being cut loose here and being denied the \nunemployment compensation. So what we are demonstrating is increasing \ninsensitivity to these families.\n  I will just take a few more moments. There are things that can be \ndone. If we were able to get Mr. Bernanke to indicate that he believed \nsome economic stimulus program could be put into place, we are looking \nfor those that have been tried, tested, and demonstrated to have been \neffective.\n  You can see on this chart that for every dollar invested in food \nstamps, it had $1.73 of impact in boosting the economy. For \nunemployment, it was $1.64 of growth that you were buying for every \ndollar invested. For infrastructure, it is $1.59. The tax cuts the \nadministration favors do not have as positive an impact. That is what \nwe need. We need to have programs that will provide help and assistance \nfor them.\n  This chart illustrates how the costs are rising faster than the rate \nof inflation. So I think we know what needs to be done. We need an \neconomic stimulus\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nprogram that is targeted to middle-class and working families and will \nbenefit them. We heard today in the Joint Economic Committee about what \nwe have been doing for the large investment firms which get hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, but still there is not the will or desire to try \nto help real families who are having a most difficult time of it. That \nis wrong. I don't think the American people will tolerate that. They \nshould not. They should be assured that there are many of us who will \nnot tolerate it and will work effectively until we develop the kind of \neconomic program that is really going to reach out to these families \nand say to our fellow citizens that help is on the way.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are on the mortgage \nforeclosure bill, S. 2636. It is my hope, my understanding that the two \nsides are now negotiating as to whether they can come out with a \nbipartisan package.\n  I rise to speak to the bill before us that has come out of committee. \nI support it. I am a cosponsor. It is self-evident why I support the \nbill, because our people are hurting.\n  There is no doubt that the housing market in Florida is in shambles. \nFlorida home sales last month were down 28 percent compared to this \ntime last year. The median home price in Florida was down 14 percent. \nAt the same time, foreclosures are skyrocketing. January's foreclosure \nrate ranked Florida third highest in the country. We had the second \nhighest rate of total foreclosures nationwide, a 158-percent increase \nfrom last year. One area of Florida, Lee County, which includes Fort \nMyers, Cape Coral, an area that has been booming with growth, has the \nhighest foreclosure rate in the Nation, sadly, with 1 of every 86 homes \nentering foreclosure. In one estimate, nearly 200,000 homes in Florida \nwill be lost in this year and next year due to foreclosure. We have \nseen these horror stories on TV where the sheriff is knocking on the \ndoor and forces the family, with the children, out. If they are not \nhome, he has to go in and take all of the furniture out of the home and \nput it on the front lawn.\n  This crisis is not limited to subprime mortgages or risky borrowers. \nIt is destroying entire communities. The ripple effect translates into \nbig losses for each State's economy--in Florida's case, a $36 billion \ndecrease in home value and tax base.\n  The bill before us provides some commonsense relief. It is designed \nto help struggling families keep their homes and help communities that \nhave been harmed by foreclosures. It is going to help people keep their \nhomes by letting them refinance out of the subprime loans. It is going \nto fund housing counselors to help those at risk of foreclosure. A lot \nof people who face the risk of losing their home are overwhelmed \nbecause they don't know what to do. By providing some housing \ncounselors to help them work their way out of this foreclosure problem, \nand, to a certain degree, prime homeowners, homeowners where the \nresidence is their prime residence, it is going to be able to help them \nmodify their mortgages in bankruptcy court. It is going to give a new \npower to the bankruptcy judge to modify that mortgage so the person \ndoesn't lose the home from underneath them.\n  This bill is going to take our community development block grant \nfunds to help a community provide for the neediest, and through the \nCDBG funds, it will help a city or a county to purchase foreclosed \nproperties and then turn around and rent them or resell them so we can \nget them back on the market as fast as possible.\n  Additionally, it is going to increase funds for foreclosure \nprevention counseling. That is not the counselor I spoke of a while \nago, after and in the midst of the foreclosure crisis. This is to help \nsomebody work out of the problem before it ever occurs. It also makes \nmore clear disclosures on mortgage documents when the homeowner is \nsigning a mortgage in the first place, in order that they know what is \ncoming, know what their obligations are under the mortgage.\n  I am sure most of the Senators here are going to support this \nlegislation. It is a question of being able to see if we can get some \nagreement. The majority leader is working hard to do that. It is time \nwe extended this relief to homeowners, not just those on Wall Street; \nin other words, those on Main Street as well. That is what this bill \ndoes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate my distinguished friend allowing me to speak \nfor a minute.\n  I just completed a meeting with the Republican leader, Chairman Dodd, \nand Ranking Member Shelby. We have an agreement in principle as to what \nwe are going to move forward on. The two managers of this most \nimportant legislation are now in the process of drafting the principles \ninto legislative language. The staffs worked most of the night to get \nwhere we are today. I am not going to go into any detail as to what has \nbeen accomplished, but it is a robust package addressing the issues, \nsome of which were just addressed by my friend from Florida. We will \ncome back at 5 o'clock. They think they can have the language drafted \nby that time. It would be a substitute for the House-passed bill that \nwe are working off of. At that time, we would hope that there would be \nsome discussion of the substitute, that that would be agreed to, and \nthen we would start amending that. Either people want to take things \nout of it or add legislative measures to it. I think we are moving \nforward. This is good news for the American people, and I am confident \nwe can process it fairly rapidly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. What is the status we are in right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are presently on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 3221.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the majority and minority \nleaders, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, and \nSenator Shelby. We have done something today the American people should \nbe very proud of. I understand there is an agreement to move forward on \na bipartisan agreement that would allow us to address certainly one of \nthe major concerns impacting the American public today; that is, the \ncollapse of the housing industry, collapse of home values. I believe \nthis ties directly into the difficulties we are having with our \neconomy. The fact is, there is less value in homes and the ability to \nrefinance. Folks are not fixing up their homes, doing renovations. In \nmy State, folks who cut down the timber, log it, truck it, process it \nthrough sawmills, ultimately the contractors, the construction workers \nwho build, all have been impacted.\n  When one person loses a house and a series of homes are lost through \nforeclosures due to refixing of mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages \nwhich people do not have the capacity to repay, that impacts the value \nof every home in a neighborhood. So we are seeing a significant decline \nin many of our neighborhoods, not just urban but throughout the State \nand the country.\n  I congratulate the leadership of my colleagues who have come together \nwith an opportunity to move forward in an area of great importance and \none that I, as a former mayor and with the privilege now to serve in \nthe Senate, understand and am deeply concerned about.\n  I believe we have to move forward. We now have an opportunity. The \nfact is, in my State of Minnesota, communities are grasping for \nsolutions to stem the tide of our housing crisis. Local leaders and \nconcerned citizens are working to prevent erosion of the building \nblocks of their communities, which are neighborhoods. Despite their \nbest efforts, neighbors can't fight the growing number of empty houses \nthis rush of foreclosures is bringing. Local governments can't fend off \nplunging property tax revenues that make balancing the books nearly \nimpossible. Individual businesses don't have a choice\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\nwhen fewer people are coming through the door and they are faced with \ndifficult decisions about which employees they can keep on board.\n  As homes become abandoned, it starts a vicious cycle. Abandoned and \nvacant homes create blight, reduce the value of houses around them, and \nthe opportunity for criminal activity increases as those interested in \nlaw-breaking seize upon the opportunity to take advantage of other \npeople's mistakes.\n  When I was mayor, I believed in the broken window theory. If a \nviolent crime happened in a neighborhood, some would say: Why did it \nhappen? You would go back and say: Well, you had a window that was \nbroken, and it wasn't fixed. And then another window was broken, and it \nwasn't fixed. Then the graffiti got on the walls, and the gangs and the \ndrug dealers and prostitutes hang out. All of a sudden, somebody gets \nkilled. We are seeing folks abandoning homes, blighted neighborhoods. \nThis is spreading with very dangerous and negative effects. Beyond the \nloss of a home, the lives of those around those homes are also \nimpacted. It is creating a downward spiral that is difficult to stop.\n  I think we have a chance today in this body to move forward in a way \nto at least slow the downward spiral, not stop it. This is a problem \nnone of us can solve on our own. There are some problems that are too \nbig for one party to solve. This is one of them. Republicans and \nDemocrats need to come together to lift our neighborhoods out of their \ncrisis.\n  As a former mayor, I know the foundation of our communities is based \non home ownership. Housing is the foundation for strong neighborhoods. \nHousing creates good jobs, creates stable places for workers to live. \nHousing has created wealth. When there is trouble in housing, the \neconomy suffers, workers suffer, families suffer. From my travels and \ntownhall forums during the past several months back home in Minnesota, \nI have seen and heard firsthand how this crisis is hurting my State. \nLike every American, this crisis is attacking the place I call home. It \nhas taken away from the folks I live around, whom I worked hard to help \nas mayor. There are communities and neighborhoods that were struggling \nin the 1990s when I got elected. We built them up. Now many of them are \nstarting to fray and come apart. It is a very personal issue for all of \nus. It is not just an urban problem. In my State, it is a rural problem \nas well.\n  I understand there are statistics which show that Minnesota ranks \nsecond in the Nation in subprime mortgages and foreclosure. According \nto the nonprofit Minnesota Housing Link, if current trends continue, \nthe number of foreclosures will increase by nearly 48 percent this year \nto 37,854. By contrast, in 2005, there were 6,466 foreclosures. \nMeanwhile, the housing downturn has taken a toll on construction jobs \nin Minnesota. In the past 2 years alone, 15,000 of these jobs have been \nlost. But behind these troubling statistics is the human face that \nreflects the terrible crisis.\n\n  This is about folks such as Joanne Ness, whom I met at a forum \nearlier this year in St. Cloud, MN. Joanne spoke of a struggle to keep \nher house as her adjustable rate mortgage payment soared from $1,300 to \nalmost $1,900 per month. Hers is a typical story I hear time and again \nwhen I talk to families around the State.\n  Similar to when my son would throw a rock in one of Minnesota's many \nlakes--and you would see the ripple impact--the impact of these \nforeclosures is rippling throughout my State's economy.\n  I mentioned the folks in the timber industry. I was going to have a \ncup of coffee with, I thought, a small group of folks up in Aitkin, MN. \nIt is in the northeastern part of the State. It is timber country up \nthere. They talked about how their businesses are hurt by depressed \nsoftwood lumber prices.\n  Ron Enter and his wife stopped by my office the other day to share \nhow the housing crisis has hurt their small building materials \nbusiness. According to the Enters, their business sales have dropped \nroughly by half, and they have had to reduce their workforce from 25 \nemployees to 15 employees. These are more than numbers. These are moms \nand dads who have family obligations who are out of work. If you are \nout of work, you lose your health care. It has all sorts of impacts. It \nis not just about numbers. If the housing market does not improve, they \nwarn they may have to cut back to as little as six workers, employees, \nin order to keep their business going. These are moms and dads, \nbrothers and sisters, folks who are now out of work.\n  We are acting not a moment too soon. The time to act is now. It was \nyesterday, but we are going to move forward today, and I think that is \ntremendous. Folks such as the Nesses and the Enters are looking for us \nto work together on solutions to the housing crisis.\n  To that end, I joined Senators Bond and Isakson and other colleagues \nof mine in introducing, last month, consensus-based housing legislation \ncalled the Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act or SAFE Act. \nThere are a number of provisions in this act which I believe are now \ncontained in the compromise bill we will have a chance to vote on.\n  Senator Isakson had a provision to address the oversupply of homes \nthat is not only depressing home values but the construction industry \nas well. He originally had, I think, a $15,000 tax credit proposal for \nthe purchase of new or foreclosed homes. I think we did something \nsimilar in the 1970s, and it had an impact in getting rid of some of \nthe excess inventory in the market. If you get rid of excess inventory \nin the market, it brings up the value of everyone's home. I understand \nthe Isakson provision in a modified form will be contained in the bill \nwe address. The numbers may be somewhat different. It may be $3,500 for \n2 years. But it is a step forward.\n  Another provision that I joined with Senator Smith in introducing \nlast year would allow State and local governments to use mortgage \nrevenue bonds to refinance subprime loans which have fueled the surge \nin foreclosures. Again, while this proposal, on its own, will not solve \nthe crisis, it can nonetheless make a real difference for Minnesotans, \nsuch as Joanne Ness, who are looking to get safer and sounder mortgages \nso they can keep their homes. I understand this concept would also be \nincluded in the bipartisan bill.\n  The bottom line is there are folks who are hurting. We have a chance \nto help them.\n  I have also looked at a provision that would give returning veterans \nand servicemembers additional protections from foreclosure. These brave \nmen and women who have made such incredible sacrifices on behalf of our \ncountry should not be penalized by the threat of losing their home \nbecause of the difficulties they face in their service abroad.\n  As we work on this bill, I hope we also look to provide, as I have \nproposed with Senator Martinez, temporary tax relief for homeowners who \nare increasingly using their retirement savings to keep their homes. \nThis helps folks such as Terri Ross, a nurse whom I met at a St. Cloud \nforum.\n  She had a situation in which she was looking--she had an old house. \nShe moved into it. It needed to be updated. She spoke to a mortgage \nbroker who said: No problem. She could not afford to do it herself. \nThey said: Listen, we can get you to refinance. We will get you \nadditional money. You can put it into the house to fix it up. She did \nthat. She was, I think, at the time paying about $700 a month. She did \nthe fixing up of the house, but with the collapse in the value of the \nhomes, by the time it was done, her house was worth less than what it \nwould have been worth with the addition of the money she put in it.\n  She found herself also facing a rise in mortgage payments to the \npoint where her mortgage had doubled. Now it is $1,300 a month. She \noriginally had two jobs, and she told the mortgage company she was \ngoing to get rid of one to go to school. ``No problem.'' They were not \nbeing very honest with her. She had a problem. She started taking in \nrenters, working additional shifts--a lot of problems.\n\n  In the end, one of the things she had to do was to tap into--because \nshe had a good job; she had been working--her retirement income. The \nproblem is, when you use your retirement savings, you get hit hard with \na 10-percent early withdrawal tax penalty in addition to ordinary \ntaxes.\n  Last month, USA Today ran a piece entitled: ``401(K)s Tapped to Save\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\nHomes.'' This article talks about how Americans are ``getting slammed \nwith taxes and penalties'' as they try to keep their homes.\n  So I hope my colleagues will work with me on this concept based on my \nHOME Act that would allow homeowners who have fallen behind on their \nmortgages penalty-free access to their retirement savings as well as \ntax-free savings so long as the withdrawals are paid back within 3 \nyears.\n  So you can put the money back, but you avoid the very significant \npenalty. This is not a silver bullet that solves all the problems, but \nthere are a lot of folks who have worked hard over the years who have \nfound themselves, similar to Ms. Ross, in deep trouble, who are forced \nto tap into retirement savings and then are penalized on top of that. \nThat does not make sense. We should not penalize people for trying to \nkeep a roof over their heads and wanting to remain part of the \ncommunity they have called home.\n  I am optimistic we will make the most of this opportunity before us \nto stabilize the housing market and prevent further damage to our \neconomy and our communities. People such as Terri Ross and the Enters \nare counting on us to work together to do so.\n  In the end, I believe our recently passed economic stimulus package \nand our current efforts to pass bipartisan housing legislation will \nhelp to bring brighter and better times.\n  These are difficult times. Folks are hurting out there. They are \nworried about the price of gas at the pump. They fill their car up \npaying with a credit card, and they wonder which will get filled up \nfirst, their tank or their credit limit. They are worried about the \nrising cost of fuel. Many of them got into these adjustable rate \nmortgages. Some of them have what we call NINJA mortgages--no income, \nno jobs or assets. Now the interest rate goes up, the mortgage payment \ngoes up, and they are left in a home with less value, and they are out \nof a home.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I am pleased to be here today, after \nlistening to the majority leader reflect that a consensus has been \narrived at, that there has been agreement between the chairman and \nranking member of the Banking Committee to bring forth a proposal to \nthis body that will allow us to move forward on addressing one of the \nmajor concerns facing the people of this country, and that is the \nterrible housing crisis that is undermining our economy and, more \nimportantly, is hurting people--individual moms and dads and others. We \nhave an obligation to step forward in the right way, in a responsible \nway, and I am looking forward to being a part of that discussion this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nwhat is happening in the housing crisis, which I know we are all \nextremely concerned about, and to talk about what is happening to \nfamilies across the country. We are in a crisis in America.\n  Few States are being hurt as much as my State of Michigan, which \ncurrently rates sixth in the Nation in mortgage foreclosures. Families \nare seeing their life's dream--their home--being lost as a result of \nthe crisis. Last year, over 87,000 households were in foreclosure--\n87,000 families faced with the loss of their piece of the American \ndream.\n  Every day we delay passing legislation, thousands more families lose \ntheir homes and are stripped of their American dream, their home. I \nthank Senator Reid, our leader, and Senator McConnell, the Republican \nleader, for coming together for the leadership of our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to forge an agreement, because it is absolutely \ncritical that we come together and take action as soon as possible.\n  I know that right now we are seeing the final stages of putting \ntogether a substitute amendment. I know it is our majority leader's \nposition to move this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  This year alone, over 20,000 households, 20,000 families, are in \nforeclosure in Michigan. This crisis is only going to get worse, which \nis why we have to act now. We are hearing about the broader \nramifications--first starting with subprime loans, and then to larger \nhome loans, and now to the larger financial markets, where there is no \ncertainty, and capital is drying up so that entrepreneurs who want to \nstart a small business may not be able to do so.\n  The young person getting ready to go to college who is looking to get \na student loan might not be able to do so. There are broad implications \nbecause the way the financial markets are intertwined right now has \ncreated a situation where it is imperative we act. We have to go to the \nheart, to the central piece that has started all of this, which is to \naddress what is happening as it relates to home ownership and \nfinancing.\n  It has become clear, unfortunately, because of many hearings that \nhave been held and criminal investigations that have been launched on \nthe issue of subprime lending that we have seen manipulative practices \nand tactics as a part of this problem--not the whole problem but \ncertainly a very important part of it.\n  It has become clear a considerable number of mortgage brokers \ntargeted subprime loan products to minority borrowers, folks who are \nout doing a sales job, making something sound a whole lot better than \nit is, such a good deal, when maybe you have a senior who needs a home \nrepair, a roof done, a new furnace, or a young family trying to get \ninto that first home and they were told things that were not true and, \nin some cases, were sold a bill of goods.\n  On top of that, many of these borrowers, many of these families, \nwould have qualified for a prime mortgage with better terms.\n  We are only beginning to see the effects of this crisis and the \nresults of this kind of targeting. Foreclosures have already led to the \nloss of property values throughout entire communities in Michigan. It \nmay be that only one home in a neighborhood has a foreclosure sign in \nfront of it, but what happens to the values of the houses on either \nside, the house across the street, the house in the next block? This is \nimpacting whole communities. The result is a credit crisis that is \nmaking safe, affordable mortgages less available for aspiring \nhomeowners, putting the American dream further at risk.\n  Families across Michigan are struggling. Families across the Nation \nare struggling. We know that for most people, it is getting that home. \nIt is going from a renter to a homeowner, to tucking away that equity \nin the home that brings someone the opportunity to be a part of middle-\nclass America. We know that home equity has paid for young people to be \nable to go to college and for future dreams of those families. That \nequity, that value of that home, in too many cases is slipping away.\n  That is why I am proud to be part of a majority in Congress that has \nalready acted on a couple of key points. Last December, we acted to \npass my legislation that would make sure at least, as people are \nfilling out their taxes before April 15 of this year, they would not be \npenalized with additional taxes if they lost their home or had to lose \nmoney on a refinancing. We passed together--and I am very appreciative \nof the fact that we were able to do this--and President Bush signed the \nbill that would basically indicate, as an example, if you have a \n$100,000 mortgage and you are in a situation where you have to sell for \n$80,000 or there is a foreclosure and a resale of $80,000, that you do \nnot pay taxes on that $20,000 difference that is forgiven by the bank, \nfor instance. That does not count as income toward you. What we have \ndone is eliminate the added insult to injury. You lose your home and \nthen you get another tax bill. We acted last December to make sure that \nwould not happen, and I am very pleased to have led that effort.\n  We also passed provisions in the economic stimulus package, as well \nas increasing FHA's ability to help families facing foreclosure. We \nknow we are in the very final steps of having a conference committee \nreport done, and this is a very important part of what needs to happen.\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\n  We also know that is not enough. There is much more to be done, not \nonly to directly help families and communities, but to create certainty \nwithin the marketplace so that lenders who are operating under the \nrules are regulated, so our traditional lenders feel confident to once \nagain lend to others, to each other, to be able to continue our economy \nmoving forward. That is why I am very proud of, again, Senator Reid, \nour leadership, Senator Dodd, Senator Baucus, and others who put \ntogether the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 to help over 1 million \npeople stay in their homes and accomplish three important goals that I \nhope will be included as we come to a larger agreement with colleagues \nacross the aisle so we have an approach that can pass with strong \nbipartisan support.\n  We have brought to the floor of the Senate and have asked for \naction--we asked 3 weeks ago for action and we are now back hopefully \nto the point where we can get action on issues such as keeping families \nin their homes by increasing the preforeclosure counseling funds so \npeople can get help figuring out the maze. Because of the financial \nstructuring, you can get a mortgage and you can go back and those folks \ndon't own the mortgage. In fact, they are packaged together, \nsecuritized, sold in the marketplace, maybe even divided up. Maybe you \ndon't have one entity that owns your mortgage but maybe two or three. \nIt is an extremely complicated question. So being able to help people \nget through that situation with preforeclosure counseling is very \nimportant.\n  Allowing State housing agencies to issue $10 billion more in \nrefinancing bonds has been a part of our package and I hope will be in \nthe final package; also, allowing homeowners in bankruptcy to modify \ntheir mortgages. We also include in our plan the ability to help \ncommunities harmed by foreclosures by allowing them to use community \ndevelopment block grant funds, very important funds to support local \ncommunities to purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties \ntherefore, enabling struggling communities to focus on their \nproperties.\n  We also have focused on businesses--homebuilders and others--that at \nthis point need assistance through the Tax Code to apply excess net \noperating losses to prior years that were profitable to allow them to \nmanage the excess in inventory and be able to move forward and be \nprofitable.\n  Our plan also includes help for families to avoid foreclosures in the \nfuture by requiring mortgage documents be simplified.\n  These are important steps that will help millions of hard-working \nAmericans and address the most important issue causing our economic \nproblems, which is the issue related to housing and financing.\n  I urge colleagues to come together to act as quickly as possible as \nfinal plans for a bipartisan bill are being put forward.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also speak to one other piece of this, \nparticularly for a State such as Michigan. For us, it has not been the \nhigh values on homes or even the financial mechanism of adjustable rate \nmortgage arms and so on. For us in Michigan, our main cause of this \nproblem relates to the fact that people are losing their jobs. It is \nunemployment, people losing their jobs or finding themselves in a \nsituation where their income is cut in half from $28 an hour now at $14 \nan hour. The mortgage has not changed. The cost of food has not \nchanged. In fact, it has gone up. Gasoline costs have gone up. \nEverything is going up, but wages are going down if they exist at all.\n\n  In Michigan, these are not families who were flipping their houses or \nspeculating on real estate. These are hard-working men and women who \nplayed by the rules all their life, patriotic Americans who have been \ndevastated by the current economic downturn, devastated by policies \nthat have allowed us to export jobs rather than products, which is what \nwe need to be doing.\n  In Michigan, we have been in recession for quite some time now. \nMiddle-class families are losing everything in terms of jobs, homes, so \non. Although I have to say, we are tough in Michigan and resilient and \nworking hard to bring new opportunities and new industries to Michigan, \nbut it has been very challenging for us at a time when since 2001, \nsince this administration came into power, we have lost over 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs in this country. It is hard to believe. These are \nthe jobs that created middle-class America, good wage, good health \ncare, good pensions, good way of life, good standard of living. We have \nbeen at the forefront, unfortunately, in a global economy where we are \nnot enforcing our trade laws adequately, where we are not addressing \nhealth care costs in a way that makes sure everyone is covered but does \nnot cause us to have health care costs going through the roof.\n  By not addressing those issues--even though I have to say I am very \nproud to be part of a caucus that has tried at every effort, tried in \nevery form we can to address those issues, but despite that, we have \nnot seen what needs to be done in this country to create a level \nplaying field, to create a race to the top so other countries are \ncoming to us. Instead, we see pressure for a race to the bottom.\n  In Michigan, families are seeing, unfortunately, their American dream \nturn into an American nightmare because of lack of action on those \nissues that relate to fighting for middle-class America in this country \nand to keep middle-class America in this country.\n  I do not want to lose sight of these families. The housing bills in \nfront of us are very important to help families, but I hope that in the \nnot too distant future we will do something else that is incredibly \nimportant to help these families keep making the mortgage payments, and \nthat is to extend unemployment benefits. In every other time of \neconomic downturn, a recession, this Congress has responded, whether it \nbe a Democratic President or Republican President, to extend the \nbenefits to those hard-working Americans who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own so they can continue to put food on the \ntable, to pay the mortgage, keep a roof over their head while they work \nvery hard to find another job.\n  No one gets rich on unemployment compensation. People are getting on \naverage 40 cents on every dollar earned. Nobody is operating without an \nextreme struggle even on unemployment compensation. But we know it is \nthe right thing to do, the moral thing to do for families.\n  We have been told that one of the two things that have the most \neconomic stimulus is extending unemployment compensation. Why? Because \nif you are unemployed, you are not deciding: Gosh, do I save that money \ncoming in or do I spend it? You have to spend it. You have to spend it \nto keep a flow for your family. So we know it has a tremendous economic \nstimulus effect.\n  The other point that is so critical--and I want to give tremendous \ncredit to our Presiding Officer, the great Senator from Iowa, the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, for his incredible commitment to \nextending and strengthening the food programs in this country--food \nstamps, nutrition, school nutrition. But as he has said so eloquently \non so many occasions, increasing the dollars for food stamps \nimmediately goes into economic stimulus because when you receive that \nhelp, you are going right to the grocery store and you are buying the \nfood your family needs. There is something wrong in this country when \nthe best we can do at the moment is $1 per person per meal. I thank the \nPresiding Officer for his efforts. This is one of the key things we can \ndo to help families.\n  In Michigan right now, we not only have an unemployment rate that is \nthe highest in the Nation, 7.2 percent, but we also have one out of \neight people on food stamps. These are folks who never thought in their \nlife they would need help, never dreamed they would need help and now \nfind themselves in a situation.\n  We have heard a lot over the last months from the administration that \nthings are not as bad as we think, that the underlying economics are \nfine, although that has changed in the last 3 weeks. But we keep \nhearing that there is not enough evidence to show that we need to \nincrease unemployment compensation or help people put food on their \ntables. But we also know that every economic indicator says exactly the \nopposite. And we are now hearing from the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nand Goldman Sachs that by the beginning of next year, which is coming \nfaster than we would like, in January of\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nnext year, the national unemployment average will be 6\\1/2\\ percent.\n\n  Families expect us to act and do something when this kind of evidence \nis available in terms of the economy. We took action in 2002 across the \naisle in extending unemployment benefits, and yet I don't understand \nwhy that is not at the top of the list right now. Over 41,000 people in \nMichigan lost their unemployment insurance benefits in the first 3 \nmonths of this year, and millions more across the country will lose \nthat help for their family by the end of the year. Something has to be \ndone.\n  We are talking about people who were working, the middle class of \nthis country who have lost their jobs, probably related in some way to \nthis economy and what is happening. The job may have gone overseas, it \nmay not, but they are in a situation where they are losing their jobs. \nWe can not turn our backs on them.\n  The housing package in front of us is a critically important step, \nand I want to congratulate again everyone involved in coming to this \npoint. I hope we have something we will be able to move quickly on, \nwith a very strong bipartisan vote. Then I hope we are going to move \njust as quickly to those areas we know are desperately needed for \nfamilies and that will have an immediate economic stimulus effect; to \nbe able to do those things that will support the dignity of work.\n  The majority of Americans are not looking for a handout from anybody. \nThey are looking for an opportunity to care for their own family and to \nwork hard and to be able to have the American dream. They are looking \nto us to understand what is going on not only in Michigan but across \nthe country and to act to support them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to help initiate an important \ndiscussion, an important discussion about health care, the enormous \nneed for fundamental health care reform, and an important debate about \nwhat principles we should follow, what model we should use in \nfurthering this vital and necessary health care reform. This is a class \nproject, if you will, and I am joined by many Members of my Republican \nclass here in the Senate, specifically Senators Burr, Coburn, DeMint, \nMartinez, Thune, Corker, and Isakson. All of us will be coming to the \nSenate floor and coming to other forums over the next 8 weeks to talk \nabout this vitally important issue.\n  I think on some points there is near unanimous agreement among \nAmericans, points like our health care delivery system and finance \nsystem truly are broken. Health care is not available or affordable to \nfar too many Americans. The uninsured problem in this country is \nextremely worrisome, and just as worrisome, quite frankly, are the \nchallenges some insured folks face in terms of keeping their insurance \nin the face of dramatically rising costs.\n  On these points, as I say, I think there is near unanimous agreement, \nand that leads us to a conclusion that virtually every American has \nreached: We need to act. This is a very real concern of every American \nfamily, and those of us in Congress need to come together in a spirit \nof bipartisanship, with open minds, and act on this crucial issue. As \nwe do so, though, I think it is very important to lay out our choices \nin models--what the alternatives are. As I said, that is what I am \ndoing with my fellow Republican classmates, laying out a particular \nvision of what that reform can look like, what it should look like, and \nwhat principles it should embody.\n  Again, I recognize and thank Senators Burr, Coburn, DeMint, Martinez, \nThune, Corker, and Isakson for joining me in this effort. They will \njoin me tomorrow at the Heritage Foundation to do a similar kickoff, to \ntalk about this important debate, to talk about the principles we \nshould follow and the choices we face. As I said, we will lay out, over \nthe next 8 weeks, what we think that vision for a sounder, healthier \nfuture should be.\n  We are going to start that discussion by talking about guiding \nprinciples. Before you get to the specifics, before you get to \nproposals, before you get to bills, you need to have a sense of what \nyou think the guiding principles for reform and positive change should \nbe. Let me just start the discussion off by suggesting some of those \ncore guiding principles that I share with my Republican classmates who \nare coming together on this issue. We believe a number of significant \nthings.\n  First, we believe individuals and families should be in control. \nIndividuals and families should own and control their own health \ninsurance, rather than have the Government mandate something. That is \nperhaps the first and most basic and fundamental guiding principle.\n  In concert with that, we believe individuals are capable of and \nbetter at choosing their own health insurance plan than Government \nbureaucrats or insurance bureaucrats. That goes hand in hand with \nempowering the individual and empowering families.\n  We believe the current cost of health care regulation makes access to \nhealth care unnecessarily expensive for everyone and lowers quality. \nEveryone acknowledges the current high cost of health care. We believe \na huge part of that is the cost of health care regulation. We believe \nexisting Government programs can be improved and modernized and made \nmore efficient, and that should happen. But we also believe part of \nthat should not be dramatically expanding those programs to cover far \nmore classes of individuals and more income levels than were originally \nproposed.\n  We believe encouraging competition in the marketplace is the key to \nlowering health care costs. That, again, goes hand in hand with \nempowering individuals and empowering families--giving them choice, not \ndramatically expanding the Government sector.\n  We believe and recognize that seniors have increasingly turned to \nMedicare Advantage Plans because in so many cases they offer a better \nvalue and a higher quality of care for traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare, so we strongly support that option--not making it mandatory \nbut that option in terms of the future of Medicare.\n  Finally, we believe taxes should be as low as possible and the Tax \nCode should be changed to actually give more power to individuals, give \nmore power to families in choosing and buying and owning their own \nhealth care.\n  That is a fundamental principle on which we outline our vision. As I \nsaid, once you acknowledge the enormity of the issue, the need for \nfundamental change which almost all of us do, once you lay out guiding \nprinciples, fundamental core principles which should help chart our \nfuture, then you can more fully get to the choices there are in the \ndebate that we need to have in the Congress--in the Senate and the \nHouse--and much more broadly in the country.\n  Over these next 8 weeks we are going to be highlighting those choices \nand those differences. I think this is very important to do, \nparticularly in a major election year, because as we lead up to the \nfall elections, these choices, in fact, are going to be a big part of \nour choices for candidates for President, for candidates for the House \nand for the Senate.\n  So over these next 8 weeks my colleagues and I will be talking about \nnot only our guiding principles, what vision that sets out, but also \nthe fundamental choices from which we have to choose those guiding \nprinciples, that vision, and that model, or to choose a very different \nGovernment-dominated model.\n  So we will be talking about some of those choices: No. 1, running \nhealth care by the Federal Government or empowering individuals through \nprivate-owned insurance, the fundamental choice that is at the center \nof this debate; No. 2, forcing certain types of enrollment in large \nnational or Government programs versus expanding opportunities for \nindividual choice; No. 3, mandating requirements which are often \nexpensive mandates that add to\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\nthe cost of health care through health care regulation versus creating \nmore choices and alternatives and flexibility which can both empower \nthe individuals and lower cost; No. 4, how we deal with seniors, \nwhether we take away their choices in Medicare Advantage and in drug \nplans or we keep and even expand their choices in these and other \nareas; finally, No. 5, raising taxes to support a Government-dominated \nmodel versus tax fairness, lowering taxes or creating tax deductions or \ncredits which empower individuals to choose and buy and own good \ncoverage.\n  Again, that is a quick preview of the next 8 weeks of our discussion \nand of some of the clear and quite stark, in some cases, choices we \nface as we have this debate.\n  In closing, let me say I think this is exactly the sort of discussion \nand debate we should have in the Senate. We should be responding to the \nAmerican people's appropriate concern with the crisis we face in \nAmerican health care. We do have a broken system in terms of getting \nhealth care to all Americans. Far too many Americans are uninsured. Far \ntoo many other Americans face real worries about being able to afford \nhealth care in the future.\n  We do not have the accessibility and the affordability we need. So we \nneed to respond. Again, I think it is appropriate we start with guiding \nprinciples, what should be the fundamental guiding principles we use as \nwe come up with specific proposals, specific plans, specific \nlegislation. Then that, in turn, leads to a necessary and healthy \ndiscussion of what the real alternatives are, whether we want a system \nwhere we empower the individual and the family to choose and buy and \nown good coverage or whether we want a system where the role of the \nGovernment increases even further, and by definition it narrows \nindividual and family choice.\n  I look forward to this debate as we lay out our ideas. This group of \nSenators, we are going to expand on these ideas somewhat tomorrow at \nthe Heritage Foundation. We will be back on the Senate floor over the \nnext 8 weeks talking about these guiding principles and these choices. \nWe will be in many other venues in our States, in the Nation's Capital, \nall around the country, to promote this extremely important debate as \nwe acknowledge we must fundamentally, dramatically reform our health \ncare system to give all Americans accessible, affordable, high-quality \nhealth care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have often over the years reminded my \ncolleagues of a verse of a song of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys \nfrom the 1930s. The verse in the song from the 1930s by Bob Wills and \nthe Texas Playboys was:\n\n       The little guy picks the cotton, but the big guy gets the \n     money. The little bee sucks the blossom, and the big bee gets \n     the honey.\n\n  Never is that more evident in almost every decade than it is evident \ntoday, at this point, in this decade, with what is happening in \nWashington, DC.\n  Some big economic interests get a headache, the Federal Reserve and \nthe Government rush with a pillow and aspirin to see if they can put \nthem to bed, help them out, give them some comfort. Sure enough, we are \nnow told for the stability of the financial system, a big investment \nbank has to be bailed out. We will assume $29 billion worth of risk for \nthe American taxpayer, and another investment bank will be able to buy \nthe investment bank that is failing for about $1.2 billion. So J.P. \nMorgan will buy Bear Stearns, it will cost them $1.2 billion, and the \nAmerican taxpayers will offer $29 billion as a backstop to at least \nwhat is in some cases bad commercial paper by the investment bank that \nwas failing.\n  I do not come to the floor suggesting we should do nothing, and I do \nnot even know whether what the Fed has done is the right thing. All I \nknow is if ``too big to fail'' really means too big to fail, not just \nfor banks but for investment banks that are unregulated, or for hedge \nfunds that are unregulated, if they are then ``too big to fail'' how \nabout having some regulators look over their shoulder to see what they \nare doing.\n  If the American taxpayer is going to have to bail out their mistakes, \nhow about let's have some regulators take a look at what is going on in \nsome of these organizations.\n  Now, I want to give a little history before I talk about the bill on \nthe Senate floor, which I support. I want to talk about a little \nhistory of where we are. I am not going to talk about the excessive \nspeculation of the price of oil that now has the price of oil $20 or \n$30 a barrel over where it ought to be--that is, hedge funds and \ninvestment banks, an orgy of speculation in the oil futures market. I \nam not going to talk about that. I am not going to talk about our trade \ndeficit that is $2 billion a day, every single day, $800 billion a year \nat this point. I am not going to talk about how much we have to borrow \nin budget policy. That is $800 billion in the coming year--combined, by \nthe way, that $800 billion. That is $1.6 trillion on a $14 trillion \neconomy in a single year. It does not take a genius to take a look at \nthis country and see that this administration's fiscal policy and trade \npolicy is way off track and dangerous to this country.\n  But I am going to talk about the subprime loan scandal and about the \ndecision that we are not going to regulate anything. Now I know \nregulation is a four-letter word to some. But let me describe what the \nnew head of the Securities and Exchange Commission said in 2001 when he \ncame in. He announced that it was going to be a new day at this Federal \nagency, at the SEC. It was going to be ``a business-friendly place.''\n  So we have regulatory agencies that are supposed to be wearing \nstriped shirts. They are the referees. They announce: Look, it is a \ndifferent day. It is going to be business friendly around here.\n  Well, it sure was business friendly. And look at what is going to \nhappen to the American taxpayer as a result of what was going on. I \nwant to recite a few things of what has happened. We are talking about \nlegislation that results from the subprime loan scandal.\n  Most people would not know a subprime loan from any other term. I \nmean, that sounds like foreign language, subprime loan. All of a sudden \nnow it is in our lexicon. We understand it is a scandal.\n  Let me describe part of what it is. Home ownership is part of the \nAmerican dream. I mean it is what people aspire to become, homeowners. \nAnd we understand, and we have also understood, people cannot lay out \nthe cash for the home they want to buy. As a result, we have had a home \nmortgage system in this country. It has worked pretty well.\n  It used to be kind of a sleepy industry, kind of quiet. It was an \nindustry where when you needed to buy a home, you needed to borrow \nmoney because you did not have the cash for it, so you went to a \nsavings and loan, a lending institution. You sat across from someone \nwho was wearing a gray suit and a nice white shirt and maybe a red tie. \nThey were very understated. They knew their stuff.\n  They said: Look, let's figure out whether you can afford this home. \nTell us what your income is. We will go through all of the numbers and \nsee if you can afford this home. They were very careful on both sides \nto determine is this a home you should buy. Then they got the mortgage \nand put them in the home. They made monthly payments and realized the \nAmerican dream.\n  The reason the housing industry and home ownership is so important, \nis that it is a barometer of this country's economic health. It is \nabout employment, it is about putting people to work, not just building \nthe homes but building the refrigerators and the heaters and the carpet \nand all the things that go into those homes as well.\n  Now, for many decades the home mortgage industry had a lot of good \npeople working in it. Still does. There are a lot of good people out \nthere today who are going to sit across the desk from somebody who \nwants to own a home and are going to give them a home mortgage, and \nthey are going to abide by all of the rules. They are going to make \nsure the person can afford that home. There are some good people \nworking in this industry. No question about it.\n  Then there are some real shysters, some real carnival barkers. I want \nto talk a little bit about them. Now, this industry has spawned a new \nbreed of people in addition to the good ones I\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nhave talked about. This was a sleepy, time-honored activity to write \nmortgages. All of a sudden it is like a Roman candle. Someone put some \npowder in it, and, boy, it has been a go-go industry.\n\n  The problem is, as I described the regulator in 2001 who took office \nand said: It is going to be more business friendly around here, the \nproblem is it was too business friendly. No one was watching.\n  Oh, we all watched in the morning when we brushed our teeth. If you \nhad a little television set in the bathroom as you were brushing your \nteeth you would see the commercial come on the television.\n  It would say this--this is a real one, by the way. Zoom Credit--I do \nnot know this company, but here is what they said: Credit approval is \njust seconds away. Get on the fast track at Zoom Credit. At the speed \nof light, Zoom Credit will preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, \na credit card. Even if your credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit is like \nmoney in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and debt \nconsolidation too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who cares. Come \nto Zoom Credit.\n  What an unbelievable business plan. Well, this would have to work in \na business-friendly administration because if anybody was watching, \nthey would say: What are you thinking about? What are you doing? That \nis not a business plan. That sounds like the front end of a sideshow in \na carnival.\n  Well, Millenia Mortgage, here is what they said as you are brushing \nyour teeth watching a little television in the morning. Here is the \nadvertisement: 12 months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will \ngive you the money to make your first 12 months' payments if you call \nin the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may reduce your \ncurrent monthly payments by 50 percent and allow you no payments for \nthe first 12 months.\n  Now, what they did not tell those folks is what you do not pay goes \non the back end of the loan. It is going to cost you much more later. \nBy the way, this reduction of 50 percent, that is a front-end teaser \nrate. When it resets in 3 years, you are not going to be able to pay \nyour mortgage. I am sorry, you are not going to be able to pay it. They \ndid not say that.\n  Then the largest mortgage broker in the country, Countrywide, \nCountrywide Financial--by the way, they went broke. Bank of America is \nbuying Countrywide. And now some Countrywide executives are starting a \nnew business, a new corporation, just announced in the Wall Street \nJournal last week, to buy distressed mortgages and resell them for a \nprofit.\n  From the executives of this company, Countrywide, the largest \nmortgage broker said: Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have \nlate mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? Call us.\n  That is unbelievable. Now, let me tell you a little bit about \nCountrywide Mortgage. I do not really know them either except I have \nread the newspapers and read the reports.\n  Mr. Mozilo was the CEO of Countrywide. And in 2005, a couple of years \nago, Countrywide Financial was named to Fortune magazine's prestigious \nCompany of the Year Honor Roll. Company of the Year Honor Roll.\n  Mr. Mozilo, the CEO, received the Horatio Alger Award, and Barron's \nmagazine named him as one of the world's 30 most respected chief \nexecutives. In 2006, Mr. Mozilo earned $142 million and was celebrated \nas the growth executive taking this high-flying mortgage lender into \nnew heights.\n  Even as he was touting his company's success, he was selling $138 \nbillion worth of his company's stock from August 2006 to 2007. He sold \n$248 million in stock, according to the Associated Press.\n  Most people don't know what this kind of carnival atmosphere was \nabout. It gets to something I wished to talk about with respect to the \nlegislation. Some people say: If you had a mortgage and couldn't pay \nfor it, that is your fault. That is the victim's fault.\n  I understand. I believe those who have been victimized have some \nresponsibility. But I wish to tell you about what happened. We had a \nnew breed of mortgage brokers cold calling people who lived in their \nhomes and had a mortgage, predatory lending with high-pressure tactics, \ncalling them on the phone and saying: I have a better mortgage for you. \nYou can cut your monthly house payment in half.\n  What they didn't tell them was this new teaser rate was going to \nreset at an unbelievably higher rate later, and they would have \nprepayment penalties in this mortgage so they couldn't get out of them. \nThey didn't disclose that. They didn't disclose there were also going \nto be escrow payments on top of that. So a lot of people got duped by \nthese carnival barkers portraying themselves as brokers to put them in \na new mortgage they couldn't possibly afford. It is called subprime.\n  We now understand, from statistics I have seen, that 60 percent of \nthe people who got subprime mortgages actually would have qualified for \nregular mortgages at much better and more desirable rates. But they \nwere stuck in subprime. Do you think they are not victims? Let me say \nagain, 60 percent of the people put in subprime loans shouldn't have \nbeen there. They should have gotten regular mortgages. But if you put \nsomebody in a million dollar mortgage in subprime with a prepayment \npenalty and a teaser rate, a broker could get up to $25 or $30,000 in a \nfront-end bonus for writing that mortgage. That is what was happening.\n  The techniques were almost unbelievable. The mortgages were not like \nthe old days where you just go get a mortgage. Here is what Countrywide \nand others did. Through financial engineering, they sliced and diced a \nlot of new things. They said: We are going to offer something new. \nThese are called affordability loans, adjustable rate mortgages, \ninterest rate only loans, reduced documentation or no-doc loans. \nInterest-only loans, with those loans the borrower was told: You don't \nhave to pay any principal at all. You just pay the interest. The \nprincipal, of course, goes back on the back side at a much higher rate. \nThen they were told there is a pay option, the adjustable rate \nmortgage, which allowed the borrower to pay only a portion of the \ninterest and none of the principal. So you could pay only a portion of \nthe interest, not even the full interest, none of the principal. Then, \nif you decided you would select the no doc, you had an option of not \ndocumenting all your income. You didn't have to have full documentation \nof the ability to pay. For that you paid a little higher rate, but you \nactually get a mortgage that said: You don't have to pay all your \ninterest; you don't have to pay any principal; and you can decide that \nyou want to get a no-documentation loan.\n  Does this sound like good business? It doesn't to me. Why were they \noffered that? High rates, high yields? Because if you package this up, \nif you can convince somebody through a cold call to dump their current \nmortgage, take a new mortgage with a teaser rate, and then you put \nthese all together in a big old basket, mix them up like you mix \nsausage with hamburger, this is akin to putting sawdust in sausage, as \nthey used to do in the old days as a filler, you put sawdust in \nsausage, what these financial engineers did and the mortgage banks and \nthe hedge funds, they securitized it all. As they put these subprimes \nin with the other mortgages, then they would slice them up and dice \nthem and resell them. They had a pretty decent rate on them. So this is \nall about profit and greed. If you have one of these securities that is \nbacked by these new mortgages, it paid a higher rate.\n  That is a good thing; right? Hedge funds are buying it. Investment \nbanks are buying it. They are all up to their necks wallowing in the \ncorncrib similar to a bunch of hogs making a lot of money. I described \nyesterday how much money the executives at Bear Stearns made in bonuses \nin 5 years leading up to last year; hundreds and hundreds of millions \nof dollars for the top three guys. They have the money, JPMorgan and \ntheir investment bank, and the American taxpayer is on the hook for $29 \nbillion worth of risk.\n  I don't wish to come and talk about the bill on the floor without \nunderstanding how we got here. It goes back to Harvey Pitt and what he \nsaid when this administration made him the head of the SEC. He said: \nThis is going to be a more business-friendly place. I guess it was. I \nsure guess it was. Now, 7 years later, we have a Secretary of the \nTreasury prancing around town saying this is not a regulatory problem. \nThis is not about a lack of regulation.\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\n  That is exactly what it is about. If you don't understand that, I am \nsorry, you need glasses. That is exactly what this is about.\n  Who sat around on their hands and allowed predatory lending to take \nplace? Who sat around and watched these brokers make massive amounts of \nmoney? Watched Countrywide run up these mortgages where you don't have \nto pay all the interest, don't have to pay any of the principal? Who \nsat by and watched that happen? Does anybody think there are not \nvictims out there? Of course, there are. But does anybody think there \naren't a lot of winners? You bet your life there are a lot of winners. \nThey made a massive amount of money, and now the American taxpayer is \nbeing told: You are going to have to provide the backstop because these \ncompanies are too big to fail.\n  If investment banks and hedge funds and others that were wallowing in \nthis corncrib grunting and shoving, if they were too big to fail, then, \nin my judgment, they have a responsibility to accept regulatory \nstandards by those in the Federal Government who are responsible to \nmake sure the American taxpayer is protected.\n  I have been on this floor now for 4 years or so talking about the \nneed to regulate hedge funds. Hedge funds are only about a $1.2 to $1.5 \ntrillion value. But they are responsible for one-half of all the trades \non the New York Stock Exchange every day. Think about that. Think of \nthe impact they have. We are now securitizing everything. All these \nfinancial engineers are creating all this dark money that is not \ntransparent to anybody, moving back and forth. They are all making \nmoney. Mr. Mozilo, head of Countrywide, made a massive amount of money, \nhundreds of millions of dollars, was feted as a genius. I noticed the \nother day he and the No. 2 person at Countrywide, as a result of this \nacquisition, the two of them get $19 million as a part of the \nacquisition by Bank of America.\n  So is it a case where the good bee sucks the blossom and the big bee \ngets the honey? It looks that way to me. The good little guy picks the \ncotton; the big guy gets the money. The question is, What do we do?\n  This administration, for 7 years now, has said: We don't need to \nregulate. We don't need to look over anybody's shoulder.\n  You would have thought we would have learned that with Enron. I \nchaired the hearings where Ken Lay came to the Senate and took the \nfifth amendment in front of the Commerce Committee. I chaired those \nhearings. I would have thought perhaps we would have learned something, \nthat the administration would have learned something about the need for \neffective regulation. With Enron, the top folks got rich as well. They \nmade a lot of money. Guess what. All the rest of the families who \ninvested in that stock at the advice of the chairman who was dumping \nhis at the same time, all those families ended up with nothing. You \nwould have thought we would have learned something.\n\n  Let's learn something from this. The legislation on the floor today \nis a piece of legislation I strongly support. It is not all that we \nhave to do, but at least it is a step we have to take now. I commend \nSenator Reid and others, Senator Dodd, many others who have worked on \nthis legislation. It will not wave a wand and fix everything, but at \nleast it begins to answer the question: If we are willing, if the \nCongress and the Federal Reserve Board and the administration are so \nanxious to promote financial stability by saying those that have been \nunregulated are still going to be too big to fail and the American \ntaxpayer must ante up the money for the risk, if we are going to do \nthat, why would we turn a blind eye to so many victims who now are \nlosing their homes? It is estimated, in the next couple years, we will \nhave 5 million people who will be moved out of their homes. I am \ntalking about 5 million. All those families are going to come home \nsomeday and find out: We can't live here anymore because we are being \nevicted. The question is, Can we help some of them?\n  One of my concerns has been, I don't want the American taxpayer to be \nrequired to help somebody who saw this big old housing bubble begin to \ndevelop and decided, I am going to ride the top of that bubble. I want \nto invest in some things and flip it every 6 months, make a bunch of \nmoney. It is not in my interest to say the American taxpayer should \nfinance that speculation. If they made those judgments and were wrong, \nI am sorry, that is a penalty they have to pay. But those folks who \nlive in their residence and were victims of predatory lending, those \nfolks who got bad mortgages, whose terms were not disclosed--and we \nhave had testimony before the Commerce Committee about this, that the \nmaterials given to some of the homeowners never even disclosed what the \nreset interest would be, at least in language that could be understood \nby the average homeowner, did not even disclose there was going to be \nan escrow payment on top so, when the reset occurs in 3 years, you go \nfrom a mortgage payment you can easily handle to a mortgage payment \nthere isn't anyway you could make, that family then is out of luck. I \nthink for purposes of stability and for purposes of fairness we ought \nto reach out and provide some assistance. That is what this piece of \nlegislation does. As I indicated, the legislation applies only to \nowner-occupied primary residents. They are the only ones who would be \neligible. It has five principles and those five principles are sound. \nLong-term affordability, we are trying to create some new equity for \ntroubled homeowners. The new loans will be based on the family's \nability to repay. That will provide some stability for sustainable home \nownership. This is not an investor or lender bailout. We are not \nbailing out investors or lenders. What we are doing is helping those \nwho are in the home, only owner-occupied homes. There is no windfall \nfor borrowers. The borrowers will share their new equity and future \ngrowth appreciation equally with the FHA. It will, I think, do \nsomething to provide some stability and some confidence and some \nliquidity and some transparency in the credit markets, which is very \nimportant.\n  I have spoken longer than I intended, but I did wish to give some \nbackground to why we find ourselves in this position. We should not be \nhere. I don't know anybody here who thinks it is smart for a company \nthat decides it is going to advertise, if you have bad credit, if you \nhave been bankrupt, you can't make your payment, come to us, we want to \nloan you money. That is a business plan? Not where I come from. Yet \nthat is what has been going on. It has been akin to a carnival.\n  Now all this inept business practice comes crashing down, and guess \nwho gets hurt. The American taxpayer and the homeowners. The question \nis, What can Congress do? We know what the Federal Reserve Board has \ndone. The Federal Reserve Board has responded with cuts in their \ninterest rates. They have a couple different interest rates that they \napply, and they have been cutting those interest rates.\n  One of my major concerns is the Federal Reserve Board and the \nSecretary of the Treasury misunderstand a portion of what has caused \nthis critical area that we are in. Yes, the subprime loan scandal was \nthe fuse. When that fuse was lit, the explosion occurred. Yes, that is \nthe case. But it is also the case that the electronic herd in this \nworld, the currency traders, those who take a look at what are the \nfundamentals, what is the foundation of the economy of a country, they \nlook at this country, and they see an economy that is desperately off \ntrack. They see an administration that decided long ago we are going to \nfight a war, and we will not pay for it. We intend to fight a war, and \nwe will send the soldiers overseas. They can strap on ceramic body \narmor in the morning and be shot at in the afternoon. But we will not \nask the American people to pay a penny for it. Two-thirds of a trillion \nhave been added on top of the debt by this President, all of it \nrequested as emergency funding. Two-thirds of a trillion, and we are \ntold as of yesterday he is going to ask for another $100 billion. We \nare going to have to borrow in budget policy $800 billion in this \ncoming year.\n  On top of that, we have the highest trade deficit in the history of \nthe country. I have written a book about that issue. It is the highest \ntrade deficit; $2 billion a day we import more than we export. Currency \ntraders look at that. They look at the budget problem. They look at the \ntrade problem, and they say: That doesn't add up. That can't be \nsustained.\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\n  Warren Buffett has always said: Every bubble is always destined to \nburst; the question is when. The housing bubble burst. Probably not \nsurprising. But he has also said this fiscal policy and this trade \npolicy is not sustainable. I use him as a quote because I have a lot of \nrespect for Warren Buffett. He analyzes pretty well what is going on. \nWe have a responsibility to do what is right. On fiscal policy, if we \nare going to spend money, we have to pay for it. If that is difficult, \nif it is tough to ask the American people to do that, maybe then we \nshouldn't spend it. If it is important to spend it, then maybe we have \na responsibility to say to the American people: Here is why. Here is \nwhy it is important for the future of this country.\n\n  My hope is we will pass the HOPE for Homeowners Act of 2008 as a \nfirst step--just as a first step. I think there is a lot to commend it. \nBut there is so much more to do.\n  The book that McCullough wrote about John Adams was a fascinating \nbook, going all the way back to the start of this country.\n  John Adams, as they were trying to put this new country together, \ntraveled a lot. He traveled to Europe and elsewhere, representing this \nnew set of colonies trying to put a nation together. He would write \nhome to his wife Abigail. As McCullough has chronicled, in the letters \nto Abigail Adams, John Adams would lament. He would say: Where will the \nleadership come from to start this new country? Where will we find the \nleadership? Who will be the leaders? And then he would lament: There is \nonly us--Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, me. Well, in the \nrearview mirror of history, the ``only us'' represented some of the \ngreatest human talent gathered on this planet.\n  But I think every generation of Americans has a right to ask and an \nincentive to ask the same question: Where is the leadership? Who will \nbe the leaders to steer this country and put this country on track for \nthe future? That is an important question now.\n  We answer a question with a piece of legislation today. I hope we \nwill move to this and move rather quickly to pass this legislation. But \nit is just a portion of the question the American people have a right \nto ask: Where will the leadership come from? Who will be the leaders to \nput this country back on track?\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about the housing market crisis. I am grateful for the bipartisan \nwork of Majority Leader Reid, Republican Leader McConnell, and Senators \nDodd and Shelby. I am hopeful that we can finally pass legislation that \ngives our neighborhoods and middle-class families solutions to address \nthe subprime and foreclosure crisis that has already been affecting the \neconomy not only in my State but across the country.\n  For the past year and a half, we have been hearing all about this \nsubprime mortgage crisis. I think many people not facing foreclosure--\nand that is most of us--have had this view: It doesn't affect me. I pay \nmy mortgage. I don't have a subprime or adjustable rate mortgage, and I \nam dealing with a responsible mortgage lender.\n  The truth is that none of us can escape the impact any longer. The \nhousing crisis is now affecting every homeowner in the country and \nevery would-be homeowner. It is dragging down our entire overall \neconomy. It is not just in the urban areas. In our State, the \nforeclosure rate has doubled in the rural areas and, in fact, the two \ncounties with the highest foreclosure rates are suburban counties \nbordering a rural area.\n  I am a member of the Joint Economic Committee, and just this morning \nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before our committee \nabout the state of the economy, the state of housing, about our \nfinancial markets, and about what happened with Bear Stearns. He \ntestified this morning that the housing market is at the root of our \nhousing crisis, and until Congress addresses this crisis, our economy \nwill not be on sure footing.\n  In January, with record speed, Congress enacted an immediate and \ntemporary fiscal stimulus package. Americans will start getting their \nchecks in just a few weeks. We have to have solutions in this country \nto our economic troubles that go far beyond the day that these rebate \nchecks are sent. I believe we have to have a long-term energy plan, and \nwe need to put into place a health care plan that makes health care \nmore affordable and more fiscally responsible.\n  Since then, it has become very clear that this stimulus package will \nnot be enough to address the deep-seated problems that have been \ndeveloping over several years in our housing and financial markets.\n  Home ownership has always been considered a basic part of the \nAmerican dream. But in the last few years, the ``dream'' has changed in \nways that our parents would not even recognize.\n  A decade ago, just 5 percent of mortgage loan originations were \nsubprime--meaning that they were made to borrowers who would not \nqualify for regular mortgages. By 2005, it was 20 percent of the \nmortgages that were subprime. This opened the dream of home ownership \nto millions of people but also greatly increased the risk to our \nsystem. In Minnesota, in 2000, there were 8,347 subprime mortgages \nissued. By 2005, it had increased more than fivefold to more than \n47,000 subprime mortgages.\n  In addition, adjustable rate mortgages now make up a much larger \nshare of the market than they did 10 years ago. Many people took out \nthese loans during a period of low interest rates. But when interest \nrates went up, their mortgage payments adjusted upward and they found \nthey were unable to make their monthly payments. We met some of these \npeople in Minnesota, people who had looked for a mortgage and, because \nhome values were so high, got a subprime mortgage, understood that the \nrate would go up but were under the misimpression that, in fact, there \nwas a cap or that it would go up a few hundred dollars, and they saw, \nin fact, in some cases a doubling of their mortgage payments. As a \nresult, we have had a wave of home foreclosures that started in 2006 \nand continues today. During 2007, nearly 1.3 million homes became \nsubject to foreclosure--a huge increase from 2005.\n  What started as a foreclosure crisis is now having ripple effects--or \nmore like a tsunami wave--across the entire economy. It is no longer \njust a foreclosure crisis. It is a housing market crisis, it is a \ncredit crisis, and it is an economic crisis. It affects everyone who \nwants to borrow money, whether it is for a house, a car, a college \neducation, or a small business. It affects you even if you make your \nmortgage payment on time every month and even if you have already paid \noff your mortgage.\n  The rise in delinquencies and foreclosures--coupled with the credit \nsqueeze that has made it harder for many buyers to obtain a mortgage--\nhas resulted in an excess of houses on the market, and that has, in \nturn, depressed home prices. Just last week, a report showed that home \nprices in the Twin Cities of Minnesota have fallen by nearly 11 percent \nin the last year--one of the sharpest drops in the country.\n  Last fall, the Joint Economic Committee issued a report on the \nhousing crisis and its impact on the broader economy. The findings are \ntroubling. The report estimates that, by 2009, 2 million foreclosures \nwill occur; $71 billion in housing wealth will be directly destroyed \nbecause a foreclosure reduces the value of the house and the value of \nthe homes around it; another $32 billion in housing wealth for other \nhomeowners will be destroyed because each foreclosure brings down the \nprice of houses generally. The most poignant example of this would be a \nyear or so ago in some of our urban neighborhoods where you started \nseeing foreclosures, and you would see a sign and people may not want \nto move into those neighborhoods. Now we are seeing it statewide, and \nwe are seeing the effect it has on reducing home values in general. \nState and local governments will lose more than $917 billion\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\nin property tax revenue because of lower home values.\n  By one estimate, 10 percent of all homeowners--or 8.8 million \npeople--have a mortgage that is at least as much or more than their \nhome is currently worth; that is, 10 percent of all homeowners have a \nmortgage that is worth at least as much or more than their home is \ncurrently worth. If home values were to fall 20 percent from their \npeak, even more--13.3 million--would be living in homes worth less than \ntheir mortgages. For the first time since the Federal Reserve started \ntracking the data in 1945, the amount of debt tied up in American homes \nnow exceeds the equity that homeowners have built up--with home equity \nslipping below 48 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.\n  But you don't have a read a congressional report or go to our hearing \nand sit through the testimony to see how this ripple effect is touching \neveryday consumers. Last Tuesday, the Conference Board, a business \nresearch group, reported that consumer confidence fell to the lowest \nlevel in 5 years--just before the Iraq invasion. In the past couple of \nweeks, many Minnesotans just got their annual county property tax \nstatements, and they were shocked to see that even the county values \ntheir homes at thousands of dollars less than last year.\n\n  You might think all of this would be good for first-time home buyers, \nthat they would be a beneficiary because the amount of money and the \nvalues are going down. But many of these first-time home buyers, who \nmay not have much credit themselves or much money in the bank, find \nthat just as some bargains are coming on the market, the banks are \nraising rates and tightening their lending standards, making it harder \nand harder for ordinary families to qualify for a loan.\n  We don't have to sit on the sidelines and watch as this housing \ncrisis eats away at our finances and paralyzes our economy. We need to \ntake steps to help homeowners and home buyers, and we can. I hope this \nis done on a bipartisan basis.\n  I had a reporter run after me, saying: Majority Leader Reid just said \nwe are going to work together on this--Democrats and Republicans.\n  I said: It is true. We want to get it done.\n  He said: OK. Thank you.\n  I think people are surprised that when we have an enormous crisis \nlike this, Congress must work together to get things done.\n  What do we need to do? First, we need to give first-time home buyers \na fighting chance to get into the housing market--and create some \ndemand.\n  I have cosponsored the First-Time Homebuyers' Tax Credit Act. Other \ncosponsors are Debbie Stabenow, Joe Lieberman, and Gordon Smith. I \nthank Senator Stabenow for her great leadership on this bill and this \nissue. In fact, before I was even in the Senate, I called her to get \nsome good ideas for first-time home buyers because I was hearing all \nover our State that because of the value of homes, it was getting \nharder for first-time home buyers to get a tax credit.\n  We have a State fair, as the Presiding Officer has in Missouri, and \nour booth was a home. We designed it like a house and talked about how \nimportant it was for Senator Stabenow's idea--for a first-time home \nbuyers' tax credit.\n  This bipartisan legislation would create a tax credit of $3,000 for \nindividuals and $6,000 for married couples, if they have qualifying \nincomes, to help make a downpayment on a first house. We estimate that \nthis credit would help more than 15 million people close the deal on \ntheir first home over the next 7 years.\n  Second, we need to expand financing opportunities for homeowners \ncaught in the credit squeeze.\n  I am hoping the Senate is able to finally pass legislation that gives \nState and local housing finance agencies the ability to issue bonds to \nraise money to refinance subprime mortgages that are in trouble and to \nexpand the ability of the Federal Housing Administration to help \nhomeowners rework their mortgages--rework that many lenders are \nunwilling or unable to do because of the broader economic crisis.\n  Third, we need to make sure the foreclosure wave doesn't catch even \nmore consumers who got into mortgages they didn't understand and should \nnot have signed.\n  I was thinking today at our hearing, when Senator Kennedy was \nspeaking, that we have seen broken Government across this economy \nbecause of, in fact, the decision by this administration and others not \nto watch what was going on, not to put the resources into things--\nwhether it is toxic toys or tainted dog food. Well, these faulty and \nfalse and fraudulent financial offerings are a piece of this as well. \nBy really being off the job and not watching over things and not seeing \nthis crisis, we got to the point where we are.\n  Now we know where we are. We know we have to work with the financial \nindustry, but we also have to look, as we talked about today, at \nchanges in our regulatory agencies for more oversight, particularly \nchanges for these financial offerings. We need to provide the resources \nfor preforeclosure counseling so that homeowners do not get into a \nfinancial crisis in the first place.\n  We need to improve and simplify disclosure in mortgage documents. \nAnyone who signs a mortgage remembers how thick they are. Luckily, when \nI signed my first mortgage at home before I got married--I still \nremember sitting at that table trying to figure it out--I went through \na good mortgage loan person and someone I trusted, and I got a regular \nmortgage. So many people do not understand what they are signing. They \nknow they have a teaser rate, but they think it will only go up a \nlittle. So why can we not have a 1- or 2-page summary that at least \nexplains how high it can go, what the cap is, what they will be facing \nin their monthly payments if certain changes are made.\n  We also have to have some skin in the game for these lenders. They \nshould be held to the same fiduciary duty as banks. The banks have long \nbeen advocating for this so we can make sure the homeowners are able to \npay the mortgage, not just the first year but in the years down the \nroad.\n  The truth is these lending documents have gotten so complicated with \nnew gimmicks and provisions that no one can understand them and \ncertainly not a young family just coming on the market.\n  We must work together if we are going to turn around the housing \nmarket and our economy. Together, we can bring some stability to our \nmarket. We can make the market work more effectively for homeowners and \nhome buyers and put a more solid foundation under our shaky economy. \nThis is going to take more than just looking at this housing crisis. It \nobviously is going to take more fiscal responsibility with Government, \nsomething I know the Presiding Officer has focused on very much, and I \nhave. It is going to take talking about how we pay for things. It is \ngoing to take better regulation of these financial markets.\n  As Chairman Bernanke said today, in fact, this subprime crisis is at \nthe root of the problem, and that is what we need to focus on this \nweek. Home ownership is at the center of the American dream.\n  In the last couple of years, it has become a nightmare, or at least a \ntroubled dream for way too many middle-class families. We cannot sit \nidly by or, worse, become paralyzed by the size of the problem. It is \nnow time to act.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Graduation Rates\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, there is much talk about change. I \nknow one opportunity for real change that would affect nearly 7,000 \nyoung Americans every schoolday--5 students every minute. Gang \nviolence? Drugs? No, neither of those. This is less flashy, but as \nserious. It is the persistently high number of high school dropouts.\n  Twenty-five years ago, the landmark Federal report ``A Nation at \nRisk'' said:\n\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\n\n       If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on \n     America the mediocre educational performance that exists \n     today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.\n\n  In response the Nation's Governors and President George H.W. Bush set \nnational goals, one of which was that the graduation rate would rise to \nat least 90 percent by the year 2000. According to the National Center \nfor Education Statistics, the national graduation rate was only 68 \npercent in 2006.\n  There has been plenty of effort and some gains. Fourth graders \nnationwide recently scored higher than ever in reading, while both \nfourth and eighth grade students achieved record high math scores. Yet \nin 2006, among minority students, only 58 percent of Hispanic and 53 \npercent of African-American students graduate with a regular diploma, \ncompared to 76 percent of White students and 80 percent of Asian \nAmericans.\n  When students drop out they lose, employers lose, society loses, and \ndemocracy suffers. These students are more likely to go to prison, to \nrely on public programs and to go without health insurance. The \nAlliance for Excellent Education estimates that dropouts from the class \nof 2006-2007 alone will cost our Nation more than $329 billion in lost \nwages, taxes, and productivity over their lifetimes.\n  A recent landmark report by the National Academies of Science and \nEngineering called ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' warns that \nAmericans may be losing the brainpower advantage that has permitted us \nyear in and year out to produce about 30 percent of the world's wealth \nfor just 5 percent of the world's people, those of us who live in the \nUnited States of America. China, India, and other countries know that \nbetter schools, better colleges, and research mean better jobs and are \ndetermined to catch up.\n  In response, Congress enacted the America COMPETES Act of 2007 to \nincrease funding for science agencies, training for more math and \nscience teachers and supporting more research. States are remodeling \nhigh schools, such as North Carolina's work with the Gates Foundation \nto create an academically rigorous curriculum. Mayors, like Nashville's \nKarl Dean, are holding dropout prevention summits.\n  Also pitching in is America's Promise--the movement founded by Alma \nand Colin Powell and supported by four U.S. Presidents. Instead of \nrelying on Washington wisdom, America's Promise will organize 100 \ncommunity summits to find ways to change low graduation rates.\n  After 30 years of fighting for and watching education reform, I wave \none yellow flag of caution: Let's hope the talk at these summits will \nnot be stuck in the same old educational ruts, but instead will be open \nto real change--such as offering high school juniors and seniors more \noptions to enroll in college courses, giving low income students more \nof the same choices of so-called good schools that wealthy kids already \nhave; giving all students more choices so they fit their school; \nmeasuring good teaching and finding fair ways to pay the best teachers \na lot more; turning high schools as we now know them inside out so that \nthey actually attract students; finding more ways to connect work and \nschool so young people know the real world; and pushing standards \nhigher so American graduates can compete in the world marketplace--and, \nyes, putting money behind real changes when they earn it.\n  These are the real, hard changes that will help more of our \nyoungsters realize America's promise.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                     China Human Rights Violations\n\n  Mr. President, in a little more than 4 months, the world will witness \none of its great quadrennial events: the Summer Olympic Games.\n  The games have been billed as a way for China to reintroduce itself \nto the international community. China has done everything, virtually, \nto prepare. It has pulled out all the stops: $38 billion in \ninfrastructure improvements, including a brand new 91,000-seat stadium, \n300 miles of new roads, and an entirely new terminal at Beijing's \ninternational airport--all done for the Olympic Games.\n  What China will not be highlighting is its human rights record. That \nis because its human rights record is abysmal. Last year, Amnesty \nInternational, the nonpartisan, nonaligned, highly respected \ninternational group that monitors human rights, said of China that:\n\n       An increased number of journalists . . . were harassed, \n     detained, and jailed. Thousands of people who pursued their \n     faith outside officially sanctioned churches were subjected \n     to harassment and many to detention and imprisonment. \n     Thousands of people were sentenced to death or executed. \n     Migrants from rural areas were deprived of basic rights.\n\n  The report went on to say:\n\n       Severe repression of the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang \n     Uyghur Autonomous Region continued, and freedom of expression \n     and religion continued to be severely restricted in Tibet and \n     among Tibetans everywhere.\n\n  Acts of repression include indiscriminate use of the death penalty, \ntorture, kangaroo courts, arbitrary detention, and the policy of \ncultural, religious, and linguistic eradication.\n  Beijing will continue to attempt to paint its repressive regime in \nthe best light possible, as we have seen them try to do in the last \nmonth with the unnerving tragic events in Tibet.\n  Our Nation must not implicitly condone human rights abuses by \nignoring them. Our Nation must not implicitly condone religious \npersecution by minimizing it. Our Nation must not implicitly condone \neconomic exploitation by perpetuating it.\n  The repression in Tibet is, unfortunately, nothing new. For close to \n60 years, Tibetans have survived under Beijing repression. The Uyghur \npeople in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been subjected to \nthe same grueling conditions.\n  We must not allow the pomp and circumstance--as it comes over the \nbroadcast networks in our country--we must not allow the pomp and \ncircumstance of these Olympics to obscure the real China, the China \nthat too often represses its people, the China that too often \nmanipulates its currency--as the senior Senator from New York, the \nPresiding Officer, has worked on--the China that makes a mockery of its \ntrading partners.\n  Communities across America feel the reverberations of this policy. We \nhave lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs in the United States. \nMy State of Ohio has lost 200,000 in the last half dozen years.\n  Our trade deficit with China was only about $12 billion when I first \nran for the House of Representatives in 1992. Now it exceeds $250 \nbillion, and it hits new records almost every month.\n  Massive Government subsidies, slave wages, and lax worker safety and \nenvironmental laws--if they ever actually enforce them--enable Chinese \nmanufacturers to undercut U.S. companies.\n  We are certainly not innocent, as U.S. companies outsource jobs, \ndevastating American communities, with the damage they have done to \nplaces such as Tiffin and Bryan and Toledo and Lima and Marion and \nMansfield. The American companies go to China and subcontract with \nChinese subcontractors who do not observe any kind of wage, \nenvironmental, or worker safety laws.\n  By minimizing the importance of these anticompetitive tactics, our \nNation is walking down a dangerous road, and by dismissing the \nimportance of human rights violations, we are treating our own values \nas negotiable and arbitrary. Americans are far more resolute in our \nbeliefs than that, and as their elected officials we should be too.\n  The Olympic Charter states that the goal of the Olympic Movement is \nto contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating \nyouth through sport practiced without discrimination of any kind. The \nOlympic Charter makes clear the goal of an Olympic spirit which \nrequires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity, \nand fair play.\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\n  The charter is a good blueprint for the way leaders should treat \ntheir people and countries should treat one another. That is the \nunderlying and fundamental purpose of the Olympics. Instead of giving \nChina a pass during the Olympic games, we should use the games as an \nimpetus to hold that country accountable on fair trade, on religious \nfreedoms, on human rights.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Pryor]. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for such \ntime as I may consume as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nto talk about the farm bill for the United States of America. As the \nPresiding Officer knows full well, this has been a major undertaking of \nthis Congress for the last year. Under the leadership of Senator \nHarkin, this has been a major effort which actually preceded even this \nCongress, through the work of the last Congress, and for many of us \nover the last 3 years.\n  Our efforts to put together the best farm bill in the history of the \nUnited States came to a conclusion here on December 14, 2007, where, at \nabout 3 o'clock that afternoon, in a vote in this Chamber, there were \n79 Senators, 79 Senators who cast a ``yes'' vote on this farm bill. \nNow, not all Senators voted that day because there were seven Senators \nwho were absent, some of them who were on the Presidential trail. When \nwe talked to those Senators who were on the Presidential trail and \nthose who were not here to vote on that day, we know there were 84 \nSenators who would have voted yes for that farm bill. That was on \nDecember 14, 2007.\n  December has passed, January has passed, February has passed, March \nhas passed, April. Where are we? We are not, in my view, making the \nkind of progress to get us across the finish line that we have to make. \nSo I come here today to remind us all that it is important that we \nfinish the work on the farm bill. And, yes, I have made telephone calls \nto colleagues on the House side, asking them and urging them to move \nforward with the kind of urgency that many of us in this Chamber feel \nabout this legislation.\n  I want to go back and reflect a little bit with my colleagues here on \nthe importance of this bill. When I came to the Senate in January 2005, \nI gave my maiden speech on the floor of the Senate, and in that speech \nI spoke about the forgotten America. It was about those wide dispatches \nof land which have had troubling economic times, that even in those \ndays of the 1990s when the economy was doing so well all across this \ncountry, there were those places in our Nation that somehow continued \nto wither on the vine.\n  In my own State of Colorado, a huge State with 64 counties, there are \nabout 12 counties that I would say have done very well through the \n1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, our population from 1980 to today has \ngrown by some 2 million people so that we now have about 5 million \npeople. But there are wide spaces in the State of Colorado, in \napproximately 50 of those 64 counties, where the population has been in \ndecline, where Main Streets have been boarded up, where the economic \nstruggle of people is particularly painful, whether it is the area of \nhealth care or in the area of education or in any of those facets of \nlife that affect us all.\n  So our opportunity to shine the spotlight on rural America really \ncomes about once every 5 years when we get to renew the farm bill and \nreset the policy of the Nation with respect to agriculture and rural \nAmerica. This has been our time. This has been our time to do something \nto address this issue of what I have called the forgotten America.\n  When you look at this nonmetro population change by county from 2000 \nto 2005, you will see the great swaths of America that are outlined \nhere in red where you see county after county, mostly in rural America, \nthat continues to lose population. So I show this map here because I \nthink it is important for us, to remind us that as we work here today \non the housing bill, which is an important and urgent piece of \nlegislation for the United States and for the people of America who are \nfeeling the pain today because of the housing crisis, it is also \nimportant to remind people that there is another pain being felt across \nAmerica, and that is a pain in rural America.\n  This next poster is a typical poster of a Main Street in the State of \nColorado. This is a poster from Mariano, CO, a picture of Mariano, CO, \nwhich shows what is happening in many of our communities. I am sure \nthat in the Presiding Officer's State of Pennsylvania, in the rural \nparts of Pennsylvania, we can probably find communities that look very \nmuch like this on Main Street. Perhaps even in the great State of Rhode \nIsland there may be some towns that actually look like this. We have \nhalf of Main Street essentially boarded up. You have a few pickup \ntrucks. That is kind of how it looks.\n  This is another example of much of what is happening. This is from \nBrush, CO, again out on the eastern plains, ``for sale'' signs, Main \nStreet for sale. Rural America--rural America has a whole bunch of \nproblems.\n  So when we look at the 2007--now 2008--farm bill, which will set the \npolicy of the United States of America with respect to our farming \npolicy for the next 5 years, I think it is important to see it as a \ngreat opportunity for us to come together, to create new opportunities \nfor the United States of America, to move us forward with energy \nindependence and fuel security for our country and also to make sure we \nhave food security for America.\n  There are many opportunities that are set forth in this farm bill \nwhich we ought not to forget. One of those opportunities is set forth \nin title IX of the farm bill where, for the first time, for the first \ntime we have included in there a robust package that will help us grow \nour way to energy independence. We are going to do that through \nharnessing the power of the wind, the power of the Sun. We are going to \ndo it through harnessing the power of biomass, where we can create a \nnew biofuels industry that will enhance our national security, get rid \nof our dependance on foreign oil, and make sure we start addressing the \nenvironmental security concerns of the people of America. That is an \nimportant provision of this legislation.\n  This is a picture of one of the wind farms in my State of Colorado, \nwhere wind has become a significant part of our renewable energy \nportfolio for our State. I am sometimes in awe of what my State of \nColorado has done in a very few short years.\n  In 2004, there was virtually no wind generation within the State of \nColorado. We were not producing any electricity or very little \nelectricity for the consumption of the people of my State and \nsurrounding States.\n  In 2004, we started this renewable energy initiative. In a very short \n3 years, we now have accomplished 1,000 megawatts of power being \ngenerated by the wind farms throughout the State of Colorado--1,000 \nmegawatts of power. That is an incredible amount of power when you \nconsider it. That is about the equivalent of what we would be \ngenerating from three coal-fired powerplants. We have begun to do that \nin my State. We are starting it, actually, in other States all across \nthis great Nation where the wind blows, whether it is in North Dakota \nor New Mexico or Texas.\n  We have a huge initiative going forward now with respect to grasping \nthe reality of renewable energy to harness the power of the wind. It is \nnot only major wind farms owned by companies or by utilities. In the \nfarm bill, we said: We take the power of the wind and we ought to be \nable to make it available to homeowners, to farmers, and small \nbusinesses by including in title IX a small tax credit of $4,000 for \nsmall wind turbines that produce less than 50 kW. That is a very \nimportant part of the farm bill.\n  In addition to harnessing the power of the wind, what we do in the \nfarm bill is also to harness the power of our biomasses. Yes, we have \ndone that in the past. In the 2005 Energy Policy Act, we\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nmoved forward with quintupling the renewable fuels standard. In the \n2007 Energy bill, which we passed out of the Senate, we pushed that \nagenda significantly higher in the 2007 farm bill.\n  This is an ethanol plant in my State of Colorado. Three years ago, \nthere were no ethanol plants in my State. Biofuels had bypassed the \nState of Colorado. Because of the work of this Chamber, today there are \nfour ethanol plants which are up and functioning, producing hundreds of \nmillions of gallons of ethanol within my State. Ground has been broken \non two additional ones. But even more importantly, what we have done in \nthe Congress is we recognized that we will move beyond these ethanol \nplants into a whole new future of cellulosic ethanol that is required \nunder the renewable fuels standard of the Energy Policy Act. In the \nfarm bill, in title IX, which we have included in the farm bill itself, \nwe have said that this next step on cellulosic ethanol has to be taken. \nWe include major incentives for a cellulosic ethanol future for the \ncountry.\n  Let me say it is more than about rural America and rural development \nand energy, it also is about conservation of our lands across this \ngreat country. It has been said many times that farmers and ranchers \nare the best stewards of our land. Perhaps they are the best \nenvironmentalists we know. That comes from the reason that at the end \nof the day, if you do not take care of your land and you do not take \ncare of your water, you are not going to have the wherewithal to be \nable to provide for yourself and your family a living in the following \nyears. So farmers and ranchers are conservationists, and that is why in \nthe farm bill its conservation title has a very robust movement forward \nin a number of our conservation programs which are so important for our \ncountry.\n  Here is a picture, again taken at the foothills of the great Rocky \nMountains in the State of Colorado, of a project which has been founded \nthrough the Wetlands Reserve Program. Those kinds of programs are a \nvery fundamental component of this farm bill.\n  But it goes beyond conservation. We also, in this farm bill, need to \nconstantly keep reminding people that 67.7, almost 68 percent of all of \nthe money this Senate directed to be spent on the farm bill--almost 68 \npercent, more than two-thirds--is supposed to be going and will go to \nthe nutrition programs. It will provide money for food stamps, it will \nprovide money for the kinds of fruits and vegetables programs we want \nin our schools. It is a very important part of the farm bill. Sometimes \npeople say: Well, the farm bill is all about rural America, the \nforgotten America that I was talking about. That is not true because \nmost of the nutritional dollars that are spent under the farm bill \nactually go to benefit the urban cousins we have throughout this \ncountry. So let's not forget the importance of food stamps, the \nimportance of the nutritional programs that are included in the \nschools.\n  Finally, from time to time there is a disaster that strikes rural \nAmerica. This is the disaster which struck the eastern part of my State \nand the western part of Kansas just last year, with a snow blizzard \nthat ended up killing tens of thousands of cattle out on the eastern \nplains.\n  We have not had a disaster program that has been an effective \ndisaster program for rural America. We were able to come up with a good \ndisaster program that was included in the farm bill here in the Senate. \nI am hopeful that disaster program is something we can come around on \nin a bipartisan fashion to support and get across the finish line.\n  Let me conclude by saying to my colleagues we cannot afford to wait. \nNot passing a 2007 farm bill as a Congress is not an option. We cannot \nfail at this. For my time as attorney general of my State and a Member \nof the Senate, I have always had in my office a sign that says: No \nfarms, no food. It is important for the people of this country to \nunderstand we have the least expensive, most secure food supply of \nanyone in the world today. If my friend, Kent Conrad, were here and had \none of his great charts, one of the things he would point to is we pay \na lot less for food today than we did during the days of the Great \nDepression in the 1940s and 1950s. Only about 10 percent of our \ndisposable income actually is spent on the food we consume as opposed \nto 20 and 30 and 50 percent in other countries. So it is important for \nus to maintain that food security for the American people.\n  I hope the House of Representatives and those in the House of \nRepresentatives who care about the food and energy security of our \ncountry will help us to get to conclusion on this very important \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the matter that we have to lay down as a \nsubstitute is done. The staff is reading it over. They found a couple \nmistakes. It happens on a bill this big, an amendment this big. So \nrather than have more time spent tonight treading water, we are going \nto lay this amendment down in the morning. We are going to come in at \n9:30. Senators Dodd and Shelby have a very important banking hearing. \nIt has been scheduled for quite some time. But Senator Durbin has \nagreed to manage the bill for Senator Dodd, and the Republicans will \nhave someone here also. It is my understanding, after initial \nstatements are made on the bill, we are going to go back and forth on \namendments. Senator Durbin will lay down an amendment. That will be our \nfirst one--not a lot of time on that. Our second amendment would be \nwith Senators Schumer and Murray. The third amendment will be Senator \nFeinstein. It is a bipartisan amendment. I believe it is Senator \nMartinez.\n  As I indicated to staff, of course, following the first Democratic \namendment, there will be a Republican amendment, if there is one. \nFollowing the second Democratic amendment, there will be a Republican \namendment. We will try to move through this as expeditiously and as \nwell intentioned as we can. The progress that has been made in the last \n24 hours is very significant. We have a piece of legislation that now \nhas very important FHA modernization in it. It is not what everyone \nwants, but it is a good piece of legislation.\n  Senators Dodd and Shelby have agreed the limit would be $550,000. \nThere would be a 3.5 percent downpayment. There are other things in it \nthat banking minds can describe better than I.\n  There is the CDBG funds to assist communities devastated by \nforeclosures. That would be $4 billion. We would provide preforeclosure \ncounseling for families in need. In the underlying bill, the so-called \nReid amendment, we had $200 million. That has been reduced to $100 \nmillion. There will be efforts made to increase that. As I understand, \nthat is what Senators Schumer and Murray intend to do. We have a \ncombination of pieces of legislation that have been put together in one \namendment. It is bipartisan. It started with the Jack Reed disclosure \ntransparency legislation, and others had ideas on how to improve that. \nThat is what Senators Dodd and Shelby have done.\n  It lengthens the time a lender must wait before starting foreclosure \non a servicemember by some 3 months, which is important during this \ntime of Iraq and Afghanistan. It raises the loan guarantee amount for \nVA-backed loans in high-cost areas. There is a standard property tax \ndeduction; of course, what the President called for in his State of the \nUnion Address, the mortgage revenue bonds to purchase used or \nforeclosed-upon homes; the extension of net operating loss carryback, \nextremely important to homebuilders. There is a tax credit for the \npurchase of homes in foreclosure. This is the Isakson amendment that \nhas been talked about for several weeks now. The two managers of the \nlegislation have modified the original Isakson proposal to have $3,500 \nfor 2 years in succession, a total of $7,000. It will be for buyers of \nforeclosed homes.\n  This is the package. It would be great if the Presiding Officer and I \nand Senator Salazar could just say: OK, this is done. This is great, \nbecause it is bipartisan. Let's go home tonight, having done this. We \ncan't do that. That is\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\nthe way the legislation is. But I think it is a tremendously important \nbipartisan package that we have. I commend and applaud the work to this \npoint of Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby. They have done very good \nwork. Their staffs worked most all night. And, of course, they have \nworked all day. Senators Shelby and Dodd were on the telephone last \nnight at midnight trying to work things out. So I appreciate their \ngood, hard work. They have been long-time legislators. As I mentioned, \nwhen Senator McConnell and I suggested they come up with a bipartisan \npackage, they are experienced legislators. They both had extensive \nservice in the House of Representatives before coming here. I feel we \nare in a good spot to be able to deliver a package that will go toward \nhelping Main Street. We helped Wall Street.\n  We are all glad Bear Stearns was taken care of. But now it is our \nopportunity to take care of people on Main Street. They deserve that. I \nam convinced it would be the right thing to do.\n  As I indicated, we are going to come in at 9:30 tomorrow. I hope this \ngives everyone an outline of the legislation. I apologize, as I have to \ndo often, that we were not doing more proactive stuff on the floor, but \nevery minute that we were on the floor in the quorum calls or people \ngiving speeches on what they thought should be done with housing or \nother issues, the staffs and Senators Dodd and Shelby were working very \nhard to get us to the point where we are tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2337-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak about \nthe situation in Tibet, which has captured the world's attention in \nrecent days and weeks.\n  For those of us who have visited Tibet, as I did in 1988, and for \nmillions of people here and abroad, the press reports of Chinese police \nofficers arresting and beating Tibetan protesters, and of Tibetans \ndestroying the property of Han Chinese, are deplorable.\n  Estimates of the number of protesters killed have ranged from 13 to \n140, and more than 1,000 arrested. Knowing the way Tibetans have been \ntortured and mistreated in Chinese prisons, we should be very concerned \nwith the welfare of those in custody.\n  More than a dozen Han Chinese were reportedly killed and their \nbusinesses ransacked and burned. Violent attacks against civilians and \ntheir property cannot be justified, even when they may be prompted by \nlongstanding, legitimate grievances.\n  For many years, the Chinese Government has been systematically \nimplementing a strategy to destroy Tibetan culture and solidify its \ncontrol of Tibet.\n  A flood of Han Chinese into Tibet has fueled an economic boom, but \nthis has also exacerbated tensions between Chinese business owners and \nthe Tibetans who have become increasingly marginalized and \ndiscriminated against in their own homeland.\n  When first asked about the recent violence, Chinese authorities in \nBeijing and Lhasa insisted that only a handful of agitators were \ninvolved and there was no cause for concern.\n  Then, as photographs were posted on the internet of Tibetans being \nchased and beaten bloody by baton-wielding, helmeted riot police, the \nChinese Government blocked access for journalists and blamed the Dalai \nLama for instigating the violence to sabotage the Beijing Olympics.\n  Many of us have had the privilege of meeting the Dalai Lama. I \nconsider him a friend, and last week I spoke by telephone with one of \nhis advisors, Lodi Ghari, who was in India at the time. It is \noutrageous to suggest that the Dalai Lama has encouraged violence in \nTibet.\n  For decades, the Dalai Lama has shown remarkable tolerance and \npatience as he has sought a peaceful resolution of the conflict over \nTibet's political status. He has repeatedly extended a hand of \nfriendship to the Chinese Government, which has consistently responded \nby denigrating and misrepresenting the Dalai Lama's views.\n  I would like to hope that this latest outbreak of violence will cause \nthe Chinese Government to recognize that a strategy of repression in \nTibet will only provoke further tensions and violence. Brute force is \nnot a solution. Ethnic cleansing is not a solution.\n  Several things should be done immediately.\n  The Chinese Government should distinguish between peaceful protestors \nand rioters, and reaffirm that it will uphold the Chinese \nConstitution's protections of free speech and association.\n  It should end its lockdown on Tibetan areas, including allowing full \naccess by the media, and account for those who are missing and dead \nfrom the protests.\n  There should be a full accounting of each Tibetan who has been \narrested or charged with a crime, including names, charges if any, and \nthe location where they are being detained. The International Red Cross \nshould have access to monitor their treatment.\n  The only way to resolve this conflict is through dialogue conducted \nin good faith. It is long past time for Chinese authorities to \nrecognize that it has nothing to fear from the Tibetan people if they \nrespect the Tibetans' cultural identity.\n  There has been much talk and speculation about what these events \ncould mean for the Beijing Olympics.\n  I am not among those who believe the Olympic Games should be a \npolitical issue. The Olympics should be about the athletes, not about \ngovernments.\n  If some countries boycott these Olympics for one reason, other \ncountries will feel justified in boycotting other Olympics for \ndifferent reasons. The future of the Olympic Games would be in \njeopardy.\n  That said, the Chinese Government obviously sees the Olympics as an \nopportunity to showcase China as a modern, harmonious country. The \nChinese Government's actions in Tibet, and its continuing crackdown on \ndissidents who call for more political freedom, starkly contradict this \nimage.\n  Apparently, neither the Olympic Committee nor the White House \nimpressed upon the Chinese authorities that if the Olympics were to be \na success, there needs to be a marked improvement in China's respect \nfor human rights. That message should be conveyed clearly, vigorously, \nand immediately. It is not acceptable for President Bush to simply say \nhe plans to attend the Olympics as a ``sports fan.''\n\n  I have long criticized the Chinese Government's violations of human \nrights.\n  Its detention and trial on trumped up charges of dissidents who dare \nto criticize official corruption and repression.\n  Its use of excessive force in Tibet.\n  Its support for the Government of Sudan, even while that government \nwas committing genocide in Darfur.\n  Its torture of prisoners and summary executions after unfair trials.\n  I, with former Senator Jeffords, and then Representative Sanders, \nworked for 6 years to secure the release from a Chinese prison of \nNgawang Choepel, a young Tibetan whose only crime was to use a video \ncamera to record Tibetan music and dance. He posed no threat to China's \nsecurity. His arrest, his trial, and his imprisonment were a travesty.\n  Just last week, China convicted a human rights activist named Hu Jia \nof ``inciting subversion'' through his writings on the internet. His \ncrime was to advocate for better protection for people with AIDS, for \nmore religious freedom, and for increased autonomy for Tibet.\n  His case is another reminder that when it comes to human rights, \nlittle has changed in China. The Chinese Government insists that China \nis a country of laws and that his case was dealt with according to the \nlaw. That is reminiscent of those who once defended slavery because it \nwas lawful at the time. As long as the Chinese Government criminalizes \nspeech, it will face the criticism of the international community.\n  Criticizing the Chinese Government is not the same as isolating \nChina, which I have never believed is an option. I have visited China \nseveral times and have always favored more engagement with China. We \nshould be encouraging closer relations.\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n  I have worked to increase funding for professional, educational, and \ncultural exchanges, and for programs focusing on environmental \nprotection and the rule of law. I have seen the benefits to American \nand Chinese students who participate in these programs, including from \nthe Vermont Law School.\n  China has an extraordinary history and culture. Its people have \nsuffered many hardships, including devastating wars and famines. Many \nstill toil from dawn until dusk to survive, but China has made \nextraordinary progress in the 30 years since my first trip there.\n  The Chinese people want the best for their families and their \ncountry, as Americans do. They also want a government that is less \ncorrupt and more open and accountable.\n  China wants to be treated like a great power, but the Chinese \nGovernment cannot expect to be respected as a world leader just because \nof China's large population and its economic and military prowess. Not \nas long as it crushes peaceful dissent and, in Tibet, destroys the \nculture of a unique people who are admired throughout the world.\n  Other governments of countries where Tibetans have rallied peacefully \nin support of those back home should also stop the arrests and \ndetentions and use of excessive force.\n  This is particularly so in Nepal, where not long ago tens of \nthousands of Nepalese people took to the streets in demonstrations \nwhich led to the restoration of multi-party government. Those who are \nin power in Nepal today, because of the people's brave defiance of a \ncorrupt, abusive king, should be respecting the Tibetans' rights of \nassembly, of association and expression.\n  Speaker Pelosi, who visited the Dalai Lama recently, said it well \nwhen she called the crisis in Tibet a matter of conscience for the \nworld.\n  But just as I believe our collective conscience must be steadfast in \nsupport of the Tibetan people and their spiritual leader, so should we \nreaffirm that we recognize this is a conflict the Chinese and Tibetans \nmust solve themselves.\n  I believe a solution is possible that meets the needs and aspirations \nof both peoples. But after 6 years of talks that have achieved nothing, \nit is clear that a new approach is needed. Repression is not the \nanswer. Confrontation is not the answer.\n  There are creative, visionary people on both sides who can learn from \nthese events and pursue a new way forward. Those of us half a world \naway who care about Tibet and China should encourage that.\n  Unfortunately, rather than reach out directly to the Dalai Lama, the \nChinese authorities are already tightening their control of Tibet. \nApparently they have concluded that the lesson of this latest uprising \nis to increase the repression and claim that everything is back to \nnormal.\n  Their idea of what is ``normal'' in Tibet is not the answer. If that \nis the path they take, it is only a matter of time before the next \neruption of violence. And in the meantime, China will further \njeopardize the Olympics and do more damage to its international \nreputation.\n  Nobody wants that. We want closer, cooperative relations with China.\n  Mr. President, let us hope that years from now, the 29th Summer \nOlympic Games will be remembered not for the violent images of recent \nweeks, and not for a hardening of positions, but as the catalyst for a \nnew political dialogue that brought about a lasting agreement on \nTibet's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2338-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2338-S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IRAQI REFUGEES RESETTLE IN VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at a time when we are all concerned with \nthe fate of Iraqi refugees and the need to help as many of them as \npossible resettle in safe havens, I ask unanimous consent that a March \n24, 2008, article in the Brattleboro Reformer entitled ``Difficult \nChoices: Son's Birth Deepens Couple's Concern Over Future,'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  This article illustrates what Vermonters are doing to help two Iraqi \nrefugees, Revan Hedo and Aseel Pola, who recently gave birth to \nBrattleboro, Vermont's first Iraqi-American citizen, Matthew. As \nVermonters and other Americans open their hearts, their homes, and \ntheir wallets to try to alleviate the suffering of Iraqis who have been \nforced to flee their homeland to escape the violence, it is an \nimportant reminder that no matter how one may feel about this war, \nthere is a humanitarian dimension that requires everyone's attention. I \nam proud that Vermonters are doing their part.\n  We all hope that some day Iraq will be safe enough for those who want \nto return home to do so. But there are some 2 million Iraqi refugees \nstranded in Jordan, Syria, and other countries, and millions more \ndisplaced inside Iraq. Only a tiny fraction of those who need and \ndeserve our help have received U.S. visas. This is unconscionable. I \nurge the White House to expedite the processing for resettlement of \nIraqis whose lives are threatened because they had the courage to serve \nas translators, drivers, and provide other services to the United \nStates. These people risked their lives for us, and they have every \nreason to expect that we will not abandon them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Reformer, Mar. 24, 2008.]\n\n  Difficult Choices--Son's Birth Deepens Couple's Concern Over Future\n\n                            (By Bob Audette)\n\n       Brattleboro.--One year ago today, Iraqi natives Revan Hedo \n     and Aseel Pola were married in their home country.\n       Ten days ago, Aseel gave birth to a baby boy, Matthew, the \n     first Iraqi-American born in Brattleboro. His birth heralded \n     a new chapter in the lives of Hedo and Pola, a Catholic \n     couple with family in Iraq but no safe home to return to.\n       While Matthew is guaranteed a life in the United States by \n     right of his birth, his parents may one day have to return to \n     the Middle East--with or without their son--when their visas \n     expire.\n       ``My son is a U.S. citizen,'' said Hedo, proudly.\n       Hedo, now 29, first came to the United States in 2004 on a \n     Fulbright scholarship with which he earned a master's degree \n     in comparative literature and simultaneous translation from \n     the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. He returned to \n     Iraq in 2006 and married Pola. In August 2007, he and his new \n     wife returned to the states, so he could earn a master's in \n     the Art of Education at the School for International Training \n     Graduate Institute.\n       As an Iraqi, he served as an interpreter for U.S. forces, \n     translating for high-ranking officials such as L. Paul \n     Bremer, Gen. John Abizaid and England Foreign Secretary Jack \n     Straw. One reason for renewing his visa was because living in \n     Iraq had become too dangerous for him and his new wife.\n       ``My life was in jeopardy,'' he said. ``Everyone knew I had \n     been to the United States and had been working for U.S. \n     military forces.''\n       Francis Bailey, an associate professor at UMass, who \n     befriended Hedo during his two years in Amherst, offered the \n     couple a place to live rent free. Bailey was teaching at SIT \n     and offered to sponsor the couple's stay in the United \n     States.\n       ``I was frustrated with the decision to invade Iraq,'' said \n     Bailey. Giving Hedo and Pola a place to live was ``an \n     opportunity to make an individual difference,'' said Bailey. \n     ``This was my choice.''\n       Because of the danger to him, his wife and their new son, \n     returning to Iraq is out of the question, but barring some \n     miracle, they can't legally remain in the United States after \n     their visas expire. Even having a son with American \n     citizenship doesn't guarantee the couple can stay here.\n       Financially, things have also been difficult for the \n     couple.\n       Pola, a microbiologist, doesn't work, and Hedo's visa only \n     allows him to work 10 hours a week in SIT's library, not \n     nearly enough money to pay for the daily necessities, never \n     mind the bill at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital for the birth \n     of their son. While Hedo has insurance through SIT, Pola has \n     no coverage.\n       The congregation at St. Michael's Catholic Church on Walnut \n     Street has been essential in helping the couple keep their \n     heads above water as has the international community on the \n     campus of SIT.\n       ``Our friends at SIT showed us the spirit of diversity, the \n     respect of other cultures and hospitality,'' said Hedo, \n     adding, ``The neighbors are wonderful. They've really \n     supported us, especially emotionally.''\n       ``The town is very nice and beautiful,'' said Pola. \n     ``People are really friendly.''\n       Her biggest hope for her son is that he grows up in a \n     family with both a mother and a father. Pola's father spent \n     several years as a prisoner of war during the Iraq-Iran War \n     of the 1980s. In 2001, when she was 19, he was shot dead on \n     his front steps by minions of Saddam Hussein.\n       One day, they hope to return to Iraq, but right now they \n     consider their trip to the United States ``a one-way \n     ticket,'' said Hedo. ``We can't go back.''\n       ``We want to be able to live in peace (in Iraq),'' he said, \n     ``To be respected no matter what our beliefs are. We would \n     love to live in an environment with a lot of tolerance, just \n     like Brattleboro.''\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\n       Pola has two simple wishes.\n       ``I want to hear that my family is living in peace, not in \n     war, worried all the time, and to have the hope of seeing \n     them.''\n       Hedo and Pola have also received support from their \n     friends, Noah and Natalie Baker Merrill.\n       ``It's very important in these times for Americans to get \n     to know Iraqis and see them as their neighbors,'' said Noah \n     Baker Merrill, a founder of Direct Aid International, which \n     helps Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan.\n       Baker Merrill and his wife met Hedo and Pola through SIT, \n     where Natalie is a student advocate.\n       The United States has done a disgraceful job in helping the \n     refugees, said Baker Merrill, accepting only 1,800 of the 2 \n     to 2.5 million who have fled Iraq.\n       Nearly 100,000 Iraqis have been allowed to settle in \n     Sweden, but the majority live in refugee camps in Jordan and \n     Syria. Resettlement in a different country is not the answer, \n     said Baker Merrill. Making Iraq a safe country that Iraqis \n     can return to is the answer.\n       ``The overwhelming majority just desperately want to be \n     able to go home.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2339-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice of support for \nthe first-ever World Autism Awareness Day, a day that is sorely needed. \nIn 2006 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimated \nthat 1 in 166 children were diagnosed with autism. Today the CDC \nestimates that number to be 1 in 150. In fact, 67 children are \ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder per day; a new case is \ndiagnosed almost every 20 minutes.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have had the opportunity to spend time \nwith children with autism and their families, from Connecticut and \naround the Nation. Autism is a complex neurological disorder, which \nmanifests itself differently in each individual but occurs in all \nracial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups. It is a lifelong condition \nthat affects not only the individual with the disability, but impacts \nthe entire family, often requiring intensive levels of support and \nintervention.\n  There are so many unanswered questions about autism. The first step \nin answering them is for us to come together as a society and recognize \nthe many challenges autism presents in the U.S. and throughout the \nworld. It is my hope that today everyone will take a moment to consider \nautism and the millions of individuals and families struggling with \nthis developmental disability.\n  We should also make note of the great work and sacrifice of families \naffected by autism and the tireless advocates for autism research and \ntreatment who have worked to make this day a reality. Among them I want \nto particularly note my friends Bob and Suzanne Wright who have worked \nwith me for years to address the needs of those dealing with autism. \nBut there is still more to be done.\n  At a time when the number of children and families living with autism \nhas grown exponentially, it is important that we recognize the need to \nexpand our federal commitment to combating this disease. Autism is the \nfastest growing developmental disability in the United States, yet we \nare not committing enough of our federal resources to developing the \ntype of scientific breakthroughs in autism that are needed. It is time \nto redouble our efforts and help the thousands of families who are \nraising children with autism.\n  Among the first major steps in the Federal response to autism was in \n2006 when Congress unanimously passed the Combating Autism Act, which \nmy former colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Rick Santorum and I \nauthored along with the strong support of many of our colleagues \nincluding Senators Kennedy and Enzi. This initiative represents the \nlargest federal expansion of funding and programs for children and \nfamilies with autism spectrum disorder.\n  We took another major step recently on the Senate floor with the \nunanimous passage of an amendment Senator Susan Collins and I offered \nto the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution that would double funding for \nprograms dealing with autism at the CDC, the National Institutes of \nHealth, and other health agencies. It is my hope that my colleagues \nwill keep this momentum going by making sure this funding finds its way \ninto the final budget resolution conference report and then through the \nappropriations process. The research these funds would support will \nhelp us understand more about the causes of and appropriate treatments \nand services for autism.\n  We should close no doors on promising avenues of research into the \ncauses of autism. The Combating Autism Act and my recent amendment to \nthe budget resolution allow all biomedical research opportunities on \nautism to be pursued. In fact, just today a new study of toddlers finds \nthat there may be a link between babies born very prematurely and \nautism. As the author of the PREEMIE Act, along with my colleague \nSenator Lamar Alexander, I find this news particularly interesting. I \nlook forward to the upcoming Surgeon General's Conference in June which \nwas called for under the PREEMIE Act as an opportunity to further \npursue this possible link between extreme prematurity and autism.\n  As we look to the future, we also need to find new and innovative \nways to help parents and loved ones care for family members suffering \nfrom autism. That is why I have introduced S. 2741, The Disability \nSavings Act of 2008. This bill will encourage individuals with \ndisabilities and their families to save money for their unique needs in \ntax-advantaged disability savings accounts. This money could then be \ndrawn out as needed, to pay for services and care that are needed.\n  Today, on World Autism Awareness Day, I hope we in the Senate can \nmake finding a cure for autism a top priority of the Congress and the \nNation. Together, we can make life a little better for those with \nautism and their loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2339-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN HONOR OF BOB VALEU\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on May 1, 2008, Bob Valeu ends his service \nto the U.S. Senate.\n  For 16 years, Bob Valeu has done an outstanding job as the director \nof my North Dakota Senate offices. His passion for public policy, his \ndedication to our State and country, and his commitment to excellence \nhave been a hallmark of his service these past years.\n  Those of us who serve as Senators get attention for the work we do. \nBut we understand that very often that attention and our \naccomplishments are a result of some very talented and dedicated staff \nwho work with us to advance the interests of our State and our country. \nThat is certainly the case with Bob Valeu's service to me and to the \nSenate.\n  Whenever an event ended, the lights were turned down, the microphone \nwas turned off, and I had moved on to another event, Bob Valeu was \nusually still there solving problems and working with people to address \ntheir needs. He was that kind of State director--the type every Senator \naspires to have.\n  Bob and I have traveled tens of thousands of miles together to every \nnook and cranny of our State. We have been to every kind of event \nimaginable: high school convocations, Main Street tours, ribbon \ncuttings, university commencements, lutefisk dinners, State fairs, \nkaraoke competitions, and chili cookoffs. But beyond all of that--and \neven more importantly--Bob Valeu had provided wise counsel and advice \nover the years. And I know that even as he leaves my official staff, he \nwill continue to be a valuable advisor and a good friend.\n  So I want to use this opportunity to publicly thank my friend and a \nvery dedicated American with whom I have been privileged to serve these \npast 16 years.\n  To Bob and his wife Marge and their entire family, on behalf of the \nSenate, I tell you that our country is a better place because of your \nservice. And this Senator is deeply appreciative of the many years of \nexcellence you dedicated to the best interests of our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2339-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2339-S2340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF DITH PRAN\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nextraordinary life of Dith Pran, who risked his life to expose the \nterrors of the Khmer Rouge regime in his native Cambodia, and who later \nbecame the subject of the Oscar award-winning film, ``The Killing \nFields.'' Mr. Dith died March 30, 2008, in New Jersey, surrounded by \nrelatives and friends. He\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\nwas a defender of human rights, a journalist, a teacher, and a hero.\n  As many fled Cambodia during the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer \nRouge in 1975, Mr. Dith sent his wife and children to safety abroad but \nstayed behind with investigative journalist Sydney H. Schanberg to help \nensure that news of the events there reached the outside world. He \nbelieved his country and people could only be saved from the Khmer \nRouge if individuals in other countries understood the tragedy \ngathering in his homeland.\n  Amidst the crisis spreading throughout Southeast Asia in the years \nfollowing the Vietnam war--a crisis my father, Charles Whitehouse, also \nsaw firsthand through his work as U.S. Ambassador to Laos and Thailand \nin the 1970s--Dith Pran was a witness to, and a fierce critic of, the \ngreatest atrocities men have inflicted upon their fellow men.\n  Against all odds, Mr. Dith survived the Cambodian genocide in which 2 \nmillion Cambodians, one-third of the population, were killed. Most of \nhis extended family were also killed. He suffered through 4 years of \nhard labor, living on just one teaspoon of rice a day and whatever \nanimals and insects he could find. Mr. Dith finally escaped from a \ncommune and travelled 40 miles to the Thai border through what he \ncoined ``the killing fields,'' past the bodies of those killed by the \nKhmer Rouge, before reaching safety.\n  After reaching the United States, Mr. Dith became a photojournalist \nfor the New York Times. He founded the Dith Pran Holocaust Awareness \nProject to educate individuals around the world of the horrors he \nsurvived in order to prevent future genocides. He was appointed a \nUnited Nations Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees in 1985.\n  For his efforts to educate the world, Mr. Dith was awarded the Ellis \nIsland Medal of Honor in 1998. He also received the Award of Excellence \nfrom the International Center in New York.\n  Dith Pran said: ``Part of my life is saving life. I don't consider \nmyself a politician or a hero. I'm a messenger. If Cambodia is to \nsurvive, she needs many voices.'' Dith Pran has been a powerful and \ncompelling voice for his countrymen and the land he loved. His \nwillingness to share his story brought light to dark places and hope to \nmillions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2340-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THURMAN ADAMS, JR.\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the \nHonorable Thurman G. Adams, Jr., Delaware's longest serving State \nSenator.\n  Senator Adams was first elected to Delaware's 19th senatorial \ndistrict in Sussex County in 1972. He served as senate majority leader \nfrom 1999 to 2003, when he was elected President Pro Tempore of the \nsenate by his colleagues.\n  When I was Governor of Delaware, I worked closely with Thurman on \nmany issues. He serves as chairman of the Senate Executive Committee, \nwhich considers gubernatorial and judicial appointments. Thurman has a \nkeen understanding of the important role Delaware plays as a worldwide \ncorporate center and has been a consistent champion of Delaware's \njudiciary. Thurman has also been a strong advocate of public safety \nissues, sponsoring legislation to establish Delaware's ``Enhanced 911'' \nemergency telephone system. As owner and president of his own feed and \ngrain agribusiness, T.G. Adams, and Son, Inc., Thurman has worked for \nthe interests of Delaware's farming and business communities. He is a \nleader in such issues as highway and local roadway improvements, \neducation accountability, and the growth of Delaware Technical and \nCommunity College's Owens Campus in Georgetown.\n  Thurman has a long history of civic and community service. Prior to \nbeing elected to public office, he served as chairman of the Governor's \nHighway Safety Committee and a member of the Delaware State Highway \nCommission. Active in his community, he has held such positions as \ndirector of Milford Memorial Hospital and the Medical Center of \nDelaware, director of the Baltimore Trust Company for 27 years, \npresident of Harrington Raceway, chairman of the Union United Methodist \nChurch Administrative Board, and president of the Eastern Shore Grain \nDealers Association.\n  The recipient of awards too numerous to list, Thurman was most \nrecently awarded the Liberty Bell Award, presented by the Delaware \nState Bar Association in recognition of significant contributions to \nthe community by a nonattorney, and the Silver Good Citizenship Award \nof the Delaware Chapter of the National Society of the Sons of the \nAmerican Revolution. He also received the University of Delaware's \nMedal of Fame Distinction and the ``Wall of Fame'' Award.\n  As his record shows, Senator Adams has a strong commitment to the \nState of Delaware. Born and raised in Bridgeville, he attended \nBridgeville High and later graduated from the University of Delaware. \nHe returned to Bridgeville where he built a successful business and \nraised his family. Thurman was a devoted husband to his wife Hilda, to \nwhom he was married to for nearly 50 years. Senator and Mrs. Adams \nraised three wonderful children whom any parent would be proud to call \ntheir own. No stranger to tragedy, Thurman lost his beloved wife to \ncancer in 2002 several years after the death of their son Brent. \nDespite these heartbreaks, Senator Adams remains devoted to his \nchildren, seven grandsons and three great-grandchildren.\n  I have known Thurman Adams for many years. On a personal note, I \nremember fondly stopping by their summer home for lunch following the \nannual Fourth of July parade in Bethany Beach and enjoying immensely \nfood and fellowship with him and his family. I can also attest to his \nexpert egg-tossing skill, having been at the receiving end of his \nsmoothly delivered toss at the Delaware State Fair Governor's Day \ncelebration. We have enjoyed many times together both personally and \nprofessionally, and we have shared times of deep sorrow, as well.\n  I am proud to congratulate my longtime friend and colleague on \nreaching this impressive milestone. The people of Delaware, and \nespecially residents of the 19th District, are certainly well-served \nand fortunate to have been represented by such a man as Thurman Adams. \nDelaware is a far better place in which to live and work because of his \nstewardship and his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2340-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ALBERT W.

He currently serves as president of the Southwest Colorado \nMental Health Board of Directors, and is a member of both the La Plata \nHealth Care Project Steering Committee and the Regional Juvenile Center \nTask Force. Al's involvement in these and other community organizations \nspeaks to his generosity, selflessness, and his love for the southwest \nColorado community.\n  In short, southwest Colorado has benefitted tremendously because Al \nBell chose a path of public service. He has set an example for all \nAmericans to live by. While I am sorry to see him go, I know that he \nhas very much earned a healthy and happy retirement.\n  On behalf of the people of Colorado, I thank Al for his service, and \nwish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2341-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n                  RECOGNIZING JOHNNY'S SELECTED SEEDS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize an extraordinary \nbusiness from my home State of Maine, Johnny's Selected Seeds. A mail-\norder seed producer and seller from Kennebec County, Johnny's Selected \nSeeds recently garnered the U.S. Small Business Administration's \nEntrepreneurial Success Award. But what is most gratifying about the \nrecognition for Johnny's is that the company won the award on the \ndistrict, regional, and national levels.\n  Chairman Rob Johnston, Jr. founded Johnny's Selected Seeds in 1973 at \nthe age of 22. With only $500 in his savings account, but with a deep \nappreciation for and knowledge of agriculture, Mr. Johnston began his \nventure in the attic of a farmhouse before finally settling in Albion, \nME, in 1975. As Johnny's grew, so did demand for its product, largely \ndue to the firm's easy-to-use and straightforward catalog with detailed \ndescriptions of available seeds and handy growing information, as well \nas the company's production of various vintage heirloom seeds. Johnny's \nmoved its headquarters to Winslow, ME in 2002 and later opened a \ncatalog store in the same town. The employee-owned company continues to \nmaintain its property in Albion as a working farm and research facility \nwhile offering seed enthusiasts and curious visitors self-guided farm \ntours throughout the summer months.\n  Johnny's employees take seriously their pledge to provide their \ncustomers with tools, seeds, plants, and supplies of the utmost \nquality. The company's minimum germination standards are well above \nthose required by law, and Johnny's goes to great lengths to ensure \nthat commercial varieties are free of certain viruses and diseases. \nJohnny's also offers various organic seeds, and since 1999, has adhered \nto the principles of the Safe Seed Pledge, signaling that the company \ndoes not ``. . . knowingly buy or sell genetically engineered seeds or \nplants.'' Additionally, in an effort to stay on the cutting edge, \nJohnny's takes great pride in the research it does to maintain its \ninnovative reputation. In particular, the firm focuses on developing \nnew seed varieties, as well as leading the way in quality control.\n  Johnny's Selected Seeds has truly made a name for itself through its \noutstanding achievements and reliable service. But the company has also \nmaintained a loyal customer base because of the basics. Johnny's vends \na wide array of seeds, tools, and supplies to both home gardeners and \nsmall commercial growers. Offering a vast selection of vegetable seeds, \nfrom artichokes to watermelons, Johnny's also sells fruit seeds, herb \nseeds, and an impressive collection of flower seeds. Continually \nupdating its stock, Johnny's adds new seeds to its list each year, and \n2008 is no exception. Some of the dozens of new products available \nrange from colorful spring flowers to different corns, cantaloupes, and \ngreens. And for convenience, home growers can order a small packet of \n25 seeds, and larger growers can often request up to 10,000 or 25,000 \nseeds, depending on the product.\n  A truly entrepreneurial business, Johnny's Selected Seeds constantly \nseeks new ways to grow, improve, and impress. It has, without a doubt, \nearned its latest accolades handily. To succeed as superlatively as \nJohnny's does speaks volumes about the resolve and passion of Mr. \nJohnston, but it is also a testament to the hard work and dedication of \nthe company's over 80 full-time and 50 seasonal employees. I \ncongratulate Johnny's Selected Seeds for earning the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration's Entrepreneurial Success Award at all levels \nand for the example it sets for small businesses everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2341-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. Penland had been an advocate for coastal protection and \nrestoration in Louisiana and spoke passionately about how coastal \nwetlands and barrier islands functioned as natural storm surge barriers \nduring hurricanes and tropical storms.\n  Several years ago I sponsored and passed a bill to bring together a \nnumber of individuals and entities to coordinate efforts to clean up \nLake Pontchartrain and promote the restoration of the Lake \nPontchartrain Basin. Dr. Penland took a leadership role in this effort \nby helping to bring the university community together to prioritize and \ncoordinate their research activities. The program has been very \nsuccessful over the last several years, and Dr. Penland deserves a \ngreat deal of credit for helping to achieve that success.\n  Dr. Penland's passing is a great loss to the State of Louisiana, and \nWendy and I send our thoughts and prayers out to his family, friends, \nand coworkers. I am positive that Dr. Penland's work will continue to \nbenefit Louisiana and coastal regions throughout the United States for \nyears to come.\n  Thus, today, I am proud to honor a fellow Louisianan, Dr. Shea \nPenland, and thank him for his dedicated and tireless service to our \nState and country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2341-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL ROBERT CREAR\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the \nretirement of BG Robert Crear from his distinguished career in the Army \nCorps of Engineers. I would like to take some time to make a few \nremarks on his accomplishments and contributions to Louisiana and the \nUnited States.\n  In 1975 he graduated from Jackson State University, where he received \na bachelor's degree in mathematics and a Regular Army commission as a \nsecond lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers. He holds a master's degree \nin national resource strategy from the Industrial College of the Armed \nForces and has held various other command and staff positions in the \nUnited States and overseas, including Commander for the Corps' \nSouthwest Division and Chief of Staff for the U.S. Corps' Headquarters \nhere in Washington, DC. During Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom, General Crear served as commander, Task Force Restore Iraqi \nOil, which safely and effectively helped to ensure the economic \nrecovery of Iraq.\n  In June of 2004, General Crear assumed command of the Mississippi \nValley Division. As MVD commander, he is responsible for a $1 billion \ncivil works program. He also played a vital role in managing the Corps' \nwater resources program in the Mississippi River Valley. As a member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nthe Mississippi River Commission, I helped approve General Crear's \nnomination as President and Commissioner of MRC. After the devastation \nof Hurricane Katrina, General Crear created Task Force Hope, a program \ndedicated to the restoration and rebuilding efforts in New Orleans and \nsoutheast Louisiana. It is among the largest disaster recovery \noperations in the history of the Corps of Engineers.\n  I am honored to have worked closely with General Crear. His devotion \nto the rebuilding and recovery efforts of the gulf coast region is a \ntestament to his leadership and commitment. Louisiana and the gulf \ncoast are forever grateful for his dedication and tireless effort.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate him on his retirement and \nexemplary service to our state and the country. I hope he enjoys his \nwell deserved retirement and wish him well in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2341-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2341-S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BRINGING TEAM USA SUCCESS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Tara Bounds \nand Phyllis Mitchell, a mother-daughter team that fought adversity and \nbrought home a Gold and Bronze Medal from the 2007 World Games Special \nOlympics in Shanghai, China. I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss their tireless efforts to bring Team USA success.\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n  Tara Bounds, a 25-year-old Ball, LA, resident, was diagnosed with \nDown's syndrome at birth. She began competing in the Special Olympics \nat age 8. However, it is only by miracle that Tara could even compete \nathletically. She also has a congenital heart defect and needed two \nsurgeries before the age of 5 in order to live. Phyllis Mitchell \ncoached Bounds along to help her win the Gold Medal in the softball \nthrow and the Bronze Medal in the 50-meter run.\n  The World Games were held from October 2 to October 11, 2007, with \nover 7,000 athletes participating from 110 countries. Tara persevered \npast three competitions: the area competition, the State competition in \nHammond, LA, and the national competition in Iowa. In order to \ncontinue, you must win at least one Gold Medal in the State and \nnational competition. However, Tara almost did not make it due to \nmonetary reasons, but she held fundraisers, and the people of Louisiana \nchipped in to send her to the World Olympics.\n  In order to practice, Tara ran at two local high schools, Pineville \nand Tioga. She also set up a target in her back yard to prepare for the \nsoftball toss. Tara ended up with a distance of 16.94 meters to win \ngold in the softball toss and ran the 50-meter run in 11.68 seconds to \nwin bronze.\n  Tara continues to strive for excellence and hopes to participate in \nthe 2011 Special Olympics in Athens, Greece. We should all aspire to \nfollow her example. Today, I congratulate Tara Bounds and Phyllis \nMitchell for their victory, and I wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2342-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2342-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2342-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               2008 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY--PM 42\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the 2008 National Drug Control Strategy, \nconsistent with the provisions of section 201 of the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006.\n  My Administration published its first National Drug Control Strategy \nin 2002, inspired by a great moral imperative: we must reduce illegal \ndrug use because, over time, drugs rob men, women, and children of \ntheir dignity and of their character. Thanks to bipartisan support in \nthe Congress; the work of Federal, State, local, and tribal officials; \nand the efforts of ordinary citizens, 6 years later fewer Americans \nknow the sorrow of addiction.\n  We have learned much about the nature of drug use and drug markets, \nand have demonstrated what can be achieved with a balanced strategy \nthat puts resources where they are needed most. Prevention programs are \nreaching Americans in their communities, schools, workplaces, and \nthrough the media, contributing to a 24 percent decline in youth drug \nuse since 2001. Today, approximately 860,000 fewer young people are \nusing drugs than in 2001. We have expanded access to treatment in \npublic health settings, the criminal justice system, and in sectors of \nsociety where resources are limited. The Access to Recovery program \nalone has extended treatment services to an additional 190,000 \nAmericans, exceeding its 3-year goal by over 50 percent. We have seized \nunprecedented amounts of illegal drugs and have denied drug traffickers \nand terrorists the profits they need to conduct their deadly work. \nDuring the first three quarters of 2007 we saw significant disruptions \nin the cocaine and methamphetamine markets, with prices rising by 44 \npercent and 73 percent, and purities falling by 15 percent and 31 \npercent, respectively.\n  These results do not mean that our work is done. Rather, they provide \na charter for future efforts. By pursuing a balanced strategy that \naddresses the epidemiology of drug use and the economics of drug \navailability, we can further reduce drug use in America.\n  I thank the Congress for its support and ask that it continue this \nnoble work on behalf of the American people.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nSenators Durbin, Coleman, and Lincoln, to introduce the landmark Small \nBusiness Health Options Program Act of 2008 or the SHOP Act because \nafter more than 10 years of discussion in Congress of this No. 1 \npriority for America's small businesses, this bill should finally be \nthe vehicle that brings us to the finish line in passing legislation \nthat's critical not only to our small businesses but also to millions \nof America's uninsured.\n  This compromise proposal represents the culmination of 15 months of \ncoming together, of reaching across the partisan divide, to fashion a \nworkable solution to pass this year. So I want to thank Assistant \nMajority Leader Durbin for his steadfast and stalwart leadership on \nthis issue--he has been a true champion in this cause--and Senator \nLincoln, my esteemed colleague on the Senate Finance Committee--she and \nI had pledged to work together on small business health insurance at \nthe start of this Congress--for her remarkable\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\ndedication to making this moment possible. I also thank Senator \nColeman, who recently held a Small Business Committee field hearing on \nhealth insurance reform in St. Paul, Minnesota, for joining us and for \nhis staunch support of our Nation's small businesses.\n  As former chair and now ranking member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, if there is one concern I have heard time and again--from \nsmall businesses in Maine and across the country--it is the exorbitant \ncost to small businesses of providing health insurance to their \nemployees. Throughout America, health insurance premiums have increased \nby a staggering 78 percent since 2001--far outpacing inflation and wage \ngains. In Maine, annual premiums in the small group market now average \nan astronomical $4,868 for individual coverage and $14,605 for a family \nplan. Just recently a group of Maine small businesses told me that, \nincredibly, the most ``affordable'' insurance policies available to \nthem included a $636 monthly premium with a $2,500 annual deductible\n  This is just simply unacceptable. And the reality of these unreal \nincreases is that it perpetuates a vicious cycle of spiraling costs and \ndeclining access--as fewer and fewer small businesses can afford to \noffer health insurance to their employees. Today, only 45 percent of \nour smallest businesses are able to provide this workplace benefit--a \n13-percent drop from 2002. No wonder that nearly 9 out of 10 to firms \ntold the National Association of Manufacturers last year that the cost \nof health insurance is one of their top-three concerns--even above \nGovernment regulations and foreign competition. And when you couple all \nthis with the fact there are already around 47 million uninsured in \nAmerica, shouldn't we be helping to add to the rolls of the insured, \nrather than the uninsured? What exactly is there not to get when the \nstatus quo absolutely makes no sense?\n  That is why in the 108th and 109th Congresses, when I was chair of \nthe Small Business Committee, I championed a Small Business Health \nInsurance Plan bill the full Senate considered back in May 2006--thanks \nlargely to the stewardship of Senator Enzi--and we came up just a \nhandful of votes short. At the same time, Senators Durbin and Lincoln \nadvocated for a different approach, the Small Employer Health Benefits \nProgram. Yet, regrettably, Congress has failed to muster the bipartisan \nsupport to pass either of these measures--despite overwhelming public \nsupport, on both sides of the aisle, to pass something.\n  Well, the clock has been ticking for far too long for America's small \nbusinesses--and with this bill, we believe their hour may have finally \narrived because with the SHOP Act, we blend the best of the \nprevious approaches and address the major concerns critics have \nexpressed in a package that both the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the National Association of Realtors, and the Service \nEmployees International Union agree on--and that is what I call a \ndiverse base of support that speaks volumes for this bill's chances for \nsuccess.\n\n  In short, we make health insurance more affordable and accessible by \nencouraging development of State-based purchasing pools backstopped by \na voluntary, nationwide small business risk pool. The SHOP Act \nmaintains the basic premise of allowing small businesses and the self-\nemployed to pool together, across State lines--just as larger employers \nare able to do--to secure quality coverage that is more affordable, \nthanks to a reduction in administrative costs, which today account for \nan astonishing 25 percent of small business premiums--compared to just \n10 percent for large employers.\n  So the creation of these purchasing pools will increase competition \namong insurers and provide more coverage choices for small businesses. \nAnd that is all the more critical as small group insurance markets--\nlike those in Maine--currently have no real competition. In fact, the \nlargest insurers now control 43 percent of the small group markets, and \nin Maine, a sum total of 4 large insurers now control 98 percent of the \nsmall group market. This cannot be allowed to continue because no \ncompetition means higher costs. Higher costs mean no health insurance. \nAnd we need more insured in America, not fewer.\n  Moreover, under the SHOP Act, business and trade associations would \nserve as health plan ``navigators,'' helping employers and employees \nalike with enrollment in health insurance plans and in responding to \nquestions and distributing information about SHOP. And to assist small \nemployers who offer health insurance, we provide a targeted tax credit \nof up to $1,000 for each covered employee, and $2,000 for family \ncoverage--with a bonus credit for employers who contribute more than 60 \npercent of the premium--encouraging our Nation's smallest businesses to \noffer health insurance for their employees as a workplace benefit.\n  But perhaps most significantly, what this bill does that others have \nnot is it resolves the persistent policy concerns that have thwarted \nprevious attempts to pass small business health insurance legislation \nin the Senate.\n  As we know, some have voiced concern that small business health \ninsurance plans could offer stripped-down, ``bare-bones'' coverage \nplans that would leave out such key benefits as cancer screenings, \ndiabetic supplies, mammograms, and maternity care. Well, we agree and \nwe address this concern by requiring SHOP's nationwide plans to meet or \nexceed a minimum benefit ``floor'' to be developed by the nonpartisan \nand highly respected National Academies of Science's Institute of \nMedicine--based on clinically appropriate and affordable practices in \ntoday's small group market. So this issue of coverage should no longer \nbe a legitimate roadblock.\n  Others have said that small business health insurance legislation \ncould drive up premium costs for all those who don't participate in \nthese new small business plans because these plans would be playing by \ndifferent and more advantageous rules. They have been concerned that, \nas a result, companies would set up plans that would attract a \nhealthier pool of individuals--who would pay lower premiums--while \npotentially relegating the less healthy to existing group or individual \nplans that would then have to raise premiums.\n  So we worked closely with the nonpartisan National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners to create strong incentives for states to \nensure a level playing field for all plans--both inside and outside of \nSHOP. We say, if you want the small businesses in your State to be \neligible for that targeted tax credit of up to $1,000 for individual \nemployees and $2,000 for family coverage that's included in our bill, \nyou must have rules prohibiting ``health status'' as a factor for \nvarying insurance and reducing excessive variations for other factors. \nAs an additional benefit to the self-employed, States must also ensure \nthat those individuals have the option to purchase a small group plan--\nrather than being left with only the far more expensive option of the \nindividual insurance market.\n  Still others have expressed concerns about a potential role of the \nFederal Government in insurance regulation, which has traditionally \nbeen left to the States. So under the SHOP Act, we ensure that State \ninsurance commissioners--not the Federal Government--would handle all \nconsumer complaints about health plans and would be responsible for \nensuring that all SHOP health plans operating in their State meet State \nrequirements for financial solvency and for grievance claim and appeals \nprocedures.\n  In conclusion, for all of these reasons I firmly believe they Small \nBusiness Health Options Program Act represents our best hope for \nachieving passage this Congress. By addressing the major concerns about \nprevious legislation, frankly there is now no longer any good reason we \ncannot make it happen. I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus \nand Ranking Member Grassley on the Finance Committee to consider this \nbipartisan measure, so it can be passed by the full Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2796. A bill to require a pilot program on the use of community-\nbased organizations to ensure that veterans receive the care and \nbenefits they need, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today \nthat will help the Department of Veterans Affairs reach out to \nunderserved veterans, through collaboration with community \norganizations.\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs is the second largest cabinet \nlevel Federal department, operating the Nation's largest health care \nsystem. VA provides benefits and health care to millions of veterans \nand their families every year. Without question, VA helps countless \nveterans through its various programs every day, largely thanks to its \nemployees, who make it their mission to serve those who served their \ncountry honorably.\n  Unfortunately, while VA makes a positive impact on the veterans it \nserves, many others are left underserved. Far too often, these are \nveterans already in difficult circumstances, those who could benefit \nmost from VA support. For example, veterans from rural areas must do \nwithout the kind of local support systems urban and suburban veterans \noften enjoy. Many veterans from racial and ethnic minority groups also \nremain underserved by VA, regardless of their physical proximity to \nveterans' programs.\n  More must be done for these veterans, who look at VA and see a system \neither out of reach or out of touch. The legislation I have introduced \ntoday pursues one potential solution: VA partnerships with community \nbased organizations.\n  If enacted, this bill would require VA to work with community based \norganizations to reach out to veterans who are underserved. Five \ncommunity organizations, chosen by VA, would be selected for pilot \npartnerships. Special consideration would be given to rural communities \nand areas with a high proportion of minorities and other underserved \nveterans. The five pilots, each in partnership with a VA medical \ncenter, would focus on providing support to their underserved group by \nhelping servicemembers transition from military service to veteran \nstatus, and helping them navigate the complicated veterans' health care \nand benefits system. Also, the pilot programs would reach out to the \nfamilies of veterans, in recognition of the central role that families \nplay in helping veterans readjust and reintegrate.\n  As Mental Health America, the country's oldest and largest mental \nhealth nonprofit, has pointed out, America's newest generation of \nveterans is returning from combat with invisible wounds that require \ncare. These and other complicated injuries place new challenges on VA \nto provide the quality health care and benefits veterans have earned \nthrough their service. I hope that through the partnerships outlined in \nthis legislation, VA will be better able to provide services to \nveterans who deserve support, yet are underserved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2797. A bill to authorize major medical facility projects and \nmajor medical facility leases for the Department of Veterans Affairs \nfor fiscal year 2009, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

As chairman of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I have not taken a position on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na transmittal letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2797\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: I am pleased to submit the \n     enclosed draft bill to authorize $1,871,900,000 for \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) major facility \n     construction projects for Fiscal Year 2009 and $60,114,000 \n     for major facility leases for Fiscal Year 2009.\n       Title 38 U.S.C. section 8104(a)(2) requires statutory \n     authorization for all VA major medical facility construction \n     projects and all major medical facility leases prior to the \n     appropriation of funds. In accordance with title 38, the \n     draft bill authorizes six major medical facility construction \n     projects and twelve major medical facility leases. The six \n     major medical facility construction projects are located in: \n     Lee County, Florida; Palo Alto, California; San Antonio, \n     Texas; San Juan, Puerto, Rico; Denver, Colorado; and New \n     Orleans, Louisiana. Previously, Congress authorized funds \n     necessary for Denver and New Orleans under P.L. 109-461. This \n     proposed bill would authorize additional funds necessary to \n     complete the remaining construction for these projects.\n       The proposed project in Lee County provides a state-of-the-\n     art ambulatory care facility which is expected to improve the \n     ``quality of life'' of the veteran population. Needed \n     services for diagnostic procedures, ambulatory surgery, and \n     specialty care will be provided in response to these areas \n     being identified as service shortfalls in the CARES analysis. \n     The proposed project in Palo Alto is required to replace a \n     functionally deficient and seismically unsafe acute \n     psychiatric inpatient building. This will be accomplished by \n     constructing an approximately 80-bed replacement facility. \n     The proposed project in San Antonio is for a state-of-the-art \n     polytrauma healthcare and rehabilitation center that will \n     include patient ward space and transitional housing space. \n     The proposed project in San Juan will provide needed seismic \n     corrections to Building 1 at the VA Medical Center.\n       The proposed project in Denver will provide a replacement \n     facility near the University of Colorado, Fitzsimons campus. \n     The project will accommodate the tertiary, secondary and \n     primary care operations for the Eastern Colorado Health Care \n     System. Previous authorization, in the amount of $98,000,000, \n     provided pursuant to P.L. 109-461, only satisfied the cost of \n     land acquisition and some architect engineering costs. \n     Additional authorization is required to complete this \n     project.\n       The proposed project in New Orleans will reestablish the \n     services in Southeast Louisiana that existed prior to \n     Hurricane Katrina. A tertiary care medical complex will be \n     constructed and will include 200 inpatient beds with 60 \n     nursing home beds. Through P.L. 109-461, this project, as a \n     facility to be co-located with the Louisiana State University \n     Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSU), was authorized \n     in the amount of $300,000,000; however, additional \n     authorization is required to deliver the project described. \n     Authorization is requested in an amount not to exceed \n     $625,000,000 regardless of whether the project is co-located \n     with LSU as prescribed in P.L. 109-461.\n       The proposed authorization will allow leases for Outpatient \n     Clinics in Brandon, Florida; Eugene, Oregon; and Greenville, \n     South Carolina. An Outpatient Clinic will be expanded through \n     a lease in Green Bay, Wisconsin. A lease for a Satellite \n     Outpatient Clinic will be acquired in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. \n     Leases for Community Based Outpatient Clinics will be \n     acquired in Colorado Springs, Colorado; Mansfield; Ohio; \n     Mesa, Arizona; and Sun City, Arizona. A lease in Savannah, \n     Georgia, will expand its Community Based Outpatient Clinic. A \n     lease for Interim Research Space will be acquired in Palo \n     Alto, California. A lease for a Primary Care Annex will be \n     acquired in Tampa, Florida.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that the \n     transmission of this legislative package is in accord with \n     the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   James B. Peake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 2803. A bill to amend the Act entitled ``An Act authorizing \nassociations of producers of aquatic products'' to include persons \nengaged in the fishery industry as charter boats or recreational \nfishermen, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to aid an industry that is vital to the State of Florida \nand that, like many others in this Nation, is suffering during the \ncurrent economic downturn: the charter and recreational fishing \nindustry.\n  I am introducing the Charter and Recreational Fishing Collective \nMarketing Act of 2008. This bill would allow charter boat and other \nrecreational fishermen to act together in associations for the purposes \nof catching, producing, and marketing aquatic products. By gaining \nstrength in numbers through such associations, charter and recreational \nfishermen could negotiate lower prices when purchasing services and \nproducts, such as insurance, fuel, ice, and other supplies.\n  If they choose to do so, this bill would also allow these \nassociations to implement vessel capacity reduction programs--in other \nwords, to buy-out those members who already wish to leave the industry \nvoluntarily but lack the financial wherewithal to do so. These \nassociations could also undertake research, such as scientific \nmonitoring of their fisheries, and in the process help improve \nconservation and management of fishery resources.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does nothing more than provide \ncharter and recreational fishermen the same rights and abilities to \nwork collectively that commercial fishermen have enjoyed since 1934. \nThis legislation has no hearing on fishing allocations or related \nregulations. In light of the great economic challenges that our country \nis facing, we have an obligation to ensure the viability of industries \nthat support our coastal communities. The Charter and Recreational \nFishing Collective Marketing Act of 2008 would help us meet that \nobligation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2803\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Commissioner of Reclamation, to assess the irrigation \ninfrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos in the State of New Mexico and \nprovide grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, the Rio \nGrande Pueblos to repair, rehabilitate, or reconstruct existing \ninfrastructure, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rio Grande \nPueblos Irrigation Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2008. This \nlegislation is based on recommendations made by the 2000 report by the \nBureau of Reclamation and Bureau of Indian Affairs entitled Pueblo \nIrrigation Facilities Rehabilitation Report. This report identifies the \nserious needs that exist in rehabilitating Pueblo Indian irrigation \ninfrastructure, and more importantly, the lack of any existing program \nto meet these challenges.\n  The 18 Pueblos of the Rio Grande basin have historically sustained \nthemselves through agriculture, irrigating their crops with water from \nthe Rio Grande watershed. However, the number of Pueblo irrigation \nworks in serious disrepair has placed this way of life in jeopardy. In \nmany cases, diversion structures and other facilities are unsafe, \nbarely operable, and wholly inefficient, thereby preventing the \nirrigation of historical farmland. Despite the time and effort the \nPueblo people have committed to operating and maintaining these \nirrigation systems, the tribes lack the financial and technical \nresources to carry out the necessary improvements by themselves.\n  Unfortunately, according to a recent GAO Report on the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs' irrigation program, it appears that the BIA also lacks \nthe resources necessary to maintain irrigation infrastructure on Indian \nland. Given this and the BIA's historical lack of attention to the \nissue, it is clear that the Bureau of Reclamation may be best suited to \nprovide the technical expertise needed to assist the Pueblos. Over the \nlast 5 years, Reclamation has funded a number of water conservation \nefforts within its irrigation projects in New Mexico. The work that's \nbeen done has been highly beneficial, and it's time to include the Rio \nGrande Pueblos in that effort.\n  Accordingly, this bill directs the Secretary of the Interior, through \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, to work with the eighteen Pueblos in the Rio \nGrande basin to assess Pueblo irrigation infrastructure and initiate \nprojects to rehabilitate and repair such infrastructure on Pueblo \nlands. Moreover, the activity authorized in the bill is consistent with \nthe goals of Reclamation's Water 2025 program. Recognizing the limited \nresources available within Reclamation, though, the bill directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to work with BIA, the Natural Resources \nConservation Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers to identify \nopportunities to use the authorities of those agencies to collaborate \non projects that make sense to all involved.\n  By focusing Federal resources and expertise on this problem now, the \nfederal government, as part of its trust responsibility, will help \nprevent further deterioration of Pueblo irrigation systems and any \nadditional rehabilitation costs in the future. The Rio Grande Pueblos \nwill benefit markedly from increased agricultural productivity, \nincreased water conservation, and overall safer facilities. More \nimportantly however, these improvements have the capacity to assist the \nPueblos in sustaining their historical way of life, both economically \nand culturally. Finally, the overall health of the Rio Grande basin \nwill likely benefit through increased efficiency in water use. For \nthese reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rio Grande Pueblos \n     Irrigation Infrastructure Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) drought, population increases, and environmental needs \n     are exacerbating water supply issues across the western \n     United States, including the Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico;\n       (2) a report developed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs in 2000 identified a serious need \n     for the rehabilitation and repair of irrigation \n     infrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos;\n       (3) inspection of existing irrigation infrastructure of the \n     Rio Grande Pueblos shows that many key facilities, such as \n     diversion structures and main conveyance ditches, are unsafe \n     and barely, if at all, operable;\n       (4) the benefits of rehabilitating and repairing irrigation \n     infrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos include--\n       (A) water conservation;\n       (B) extending available water supplies;\n       (C) increased agricultural productivity;\n       (D) economic benefits;\n       (E) safer facilities; and\n\n[[Page S2360]]\n\n       (F) the preservation of the culture of Indian Pueblos in \n     the State;\n       (5) certain Indian Pueblos in the Rio Grande Basin receive \n     water from facilities operated or owned by the Bureau of \n     Reclamation; and\n       (6) rehabilitation and repair of irrigation infrastructure \n     of the Rio Grande Pueblos would improve--\n       (A) overall water management by the Bureau of Reclamation; \n     and\n       (B) the ability of the Bureau of Reclamation to help \n     address potential water supply conflicts in the Rio Grande \n     Basin.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the \n     Secretary--\n       (1) to assess the condition of the irrigation \n     infrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos;\n       (2) to establish priorities for the rehabilitation of \n     irrigation infrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos in \n     accordance with specified criteria; and\n       (3) to implement projects to rehabilitate and improve the \n     irrigation infrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to reconsider the decision of the Administrator to \ndeny the request of the State of California to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions from new motor vehicles, and to complete further proceedings \nin accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in Massachusetts \nv. Environmental Protection Agency; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 1-year \nanniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark Massachusetts v. EPA \ndecision on global warming pollution, to introduce the Greenhouse Gas \nEndangerment Finding Deadline and California Waiver Reconsideration \nAct. The bill would force the EPA and this administration to act--at \nlong last--against global warming.\n  This legislation will impose two significant deadlines on the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  First, the legislation gives EPA 60 days to respond to the \nMassachusetts v. EPA ruling.\n  Second, this bill requires EPA to reconsider its unprecedented \ndecision to deny the State of California a Federal waiver that would \nhave allowed the State to limit tailpipe greenhouse gas pollution from \ncars and trucks.\n  Unfortunately, deadlines for EPA action are necessary in both cases.\n  In its landmark Massachusetts v. EPA ruling, issued 1 year ago today, \nthe Supreme Court gave EPA a specific task: Determine whether the \nemissions of greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, and \nthen comply with the Clean Air Act requirements that result from this \ndetermination.\n  Yet 1 year later, EPA has done nothing. EPA Administrator Johnson \npledged to act by December, but that day came and went.\n  I wrote to Administrator Johnson in January asking for a timeline for \naction.\n  He wrote back to tell me he could not give me one.\n  Last month, when I asked Mr. Johnson how many people were working on \nthis endangerment finding, he could not tell me if anyone was working \non it.\n  In a March 27, 2008, letter to me and many of my colleagues, EPA \nindicated that it intends to begin soliciting comments from the public \nas the Agency ``considers'' regulations of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  EPA's letter indicates that it does not intend to determine whether \ngreenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, as the court \ninstructed it to do, anytime in the near future.\n  Instead EPA's Administrator stated that ``implementing the Supreme \nCourt's decision could affect many sources beyond just the cars and \ntrucks considered by the Court,'' suggesting that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt would have come to a different conclusion had it better \nunderstood the Clean Air Act.\n  The process will not begin until ``later this spring.''\n  EPA has no further timeline for action, nor has it set a deadline for \ncompletion.\n  The plaintiffs in the Massachusetts v. EPA case today returned to \ncourt to compel the EPA to act. This bill is intended to work in tandem \nwith their suit, compelling EPA to take an action, which both the \ncourts and the law indicate should not be unreasonably delayed. No one \nshould interpret this bill as a substitute for the courts taking action \nto compel EPA to act without delay under existing law. Both the new \nlawsuit and this bill are prompted by the clear failure of EPA to act \non a reasonable timeline.\n  Bottom Line: Responding to the Supreme Court's remand cannot and \nshould not be delayed for an undefined period of time.\n  EPA has had a full year to collect public comment and consider the \nimplications of its response, and it has done so. EPA staff told \nCongress that they spent thousands of hours writing an endangerment \nfinding and proposed regulations this past autumn. A draft has already \nbeen submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n  This legislation puts EPA on the clock to finish the job it was \nassigned by the highest court in the land.\n  The second deadline in this legislation requires the EPA \nAdministrator to reconsider, and either confirm or reject, EPA \nAdministrator Johnson's December decision to deny California a Clean \nAir Act waiver.\n  Without the waiver, California and 15 other States are unable to \ncontrol greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles.\n  EPA Administrator Johnson denied this waiver even though EPA's legal \nand technical staff unanimously recommended that the waiver be issued.\n  EPA's attorneys had told Mr. Johnson that a waiver denial in this \ncase would ``in effect, amend the Clean Air Act by Administrative \nAction.''\n  They told him that EPA would be sued and ``was likely to lose suit.''\n  The decision was made before the legal justification had been \nwritten. EPA staff had been cut out of the process entirely.\n  His official legal document, issued more than 2 months after Mr. \nJohnson issued the decision, asserts that the waiver was denied based \nalmost entirely on the legislative history of the 1967 Clean Air Act. \nHis legal document made no mention of the fact that Congress rewrote \nthe operative section in 1977.\n  In hearing after hearing, Mr. Johnson has asserted that he made this \ndecision himself. Apparently he read the law differently than every one \nof his agency's experts and attorneys--a different reading he has never \nexplained. But even he has acknowledged that the process under which \nthis decision was made was unusual.\n  I believe that an unusual process led to an unusual result.\n  This bill would give EPA the opportunity to reconsider this decision. \nAnd with this reconsideration we will see whether a normal process will \nproduce a different result.\n  This legislation sets firm deadlines by which EPA must complete its \nwork. It instructs the administration to act in the face of climate \nchange. It brings an end to the delay and obfuscation that impede \nprogress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\n                                S. 2806\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 496\n\n       Whereas sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who never received any \n     formal art training but nonetheless won 1st place for \n     sculpture at the New York World's Fair in 1939, came to the \n     Black Hills of South Dakota as an assistant to Gutzon Borglum \n     to help carve Mount Rushmore;\n       Whereas Lakota Chief Henry Standing Bear contacted Korczak \n     Ziolkowski in 1939 to encourage him to create another \n     mountain memorial, saying in his letter of invitation: ``My \n     fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red \n     man has great heroes, too'';\n       Whereas Crazy Horse was remembered by his people as a \n     fierce warrior and visionary leader who was committed to \n     preserving the traditional Lakota way of life;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was inspired to honor the \n     culture, tradition, and living heritage of North American \n     Indians, and thus designed a metaphoric tribute to the spirit \n     of Crazy Horse and his people;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was dedicated as well to helping \n     his country preserve freedom, enlisted in the Army, and was \n     wounded in 1944 at Omaha Beach;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski returned to South Dakota after \n     World War II in order to find a suitable mountain to carve in \n     order to honor Crazy Horse and his people;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski and Chief Standing Bear \n     dedicated the Crazy Horse Memorial on June 3, 1948;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski worked until his death in 1982, \n     and his wife, Ruth, and their family have dedicated their \n     lives to carving the mountain and continuing the mission of \n     the Crazy Horse Memorial;\n       Whereas there is no way to predict when the mountain \n     carving will be completed, owing to the uncertainty of \n     weather, the availability of private funding, and the \n     challenges of mountain engineering;\n       Whereas, when completed, the Crazy Horse mountain carving \n     will be the largest carving in the world, at 641 feet long by \n     563 feet high;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski's parting words to his wife \n     were, ``You must work on the mountain--but go slowly so you \n     do it right'';\n       Whereas the Ziolkowski family and the Crazy Horse Memorial \n     Foundation have continued to do it right, have proceeded \n     without government financial support, and remain dedicated to \n     making steady progress on the Memorial's humanitarian goals; \n     and\n       Whereas the Crazy Horse Memorial will celebrate the 60th \n     anniversary of the dedication of the mountain carving on June \n     3, 2008: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, on the 60th anniversary of the \n     commencement of the mountain carving of the Crazy Horse \n     Memorial, honors sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, the Ziolkowski \n     family, and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation for their \n     dedication to honoring the culture, tradition, and living \n     heritage of North American Indians and the spirit of Crazy \n     Horse and his people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2362-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2362-S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 497--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT PUBLIC \nSERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE \nTO THE NATION DURING PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK, MAY 5 THROUGH 11, \n                                  2008\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Levin, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Carper, Mr. Warner, Mr. Obama, and Mrs. \nMcCaskill) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution honoring \nthe dedication, commitment, and noble service of Federal, State, and \nlocal government employees during Public Service Recognition Week.\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\n  For the past 23 years, the first full week of May is reserved to \nrecognize the men and women of the military and civilian workforces \ndiligently serving our Nation and celebrate their achievements.\n  Throughout the history of this Nation, public servants have been the \nfirst in many fields. Public servants are the first to respond to an \nemergency. They were the first to walk on the moon, the first to \nsubnavigate the North Pole, and the driving force behind the creation \nof the Internet. However, there are lesser known achievements of public \nservants that improve all of our lives. Researchers at NIH were the \nfirst to make a discovery that lead to the Human Papillomavirus \nvaccine. They were the first to create a program allowing States and \nlocalities to analyze DNA evidence on thousands of cases. And, they \nhave been the first to discover hormones produced by the heart that \nhave profound benefits in treating many deadly diseases.\n  Public Service Recognition Week is a time for all Americans to \nrecognize the contributions which public servants make to this country \nthat are often overlooked. We are familiar with the police officers who \npatrol our streets, the teachers who teach our children, the public \nofficials we elect to govern, and the war fighters so bravely defending \nour country. However, there are many other public servants who protect \nand care for our National Parks, provide care to veterans, protect the \nwater we drink, build the roads we drive on, archive American history \nand the American experience, and curate our public museums that work \nbehind the scenes without much attention or praise. These are just some \nof the silent servants who are the backbone of America.\n  Public servants have chosen a career path that does not often exalt \nor glorify their work. We rarely hear about the support the civilians \nin the Department of Defense are providing to the military during this \ntime of war or the doctors and nurses at the Veterans' Affairs \nAdministration who provide care to the many men and women returning \nhome from combat while struggling with insufficient resources. PSR week \nis a time we thank them for their service and recognize their efforts.\n  This week is not just a time for us to honor their work, but a time \nfor us to get to know the groundbreaking efforts made by the military \nand civil servants. Across the country, mayors, State governments, \nGovernors, county governments, and many other civic organizations are \nparticipating in Public Service Recognition Week through proclamations, \nhonorary events, awards, and exhibits. In Washington, DC, Federal \nagencies are coming together on the National Mall to demonstrate to the \npublic all that they do for America. The military will show its might \nwith planes, helicopters, tanks, and other machinery located throughout \nthe exhibit. The civil service will show innovations in scientific \nresearch, advances in criminal detection and law enforcement, and ways \nit is improving the lives of Americans everyday.\n  We sit on the edge of great change in the Federal workforce. \nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, an estimated 40 \npercent of the 1.8 million federal employees will retire in the next 10 \nyears as many more become eligible to retire. According to a number of \nrecent reports published by the Partnership for Public Service, we know \nthat young people want meaning in their careers. They can find both \nmeaning and nobility in public service. Our challenge is to show the \nnext generation of employees that public service offers a range of \noptions for meaningful experiences and dynamic opportunities.\n  As we celebrate the 24th annual Public Service Recognition Week May \n5-11, I encourage all Americans to take time out of their busy \nschedules to learn more about the work of public servants and recognize \nthem for their commitment and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2363-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 498--DESIGNATING APRIL 8, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL \n                   CUSHING'S SYNDROME AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 498\n\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome affects an estimated 10 to 15 \n     people per 1,000,000 people annually, most of those affected \n     are between the ages of 20 and 50;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal \n     disorder caused by the prolonged exposure of the body's \n     tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol;\n       Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction of \n     cortisol in the body or by taking glucocorticoid hormones, \n     which are routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid \n     arthritis, and lupus, or as an immunosuppressant following \n     organ transplants;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome may also result from pituitary \n     adenomas, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) \n     syndrome, adrenal tumors, and Familial Cushing's Syndrome;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome can cause abnormal weight gain, \n     skin changes, and fatigue and can ultimately lead to \n     diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, or \n     death;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of \n     tests, often requiring x-ray examinations of adrenal or \n     pituitary glands to locate tumors;\n       Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing's Syndrome are \n     misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed for years because many of the \n     symptoms of Cushing's Syndrom are also indications of milder \n     diseases, and those errors in diagnoses delay the \n     implementation of important treatment options;\n       Whereas treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include surgery, \n     radiation, chemotherapy, the use of cortisol-inhibiting \n     drugs, and reducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome was discovered by Dr. Harvey \n     Williams Cushing, who was born on April 8, 1869;\n       Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United \n     States Postal Service's ``Great American'' series of stamps, \n     initiated in 1980 to recognize individuals for making \n     significant contributions to the heritage and culture of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in \n     the Rose Garden at a White House ceremony to unveil the \n     commemorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey Cushing;\n       Whereas, following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a \n     reception in the State Dining Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, \n     Dr. Cushing's daughter, and representatives of the American \n     Association of Neurological Surgeons; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness of Cushing's Syndrome in the general public and the \n     medical community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 8, 2008, as ``National Cushing's \n     Syndrome Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people in the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of Cushing's Syndrome;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Cushing's Understanding, Support, \n     and Help Organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2363-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4384.

Res. 498\n\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome affects an estimated 10 to 15 \n     people per 1,000,000 people annually, most of those affected \n     are between the ages of 20 and 50;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal \n     disorder caused by the prolonged exposure of the body's \n     tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol;\n       Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction of \n     cortisol in the body or by taking glucocorticoid hormones, \n     which are routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid \n     arthritis, and lupus, or as an immunosuppressant following \n     organ transplants;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome may also result from pituitary \n     adenomas, ectopic\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\n     adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome, adrenal tumors, \n     and Familial Cushing's Syndrome;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome can cause abnormal weight gain, \n     skin changes, and fatigue and can ultimately lead to \n     diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, or \n     death;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of \n     tests, often requiring x-ray examinations of adrenal or \n     pituitary glands to locate tumors;\n       Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing's Syndrome are \n     misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed for years because many of the \n     symptoms of Cushing's Syndrom are also indications of milder \n     diseases, and those errors in diagnoses delay the \n     implementation of important treatment options;\n       Whereas treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include surgery, \n     radiation, chemotherapy, the use of cortisol-inhibiting \n     drugs, and reducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome was discovered by Dr. Harvey \n     Williams Cushing, who was born on April 8, 1869;\n       Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United \n     States Postal Service's ``Great American'' series of stamps, \n     initiated in 1980 to recognize individuals for making \n     significant contributions to the heritage and culture of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in \n     the Rose Garden at a White House ceremony to unveil the \n     commemorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey Cushing;\n       Whereas, following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a \n     reception in the State Dining Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, \n     Dr. Cushing's daughter, and representatives of the American \n     Association of Neurological Surgeons; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness of Cushing's Syndrome in the general public and the \n     medical community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 8, 2008, as ``National Cushing's \n     Syndrome Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people in the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of Cushing's Syndrome;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Cushing's Understanding, Support, \n     and Help Organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/02/senate-section/article/S2365-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2807, S. 2808, S. 2809, S. 2810, AND \n                                S. 2811\n\n  Mr. REID.
