Mr. President, we have been on this immigration bill now, \nby some accounts, for 5 days. I will note that we started with a vote \non cloture on the motion to proceed at, I believe, 5:30 Monday \nafternoon. We had Tuesday on the bill, we had Wednesday on the bill, we \nhad Thursday on the bill; here we are on Friday.\n  My understanding is that the agreement between the parties is that I \nwill be only allowed to offer one additional amendment, in addition to \nthe one currently pending. I understand that limitation, but I want to \nmake clear that I think it sends a bad signal in terms of where this \nbill is headed in the long run because, all along, while I applaud the \nmajority leader and the minority leader for their willingness to give \nus an additional week on this bill after the recess, I am worried that \nbecause of the slow progress we are making on these amendments, \nparticularly on getting an opportunity to vote on amendments--for \nexample, the one I laid down early on this week--we are going to find \nourselves in for a train wreck the week after the recess, when the \namendments that have been filed will need to be considered. I am afraid \nthere will be an effort to try to prevent important amendments from \nbeing considered.\n  Let me give you a little context for my concerns. As we all know, \nthis bill was negotiated largely behind closed doors by a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators. I have to say that, in many respects, the product we \nhave before us is better than the bill that passed last year, although \nI could not support it in the end because I have amendments I think are \nneeded to improve it. To give you some context about the need for a \nrobust debate and the freedom to offer amendments and to consider \nvarious points of view other than those reflected behind those closed \ndoors, I went back to look at the Judiciary Committee last year, which \nconsidered the original McCain-Kennedy bill. There were 62 amendments \nfiled in the Judiciary Committee. The present occupant of the chair \nknows, as a member of that Committee, it is a very hard-working \nCommittee that considers a lot of important and contentious issues. \nThat committee was bypassed through the process by which this bill has \ncome to the floor this year.\n  Just an observation. Last year, there were 62 amendments filed in the \nJudiciary Committee alone that went through a process that was not \nobserved this year. So far, by my current count, there have been 107 \namendments filed to the present bill. We have had seven--count them--\nrollcall votes on amendments so far this week. I don't see any way, \nshort of an attempt to try to cut off debate and to cut off the \noffering of amendments the week we return, we are going to be able to \nget through 107 filed amendments.\n  I think it is important, for a variety of reasons, that we continue \nto have a robust debate and the freedom to offer amendments because, \nfor the reasons I mentioned a moment ago, this product was largely \nnegotiated behind closed doors by a bipartisan group of Senators. Most \nof the Members of the Senate have not had a chance to study this bill \nin great detail, until the final legislative text was prepared by \nlegislative counsel a couple of days ago.\n  This is an enormously complex issue. The bill has a lot of different \nmoving parts. We bypassed the committee process. My hope is--and this \nis my plea to our leadership--that we continue to see the kind of \nexpansive opportunities that have been provided so far, with 2 weeks \nset aside for the debate and to have an opportunity to offer amendments \nand to have votes on those amendments.\n  I will point out that on the last bill, which ended up being the \nHagel-Martinez compromise, there were 30 rollcall votes, according to \nmy notes. We have had seven so far on this bill, and here we find \nourselves on Friday and we have one more week scheduled by the majority \nleader. I am very concerned that we will not be able to get due \nconsideration of all of the various points of view, and an opportunity \nto freely offer amendments and get rollcall votes on those amendments \nthat I believe are very important. It is even more important, if it is \npossible, in this particular legislation.\n  As my colleague from Colorado knows, he and I were both present \nduring many of the negotiations that have led up to this bill, even \nthough ultimately he agreed to the product, but I could not. That this \nis an enormously emotional and contentious issue. I bet Senators have \ngotten more phone calls, e-mails, and correspondence about this issue \nthan virtually anything else that has come before the Senate. It is \nextraordinarily important to the democratic process and the legislative \nprocess to allow people to present their points of view.\n  We are here as 100 people representing 300 million people. We need to \nmake sure that not only the opinions and points of view of the elites \nand people who can hire high-priced lobbyists are considered; we need \nto make sure the views of the American people are considered, given an \nopportunity for airing and, ultimately, we all respect the process by \nwhich these matters are put to votes, and then we respect the right of \nthe majority to make the decision and we move forward.\n  Anything that would even hint of cutting off the opportunity for the \nAmerican people to have a full airing of their views, and limiting it \nto a handful of amendments that have been advocated by lobbyists and \nother people representing the elites in Washington, DC, I think would \nbe a terrible mistake.\n  Mr. President, I want to advise my colleague from Colorado of this. \nThere has been a previous agreement that we would be allowed to offer \ntwo amendments, and that other amendments would not be allowed to be \npending.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and send amendment No. 1238 to the desk, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, there was an agreement reached between the Republican leader \nand the majority leader that there would be two amendments offered on \neach side today. The Senator from Texas has offered one amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Allard, and he has offered a second amendment on his \nbehalf. If I may further comment in responding to some of his \nsuggestions----\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I reclaim my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I want to place this in context. The fact is that there \nhas been a tremendous amount of work that has already been going on in \nthis Chamber during this last week. I inquire, without losing my place \nat the podium, of the parliamentary situation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas has the \nfloor on his unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I expected the distinguished Senator from \nColorado to lodge an objection to my amendment.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I did object to a third amendment that \nthe Senator from Texas wanted to submit.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reclaiming my right to the floor, that is my \nunderstanding. I wish to make clear that he has objected, and I wish to \nmake clear that I was not a party to any agreement that would limit us \nto the number of amendments we would offer today, but I respect that. I \noffer the amendment to make this point: There are at least 107 \namendments that remain to be brought forward and considered. Here we \nare on Friday completing the first\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nweek of what has been set aside as 2 weeks for the consideration of \nperhaps the most important domestic issue confronting our country \ntoday. There will be no votes today. Colleagues are returning either \nhome or off on various travels around the world, and we are here with \nthe most important domestic issue confronting our country today and \nreally not proceeding at a pace that would give us any realistic \nexpectation of getting this matter completed in the way I think this \nmatter needs to be treated.\n  I understand and I respect the Senator from Colorado making an \nobjection to my offering further amendments, but we all can see what is \ngoing on here, and I think it portends some very disconcerting things \nwhen we are not proceeding at a pace we need to in order to actually \nget the business of the American people taken care of on this important \nissue.\n  I expect if I offer other amendments that there likewise will be an \nobjection, so I will not at this time make further offerings of \namendments, but I do have in my hand further amendments--amendment No. \n1208, which is an amendment I would offer if possible. I also have \nanother amendment, amendment No. 1247, which deals with State impact \nassistance fees.\n  One of the reasons people are so upset about the Federal Government's \ncomplete failure to deal with border security and enforce our \nimmigration laws is that most of the consequences fall on local \ntaxpayers. In my State of Texas, the Federal Government has issued a \nmandate that says no matter who shows up in your schools, your \ncommunities, or in your hospitals, you have to treat them, you have to \nprovide services to them, but the Federal Government doesn't pay for \nit. The Federal Government needs to pay for these unfunded mandates, \nand this State impact assistance fee amendment will provide that kind \nof relief to local taxpayers.\n  I understand where we are, and I respect there has been this \nagreement between the leaders, and I understand the Senator needs to \nobject, but I reiterate, we need to get moving. We need to have more \namendments offered. We need to have more votes and less time off \nwithout votes, as we are obviously having today.\n  I will now return to the amendment that I offered this morning and \nthat was allowed. Let me return now to my amendment No. 1250 and \nexplain what this amendment does provide. My hope is that we can, when \nwe return on Monday--actually, I guess it will be Tuesday, June 5--that \nwe will have an opportunity for an early vote on this amendment as well \nas the pending amendment I have that will prevent rewarding those who \nhave abused our laws and who have really thumbed their nose at our \nlegal system, who have been ordered deported and who have simply gone \non the lam, melted into the American landscape and defied the lawful \norders of our courts. These are people who have been ordered deported, \nhave actually been deported, but then they returned to the United \nStates in violation of our immigration laws, both of which constitute \nfelonies. It is my hope that I can get a vote on that amendment, which \nhas been pending now for several days, soon after we return.\n  It is my understanding our colleagues are working on some side-by-\nside agreement to provide some cover for those who don't vote for my \namendment, but I think we will have to evaluate that when we see it. I \nregret the fact that we have not been able to get votes on our \namendments because of objections primarily on the other side.\n  There is a major flaw in this legislation, and that flaw is that it \nwill, unless corrected, repeat a fundamental mistake that was made by \nCongress when Congress last passed massive legalization of undocumented \nimmigrants in 1986. The American people do not expect too much of us, \nbut they do expect that we will not repeat past mistakes.\n  I remember the definition of ``insanity'' once offered was that you \ndo the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. \nThat is the definition of ``insanity.'' This would be a terrible \nmistake if we pass this legislation without correcting a major flaw in \nthe 1986 amnesty bill that was passed by Congress, after having learned \nfrom experience what the consequences of that flaw are.\n  Under this bill, anyone in the United States in violation of our \nimmigration laws can come forward and apply for legal status with \nimpunity. Quite simply, the Department of Homeland Security is \nprohibited from using internally all of the information from the Z \napplications as well as sharing information with relevant law \nenforcement authorities. For example, if an applicant comes forward and \nis denied legalization because of some disqualifying feature, this \nlegislation, as currently written without my amendment, will prevent \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, the immigration enforcement \nauthorities, from using the information from that application to \napprehend that person.\n  What we learned from the 1986 amnesty was what the New York Times \nsaid--that it created the largest immigration fraud in the history of \nthe United States. That is the mistake my amendment will attempt to \ncorrect. As we know from the general counsel of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service under President Clinton, the statutory \nrestrictions on sharing information and providing confidentiality of \nthe applications of those who apply for amnesty contributed enormously \nto that fraud.\n\n  The population that will benefit from this legislation should be \ntreated with no more confidentiality than any other classes of \nimmigrants. We don't afford this robust confidentiality protection to \nother immigrant classes, such as asylees or battered women or those \napplying for temporary protected status, so I ask: Why the double \nstandard?\n  When an asylum seeker applies for legal status, that asylum seeker \nmust submit an application and return at a later date for a decision. \nIf that asylum seeker is denied, he or she is taken into custody or \nprovided a notice to appear on the spot based on the information \nprovided by the applicant.\n  The proponents of this legislation will tell us that without these \nguarantees of confidentiality, those who are already in the United \nStates in violation of our immigration laws will not come forward and \nseek legal status. But I must ask: Are we not granting the biggest \nbenefit that can ever be conferred to an immigrant population; that is, \nlegal status after they have violated our immigration laws? And to be \nclear, we are talking about those who cannot even establish that they \nmeet the minimum requirements to get this valuable benefit and, even \nworse, have flouted our immigration and criminal laws. Why should we \ntreat individuals who are denied a Z visa with broad privacy \nprotections by the mere filing of an application for that status? Why \nshould they be treated differently from everybody else?\n  The proponents will say they do exempt from confidentiality those \nindividuals who commit fraud or who are part of some other scheme in \nconnection with their application. Of course, this is the very least we \nshould be doing. But this bill does not go nearly far enough to \neffectively enforce our immigration laws and protect the American \npeople from criminals and others who might do us harm. For example, at \npage 311 of this bill, in section 604(b) labeled ``Exceptions to \nConfidentiality,'' the drafters of the compromise have chosen to \nprotect aliens who are criminal absconders who have not been removed \nfrom the United States. You may be asking: What is an absconder? Quite \nsimply, an absconder is someone who has ignored a final court-ordered \ndeportation and can be prosecuted for a separate felony offense which \nis punishable by up to 4 years in prison. So the drafters of this \nunderlying bill have chosen to protect that class of people who have \nnot been removed from the United States.\n  We all know that hundreds of thousands of immigrants come across our \nborders each year, many legally, a lot more illegally. But what most \nAmericans would be shocked to hear is that according to recent \nestimates, almost 700,000 of those who have been ordered deported have \nsimply failed to comply with that court order. How many Americans think \nit is OK to ignore the lawful order of one of our courts? How many \nAmericans, after receiving a subpoena from a court, ignore it and \nsimply skip the court date?\n  As my colleagues know, I have offered a separate amendment that would\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\ncategorically bar fugitive aliens from receiving amnesty. I believe \nthis is an issue of fundamental fairness and the integrity of the rule \nof law.\n  In exchange for the largest legalization program in our Nation's \nhistory, we should be able to say without any doubt that for any person \nwho applies for and is denied a Z visa on any grounds, we will \nauthorize Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take that application, \narrest that individual, and to deport them as not qualifying under the \nlaws of the land. But the bill the Senate is considering would turn a \nblind eye to those who would apply for this amnesty and are denied. \nThis bill would allow them to slide back into the shadows--the very \nproblem we are trying to solve by this bill.\n  Ask a random citizen on the street today to answer this simple \nquestion: Someone who has violated our immigration laws comes forward \nto apply for legal status under this bill. Because the applicant does \nnot satisfy one of the criteria for being awarded legal status, the \napplicant is denied a Z visa. What happens to that individual under the \npresent bill if my amendment is not adopted? I don't think we could \nfind 1 out of 100 who would say something other than: Well, they should \ngo home. And I suspect the majority would say they should be arrested \non the spot and be deported. Yet the so-called confidentiality \nprovisions in this bill will prevent law enforcement officials from \nusing information on the application to locate and remove a significant \npopulation of those who cannot qualify for a Z visa because they are \nsimply disqualified by law.\n  This is, in essence, providing an opportunity to significant \ncategories of individuals whose applications are considered and \nrejected to slide back into the shadows and to defy our laws. This is \nthe very problem we have been told this legislation was designed to \nfix. Yet it is designed in reality for failure unless this amendment is \naccepted.\n  The whole point of this exercise, we continue to be told, is to \nenhance U.S. security by bringing people out of the shadows and into \nthe open, to allow people who want to cooperate with the law to do so, \nwhile allowing our law enforcement officials to focus their efforts on \ndrug traffickers, on criminals, and others who may come here to do us \nharm. But this bill would draw those who have entered our country in \nviolation of our immigration laws or who have overstayed in violation \nof those laws to do so and to slide back into the shadows without \nallowing the law to be enforced.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues of our Nation's recent history \nwith a massive legalization program and the consequences of \nprohibitions of Federal agencies on information sharing. As I have \nstated, reasonable observers have concluded that the 1986 amnesty was \nrife with fraud. There was an article written in the New York Times, I \nbelieve it was 1989, and it called this one of the most massive frauds \nin American history.\n  We know, for example, from the 9/11 Commission staff statements that \nMohammed and Abouhalima, conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing, were granted green cards, or legal permanent resident status, \nunder the special agricultural worker program, which was an amnesty \nprogram created by the 1986 bill. Under this special agricultural \nworker program, a key component of that 1986 amnesty bill, applicants \nhad to provide evidence that they had worked on perishable crops for at \nleast 90 days between May 1, 1985, and May 1, 1986. Their residence did \nnot have to be continuous or unlawful. Nearly 1 million of these \nindividuals who applied received legal permanent resident status under \nthis amnesty, twice the number of foreigners normally employed in \nagriculture at that time according to the 9/11 Commission and staff.\n  I would like to make one last significant point about the ill-\nconceived confidentiality protections contained in this compromise \nbill. Under this bill we are considering, Congress would even prohibit \nthe use of information from the sworn third-party affidavits that are \none of the documents that can prove eligibility. Let me say that again. \nUnder this bill, you can get some third party--there is no requirement \nof who they might be: a friend, a family member, anybody--to sign an \naffidavit attesting that you were lawfully present--or that you were \npresent, not lawfully but you were present--in the United States as of \na certain date in order to qualify for benefits under this bill.\n  We already know from well-documented prosecutions of document vendors \nand other legalization cases that the type of documents submitted, \nespecially these kinds of sworn affidavits, without limitation, were \nused to further fraud. At the very least, we should not repeat the \nmistakes of 1986 by allowing the continued use of sworn affidavits by \nthose who have already shown their willingness to violate our laws in \norder to gain the benefits under this bill.\n  My amendment takes care of that concern because it will allow those \nsort of false documents to be investigated and, where necessary, \nprosecuted. Those who engage in cottage industries of massive fraud on \na huge scale can be investigated by our authorities and prosecuted \nwhere warranted. My amendment takes care of that concern.\n  We know one thing, criminals and terrorists have abused and will \ncontinue to seek ways to abuse our immigration system in order to enter \nand remain in our country. I regret to say that the bill we are \ndebating today fails to give law enforcement the commonsense tools that \nwould prevent terrorists and others who seek to do us harm from \nexploiting the vulnerabilities inherent in any massive legalization \nprogram. My colleagues may say there is a confidentiality exception for \nnational security and for fraud, but to rely solely on these narrow \nexceptions is to engage in wishful thinking and, as far as I am \nconcerned, ignores history and hard experience and the terrorist and \ncriminal threats that we face.\n  Why would we leave any of this to chance? Why would we turn a blind \neye to the type of abuses that we have seen happen in the past and risk \nit happening again in this bill? I submit that any rejected application \nnot only will provide valuable information to assist in deporting a \nperson that is not entitled under our own laws to the benefits under \nthis bill but may provide law enforcement with a valuable lead that \nthey were previously unaware of, a lead that could--and this is not too \nmuch of a stretch--potentially save lives and, at the very least, \nimprove public safety.\n  Failure to allow law enforcement to connect the dots is a deadly \nmistake. I have heard many of my colleagues promise never would that \nhappen again. So I urge those who are truly serious about their \ncommitment to make sure the mistakes of the past don't occur again, and \nthat we don't expose the American people to an unnecessary risk and \nultimately lose their confidence by enacting a law that cannot be \nenforced. If we do that, I think we will not have done our job. So I \nurge all of us who are serious about this commitment to support my \namendment to make this crucial improvement to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have to make one correction. Apparently, affidavits \nare not allowed from relatives but are from nonrelatives. So you can't \nget your brother-in-law, I guess, to sign an affidavit saying when you \nwere in the United States, but you can get a stranger on the street or \nsomeone else to sign an affidavit saying, yes, John Cornyn was present \nin the United States as of this date. What we want to do is bring a \nlittle sunshine to this process to allow our law enforcement officials \nto do what they have sworn to do, and which they do so nobly and so \nvaliantly day in and day out, and that is investigate crime, bring \nthose who break our laws to justice, to root out fraud, and to make \nsure our laws do work.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cornyn for his tireless \neffort and his great knowledge of the complexities of the issues \ninvolved in any comprehensive immigration reform. I know he has worked \nhard to try to craft a comprehensive bill but one that will actually \nwork. That is the question.\n  I know the Senator has developed great concerns about that and has \noffered a number of amendments, some\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\nexcellent law enforcement amendments, drawn, I know, from his \nexperience as a former attorney general in Texas and a member of the \nsupreme court in Texas. I believe, as a former Federal prosecutor, \nthose amendments are essential to having a successful immigration \nprogram.\n  I would like to hear why it is that now 3 days into this bill he has \nnot been able to get a vote on those amendments and about other \namendments that he has offered this morning, whether he has been \nsuccessful in even calling them up for consideration.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, Mr. President, I appreciate the question from the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, who was a former U.S. attorney, \nformer attorney general of his State, as the occupant of the chair was \nof his State, as was, as a matter of fact, Senator Salazar. It seems as \nif we have a former attorneys general convention right here on the \nfloor of the Senate, all of us engaged in law enforcement actions most \nof our professional lives.\n  To answer the Senator's question, I am simply at a loss to understand \nwhy, on the single most important domestic issue facing our country \ntoday--our broken borders and our immigration system. This is designed \nto fail because of these barriers of information sharing that have been \nerected and because of the confidentiality provisions that have been \nslapped on affidavits and other evidence of fraud that might help us \nroot out and investigate wrongdoers and bring them to justice. I think \nthis is the main reason people are so profoundly skeptical of what we \nare doing today.\n\n  I don't think any of us should be under any illusion that if we erect \nthis nice, pretty superstructure that we talk about, that the elements \nof the bill that are meritorious--things such as triggers, things such \nas enhanced border security, effective worksite verification--if we \nundermine it, if we simply cut the legs out from under the ability of \nlaw enforcement officials to enforce this law in a way that will see it \ncollapse again, like the 1986 amnesty bill did, and we don't learn from \nthat hard experience and improve this bill and eliminate those errors \nand those flaws, I think we will have failed the essential purpose for \nwhich we were sent here--to represent the American people, to see that \nthe laws are respected, to see that law and order are reestablished.\n  I really do believe the reason people are so upset about this issue \nis because they see rampant lawlessness and disregard for the law in \nour immigration system. They recognize that in a post-9/11 world that \nour broken borders can allow economic migrants to come across.\n  We all understand why people want to come to America. It is the same \nreason they always have: they want a better life. We understand that. \nBut we have to know who is coming into our country and the reasons they \ncome here. We have offered generous temporary worker programs under \nthis bill so they could come legally, so they could be screened, so law \nenforcement could focus on the criminals, potential terrorists, and \nothers who want to do us harm. But why in the world, I would ask my \ncolleagues, would we want to leave these flaws in the bill which \nprohibit our law enforcement officials from doing their job, from \ninvestigating and rooting out fraud and criminality and bringing \nwrongdoers to justice?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would just ask this question, through the Chair. Is \nit similar to the bill last year? Did they not improve the language \nthat basically said if you file a false document for a benefit under \nthis bill, that is really not subject to being examined and \ninvestigated and prosecuted?\n  If an American filed a false claim for hurricane relief or any \ngovernment benefit, that is a violation of title XVIII, section 1001. I \nhave prosecuted it many times. But persons who are here illegally, \nnoncitizens, can file false statements and then there is a mechanism \nthat blocks that from being actually investigated and perhaps \nprosecuted?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would answer the distinguished Senator by saying there \nhave been some modest steps in improving the flaws in last year's bill. \nAs we have discussed privately and on the Senate floor, I think we \nought to give some credit where credit is due to see this bill \nstrengthened over the flawed bill that passed the Senate last year.\n  But to answer his question, there are still confidentiality \nprovisions in this bill which would allow fraud to go undetected, \nuninvestigated, and not prosecuted. I don't know why in the world we \nwould possibly stand silently and allow that to happen. I am not going \nto, and that is the reason I have offered this amendment.\n  I see on the Senate floor the other distinguished Senator from \nColorado, my friend Mr. Allard, who has also offered other important \nlegislation to allow information sharing between law enforcement \npersonnel. It was as a result of the Swift meatpacking plant raids that \nSenator Allard held meetings on, which I attended, that we learned the \nvery tool that our Federal Government has given employers to confirm \neligibility to work is flawed, and Social Security information cannot \nbe shared with the Department of Homeland Security.\n  So we find people, such as the Swift meatpacking plant operators, \nusing the Basic Pilot to check whether a person shows up and says: My \nname is John Cornyn, and here is John Cornyn's Social Security number. \nThey run it through Basic Pilot. It says, yes, that is John Cornyn's \nSocial Security number, but the fact is, it is Ken Salazar using John \nCornyn's Social Security number, or somebody else, and it doesn't root \nout that kind of fraud.\n  What we need to do is make sure all manner of fraud and illegality \nare capable of being fully investigated, fully prosecuted, where \nwarranted, and that our laws are enforced. That is the flaw that my \namendment seeks to correct. And I continue to believe other amendments \nthat have so far not been allowed to be called up, some 107 that have \nbeen filed, when we actually had votes on 30 amendments in last year's \nbill, and we have only had 7 so far, that we are really not going at \nthe kind of pace at which I would hope we would proceed to be able to \namend and improve this bill in a way that we could be proud of and that \nwe would know would actually work.\n  That, to me, is one of the key pillars upon which this legislation \nought to be built: Will it work? Can it be enforced? If it can't, we \nwill have failed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my good \nfriend from Texas. I wish to respond to the notion that this Chamber is \nnot taking sufficient time in order to consider the issue of \nimmigration and immigration reform. We have, indeed, been on a very \nlong journey to try to grapple with this issue which, at the base of \nit, is the fundamental question of national security.\n  It was last year, for most of the month of May, where this Senate \ndebated a comprehensive immigration reform package. It was an \nimmigration reform package that had gone through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and was amended multiple times on the floor of the Senate. \nNow, for the last many months, perhaps as many as 4 to 5 months, there \nhave been a group of Senators, Republicans and Democrats, working with \nSecretary Chertoff and Secretary Gutierrez and President Bush to try to \ncome up with a comprehensive immigration reform package, which is now \nthe package that is before this Chamber.\n  I submit, in response to my good friend from Texas, that there has \nbeen ample opportunity for us to deal with the issue of immigration \nreform and to come up with a system that is, in fact, workable.\n  On this specific issue, what we have done during this past week is--\nthere have been 23 amendments that have been offered. There have been \n13 of those amendments that have been disposed of--7 of those have been \ndisposed of with rollcall votes, 6 of them with voice votes. There were \n10 amendments pending as of yesterday; there will be 4 more amendments \npending as of today.\n  At the request of many Republican colleagues, Senator Reid agreed it \nwas important for us to take an additional week to be able to fully \ndebate this very complicated and very difficult and very emotional \nissue on how we move forward with immigration reform. We did not get to \na conclusion of this debate this week because Senator Reid\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\nthought it important to take another week to fully consider the \nlegislation before us.\n  Indeed, during the week that Members of the Senate are working back \nin their districts or doing what they may be doing during this next \nweek, it is going to be another opportunity for Members of the Senate \nto continue to study the provisions of this legislation. But this \nlegislation was not pulled out of the darkness one day and placed on \nthe floor of the Senate. This legislation was crafted with significant \ninput from both Republican and Democratic Senators and with the \nguidance of Secretary Chertoff. While it may not be perfect, and while \nthe efforts on the floor of the Senate this week and the week after we \nreturn from the Memorial Day break will improve upon the bill, there \nhas been a huge amount of energy that has gone into creating an \nimmigration reform package that will, in fact, work.\n  At the end of the day, I remind all our colleagues and those who are \nwatching, what is at stake is moving from a system of a broken border \nand lawlessness that relates to immigration in this country to a system \nthat works. We need to find a solution that will fix those broken \nborders. We need to find solutions that will, in fact, make sure the \nlaws of the Nation on immigration are enforced.\n  For 20 years, this country has looked the other way. We are a Nation \nof laws. We ought to be enforcing the laws as this legislation moves \nforward, making sure we are going to have the laws and the capacity to \nenforce those laws in our interior, and we need to have a realistic \nsolution to deal with the 12 million undocumented workers here in \nAmerica. To those who would be part of the ``round them up and deport \nthem'' crowd, I remind them that is an unrealistic solution. As the \nPresident of the United States said during the last week: To round up \n12 million people, to put them on buses and railroads and whatever \nother way one would want to round up those 12 million people and send \nthem elsewhere is not a realistic solution.\n  This proposal that is now before the Senate, which was carefully \ncrafted with significant input from the administration and the \nleadership of the President, is a good way for us to move forward. I \nhope, as we go on into the week after the Memorial Day work period, at \nthat point in time there will be ample opportunity to have a robust and \norderly debate on amendments that my colleagues will bring forth to try \nto further improve the bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1183 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments be laid \naside, that the Senate turn to consideration of an amendment by Senator \nClinton, amendment No. 1183.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for Mrs. Clinton, \n     for herself, Mr. Hagel and Mr. Menendez, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1183 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I see my colleague and friend from \nColorado, Senator Allard, on the floor to speak to his amendment.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Allard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am certainly going to yield to Senator \nAllard, if I may make a brief--about 1-minute--response to my friend, \nSenator Salazar.\n  I have in my hand the bill that was actually laid down by the \nmajority leader and others. It is 789 pages. This is not actually the \nbill we are on. As you know, and as my colleagues know, there has been \na substitute bill that was not put in final legislative language until \nTuesday. Those who did not participate in the closed-door meetings that \nproduced what has been sometimes called the ``grand bargain''--while I \nhave been clear to give them credit where credit is due--I think they \nwould appreciate the fact that not everybody has had access to the same \ninformation. Certainly not all Members of the Senate and our staffs \nhave had access to the legislative text we are actually voting on and \nto which we are actually offering amendments.\n  As the Senator from Colorado acknowledged, we all know how \ncomplicated this subject is. It is enormously detailed. We are doing \nour best to try to keep up. My hope is we can continue to work together \nto try to work our way through this. I think that is the spirit in \nwhich we are all trying to work.\n  Nobody wants to blow this up. We all want to find a solution. We have \nsome differences on what those solutions might be, but this is where \nthose differences are debated, where the process allows amendments, \nsuggested changes and improvements to be offered, and then in the end \nwe will vote. But I wished to express my concerns that we be given the \nopportunity to do a good, conscientious job on behalf of our \nconstituents, on behalf of the American people, in what I believe is \nthe single most important domestic issue confronting our country today. \nThat is the sum and substance of my part.\n  I am glad to yield to the distinguished Senator from Colorado, \nSenator Allard.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have worked on \nthe compromise committee. Senator Cornyn from Texas has done yeoman's \nwork on this issue of immigration. He has a good understanding of the \nbill. I appreciate it. My colleague from Colorado, Senator Salazar, has \nalso worked hard on this particular piece of legislation.\n  I wish to say before Senator Cornyn leaves the floor, how much I \nappreciate his efforts and appreciate the fact that he did put forward, \nthis morning, my amendment dealing with the supplemental schedule for \nZs, that is the Z visas, because I think this is an important issue to \ndebate. I appreciate him doing it for me on my behalf.\n  I am very disappointed the leadership has limited us to only two \namendments that we can call up today. I have a total of about five that \nI am working on. I have four ready to be called up. I was not a member \nof the compromise committee. I know Senator Cornyn is a very honorable \nSenator. Whenever I inquired of him as to what was going on in the \nconference committee, the bipartisan committee, he didn't believe he \ncould share that information with me because he believed he was working \nwithin the committee.\n  The vast majority of us are looking at some of these issues for the \nfirst time. Some of them are issues that have been coming up before the \nSenate from the previous debate and they are old hat. But the fact is, \nthis is a new bill. In my office on Saturday morning, I got a rough \ndraft with things penciled in, in the margins. That is what comes out \nof the committee. Then, as mentioned, on Monday night the substitute \namendment was finally filed in the Senate. It wasn't until Tuesday that \nwe got a final print of the bill. I don't know how many pages are in \nthe final bill--I think it would be close to 1,000 pages in standard \nformat. I do not believe I have had an adequate opportunity to have \ninput. I was assured by the leadership that there is going to be plenty \nof opportunity for amendments--don't worry. But here we are on Friday \nand we are limited to two that we can call up.\n  I have four here at the desk that I have filed, but I think the \npeople need to understand, because you file them doesn't mean you get \nto bring them up and have a vote on them. They have to be made pending. \nThat is what Senator Cornyn has done to help me out on one of my \namendments. I thank him for that effort.\n  First, let me comment a little bit about the general direction of \nthis legislation. In current law we have what we call chain migration. \nWhat happens with chain migration is you come into the United States, \nand once you become legally here in the United States, that allows \nmembers of your extended family to follow you in.\n  We are moving more toward a merit-based system, which is a direction \nin which we need to move. We cannot absolutely go all merit based, but \nI do think it is moving us in the right direction because we do have \nreal needs out there. We need to identify those needs in the workplace. \nIf we need to fill those with immigrants, we need to give business an \nopportunity to do that. On the other hand, probably more important than \nanything is we must make sure we have accountability in the system so \nwe know who is coming into the country and for what purpose; that is, \nthey want to have jobs or they want to be Americans. We don't want \npeople coming into this country because they are terrorists and they \nwant to destroy our society. We don't want people coming into this \ncountry because they are part of a drug cartel or they are smuggling \nweapons--in or out. We do need to secure our borders. I think that is \nthe primary thing we need to accomplish. There are provisions in this \nbill that make me believe our borders will be more secure than as a \nresult of the previous legislation--certainly more secure than what we \nare seeing today on our borders.\n  I do, however, have a number of concerns with the bill. To address \none of those concerns, I introduced amendment No. 1189, which is my \namendment that Senator Cornyn called up, and that refers to the \nsupplemental schedule for Zs. This section, in my point of view, is a \ngreat inequity in the bill because it rewards lawbreakers over law \nabiders.\n\n  Ironically, this inequity is in the same section of the bill that \nrewards would-be immigrants based on merit. The only thing that \nbreaking the law should merit, in my view, is jail time.\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\n  To be clear, I strongly support curbing chain migration and moving \nour system to one based on merit. However, I believe all applicants \nunder the merit-based system should be on a level playing field.\n  By now, most of us are familiar with the bill's merit-based system \nthat awards points to immigrants based on criteria such as employment, \neducation, and knowledge of English.\n  What many may not know is the enormous advantage the bill's point \nsystem gives to people who have violated our immigration laws relative \nto people who are seeking to enter this country legally. I am referring \nto the so-called supplemental schedule for Zs. This separate schedule \nawards up to 50 bonus points, points that are not available to people \nwho have never broken our immigration laws, to holders of Z visas \nseeking permanent status.\n  Holders of Z visas are, by definition, lawbreakers. In fact, this \nbill specifically requires that an alien prove he or she broke the law \nin order to even be eligible for the Z visas. In effect, this \nsupplemental schedule rewards people who entered this country \nillegally. Worse yet, it disadvantages other qualified people who seek \nto enter this country legally.\n  The bill's stated purpose of adopting a merit-based system is that \nthe United States benefits from a workforce that has diverse skills, \nexperience, and training. I happen to agree. I have stated that before. \nI am simply not convinced that a history of breaking the law \ncontributes to this goal more than education and experience. My \namendment simply strikes the special schedule that makes people who \nhave violated our immigration laws eligible for points that others are \nnot eligible for. I strike that provision.\n  I just strike that provision so it puts everyone on a level playing \nfield. Visa holders would, however, still be eligible, up to their 100 \npoints we provided in there under the regular schedule--the exact same \nnumber as anybody else.\n  We should not reward those who have broken the law, and we certainly \nshould not punish those who have abided by the law. I urge my \ncolleagues to support that amendment when it comes up for a vote.\n  Now, I have other amendments I very much would like to put forth. I \nunderstand that if I were to call them up at this particular point in \ntime, I would put my colleague from Colorado in a terrible position, \nthat he would have to object to my amendment when I ask unanimous \nconsent to call it up. I don't want to do that. But what I do want to \ndo is I want to talk about these particular amendments for a moment. \nEven though they have been introduced, I am not going to have an \nopportunity to call them up. I think these amendments are important \nprovisions that would add to the bill in a positive way.\n  One amendment I have is number 1187. Obviously I am not going to have \na chance to call it up today. This particular amendment addresses the \nissue of identity theft and tries to improve the legislation at hand by \nprotecting the identity of hard-working Americans, which is of the \nutmost importance to me.\n  By way of background, this identity theft issue was called to my \nattention when we had some identity thefts that were pretty rampant in \nnorthern Colorado, close to where I live in Greeley, and I have \ndiscovered it is a rampant problem throughout the country.\n  Now, again, I commend the drafters of the bill for including my \nproposal to allow for information sharing between the Social Security \nAdministration and the Department of Homeland Security in the current \nbill. I had an opportunity to meet with the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, Secretary Chertoff, I had an opportunity to meet with the \nSecretary of Commerce, Secretary Gutierrez, and I had an opportunity to \nmeet with my colleagues, including my colleague from Colorado, on this \nmost important issue. I think that including that provision in there \nwhere we have now information sharing between Social Security and \nHomeland Security in the bill is going to be very helpful for us to \nidentify identity theft. If anything else, the real victims in this are \npeople who get their ID stolen, and it is a price they pay for the rest \nof their lives. It tracks with them all the way until they are \nreceiving their Social Security benefits. So it was a critical first \nstep to get this provision in the bill so that we can address the issue \nof identity theft and help many innocent victims.\n  Contributing to the problem is the fact that under current law, \nGovernment agencies are prevented from sharing information with other \nGovernment agencies. After 9/11, one of our stated purposes was to \nbreak down the walls between the various agencies. Well, here we are. \nWe find there is one that is remaining, between Social Security and \nHomeland Security. The bill addresses this issue. Going forward, when \nwe find two names on the same Social Security number, Social Security \ncan contact Homeland Security and say: Look, this is a number which has \ncome to us, and we suspect fraud because we have two names on the same \nnumber. Then when the employer now calls in to check with Homeland \nSecurity about a Social Security number, they can say: Well, we have \nproblems with this particular number. We think this could be an illegal \nimmigrant, and we think you need to further check it out, and we will \nhelp you check it out.\n  Now, this is sort of the program which was in place when we had the \nraids on Swift & Company in Greeley, CO. But I will talk a little bit \nmore about that later.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission 2006 database, victims' \nidentification has been misused to obtain credit cards, bank accounts, \nloans, and a long list of other things, including employment fraud. The \ncurrent national average of employment fraud is 14 percent of all \nreported identity theft occurrences. Nationally, my home State of \nColorado ranks sixth in overall identity theft. Seventeen percent of \nreported cases involve employment fraud, by the way. Massachusetts \nranks 22nd, Pennsylvania 19th, and the FTC designated Arizona as the \nNo. 1 State for identity theft. An estimated 39 percent--almost 40--of \nthose reports involve employment fraud.\n  That is why it is very important that we address this problem which \ncame up when we had the raid on Swift & Company because what was \nhappening with Swift & Company is they were working with Homeland \nSecurity to do what they call a basic pilot. So whenever anybody came \nin to Swift & Company and asked for a job, their employment application \ninformation was sent to Homeland Security. Homeland Security reviewed \nit and said: That is fine, go ahead and hire them, Swift & Company. \nThen Swift & Company goes and hires them. Then those very same people \nthey were supposed to have cleared as legal immigrants, they arrested \nthem for being here illegally. Now, if the Federal agencies cannot \nenforce our immigration laws, how can we expect the employers to comply \nwith the current law? That is why my proposal is so very important. It \nis important to put sound measures in place now to uncover this \nidentity theft and to prevent further damage to these innocent victims.\n  Getting back to my amendment at issue today, Amendment 1187--I have \nnot called it up, just introduced it, and I am not sure I am going to \nget a vote on it. It adds to the list of credentials needed to obtain a \nZ visa. It is an additive to what is already in this bill.\n  The underlying bill requires applicants for Z visas to submit a \nvariety of personal information, such as their name and date of birth. \nMy amendment will add one more piece of information that will offer \npeace of mind to all who have fallen victim to identify theft. It \nrequires the Z visa applicant to disclose all past names and Social \nSecurity numbers they have used in their work in the United States.\n\n  This will create a documented record of compromised identities. \nFailure to provide this information will jeopardize the applicant's \nability to obtain a Z visa. My amendment would permit Government \nagencies to share information with other agencies. These agencies may \nthen notify the rightful assignee, alerting the victim that their \nidentity was compromised, allowing the victim to repair their standing \nwith Government agencies and finance and credit, and finally returning \na sense of personal security and integrity.\n  So I think it is important that we address this issue. We must do \neverything possible to end identity theft. I look\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nforward to working with my colleagues. I hope I will have an \nopportunity to call up this amendment so we can vote on it, so we can \nmake it a part of this particular bill, because it is an important \naspect of identity theft that is simply not addressed in the bill. I \nthink it adds to what we are trying to do in the bill. I am \ndisappointed that I am not going to be able to move forward on this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I also have another amendment, 1188. Again, that \nhas been introduced. This is an amendment which I have put at the desk \nwhich would help prevent further accrual of Social Security benefits by \nunauthorized workers. Currently, the Social Security Administration \ndoes not have real-time information relating to the eligibility of an \nalien to engage in employment in the United States. Consequently, \nsomeone working in the United States on an expired visa continues to \naccrue Social Security benefits for their unauthorized work.\n  My amendment, 1188, would require the Secretary of Homeland Security \nto notify the Commissioner of Social Security when he or she grants, \nrenews, or revokes authority to engage in employment. It then prohibits \nthe Social Security Administration from counting work during that time \nif an individual, if not a citizen or a national, is unauthorized to \nwork in the United States.\n  In summary, this amendment simply facilitates the sharing of existing \ninformation among Government agencies, again to prevent fraud. It is \nforward-looking in nature. It does not look back. It does nothing to \nupset the bill's delicate balance. It is simply a better way of doing \nthings moving forward.\n  So those are some of the issues I have concern about. I am \ndisappointed again that we have put a limit on amendments. They are \nmeaningful amendments and would add to what would be viewed, I think by \nmost Members of the Senate, as positive in nature in trying to help \nsecure this country's borders, to help protect individuals from \nidentity theft and break down the barriers we have or the firewalls we \nhave between various agencies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I will take a look at the amendment my \ncolleague from Colorado has pending, amendment No. 1189.\n  I do wish to say this about my colleague from Colorado: He has been a \nchampion for agriculture all his life. He is a fifth-generation \nColoradan. He understands what it is like out in the country, coming \nfrom a place in Jackson County, Walden, CO, for now five generations.\n  A concern I have with his amendment, and I will take a further look \nat it, is that it seems to strike at the heart of the AgJOBS provision \nof this legislation. The AgJOBS provision of this legislation is an \nessential part of the agreement here that we need to move forward and \ncreate a system that will provide the labor we need to work on our \nfarms and ranches across America.\n  In my own State of Colorado, we have approximately 31,000 farms that \nencompass more than 31 million acres. According to the agribusiness \nstatistics we have, they contribute over $16 billion to the State's \neconomy. We need to make sure we have the labor that is necessary to \nwork out in those fields so that we do not have the destruction we have \nseen in Colorado and California and in almost every State that is an \nagriculturally dependent State.\n  So one of the concerns I have, and I will take a further look at my \ncolleague's amendment, 1189, but I do voice a preliminary concern, and \nI do wish to make sure that at the end of the day, when we have \ncomprehensive immigration reform adopted here in this country, that the \nprovisions of AgJOBS--we have had as many as 67 cosponsors on that \nlegislation--that AgJOBS in fact does remain a part of this \nlegislation. That is legislation which has been worked on for a very \nlong time in a bipartisan fashion, led by Senator Dianne Feinstein as \nwell as Senator Larry Craig. It is a good piece of legislation that we \nneed to deal with in order to make sure we have the labor requirements \nmet for farmers and ranchers across America.\n  Mr. President, I know our colleague from Alabama is waiting to speak, \nand then in the wings I see waiting Senator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to just take a moment, and I see \nmy colleague, Senator McCain, is here and prepared to speak, and I will \nbe pleased to yield the floor and allow him an opportunity to speak.\n  One of the problems we have with this legislation is we have gotten \nout of sync about our normal process on how legislation becomes law, \nhow it should become law, what should be a part of it, particularly \nwhen it is such a massively important, broad, comprehensive bill that \npurports to be moving through the Senate.\n  My colleague used a phrase that has been used frequently, that he was \nconcerned about perhaps this amendment because it might affect an \nessential part of the agreement. Who made an agreement? I have not made \nan agreement. The American people haven't been in on an agreement. We \nhave not gone through the normal process of moving an immigration bill \nthrough committee to the floor with hearings. We had some hearings last \nyear and produced a quite different bill from the one that is on the \nfloor today. This one was cooked up by a hard-working, good group of \nSenators who thought they could just speak for everybody--self-\nappointed, I suppose.\n  Let me display this chart. When this bill was announced, it was said: \nThis is democracy in action. This is what you learn in ninth grade \ncivics. This is good business. But how about our old buddy Mr. Bill who \nwants to become a law. You have heard him say it. Old Bill has a bunch \nof holes in him. He has a lot of loopholes in him. I am going to talk \nabout that in a few minutes.\n  Senator Specter, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, ranking \nRepublican on the committee, part of this effort that worked hard to \ntry to create a bill they thought would be effective, said the other \nday that in retrospect, it would have been better had it gone to \ncommittee. Old Bill, ask him how a bill becomes law. He says: It is an \nidea somewhere. Then it gets written up. Then it goes to the floor. \nThen it goes to committee. The committee has hearings on it and calls \nwitnesses and considers all the details and ramifications and lets the \nAmerican people know what occurred.\n  The way this bill purports to become law is a group of Senators got \ntogether. I affectionately call them ``masters of the universe.'' They \ngot together and wrote up a historic piece of legislation that, if \nplaced in normal bill language, would probably push 1,000 pages, \nprobably the longest piece of legislation ever brought here. It was not \nsent to committee. It was filed at the desk, and the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, called it up without any committee hearing. They had the \nold bill on the floor. They filed cloture this Monday on the old bill. \nThen Monday night, for the first time of record, they plopped down this \nhistoric and incredibly complex, long piece of legislation. It has a \nlot of problems with it. It should not become law. That is what this is \nall about.\n  Now we have gone a week, and we haven't had many amendments voted on. \nThirteen is about all we have voted on by voice, unanimous consent, and \nroll call. Senator Cornyn, who has been engaged in this deeply and \nworked hard on it, former attorney general, Supreme Court Justice of \nTexas, offered some amendments this morning. They were objected to. I \nwas told last night if I put up some amendments to the other side, they \nwould evaluate them, and we would be able to call up one of those \namendments this morning. In truth, both have been objected to. I am not \nable to offer a new amendment this morning. So the first week is gone. \nIn fact, Senator Harry Reid, our esteemed Democratic leader, a person I \nlike and enjoy working with, wanted to complete the bill this week and \nhad it set up to try to complete the bill this week. There was so much \npush back and objection, he said: We will carry it over for another \nweek.\n  I don't believe 1 more week is nearly enough for this legislation, \nfrankly. We need to spend a lot more time on it. I can feel the train \nmoving. There is a method in the way the majority is handling \namendments; that is, you can\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\nonly bring up one amendment at a time. It has to be approved by the \nother side before you can call it up. If you can't call it up, it \nceases to be an amendment that can be voted on postcloture, even if it \nis germane. So the result is, we could proceed with this process in a \nway that does not allow it to be improved in a significant way.\n  I am worried about my friend, Mr. Bill. I don't believe his teachers \nback there in the civics class would be pleased with how he has been \nbumped around. They would not be pleased that he had not gone through \nthe normal process. I will point out some of the loopholes in poor, old \nMr. Bill, as we go along today. Those loopholes will indicate this bill \nshould not be passed in its present form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nAlabama, because I know he has a great deal more to say about the \npending legislation this morning. I appreciate his allowing me a few \nminutes to discuss my view. I thank him for his courtesy.\n  I thank my friend from Colorado, Senator Salazar, for his leadership, \nfor his involvement and his integrity. What a great honor it has been \nfor me to work with him on this and a number of other issues over \nseveral years. I thank him.\n  Immigration reform is long overdue. I am proud to support this \nhistoric overhaul of our immigration system. This bill represents \nweeks, months and, in some cases, years of work by the proponents of \nthis bill. The President has shown tremendous leadership on this issue \nand has dedicated countless hours to the process. While I may not be in \nagreement--and most of us are not in agreement--with each and every \nprovision of the bill, it offers a good starting point for debate and a \ngood framework. The proponents of this bill have come together to try \nto fix one of the most serious issues facing our country. We have put \npartisan politics aside in order to forge a consensual proposal to \nallow us to start a full floor debate on immigration reform. Others \nneed to do the same.\n  Those of us from border States witness every day the impact illegal \nimmigration is having on our friends and neighbors, our county and city \nservices, our economy, and our environment. We deal with the \ndegradation of our lands and the demands imposed on our hospitals and \nother public resources. However, I have learned over the last several \nyears this is not only a border State problem; this is a national \nproblem. It affects the dairy farmers in Vermont and the cattlemen in \nColorado. It also affects the poultry processors in Georgia, the \nconstruction worker in Nevada, and the housewife in Maine. Our current \nsystem doesn't protect us from people who want to harm us. It doesn't \nmeet the needs of our economy, and it leaves too many people vulnerable \nto exploitation and abuse.\n\n  Throughout this debate, we will be reminded that immigration is a \nnational security issue, and it is. It is also a matter of life and \ndeath. We have hundreds of people trying to cross our borders every \nday, an estimated 12 million people living in the shadows of our \ncountry. While we believe the majority are hard-working people \ncontributing to our economy and society, we can also assume there are \nsome people who want to do us harm hiding among the millions who have \ncome here only in search of better lives for themselves and their \nfamilies. We need new policies that will allow us to concentrate our \nresources on finding those who have come here for purposes more \ndangerous than finding a job.\n  Last year the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill, but it \nnever even got to conference. This year we realized we had to take a \ndifferent approach if we wanted to enact real reforms. New ideas and \nconcepts were incorporated into the bill that helped to enhance the \ncomprehensive nature of the bill and ensure the strongest tools were in \nplace to enforce our laws and secure our border. First and foremost \namong our priorities was to ensure this bill included strong border \nsecurity and enforcement provisions. We need to ensure that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has the resources it needs to secure \nour borders to the greatest extent possible. These include manpower, \nvehicles, and detention facilities for those apprehended. But we also \nneed to take a 21st century approach to this 21st century problem. We \nneed to create virtual barriers as well through the use of unmanned \naerial systems, ground sensors, cameras, vehicle barriers, advanced \ncommunications systems, and the most up-to-date security technologies \navailable.\n  This legislation mandates that before we can move forward with a \nprogram to address the undocumented workers currently in the United \nStates or future workers wishing to enter, we must meet certain \nenforcement and security benchmarks that will let everyone know we are \nenforcing our laws and that we are not going to repeat the 1986 \namnesty. These triggers include the hiring of 20,000 Border Patrol \nagents, the construction of 300 miles of vehicle barriers and 370 miles \nof fencing, the establishment of 105 ground-based radar and camera \ntowers along the southern border, and the deployment of 4 unmanned \naerial vehicles and supporting systems. It also includes the end of \ncatch and release, the ability to detain up to 31,500 aliens per day on \nan annual basis, the use of secure and effective identification tools \nto prevent unauthorized workers, and the receiving, processing, and \nadjudication of applications for the undocumented workers applying for \nlegal status.\n  Every one of these items must be in place and fully funded before a \nsingle temporary worker enters our country or a single undocumented \nimmigrant receives a permanent legal status in the United States. I \nbelieve these requirements are a substantial improvement over previous \nmeasures. Not only will this legislation finally accomplish the \nextraordinary goal of securing our borders, it will also greatly \nimprove interior enforcement and put employers on notice that the \npractice of hiring illegal workers simply will not be tolerated. \nBusiness as usual is no longer acceptable, and neither is a de facto \namnesty. This legislation would put in place an effective and practical \nemployment verification system to replace the outdated I-9 system that \nall employers use. In the 21st century, it is unacceptable that \nemployers are still recording important employment eligibility \ninformation with a pen and pad. We need real-time answers that will \ntell employers if the person sitting in front of them is not only \neligible to work here but the person they actually claim to be. \nEmployers will no longer be put in a position of judging documents \npresented to them at face value.\n  The employment verification system in this bill will allow employers \nto electronically verify identity and work eligibility through both DHS \nand the Social Security Administration, while also protecting the \npersonal information of all U.S. workers. If we cannot adequately \nenforce our immigration laws at the worksite, employers will be able to \ncontinue to employ undocumented workers. That is not a scenario we will \nallow under this legislation.\n  We need the ability to have additional legal workers in this country. \nThere are certain jobs Americans are simply not willing to do. For \nexample, today in California, fruit is rotting on the vine and lettuce \nis dying in the fields, because farmers can't find workers to harvest \ntheir crops. At the same time resorts in my own State of Arizona can't \nopen to capacity, because there aren't enough workers to clean the \nrooms. Restaurants are locking their doors because there is no one to \nserve the food or clear the dishes. We are facing a situation whereby \nthe U.S. population does not provide the workers that businesses \ndesperately need. Yet the demand for their services and product \ncontinues.\n  At the same time we have seen, time and time again under the current \nlaw, that as long as jobs are available in this country for people who \nlive in poverty and hopelessness in other countries, those people will \nrisk their lives to cross our borders. Our reforms need to reflect that \nreality and help us separate economic immigrants from security risks. \nThis legislation does just that.\n  The most effective border protection tool we have is establishing a \nlegal channel for workers to enter the United States after they have \npassed background checks and have secured employment. We need to \nestablish a temporary worker program that permits workers from other \ncountries to\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\ncome here and find work and employment and to make sure those people \nare here on a legal basis.\n  Recently, David Brooks wrote in his column:\n       The United States is the Harvard of the world. Millions \n     long to get in. Yet has this country set up an admissions \n     system that encourages hard work, responsibility and \n     competition? No. Under our current immigration system, most \n     people get into the U.S. through criminality, nepotism or \n     luck. The current system does almost nothing to encourage \n     good behavior or maximize the nation's supply of human \n     capital.\n       Let's look at how this bill would improve incentives almost \n     every step of the way.\n       First, consider the 10 to 12 million illegal immigrants who \n     are already here. They now have an incentive to think only in \n     the short term. They have little reason to invest for the \n     future because their presence here could be taken away.\n       This bill would encourage them to think in the long term. \n     To stay, they would have to embark on a long, 13-year \n     process. They'd have to obey the law, learn English and save \n     money (to pay the stiff fines). Suddenly, these people would \n     be lifted from an underclass environment--semi-separate from \n     mainstream society--and shifted into a middle-class \n     environment, enmeshed within the normal rules and laws that \n     the rest of us live by. This would be the biggest values-\n     shift since welfare reform.\n       Second, consider the millions living abroad who dream of \n     coming to the United States. Currently, they have an \n     incentive to find someone who can smuggle them in, and if \n     they get caught, they have an incentive to try and try again.\n       The Senate bill reduces that incentive for lawlessness. If \n     you think it is light on enforcement, read the thing. It \n     would not only beef up enforcement on the border, but would \n     also create an electronic worker registry. People who \n     overstay their welcome could forfeit their chance of being \n     regularized forever.\n\n  I would remind my colleagues the six people arrested who wanted to \nattack Fort Dix, NJ, and to kill Americans--three of them came across \nour southern border illegally; three of them came on valid visas and \noverstayed them.\n\n       Moreover, aspiring immigrants would learn, from an early \n     age, what sort of person the United States is looking for. In \n     a break from the current system, this bill awards visas on a \n     merit-based points system that rewards education, and English \n     proficiency, agricultural work experience, home ownership and \n     other traits. Potential immigrants would understand that the \n     United States is looking for people who can be self-\n     sufficient from the start, and they'd mold themselves to \n     demonstrate that ability.\n\n  In essence, we are rewarding people for working hard and showing \npotential. These are not all high-skilled workers, but they are the \nkind of workers and people we should want to become citizens of our \ncountry. By combining family ties with economic realities, we can build \na stronger immigration system that will help to build a stronger, more \ncompetitive economy and Nation.\n  In addition to future immigrant and nonimmigrant workers, we have to \naddress the fact that 12 million people are living in the United States \nillegally, most of them employed--all of them contributing to our \ncountry. Our economy has come to depend on people whose existence in \nour country is furtive, whose whereabouts and activities in many cases \nare unknown. I have listened to and understand the concerns of those \nwho simply advocate sealing our borders and making life so terrible for \npeople here that they will self-deport. But that is easier said than \ndone.\n  I fundamentally believe our Judeo-Christian society would not \ntolerate this type of treatment of people within our own country, \nwhether here legally or not. We need to come up with a humane, moral \nway to deal with those people who are here, most of whom are not going \nanywhere. No matter how much we improve border security, no matter the \npenalties we impose on their employers, no matter how seriously they \nare threatened with punishment, we will not find most of them, and we \nwill not find most of their employers.\n  The opponents of our proposal to address undocumented workers in this \ncountry decry as amnesty our proposal to bring them out from their \nshadows and into compliance with our laws. No, it is not. Amnesty is, \nas I observe, for all practical purposes, what exists today. We can \npretend otherwise, but that does not make it so. Amnesty is simply \ndeclaring people who entered the country illegally citizens of the \nUnited States and imposing no other requirements on them. That is not \nwhat we do in this legislation.\n  Under the provisions of this legislation, undocumented workers will \nhave incentives to declare their existence and comply with our laws. \nThey may apply for a worker visa. They would be subjected to background \nchecks. They must pay substantial fines and fees, totaling \napproximately $7,000, learn English, enroll in civic education, remain \nemployed and, if they choose to get a green card, go to the end of the \nline behind those who waited legally outside of the country to come in.\n  I believe most undocumented workers will accept these requirements in \norder to escape the fear, uncertainty, and vulnerability to \nexploitation they currently endure. While those who have come here to \ndo us harm will not come out of hiding to accept those conditions, we \nwill at least be spared the Herculean task of finding and sorting \nthrough millions of people who came here simply to earn a living.\n  We are aware of the burdens illegal immigrants impose on our cities \nand counties and States. Those burdens which are a Federal \nresponsibility must be addressed. We need also to face honestly the \nmoral consequences of our current failed immigration system.\n  I am hopeful at the end of this debate we can show the American \npeople that we addressed a serious and urgent problem with sound \njudgment, honesty, common sense, and compassion. I hope we can show \nthat we reached across the aisle to try to solve a serious problem in a \nserious way.\n  It seems almost trite at this point to once again state that our \nNation's immigration system is broken and in bad need of repair. But \nwithout comprehensive immigration reform, it is a fact that our \nNation's security will remain vulnerable. We must act immediately or \nface the consequences of another summer of people dying in our deserts, \nbusinesses shutting their doors because they do not have the manpower \nto stay open, and criminals hiding in the shadows of our society mixed \nin with hard-working people who are the backbone of our economy.\n  The Senate must have the courage and will to solve this crisis facing \nour Nation. The American people are demanding action. I say the time is \noverdue, and we are failing the citizens of the United States if we do \nnot pass this important piece of legislation and ultimately achieve its \nenactment and implementation. If we do fail, what then?\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and I thank my friend from \nColorado.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, for his comments and for his support of this legislation. I \nalso want to say that Senator McCain has always spoken to the highest \nmoral values of this Nation. His history in terms of his contributions \nto this country are unequaled. His involvement in trying to deal with \nthis issue, including addressing it from a moral perspective, is \nsomething I will always admire.\n  I remember well, I say to Senator McCain, when I went to your office, \nprobably 2 years ago, as a freshman Senator. When I was sitting in your \noffice, you pulled out a copy of the Arizona Republic, and I think the \nheadline was: ``300 People Died in the Desert.'' The Senator spoke \nabout the moral basis for us to move forward with comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  The Senator certainly has been a leader in that effort. I thank him \nfor that. I thank him for his integrity, and I thank him for all his \ncontributions to this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I see my friend from Alabama is \nin the Chamber\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the failed immigration policies we have \nnow are in need of reform, in need of comprehensive reform. I said that \nlast year. Some of my colleagues said borders first; and I had sympathy \nwith that and it actually would probably have been a healthy process if \nwe started a year or two ago and established border security and gained \nthe respect and confidence of the American people. We could then have \nbeen bringing forward a comprehensive immigration bill with more \ncredibility than we have today.\n  There is a lot of debate going on, and a lot of posturing going on. \nYou see\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\nthings, such as my good friend, the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nMike Chertoff who is doing a great job--he frames the issue this way: \nIt is a choice between Republican conservatives who want to block the \nbill by insisting on mass deportations or insisting on deportations \nthat are just not going to happen.\n  Well, I am not aware of anybody on our side of the aisle calling for \nmass deportations. That is not so. That is a false setup. That is a \ntriangulation, if you will, good friend, Mr. Chertoff, former U.S. \nattorney. We served together in the Department of Justice. He is one of \nthe best members of the Cabinet. I do not appreciate it, Mike. You tell \nme who on this side said we want to have a mass deportation--zero. That \nis not the question.\n  The question is whether we will have a decent bill that will actually \nwork. I know you have made recommendations that are critical, Mr. \nChertoff, to the passage of the bill that were not included in it. In \nfact, I have to give him credit. He did criticize the liberal \nimmigration rights advocates by suggesting they will prolong the \nanguish by holding off the bill also. But I do not think that is the \nright issue here.\n  All of us want a compassionate, legitimate piece of legislation that \ncan work and will serve our long-term interests and will be consistent \nwith the principles that are set forth by the people who worked on the \nlegislation. But I am not given confidence. I will repeat again: I am \nnot feeling confident at all there will be a legitimate, full, vigorous \ndebate and a lot of amendments that go to some of the weaknesses in the \nlegislation. I am afraid they are not going to be considered.\n  I say that because I see the tactics moving along. We have gone a \nweek with only three, four votes. That is not enough time on a bill of \nthis size and complexity. I think we had 40 or 50 votes on the \nbankruptcy bill. It was nothing more than an updating of bankruptcy \nlaw. It went on for weeks and months. It came through the Senate three \nor four times actually before it finally became law.\n  There were other bills that had far more extensive debate and \ndiscussion than this one. But none of those bills come close to having \nthe impact on America or come close to having the attention of the \nAmerican people to the degree this issue does.\n  The reason the American people are angry and upset is simple. They \nare not angry, they are not upset with immigrants. That is not what I \nread people to be saying. What I think they are angry and upset with is \nCongress and the President for absolutely refusing to listen to their \nnatural and proper concerns about immigration. What I am hearing is \nthey do not want to be taken to the cleaners once again.\n  They do not want to be victims of a bait and switch in which we \npromise we are going to create a system that will work for lawful \nimmigration, that will allow us to have an immigration policy that \nserves the national interest, that allows millions of people to come to \nour country in immigration status--but it would be a number we can have \njobs for, without pulling down the wages of hard-working American \nworkers. It would bring in numbers sufficient to make sure we do not \ncause problems in schools and other areas that we cannot quite handle.\n  The number ought to be correct, and that they ought to be, insofar as \npossible, persons who are going to flourish in our economy, people who \nhave the skills, language, and education levels that indicate they will \nlikely be very successful here, like Canada does. That is what they do. \nWe have a touch of that in this bill--far better than last year, I have \nto say--but I have been so disappointed to read the fine print and to \nsee that movement to follow the philosophy that Canada does has not \nnearly been strong enough. It is discouraging to see it has not been.\n  So the individuals who thought they would meet and reach an agreement \nand plop it on the floor of the Senate--for which all the rest of us \nfolks would just dutifully comply with and ratify and say: Thank you, \nmy elite colleagues. We are glad you have worked out this immigration \nproblem. Thank you so much. We know something had to be done--and it \ndoes have to be done--we are just overjoyed you got Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Kyl and everybody has agreed, and we are going to plop this \nbill down, and you guys will just ratify it. You can have a lot of \nlittle amendments if you want to, but, remember, if anything touches \nthe core principles we have decided on, why, that would be something we \njust couldn't accept, and every one of us is going to stick together, \nand we are going to vote against it, even if we might agree with your \namendment. We had to compromise that to get this agreement. Yes, Jeff, \nwe like that amendment. I know you like that amendment. I really think \nyou are right on that amendment, but I cannot vote with you because I \nhave agreed with this group over here in this secret session which the \npublic was not involved in. We made a commitment to one another, and we \nare going to stick together and vote you down.\n  Now, this is not the way old Bill was taught law was supposed to \noccur in America. It is unbelievable that you would have a piece of \nlegislation of this historic nature not even go to committee and that \nthis group just met. How quick did we have it? Oh, well, we were going \nto have the bill last Thursday so people could read it, and then it was \ngoing to be Friday. We promise we will have the bill Friday. Then it \nturned out to be Saturday morning, at 2 a.m., they emailed it and tried \nto say they put it out Friday. It was Saturday, at best, when the bill \nwas out. They claim it is 300 and some pages. I believe this is it. \nThey say it is 300 pages or whatever the number of pages it is in this \nstack of bills, but they didn't print it in the normal language. I have \nnever seen a piece of legislation of any size go through here and not \nbe in bill language. This is fine print. If you put this bill in bill \nlanguage, it would probably be 1,000 pages. A good immigration bill \nneeds to be 1,000 pages. There are thousands of issues involved that \nneed to be clarified, hundreds and hundreds of complex situations that, \nif not properly addressed, will never work if we don't do it right.\n  That is all I would say to my colleagues and friends. I love you. I \nappreciate all your efforts to try to solve the American people's \nproblems. I know you didn't want to bother with them while you met and \nhad your discussions, except I guess the Chamber of Commerce and this \nspecial interest group and that special interest group and maybe some \npollsters telling this and that; I don't know how that came out. But I \ndon't appreciate the fact that we are not being able to have a full \ndebate on it, and we are not going to be able to have very many \namendments. We could probably, without--well, you say: You are trying \nto file amendments to delay. You want to slow down the process. Well, \nas Senator Specter said, in retrospect, we would have done better had \nthe bill gone through committee, the Judiciary Committee. At least they \ndid last year. It was rammed through the committee last year because I \nsaw it when I was on the committee. This is what happened last year: \nThey waited until the last minute. Senator Frist, the majority leader, \nsays we are going to bring an immigration bill up next Monday. On the \nJudiciary Committee, we are working hard. We go to the Judiciary \nCommittee, and Senator Specter has a bill that had some possibilities. \nIt had problems, but it had some attractiveness to it. It wasn't long \nbefore Senator Kennedy dropped his bill and substituted and the Specter \nbill was gone. We had an entirely new bill. Then they dropped an AgJOBS \nthing on top of that. Then they dropped the DREAM Act, which gives \ninstate tuition to illegal aliens and things of that nature that all \ngot dropped on, passed, pop, pop, pop.\n  Senator Frist says: Well, if you don't have the bill on the floor by \nMonday night, I am going to go with an enforcement only bill. So we \nrush and rush around there and they put the bill down on Monday night \nand here we go. Senator Reid says we don't want any amendments. Senator \nCornyn and Senator Kyl had some amendments. They got their backs up and \nbegan to push back and people said: What are we going to do with a bill \nwithout any amendments? So finally, Senator Frist pulled the bill. He \nsaid: We are not going to bring it back up until the Democratic leaders \nagree we are going to have some amendments. It came back up for a \ncouple of weeks of debate and cleared this body, knowing the House of \nRepresentatives had no intention whatsoever of ever considering it.\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nIt was sort of a gesture because it was not an effective piece of \nlegislation.\n  This year's bill is better than last year's, although I have been \ndisappointed to see that it has backed up on some issues of \nsignificance. I still would say the framework of this year's bill is a \ngood bit better than last year's. Last year's bill should never, ever \nhave become law. It was fatally flawed.\n  So what were the principles that the promoters of this legislation \nsaid should be occurring here? They said we need a lawful system, that \nwe wouldn't have amnesty and that there would be a trigger, which was \nrejected last year, a trigger and a number of other things they cited \nas key component principles of a good immigration bill. All right. I \nagree with that. Many of those principles were sound. But as we read \nthe fine print, our concern is--my fine staff, they have worked hard, \nincluding weekends. They get the bill at 2 a.m. Saturday morning. They \nwork Saturday nights and Sunday nights and here we are on the floor of \nthe Senate. The thing does not even get introduced until Monday night, \nand nobody has had a chance to read it until then. So it is a big \nproblem.\n  My fundamental concern then is that the bill does not live up to the \nstated principles that it contains. So what we need in reform are a \nnumber of things. We need to recognize--unless anyone misinterprets \nthis--we need to recognize we are indeed a Nation of immigrants. We \nare. Some people don't believe that, but I don't believe there is a \nMember of Congress who doesn't understand that. We want and will have a \ncontinuing flow of new people into our country, and it enriches us and \nhas proven to be one of our strengths as a Nation. I think we need to \nrestate that again and again and that immigration will continue in the \nfuture and that we are going to treat compassionately, even generously, \npeople who have broken our laws and come into our country illegally. \nBut we must do it in a way that minimizes the damage that will be done \nto our legal system and our ability to enforce the law in the future.\n  My colleagues have been involved in law enforcement and you get busy \nand you start giving people immunity for this and that crime repeatedly \nand people begin to believe you are never going to enforce it. At some \npoint in the future, you get to the point where you would not be able \nto enforce it. On the floor, I think maybe yesterday, Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, who is such a great Senator, such a direct speaker, asked \nthis question. He said he was here in 1986 when they promised no \namnesty. He is very concerned because it didn't work and he felt \nresponsibility for that. He was not going to be a part of new \nimmigration legislation that doesn't work such as the 1986 legislation. \nHe said: In 1986, they said we are not ever going to have amnesty \nagain, and he asked this question: Have you heard any of the promoters \nof this legislation say we will not have amnesty again? He said: You \nare not going to hear them say that. That is one thing you would not \nhear because after--because if we give amnesty again, what good is it \nto even say we are not going to do it? Because what principle, what \nbasis on which to stand will we have 10, 12, 15 years from now when \nseveral million other people are in our country legally and someone \nsays they are here illegally, why don't we enforce the law and ask them \nto go home. Oh, well, you gave amnesty before. You gave amnesty in \n2007, you gave amnesty in 1986. How can you enforce the law now?\n\n  So to not understand as a matter of law and principle that once \nagain, taking the easy amnesty step will make it almost impossible in \nthe future for us ever to enforce the law is a mistake.\n  I read the debate in 1986--a lot of it. It went just like that. \nPeople said: One-time amnesty. We have to do this. Own-time amnesty. \nThe others said: Well, we are not sure about this. We think if you have \nan amnesty and you wipe out the laws that we had here and the \nviolations that have occurred, you are liable to increase the threat in \nthe future that more people will break into our country illegally on \nthe expectations that they, too, after a period of time, will be \nallowed to stay legally. If you read that debate, you will see whose \npredictions were correct. I have to say that. I have to say that.\n  So I think the Z visa program that allows people who come here \nillegally to stay here illegally, to come out of the shadows with some \nsort of status, but not, I would suggest, as it is now written giving \nthem a guaranteed path to receiving every single benefit that accrues \nto people who come legally, I don't think we should do that. That is my \nprinciple. If you didn't follow the rules, somehow, it ought to be \nclear that you will never get every single benefit of citizenship and \nparticipation in America than if you waited in line. If you give up on \nthat principle, we have a problem. So I think if we had the courage and \nthe firmness and the strength in this Senate and would listen to the \nAmerican people, we would say the principles of 1986 are going to be \naffirmed. OK. We will figure out a way you can stay, your children can \nbe citizens, you can have all the protections of the laws of our \ncountry but not every benefit of citizenship, and we will never, ever \nagain do that. If we give away that position, I think we have a \nproblem.\n  So what I would like to talk about is some of the loopholes in this \nbill. I talked about the loopholes last year in the bill and there were \nquite a number of them. This is not an exhaustive list. You heard \nSenator Allard earlier this morning make comments about the weaknesses \nin the legislation, and you heard Senator Cornyn point out some \nweaknesses in the legislation. I have identified 15. We certainly would \nnot be able to talk about all those this morning that I wish to talk \nabout, but there are many more. It is troubling that we might not be \nable to have an opportunity to fully amend the bill to fix these \nloopholes.\n  Our old buddy, Bill, the ideal way that laws should be written in \nAmerica, well, he has been forgotten in this process. I will tell you \nwhat could happen in the House of Representatives. I don't think they \nare having any serious hearings over there. This bill could hit the \nHouse of Representatives if it came out of the Senate--and it may well \ncome out of this body--it could hit the House of Representatives. They \ncould call it up. They don't have unlimited debate. They don't have a \nvery strong ability to cut off debate. They could vote the bill out. It \ncould go to conference. The conferees will be chosen and controlled by \nSenator Reid, the Democratic leader, and the Speaker of the House, \nNancy Pelosi, and they will appoint the people they want to fix any \ndifferences in the bill, and they can make virtually any changes they \nwant to. Then the bill is on the floor, and it is either up or down, \nand it might pass. As one Member of the House said about whether \nPresident Bush would sign it, he said President Bush would sign a pork \nchop if it had immigration reform on it. We have to be careful what we \ndo and what is in this bill.\n  It can affect what is actually going to become law. There is no \npassing this off to the House of Representatives, like last year, as if \nthat was going to fix many of the problems that were in the \nlegislation. The House is liable to make it worse. Well, you have heard \none of the principles in the bill.\n  I am glad to hear Senator McCain say there was a trigger in the \nlegislation. He resisted a trigger last year. We had quite a debate on \nit. Those opposing it last year said you cannot have a trigger because \nall of us who met and wrote the bill don't want a trigger; you will \nupset our compromise. I asked then--and I ask today--who was in this \ncompromise? Did you have public hearings? Were people allowed to do \nwhat you were discussing? Did La Raza get to put in their opinion? Did \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce get to put in their opinion? Who all got \nto put in their opinion? They didn't ask my opinion--well, that is not \ntotally so; I did talk to a couple of them, whom I expressed some \nopinions to. Fundamentally, that is just not an open process. Sometimes \nyou can do something like that as a tough nut to be cracked, and people \nhave to make a decision. But this is too big, too broad, too much \npolicy. The American people are too concerned about it, and it is too \nimportant to be settled that way.\n  Let me tell you what the trigger was about. I offered in the \nJudiciary Committee last year--because it dawned on me that in \nJudiciary Committee, I offered an amendment to say: Let's add border \npatrol, and they accepted it. I\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\noffered an amendment that showed how we don't have enough bed spaces to \nend catch and release, saying you had to have more. They accepted that. \nI offered amendment after amendment, and they accepted them. I thought, \nwhy is this? So I offered amendments to change the policy to make the \nlaw actually enforceable, and they got voted down.\n  Why would that be so easy? Because the brain trust that was proposing \nthat bill last year knew the history of 1986; they knew how Congress \nworked, and they knew they never had any intention of funding all the \nBorder Patrol agents and the fencing and the prison beds. We could pass \nan authorization bill to build prisons, and they are never going to get \nbuilt, I am telling you. I will show you examples. It means nothing.\n  So I offered a trigger. It finally dawned on me what this was about, \nhow the game was going to be played out. I offered an amendment that \nsaid: You don't get any of this amnesty until the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity certifies that he has operational control over our lawless \nborder. They voted that down.\n  So Senator Isakson, from Georgia, picked that up and wrote it in even \nmore detail when the bill came to the floor and offered the amendment. \nWe had quite a debate over this because it was important--the trigger \nwas important. The cabal who put all of it together said: We cannot do \nthat because it would upset our delicate compromise in the groups that \nparticipated in writing this bill--not the American people--and they \nwould oppose it. They voted it down. It was a fairly close vote, but \nthey voted down the trigger because they really didn't want that \ntrigger because they never intended to do the things that were in the \nbill. The trigger would have said: You have to build a fence, you have \nto build the prison beds, and you have to hire the people. If you don't \ndo those things--and actually do them--the other stuff doesn't become \nlaw, the amnesty. That was the debate last year.\n  This year, they say: We got the message, we are going to have a \ntrigger. Well, good. I was happy about that. That sounded good. This is \none of our principles. This time, we are not going to mislead the \nAmerican people. We are really going to do what we promised and have a \ntrigger, and you can relax, Sessions, because we are not going to fool \nyou this time. It is not going to be like 1986.\n  But the problem is that the trigger doesn't get us there. I just have \nto tell you that. The trigger only applies to the guestworker program \nand taking illegal aliens off the probationary Z visa, and all other \nprograms in the bill will begin immediately. So if the trigger is never \nmet--if the trigger that is supposed to be met is never met, these \nrequirements we put in there to ensure that we were going to follow \nthrough with enforcement, if they are never met, the probationary \nstatus in the amnesty group never expires.\n  After the bill passes, Homeland Security has 180 days to begin \naccepting Z visa applications. They would accept them for 1 year and \ncan extend the application filing for another year. When the trigger is \nmet, if it ever is, Homeland Security will start approving the \napplications they have been processing and adjudicating. What happens \nif the trigger is never met? Will the probationary amnesty end or \nexpire? Those are pretty good questions. If the trigger is never met, I \ncan answer it for you: The Z visa probationary status never ends in the \nbill.\n  It is explained on page 291, line 17:\n\n       Probationary authorization document does not expire until \n     ``6 months after the date on which the Secretary begins to \n     approve applications for Z visas.''\n\n  So if the trigger is never met, if the Department of Homeland \nSecurity never starts approving the applications and the 6-month clock \nnever starts ticking, therefore, the probationary authorization \ndocument never expires.\n  My staff asked about this in one of the briefings by the group \npromoting the bill. The staffers asked: Does the Z visa probationary \ncard ever expire? The answer was: Well, because the triggers are going \nto get met sometime, in fact, it is not going to expire.\n  So, in addition, we need to remember that there is no guarantee that \nthe additional enforcement items--I talked about that earlier--in title \nI and title II of this legislation that purport to be effective in \nenforcing the law--there are dozens of things there that are not listed \nin the trigger. The question is, Will they ever be funded?\n\n  You should be aware, sophisticated Americans and Members of the \nSenate, that there is no obligation or requirement whatsoever that \nthese things ever get funded in the future. The bill itself \nacknowledges that in many different places.\n  So with regard to some of the things in the bill that are supposed to \nmake enforcement better and make the system work better, they use this \nphrase--they say, ``subject to the availability of appropriations.''\n  That phrase is used 18 times in the bill. What does that mean? It \nmeans we are going to increase our prison beds, increase border patrol, \nand do all these things which are in our law, and we are going to \nenforce the law subject to the availability of appropriations. Well, \nsomebody probably wants a bridge in their home State or a highway or a \nuniversity grant in their home district--more money for this or that, \ngood programs or bad programs, but that is how these things get lost \nout in the competition for spending. They don't get done. They \nacknowledge that.\n  The phrase ``authorized to be appropriated'' is used 20 times. So \nthey are saying we are authorizing to be appropriated money to do this, \nthat, and the other. They are going to make this bill good. So our \nmasters of the universe come out and say: Don't worry, American people, \nI know you think we are not going to enforce the law, but we have new \nBorder Patrol officers and prison spaces and fencing, and they add the \nphrase. But all it really says in the legislation is that it is \nauthorized to be appropriated. There is no way they can guarantee that \nCongress next year is going to appropriate the money for what they put \nin the bill.\n  All of that was key to the trigger effect. I have to tell you that, \nin my view, the trigger is not nearly strong enough. It has been \nundermined, and virtually everything in the trigger has already been \ncompleted or is soon to be completed. It doesn't have some of the new \nthings that have been promised here in the trigger.\n  Loophole No. 2. This is very important. The enforcement trigger does \nnot require that the U.S. visa exit portion of US-VISIT--the biometric \nborder check system that records that you have come into the country--\nwill be implemented. It was required by Congress in 1996. Over 10 years \nago, we required that the US-VISIT exit system be in place; that is, if \nyou have a visa to the United States for 6 months or 30 days or a year, \nyou come in and present your card, it goes into the computer system, \nlike at the bank or like your timeclock where you work, it clocks you \nin, and then it clocks you out. If you don't exit when you are supposed \nto, red flags can go up that you didn't exit when you were supposed to. \nYou are an ``overstay.'' It is an absolutely critical step in creating \na lawful immigration system that will work. It was required to be \ncompleted in 2005. Here we are in 2007, and it is not completed. Did we \npromise to complete it as part of the trigger? No, no, no. There would \nbe no way to ascertain whether people exit when they are supposed to.\n  Under the bill, it says a certain number of people come seasonably, \nor certain people for 2 years, and sometimes family members can come \nfor 30 days, and sometimes family members can come for 2 years--those \nkinds of things. Who is going to find out if they didn't go home when \nthey were supposed to? Over a third of the people in our country \nillegally came legally but overstayed their visa, and many have no \nintention of returning to their home country whatsoever. We don't even \nknow they didn't return because we have no way to clock out when they \nleft. We have no idea who left when they were supposed to leave.\n  This is why I say the legislation before us was designed to fail. I \nam not sure the Members all designed it to fail, but the effort, when \nit came down to it, when confronted with things which would actually \nwork and which are critical to the success of an effective border \nsystem, they weren't in there, and that sends you a signal on what is \nreally there.\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\n  In 1996, we required, as I said, this US-VISIT system to have an exit \ncomponent by 2005, and it is still not complete. Do you think that in \n1996, Members of the Congress and Members of the Senate went out and \ntold their constituents that we are working on immigration; we passed a \nbill that will have an exit system in 10 years or 9 years, and that \nwill help us enforce the law, and I am so proud we passed that? What \ngood is it to pass it if it never happens? It hasn't happened yet, and \nit is not required through the trigger, which is the only thing that \ncan require it to work.\n  According to the Pew Hispanic Center's 2006 report entitled ``Modes \nof Entry for Unauthorized Migrant Population'':\n\n       4 to 5.5 million of the current illegal alien population \n     ``entered legally'' and are non-immigrant visa overstayers.\n\n  Despite what we know about the overstay rates, the US-VISIT exit \nsystem is not made part of the trigger. That is a very big loophole.\n  I don't think we are serious if we don't have an exit system. One \nmight say it is hard to do. We have had 10 years. I will say one thing, \nif President Bush wanted the exit system to be in place, he would have \nit in place. If Congress wanted it in place, we would have it in place.\n  A separate section of the bill does require the Department of \nHomeland Security to submit to Congress a schedule for developing an \nexit component. That is not good enough.\n  Loophole No. 3, one of these little spots in poor old Bill who got \nshot up because he didn't go to committee like he was supposed to learn \nin civics class. He is supposed to go to committee. Maybe some \nloopholes would have been closed if we had an opportunity to talk about \nit publicly before the whole world.\n  Loophole No. 3: The bill does not require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to have enough bed space to actually end catch and release at \nthe border and in the interior. It only requires Homeland Security to \nmaintain its current level of bed space and establishes a ``catch, pay, \nand release'' program that benefits illegal aliens from countries other \nthan Mexico who are caught at the border and who can post a $5,000 \nbond.\n  A $5,000 bond is not hard to post if you know how the system works \nand you are prepared. It can be done any number of ways. But let's say \nan individual has a cousin or uncle or someone in the United States and \nthey come into the country and are apprehended, and they came from \nEurope or Brazil or someplace other than Mexico. All you have to do is \npost a bond and then you are released pending some hearing on \ndeportation.\n  We have had this problem for a number of years. Secretary Chertoff \nhas made some progress in ending it, and I give him credit for that. \nThere was an article in a newspaper that showed that people other than \nMexicans--you see, it is not easy to deport them. It is easy to take a \nperson back to Mexico, but how do you take a person back to Chile, \nBrazil, Indonesia, or Belarus? It takes some effort to do this. So they \nwere releasing everyone on bail because they didn't have any bed space, \nand asking them to show up at some given time so they could deport \nthem. If a person is willing to break into the country in violation of \nthe laws, how many of those people are going to show up after they have \nbeen apprehended to be flown out of the country? No, not zero; 95 \npercent don't show up. That is what the number is. In fact, some of the \nrules smugglers told their people to follow is if you see an \nimmigration officer, turn yourself in because they will take you \nfurther inland, they will process you, and let you out on bail, and you \nnever have to come back, which is exactly what 95 percent are doing. It \nis a mockery of the law and, in some areas, we have made progress, but \nthat is not a part of the trigger.\n  What about the bed space? You have to have a certain amount of bed \nspace or you can't hold people. Over the past 2 years, the Senate \nappropriated money for 9,000 new beds, bringing us to a total of 27,500 \nbeds. This is the current funding level, 27,500 beds. We have already \nfunded that amount. Nothing new was added to the requirements of the \ntrigger until the Gregg amendment was adopted earlier this week. Now \nthe trigger requires Homeland Security to reach a detention bed space \nof 31,500 beds, 4,000 more.\n  The 27,500 beds, however, are far less than the 43,000 detention beds \nrequired under current law to be in place and constructed by the end of \nthis year.\n  OK, cynics out there, does that provide fuel to your fire? How about \nthat? Does that breach cynicism? We require in the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 that this country have 43,000 beds \nby the end of this year, but when this bill came up, they only had in \nthe trigger portion, the thing that would guarantee we reach that \nlevel, 27,500 beds. Senator Gregg raised the number to 31,500, but in \n2004, when Senators went out and bragged that they raised our number to \n43,000 detention beds, that was supposed to be met, and we have no \nintention of meeting it, I submit. Because it is in bill language \ndoesn't mean it will ever happen.\n  This month, a Federal lawyer who used to be with the Bureau of \nPrisons, Joseph Summerill, wrote an op-ed piece--he used to be with the \nBureau of Prisons, so he knows this issue. As a lawyer, he was a \ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons, and he now practices with the firm \nof Greenberg Traurig.\n  He says the following:\n\n       . . . the demand for deportation and removal operation \n     detention space has grown much faster than available bed \n     space has. . . .\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Despite the fact that high-risk/high-priority immigrants \n     include immigrants who are associated with criminal \n     investigations, have committed fraud, or are likely to \n     abscond, these immigrants are often released because of the \n     lack of detention bed space. . . .\n       The lack of detention bed space has resulted in creating a \n     de facto amnesty program for illegal immigrants who are \n     subject to removal, particularly those immigrants from \n     countries ``other than Mexico.''\n\n  From 2002 to 2004, he explains:\n\n       DRO--\n\n  That is the detention and removal operation\n\n       DRO personnel levels grew by only 3 percent and the funding \n     of bed space decreased by 6 percent. According to the \n     inspector general, declining funds, the shortage of DRO \n     personnel, and decreased bed space led to a 38 percent \n     increase of illegal immigrants released by the DRO.\n\n  We are supposed to be fixing this catch-and-release program. I \nthought we were. Here this former lawyer with the Bureau of Prisons \nsaid we had a 38-percent increase in illegal immigrants being released. \nHe concludes:\n\n       DRO has faced annual mandates by Congress, the President, \n     and the American people to increase the number of illegal \n     immigrants who are detained. Unfortunately, Federal funding \n     has not kept pace with these mandates. . . .\n\n  So it is clear we need a lot more beds, and 31,500 beds, as we \napproved in an amendment the other day, is better than 27,500, but it \nis not enough.\n  So why are the American people cynical? We passed a law in 2004 \nrequiring 43,000 beds by the end of this year. We are at 27,500. It is \nnot likely to ever happen, and that is why they did not put it in the \ntrigger because if they did, those bed spaces would have to be \ncompleted.\n  Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague Senator Bond from \nMissouri in the Chamber. He is a most capable Senator. I appreciate his \nleadership. I have a number of loopholes I could talk about and will \ntalk about in the days to come.\n  I am raising these issues to say I can't vote for a bill that is \nlikely to clear the House of Representatives and be signed by the \nPresident with loophole after loophole after loophole. I cannot go to \nmy constituents and say I am pleased we have now passed legislation \nthat will actually work to create a lawful system, that will treat \ncompassionately the people who are here, will create a flow in the \nfuture based on merit and competition, and will do a lot of other \nthings we want done, the sponsors of this bill are saying they want \ndone, and asking us to vote for this bill because they say it will \naccomplish that.\n  My disagreement is not with their principles and their stated goals, \nbut my disagreement is the language in the legislation is dramatically \nineffective to accomplish that.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to \nspeak\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nbriefly. I have proposed an amendment which I believe is very important \nto this bill to cut the automatic path to citizenship. It is filed at \nthe desk, and I will call it up later.\n  Citizenship is the most sacred gift Americans can provide. It should \nnot serve as a reward to those who broke the law to enter or remain in \nthis country. The path to citizenship is at the heart of the amnesty \ncriticism of this bill. Cutting this path cuts out the most severe \ncomplaint about this bill.\n  I supported the Vitter amendment yesterday to strike the entire \nprogram proposed to deal with 12 million illegal aliens in the country. \nUnfortunately, that amendment was rejected. So today I propose a much \nmore targeted, focused amendment to strike the controversial aspect of \nthe proposal to give the award of citizenship to those 12 million \nillegal aliens.\n  Whatever we end up doing with those 12 million illegal aliens, it \ndoes not require the further step of giving them a path to citizenship \nahead of others. Those 12 million illegal aliens came to this country \nto work without the expectation of becoming citizens. More illegal \naliens will come to this country on a temporary basis to work without \nexpectation of citizenship. There is no need to grant these people the \ngift of citizenship.\n  Specifically, my amendment will strike the contents of section 602 on \nearned adjustment of Z status aliens, replacing it with a prohibition \non issuing an immigrant visa to Z nonimmigrants which is currently in \nthe bill and a prohibition of adjusting a Z nonimmigrant to legalize \npermanent resident or so-called green card holder.\n  In this way, the path to citizenship is cut off. I urge the Senate to \ncall up and adopt this amendment. I believe it will enable other goals \nin the bill to be accomplished without giving the amnesty path to \ncitizenship.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to make one correction. I think I \nsaid we had four or five votes, or three or four votes, or something of \nthat nature. My staff tells me we have had seven votes this week. I \nthink that is better than four, but that would indicate that in 2 weeks \nwe will have had about 14 votes. That is not enough, in my view, to fix \nthe problems in this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \nheartfelt statements concerning this very important issue that faces \nour country today.\n  I wish to do two things here. First, I wish to remind the Senate how \nfar along this road we have come. This debate on immigration reform is \nnot one that started on this Monday. It is indeed a debate the Senate \nstarted over a year and a half ago, and it started in the Judiciary \nCommittee. It then went through nearly a month of debate, with many \namendments and changes, and ultimately a bill that was passed out of \nthe Senate, this comprehensive immigration reform, by a vote, as I \nrecall, of 64 Senators voting to move that bill forward.\n  Now, that was a year ago. We are now a year ahead, and what has \nhappened during this past year is that there have been continuing \nconversations about how we might be able to create an immigration \nreform system that works for our country. After many hundreds, perhaps \nthousands, of hours of meetings, which included the White House and \nincluded the leading members of many of the committees in the Senate, \nthere was a bill that was crafted. It may be an imperfect bill, but \npart of what is happening today is that, as amendments have been \ncrafted and introduced, there is an effort to make the legislation \nbetter.\n  At the end of the day, I wish to give thanks to all those Members of \nthe Senate and members of the President's Cabinet, and the President \nhimself, for what they have done in moving this immigration debate \nforward.\n  I will also add that our majority leader, Senator Reid, long ago gave \nwarning to the Members of the Senate that we were going to move forward \nto immigration. This was not a surprise to the Members of the Senate. \nMonths ago, Senator Reid said we have to deal with this most \nfundamental national security problem of our time, and what I will do \nis I will reserve time at the end of May so we can deal with \nimmigration reform.\n  Well, he did that, and he kept everybody's feet to the fire. At the \nbeginning of this week, Senator Reid made the decision he would allow \nanother week of debate. So that, at the end of the day, we will have \nhad 3 weeks to study and debate the legislation that was put together.\n  I will remind my colleagues there has been significant progress made. \nThere have been 23 amendments that have been offered. Of those, 13 have \nalready been disposed of. Seven of them were disposed of this week with \nrollcall votes, six disposed of with voice votes. As of yesterday, \nthere were 10 pending amendments. Today, there have been four more \namendments that have been offered, and the beginning debate on those \namendments has taken place. So the majority leader's decision to add 1 \nmore week to continue the deliberation on this bill is something which \nis needed and something which we all appreciate. Hopefully, what it \nwill lead to is the passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill \nthat is good for the American people.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to sum up, from my point of view, why \nthis legislation is so important. We now know we have a system in \nAmerica for immigration which is broken. It is a system of lawlessness \nand it is a system that victimizes a lot of people, from the people who \nare the workers to the employers of this country. We also know it is a \nsystem that has been broken for a very long time. Our laws have not \nbeen enforced on immigration. The United States has chosen, instead of \nenforcing the law, to look the other way. Indeed, over the last 5 or 6 \nyears, as I understand it, there have been less than four enforcement \nactions taken against employers across the country, on average.\n  When we have that kind of chaos and lawlessness and the kind of \nbroken borders we have, what does it do to the United States? The first \nthing it does is it compromises our national security. How can we have \nnational security in a post-9/11 world when we don't know who is coming \ninto our country? We have 400,000 or 600,000 people coming here \nillegally every year. How can we say to the American people that the \nnational security interest of the United States is being protected? How \ncan we do that? We cannot do that. How can we, as Senators and as \npeople who are leading our Government, say to the people of our country \nthat in this democracy we are upholding the rule of law, when we look \nthe other way instead of enforcing the laws of the country? In my view, \nwe need to move forward and we need to develop comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  As I have looked at this legislation and the different aspects of the \nlegislation that have been crafted together, it seems to me we need to \nlook at the comprehensive approach as though we were looking at a \ntripod. We have to ask ourselves this question: What is the aim of this \nlegislation?\n  The first aim, in my view--one leg of the tripod--is to fix our \nborders. We have broken borders. We have broken borders today. So we \nhave proposed in our legislation an additional number of Border Patrol \nagents to help us secure the border. We started out in this legislation \nwith 18,000 additional Border Patrol officers. Through an amendment by \nSenator Gregg, that number is now up to 20,000 Border Patrol agents. \nThat is significant additional manpower that is going to go to the \nborder.\n\n  We have approved at least 370 miles of fencing. So we will have \nfencing that will go into the strategic places along the border. We \nalso have included in the legislation 200 miles of vehicle barriers. We \nhave included 70 ground-based radar and camera towers. We have included \nfour unmanned aerial vehicles. We have included new checkpoints and \npoints of entry.\n  So one of our aims is to secure the border, and the legislation we \nhave put forward, with the assistance and leadership of Secretary \nChertoff, will ensure we have a protected border.\n  We also need to then ask ourselves: What are our other aims? It \ndoesn't do much good to secure our borders but within our country we \nsimply continue to ignore the law. So we need to enforce the law within \nthe country. That\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\nought to be our second aim. That is the second leg of this tripod: how \nwe enforce our laws within our country. So we must secure America's \ninterior.\n  How are we going to do that? Well, our legislation does that in a \nnumber of ways. First, we will increase the detention capacity of our \nimmigration enforcement system to be able to hold those who are here \nunlawfully at the number of 27,500 a day--27,500 beds in detention \nfacilities for those who are caught here unlawfully.\n  Secondly, we will go ahead and hire an additional 1,000 new ICE \ninvestigators to help us deal with the investigations of the laws that \nare broken under our immigration system. We will hire 2,500 new Customs \nand Border Protection workers. We will reimburse State and local \ncommunities, State and local communities that today are having to deal \nwith the problems relating to criminal aliens. We will create a new \nemployer verification system so that employers know the person they are \nhiring is legal and authorized to work in the United States, and we \nwill do it in a way that does not put an unnecessary burden on American \nemployers. We will hire an additional 1,000 new worksite compliance \npersonnel. We will increase the penalties for gang activity, for fraud, \nand for human smuggling. We will streamline the background check \nprocess, we will require new fraudproof immigration documents with \nbiometric identifiers, and we will encourage partnerships between \nFederal and State and local law enforcement to make sure our laws are, \nin fact, being enforced.\n  So the second aim--to secure America's interior--is something we have \ncovered amply in this legislation.\n  The third aim--the third leg of this tripod--is to secure America's \neconomic future. I wish to speak briefly about three aspects of how we \nwill secure America's economic future.\n  First, the AgJOBS Act. The AgJOBS legislation allows us to maintain \nour current agricultural workforce. It will reform the existing \nagriculture program and make it effective. That legislation has been \ncrafted to a point where I think there are 567 organizations that have \nendorsed it, from the Colorado Farm Bureau, to the Farmers Union, to \nevery single agricultural organization in America.\n  The leaders on AgJOBS in the Senate, Senator Feinstein and Senator \nCraig, have been eloquent in making their statements about the need for \nthe agricultural community, farmers and ranchers, to be able to have a \nstable workforce. We need to stop the rotting of the vegetables and the \nfruits in California, in Colorado, and across this country. The only \nway we are going to be able to do that is if we have a stable workforce \nfor agriculture.\n  We also include in this legislation, as part of securing America's \nfuture, a new temporary worker program. Yes, it is a program that is \ncontroversial. It is very controversial on the Democratic side, and \nthere are some Members on the Republican side as well who do not like \nthat particular piece of legislation. I will say this, however. When we \ncrafted the legislation, we included the kinds of worker protections to \nmake sure the exploitation of past programs will not occur.\n  In the past, there were programs, such as the Brasero program, from \nyears ago, in which there was massive exploitation of workers who were \nbeing brought here for a short period of time. What we have done in \nthis legislation is to make sure that massive exploitation will not \noccur because the worker protections have been included in this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, we will secure America's economic future by providing a \nrealistic solution to the 12 million or so American people who are \nworking in America, who have come here illegally, and who are in an \nundocumented status. That, at the end of the day, in many ways, has \nbeen the most contentious item we have debated in immigration reform. \nWhat do we do with the 12 million people here who are working in our \nfactories, who are making our beds, who are fixing our food in our \nrestaurants, and who do all the work here in America to make sure \neverybody's daily needs are taken care of? They interface with us in \nour daily lives.\n  Some people have said, as all of us have heard, I am sure, every \nSenator here, we ought to round them up and deport them all; we ought \nto have a mass deportation of the 12 million people here in America \ntoday.\n  A mass deportation. Well, there is a fiscal cost associated with \nthat. Some people have made an estimate that it would cost multiple \nbillions of dollars to be able to round up all these people and to \ndeport them.\n  Can we actually do it? Can we actually deport 12 million people? If \nwe were to deport 12 million people, in my view, No. 1, we would have a \nmassive dislocation in the American economy; No. 2, it would be an un-\nAmerican thing for us to do as a people because it would be inhumane. \nThese 12 million people have brought their hopes and dreams to America, \nand they have contributed significantly to the workforce. It is our \nbroken system which has allowed the illegality that has taken place to \noccur over a long period of time. So what we have crafted is a way \nforward that provides a realistic solution to how we deal with these \npeople.\n  Now, on the other side, and in some places of our country, what we \nhear is a loud cry of amnesty. Well, I join President Bush and my \ncolleagues, Senator John Kyl and Senator Kennedy, in saying this is not \namnesty. What we are doing is saying, first of all, they will have to \npay a penalty. When someone breaks the law in this country, they have \nto pay for having broken the law. If you do the crime, you have to do \nthe time. Well, what we are saying is that the law has been broken, and \nthey are going to have to pay very hefty penalties in order to come \ninto compliance with the law.\n  We also say they have to go to the back of the line. The fact that \nsomeone came here illegally and crossed the border illegally will not \ngive them an advantage against those who are trying to come in through \nour system in a very legal fashion. So all these people, the new Z \ncardholders, will go to the back of the line.\n  The next thing we will do is, we will require them to return home \nbefore they can apply for their green card. They will have to go home \nto a country outside the United States and do a touchback before they \nare able to come back in. We will require them to learn English. We \nwill require them to remain crime free. I could go on and on with \nrespect to the requirements.\n\n  I have often said to those who claim this is amnesty, this is not \namnesty, this is purgatory. You are basically taking these 12 million \npeople and putting them in a purgatory status for a very long time \nbefore they would ultimately be eligible for a green card. That is a \npurgatory for a minimum of 8 years and for many as much as 12 years.\n  The legislation that has been crafted in a bipartisan way that is \nbefore this body is legislation which is tough, it is fair, it is \npractical, it is realistic. Our national security requires us to move \nforward with this legislation. Our economic security requires us to get \nto the finish line. The moral values of America that have guided \nAmerica for so long require us to be successful in this mission.\n  As we conclude the week's debate on immigration, I would like to read \na prayer, a prayer that was written by a person who knew a lot about \nimmigration because he saw a lot of the victimization that occurred \nwhen there was a broken system of immigration in this country. That was \nthe founder and President of the United Farm Workers of America, Cesar \nChavez, who passed away in 1993. He was a friend of mine. I knew him, \nand I knew his family. This is what he wrote. He said in his prayer:\n\n     Show me the suffering of the most miserable;\n     So I will know my people's plight.\n     Free me to pray for others;\n     For you are present in every person.\n     Help me take responsibility for my own life;\n     So that I can be free at last.\n     Grant me courage to serve others;\n     For in service there is true life.\n     Give me honesty and patience;\n     So that the spirit will live among us.\n     Let the spirit flourish and grow;\n     So that we will never tire of the struggle.\n     Let us remember those who have died for justice;\n     For they have given us life.\n     Help us love even those who hate us;\n     So that we can change the world.\n\n  That was written by Cesar Chavez, the founder of the United Farm \nWorkers. I think his inspiration has appeal today. It is yet another \nway to give us a clarion call to come to a successful conclusion of \nthis immigration debate\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\nwhich is here on the floor of the Senate.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1183, as Modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Clinton amendment, No. 1183, be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6945-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6945-S6949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, in the last few days, I have come to \nthe floor to speak about reform of our broken health care system: how \nto make that system run better, so that tens of billions of dollars are \nnot wasted every year, so we no longer lose as many as 100,000 \nAmericans every year to avoidable medical errors, so that we no longer \nspend vastly more of our GDP every year than any other industrialized \nnation for poorer health care outcomes.\n  I believe three central things need to be reformed. One is improving \nthe quality of care in ways that drive down costs. I spoke about that \non Tuesday and used the example of an intensive care unit reform in \nMichigan that saved $165 million in 15 months and saved over 1,500-plus \nlives. We need to encourage a lot more of that. The second major reform \nwe need is of health information technology, and I spoke yesterday \nabout the dire state of information technology in health care today-the \nEconomist magazine reported that the health care industry was the worst \nof any American industry except the mining industry and the significant \nsavings we could generate from expanding our use of health information \ntechnology. The RAND Corporation predicted that adequate health \ninformation technology would save us from $81 billion to $364 billion \nper year. We need desperately to capture those savings.\n  Today, I want to talk about the third piece of this reform: repairing \nour health care reimbursement system, the way we pay for health care, \nso that the economic signals we send into the system produce the care \nwe want. Improving quality of care will be an uphill struggle until our \npayment system rewards it. Health information technology will lag \nbehind other industries until the economics of investing in it makes \nsense for participants in the health care sector.\n  These problems can each be fixed, but the repair will work better if \nthe three solutions proceed together, not necessarily as one, but \nstaying close, because they are mutually reinforcing.\n  The payment system for health care expenditures today sends all the \nwrong messages: it rewards procedures rather than prevention; it \nrewards office visits more than email contacts; it neglects best \npractices and discourages innovation. To a large degree, the system has \nbeen co-opted by today's unfortunate business model for health \ninsurance. This is a business model which seeks first to cherry-pick \nthe healthy customers and abandon the sick ones, second to try to deny \ncoverage if a customer does get sick, and third to try to deny claims \nwhenever their sick customer's doctor tries to send in the bills. \nHealth care economics gets in the way of the change we need, gets in \nthe way of improved quality of care, gets in the way of investment in \ninformation technology and illness prevention, and gets in the way of \nlowered costs.\n  The problem is best exemplified by a tale from a book called \n``Demanding Medical Excellence'' by Michael Millenson. Northfield, MN, \nMadam President, is a town I am sure you know. It is a town of only a \nfew thousand people, but it was home to four very innovative doctors at \nFamily Physicians of Northfield. They discovered they could reduce the \naverage treatment cost of a urinary tract infection from $133 to only \n$39, a savings of nearly 70 percent, by changing their practice \npattern. Instead of doing an office examination, a complete urinalysis \nand culture, sensitivity studies for antibiotics, prescribing ten days \nof antibiotics, and a follow-up culture, they attained the same results \nwith a phone conversation with a patient, a complete urinalysis, and a \nprescription for three days of antibiotics. But pretty soon, the Family \nPhysicians at Northfield were so good at treating their patients--for \nurinary tract infections and other diagnoses--that their\n\n[[Page S6946]]\n\nwaiting room was empty. As a reward for their good work, the practice \nlost so much revenue, from never-performed lab tests and empty \nappointment calendars that, in 1995, Family Physicians of Northfield, \nwas forced to close. These doctors were taught a harsh, and perverse, \nlesson by our present health care system, and that lesson is: reduce \ncosts and improve care, and you will be punished.\n  In Rhode Island, our hospitals are pursuing quality improvement \nprojects in every intensive care unit in the state, modeled on the \nMichigan program that saved $165 million in 15 months and over 1,500 \nlives as well. The Rhode Island intensive care unit program had a \nsignificant hurdle to overcome, however: the cost was expected to be \n$400,000 annually per intensive care unit, and the hospitals had to pay \nit. The savings were estimated to be $8 million, but those savings \nwould not go back to the hospitals. The savings went to payers. So, for \nits $400,000 invested, a hospital actually stood to lose money, from \nshorter intensive care unit stays and fewer complications, so fewer \nprocedures to remedy the complications. Truly pushing that quality \nenvelope, and striving for zero tolerance in infections and errors, was \nagainst the hospital's best economic best interests. It took the \nspecial, collegial relationships developed within our Rhode Island \nQuality Institute to solve this payment dilemma between our hospitals \nand insurers.\n  A similar analysis pertains to prevention investments. The payer has \nto shoulder 100 percent of the cost today, but the savings in \nforestalled illness might not occur for years. Maybe by then the \ncustomer will be some other insurer's customer, then maybe Medicare's. \nIf you are the insurer, why take the chance and assume that cost, if \nthe savings will not accrue to you?\n  There are many ways to repair perverse incentives in the way we pay \nfor health care, but one that makes sense to me and uses existing \ninfrastructure would be the following. Let medical societies and \nspecialty groups, who create ``best-practices'' within their specialty, \nsubmit those best practices--including cost-effective prevention \nprograms--for approval by local health departments. If, after suitable \nadministrative procedures, the best practices are approved, reward the \neffort by differentiating, in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement \nrates, between care that follows the local best practices and care that \ndoes not. Reward the effort by forbidding any insurer operating in \ninterstate commerce--any health insurer--from using ``utilization \nreview''--that is their word for denying payment--for care that is \ndelivered within these approved best practices. Require them to pay all \nthose claims, in which the provider followed best practice protocols, \nwithin 30 days.\n  The legislation I have prepared will do just that.\n  This legislation sets a lot of good forces in motion. It encourages \ndevelopment and dissemination of best practices in medicine. It \nencourages doctors to follow those best practices, and discourages the \nwide and unjustifiable variations in medical treatment evident now. It \nencourages a sensible one-time debate in a professional, administrative \nforum at the time approval or amendment of the best practices is \nsought, and it discourages the wildly expensive payment battle now \nfought, claim by claim, between insurers and providers. I know from my \nexperience as the insurance commissioner for Rhode Island how much time \nand money insurers and providers spend in claims administration. \nStudies have estimated that $20 billion is spent every year in this \nbitter and expanding arms race, both by insurers seeking to deny claims \nand doctors seeking to defend their claims, and every dollar of that \nfight is wasted. Doctors in Rhode Island tell me regularly that as much \nas half of their staff is engaged in this billing battle. Instead of in \nproviding health care for their patients.\n  My legislation will engage the medical community in a thoughtful way. \nIt will bring best practices to the forefront. There is a lot of \ndiscussion about comparative efficiency in health care today, debates \nover which treatments and methods are most effective--this legislation \nwill provide a truly meaningful forum for those discussions. An \nexample: Recently, the New York Times reported on a 40-step protocol \nimplemented for bypass surgery patients by Geisinger Health Systems, \nwhich right now can be implemented only within Geisinger hospitals. \nThis bill would allow these protocols, if pursued by the local \ncardiology association and approved by the State health department, to \nget favorable reimbursement statewide. I hope this bill will help the \nhealth insurance industry look to a new business model where your \ninsurance company is looking out for you, is your advocate when you are \nsick, reminds you when testing or prevention is appropriate, helps you \nfind the best practices or care, where your insurer is your navigator \nand your adviser in the health care system instead of your adversary.\n  This legislation can help repair our health care system. It puts the \npriorities and incentives in the right place so market forces are \nunleashed in our favor. It uses existing structures, just in new ways. \nIt is designed and mandated to be budget neutral. And it does no harm \nif it does not work right away, if doctors do not take it up, if health \ndepartments will not hold the hearings, no harm is done But let's give \nit a chance to work.\n\n  Let me close by saying how important this moment is. I serve on the \nBudget Committee and have heard the troubling facts about what the \nhealth care system will cost us in years to come. By the year 2050, the \ncombined cost of Medicare and Medicaid will rise to eat up 22 percent \nof our gross domestic product. Further, as my friend Budget Chairman \nConrad has noted, the 75-year net present value of the unfunded \nliabilities in Social Security and Medicare equal $38.6 trillion, and \n$33.9 trillion of this total is for Medicare alone. The health care \nsystem is eating up our economy, costing twice as much as the European \nUnion average. There is more health care than steel in Ford cars and \nmore health care than coffee beans in Starbucks coffee. It is \nsignificantly hampering our competitiveness. It is the number one cause \nof American family bankruptcies.\n  By acting now, by acting in advance, by bringing some sensible \neconomics and some sensible management and some helpful incentives to \nour health care system, we can start to grapple with its cost. And if \nwe take on that fight here and now, while time is still on our side, we \ncan reduce costs in the best possible way: by improving the quality of \ncare, by making Americans healthier, by preventing illness before we \nhave to treat it, by avoiding expensive and often fatal medical errors, \nby giving our doctors the decision support other professionals have had \nfor decades, in sum, by making our health care system better. \nConsidering the stakes, shame on us if we fail in that duty.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            SENATE DEMOCRATS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Democrats earned the majority in Congress \nlast year by strongly opposing the President's failed Iraq policy and \nadvocating restoration of the values of working families in relation to \nour Government. The American people sent a clear message last November \nit was time to change course in Iraq. Congressional Democrats made that \nour top priority in the first day in this Congress, and have every day \nsince. In less than 4 months, we have been able to send to the \nPresident's desk a number of things to keep our Government open; and \nthat is the case literally.\n  In less than 4 months, we have been able to send to the President's \ndesk things he refused in years past, because now there is a \nCongressional branch he has to deal with.\n  As it relates to Iraq, the President has vetoed the bill which \nreflected the wishes of the American public and many senior military \nleaders and a bipartisan majority of Congress.\n  Last night we sent him another bill that doesn't go as far as I would \nlike, and the majority of the Democratic Senators, and that is an \nunderstatement. But it does begin the process of holding the President \nand the Iraqis accountable.\n\n[[Page S6947]]\n\n                              Polling Data\n\n  I think it is important to note how the American people feel, that \nthis isn't just a bunch of politicians talking in Washington. There was \na poll taken by the New York Times and CBS that was reported today. It \nwas a very in-depth poll. When we do polls at home, those of us who \nserve in government, they do samplings of 400 to 600 people. This poll \nwas twice that big. Almost 1,200 adults were sampled, so the margin of \nerror was very low when this poll was done.\n  Among other things, it said 61 percent of Americans say the United \nStates should have stayed out of Iraq, and 76 percent say things are \ngoing badly there, including 47 percent who say things are going very \nbadly. President Bush's approval ratings remain the lowest of his \noffice in more than 6 years: 30 percent approve of the job he is doing; \n63 percent disapprove. More Americans, 27 percent, now say that \ngenerally things in the country are seriously offtrack. This is the \nlowest number of approval and the highest disapproval rating since \nthese polls have been taken.\n  Public support for the war has eroded: 61 percent say the country \nshould have stayed out of Iraq; a majority, 76 percent, including 51 \npercent of Republicans, say additional troops sent to Iraq this year by \nMr. Bush either have had no impact or are making things worse. Most \nAmericans support a timetable for withdrawal; 63 percent say the United \nStates should set a date for withdrawing troops from Iraq sometime next \nyear. The poll found Americans are more likely to trust the Democratic \nParty than the Republican Party by a significant margin. More than half \nsaid the Democratic Party was more likely than the Republican Party to \nmake the right decisions about the war. More broadly, 53 percent of \nthose polled said they have a favorable opinion of the Democratic \nParty.\n  As for Mr. Bush, 23 percent approve of his handling of the situation \nin Iraq, 23 percent; 72 percent disapprove. Madam President, 25 percent \napprove of his handling of foreign policy; 65 percent disapprove. And \n27 percent approve of his handling of immigration issues, while 60 \npercent disapprove.\n\n\n                             Senate Agenda\n\n  Regarding the war in Iraq, I have spoken over the last week to two \nparents in Nevada--one in Reno, one in Fernley--who have lost sons in \nIraq. Multiply that almost 3,500 times. I can't imagine the grief and \ndespair. During the last 3 days, 17 American soldiers and marines have \nbeen killed in Iraq, 3 days--9, 2, and 6. It is an American tragedy. As \nI said last night on this floor, we will not stop our efforts to change \nthe course of this war until either enough Republicans join us with \nregard to this war to reject the President's failed policies or we get \na new President.\n  At the same time we have opposed the President's Iraq policy, we have \nmoved forward on legislation that invests in our security, our economy, \nand our health. In a matter of days, we will have as law a raise in the \nminimum wage. Sixty percent of the people who draw the minimum wage in \nAmerica are women, and for more than half those women that is the only \nmoney they get for their families. It was important that we raise the \nminimum wage, and we did that. It was long overdue.\n  We have also provided, and will shortly have signed into law, $400 \nmillion to ensure that States don't run out of money for the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. In the coming weeks, we will seek \nto reauthorize this successful program that keeps millions of children \nhealthy. We may not be doing much for adults in health insurance, but \nwe are taking steps forward with our children.\n  For 3 years we have tried to pass legislation that would give relief \nto farmers and ranchers. We have been unable to do that. The Republican \nmajority has refused to allow us to do that. Disaster relief for \nfarmers and ranchers, we did that. That is now going to be signed into \nlaw, $3 billion. Farms have gone bankrupt in the ensuing years of the \nneed for this relief. I would suggest, if you look on the Internet at \nwhat an emergency supplemental is all about, it talks about emergencies \nthat occur during the year--floods, fires, drought, hurricanes, \ntornadoes. That is why what we did last night, farm relief, $3 billion \nto help farmers and ranchers recover from drought, flood, storms, and \nother disasters is long overdue. That will be the law in a matter of \ndays.\n  Because of global warming, the western part of the United States has \nbeen swept with wildfires. In Nevada, millions of acres have burned. \nWhen these areas burn, we get noxious weeds that come instead of the \nplants and grasses that should be there. We are going to have in a \nshort few days relief. The law has been passed, western wildfire \nrelief, $465 million to help prevent and fight wildfires in the west \nand elsewhere. That is so important.\n  As I understand, there has been a raging fire on the border of \nMinnesota and Canada. It has taken days to put that fire out. That is \nwhat we are talking about. It should have been done a long time ago. We \nhave had to fight for this. I can remember going to the White House, \nbeing told by one of the President's assistants: Don't worry about \nthat. We will do it with one of the regular bills.\n  We are limited on what we can do on regular bills. This is emergency \nfunding. The President has gone to New Orleans, LA, more than 20 times \nsince those devastating floods that occurred there as a result of \nHurricane Katrina. The President has talked about it but done very \nlittle. We did something about it. We have overcome the opposition of \nthe White House, and in the bill that we passed last night, we provided \nnearly $6.3 billion to help the people of the gulf coast affected by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Homeland security--Senator Byrd, from his seat right here, over the \nlast 5 years has offered many amendments. He wrote a book and talks in \nhis book about the times he offered amendments to do something about \nhomeland security. It was defeated on a straight party line basis many \ntimes. Last night we weren't defeated on a straight party line basis. \nWe didn't get enough, but we did get a billion dollars to look at \nprograms that are all so absolutely important and necessary: port \nsecurity, $110 million; rail and mass transit security, $100 million; \nexplosive detection systems for airline baggage. It is interesting with \nour airlines, you climb in one of those seats in the airplane. You are \nseated. You feel pretty comfortable about the person sitting next to \nyou. But you don't know what is in the cargo of that airplane. We got \nsome money for that last night, as well we should. Air cargo security, \n$80 million to inspect cargo on commercial passenger airlines; $285 \nmillion for explosive detection systems for airline baggage. It was \nlong overdue--not enough but certainly a step in the right direction.\n\n  The Republicans had a majority of 55 to 45. They couldn't pass a \nbudget because it was so skewed toward the rich, so skewed toward the \nbusiness community and directed against working class America, they \ncouldn't pass it. We have a majority, with Senator Tim Johnson being \nill, of 50 to 49, not 55 to 45. But we passed a budget. We passed a \nbalanced budget that restores fiscal discipline and puts the middle \nclass first, cutting their taxes while increasing investment in \neducation, veterans care, and children's health care.\n  For the second year in a row, we legislated to give the hope of stem \ncell research to millions of Americans who suffer from all kinds of \ndiseases. There is one Senator holding up our overriding the \nPresident's veto. It could be any one of these Republican Senators. We \nare at 66. We need one more to override the President's obstinance in \nthe form of this veto.\n  What the President has done to stifle hope for millions of Americans \nis wrong. We were at a Senate retreat. Michael J. Fox came in, someone \nwhom Rush Limbaugh made fun of because he shakes when he talks. He has \nParkinson's disease. The renown actor came up and talked to us about \nhis money he has put in to find a cure for other people who have \nParkinson's disease. He has done good work because the human genome \nproject is completed, and they found the gene that causes Michael J. \nFox's neurological problems. But he said: We need more help. Stem cell \nresearch would help us find out a way to attack that gene, to take care \nof that gene. But the President has stifled, stopped, slowed down the \nhope of millions of people just like Michael J. Fox.\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\n  Several other important bills have passed and will soon be on the \ntheir way to the President, such as a continuing resolution. This is \nnot a name I came up with, the ``do-nothing'' 109th Congress. The \nRepublicans controlled by significant margins the House and the Senate, \nand they have been dubbed by historians and the press as the do-nothing \nCongress. They did less and served their constituents less days in \nactual work in the Senate and the House than in the history of the \ncountry. They did less and were in session less than the do-nothing \nCongress of 1948.\n  One of the things they didn't do is fund the Government. They lost \nthe elections last November and just left town and unfunded the \nGovernment. So there was a responsibility upon us, the Democrats, to \nfund the Government from February 1 to October 1. We did that. It \nwasn't easy, but we did it.\n  The 9/11 Commission, the President fought it. But there was a hue and \ncry to establish an independent bipartisan commission to look at what \nhappened on 9/11, what went wrong. Led by Congressman Hamilton and \nGovernor Kean, this independent bipartisan commission came up with \nrecommendations. We waited almost 3 years for the Republican Congress \nto do something. They did basically nothing. The 9/11 Commission, in \nfact, gave the Bush administration failing grades, Ds and Fs, in all \nthat they asked Congress and the President to do. But we, the \nDemocratic Congress, passed all the recommendations of the bipartisan \n9/11 Commission after they had been pushed aside for all those \nyears. Now, within a matter of weeks, the House will do the same, and \nwe will send this matter to the President and have him sign it.\n\n  Ethics. The most significant ethics and lobbying reform in the \nhistory of our country we did as the first bill we took up. With the \nculture of corruption that existed here in Washington in the 109th \nCongress with--think about this: Am I making up a culture of \ncorruption? For the first time in 130 years--approximately 130 years--\nsomeone who was working in the White House was indicted. ``Scooter'' \nLibby was indicted and convicted. Safavian, who was head of Government \ncontracting, appointed by the President and responsible for billions of \ndollars, was led away from his office in handcuffs because of \nsweetheart deals he made with Jack Abramoff and others.\n  On the other side of the Capitol, in the House, the majority leader \nin the House was convicted of three ethics violations in 1 year. What \ndid they do to respond to that? Changed the ethics rules. He is also \nunder indictment.\n  So there certainly was a culture of corruption. Staff members are \nstill under investigation. Congressmen are still under investigation \nbecause of this culture of corruption. Members of Congress have had to \nresign or have lost their races because of being involved in unethical \nand criminal activities.\n  Yes, there was a culture of corruption, and we took this up as our \nfirst legislative measure and passed it. The House passed it yesterday. \nWe need to go to conference now and send that to the President.\n  As we all know, we have begun debate on immigration reform. We are \ncontinuing that the week we get back. We have taken action on 7 of our \ntop 10 legislative priorities we introduced on the first day of the \n110th Congress. It is tradition that the majority party introduces the \nfirst 10 bills. We did that. Seven of them we have passed.\n  In the coming weeks, we expect to turn our attention to the remaining \nthree.\n  Energy. As soon as we finish immigration, we are moving to energy \nlegislation. It is bipartisan. It is legislation that has been reported \nout of the Energy Committee on a bipartisan basis, legislation reported \nout of the Environment and Public Works Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis, and legislation that has come from the Commerce Committee on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  It is not everything I want but a great start for one of the big \nproblems we have facing America today: energy.\n  In the State of Nevada, my home, we have the third highest gas prices \nin the country--Nevada. In Reno, NV, gas prices are around $3.40 a \ngallon. We need to do something about it.\n  The gluttony of the oil companies is unbelievable--making tens of \nbillions of dollars. It is so interesting, every time at just about \nMemorial Day, when people want to travel, their refineries go down, \nthey need repair. Who makes all the money? It is not the person you go \nto who pumps gas in your car or even a self-service station you go to. \nThey make pennies. They make less than a nickel a gallon. In Reno, NV, \nand other places in the country, you can pay $3.40 a gallon at the \nplace you buy that gasoline, and that person makes almost nothing. It \nis made by the gluttonous oil companies, the refiners--record profits, \nof course.\n  We are going to take a whack at that. I hope we can get it passed. It \nhas some interesting things in it. One of the things it has is CAFE \nstandards, saying automobiles in our country should be required to have \nhigher mileage per gallon. We are going to try to get that done.\n  The bill also includes some legislation dealing with alternative \nenergy. We cannot produce our way out of the problems we have in \nAmerica with oil. We have less than 3 percent of the oil in the world \nin America. We cannot produce our way out of our problems. We have to \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Today, in America, we will use 21 million barrels of oil. It is hard \nfor me to comprehend there is that much oil in the ground, let alone \nour use of it in 1 day. We import about 65 percent of that oil. This \noil comes from some of the worst tyrannical governments in the world. \nMuch of that money is used to export communism and other bad things to \ncountries, including to America.\n  We must lessen our dependence on foreign oil. This administration is \nthe most oil-friendly administration in the history of our country. So \nwe are going to take up this legislation the second week we get back. \nThe bill will dramatically increase America's renewable fuel production \nso we can begin the crucial long-term effort to reduce our dependence \non unsustainable and volatile energy supplies I have talked about.\n  The bill requires consumer appliances, buildings, lighting and, most \nimportantly, vehicles to become much more energy efficient. The Federal \nGovernment's own energy performance will be significantly improved as \nwell.\n  I so appreciate Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, and Senator Boxer, the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, whose career has been based on things dealing \nwith the environment. Senator Inouye, chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, and his right-hand person in this effort, Senator Kerry, \nhave done remarkably good work.\n  This legislation will address the growing threat of price gouging and \nenergy market manipulation as gas prices continue to set new record \nhighs almost every day.\n  I have been so impressed with Maria Cantwell, the Senator from \nWashington, for her continual efforts to go after these big gluttonous \noil companies. Her price-gouging legislation and energy market \nmanipulation legislation has been, in my opinion, a picture of how we \nshould legislate.\n  Education. We expect to address reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act in the next few weeks--in the next few months, probably \nmore likely. I hope to do it, complete it, before our August recess.\n  Since the act was last authorized in 1998, college costs have \ncontinued to skyrocket. A growing number of students are being priced \nout of a college education and all the doors it opens. A child's \nability to be educated should not be dependent on how much money their \nparents have.\n  I, of course, am a big fan of early childhood education. I was so \nimpressed yesterday, not far from here, the conservative reporter--I \nshould not say reporter--editorial writer, David Brooks, from the New \nYork Times, talked about his belief of young people being educated and \nhow he had become a convert and he now believes that the Government \nshould be involved in getting kids educated.\n  Many of those lucky enough to make it through college now begin their \ncareers saddled by the weight of the money they have had to borrow. In \nNevada, the average debt of a student is $15,000. That is unacceptable. \nIt is not unusual for someone to graduate from medical school owing \n$150,000.\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\n  Now, people say: Well, doctors make a lot of money. They do not make \nthat much money. One of my friends, a prominent physician in Las \nVegas--I do not think he will mind me mentioning his name; if he does, \nhe can call me--Dr. Tony Alamo worked hard all his life--his father \ncame in a boat from Cuba--believes in education. The senior Tony Alamo \ndid everything he could to get his kids educated. He had a boy become a \ndoctor.\n  Now, young Tony is one of the lucky ones because his dad has done so \nwell with the rags-to-riches story in America, and I am sure as to his \ndebt, his dad could help him pay it off, if necessary. But Dr. Alamo is \nvery unusual because he has parents who can help him. He has explained \nto me that when doctors graduate from medical school, they get a job, \nand a lot of jobs now are with managed care, being they are all over, \nand they are salary jobs. They have difficulty with their salary job \npaying off their loans.\n  Our legislation will increase the maximum Pell grant, reduce student \nloan interest rates, expand loan forgiveness programs, and cap student \nloan payments at no more than 15 percent of their income. Our bill \ntakes important steps to address this alarming and growing crisis.\n  We are going to take up the next work period the Defense \nauthorization bill. One of the things we talked about doing in one of \nour 10 bills is to rebuild our military. It is in a state of disarray, \ndisrepair. We learned that when we found out from the Governor of \nKansas, after that tornado, that half of the equipment of her National \nGuard was in Iraq. Could not respond to the crisis there. It is that \nway all over the country.\n  Jim Webb, who is a Senator from Virginia--Jim Webb has a resume of an \nAmerican hero because that is what he is. He is a graduate of the Naval \nAcademy, fought heroically in Vietnam, earned medals for heroism, was \nbadly injured. His military career ended not because he wanted it to \nbut because he was hurt and had to get out.\n  He believes the most important thing we can do to hold the \nPresident's feet to the fire in Iraq is force him to make sure our \ntroops are ready to go to battle, they are trained properly, they have \nthat equipment. He has an amendment we are going to work on to get in \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  One of the boys killed from Nevada this past week was on his fourth \ntour of duty in Iraq. His friend said: He told me he survived four \nexplosions, and he didn't think he would survive another one. He did \nnot. It was an awful death. We now have two hostages, prisoners of war \nin Iraq. Remember, when they were captured, they did not know who for \nsure the three were because they knew there was a body in the Humvee. \nSo I called and talked to the dad, and he prayed that his boy was not \nin the Humvee, that he was a prisoner. But it didn't work. His boy was \nincinerated in the Humvee. They could only find out who he was with \nDNA. He was on his fourth tour of duty.\n  That is what Jim Webb is advocating. That is what we advocate. We are \ngoing to take that up in the Defense authorization bill, to make sure \nour troops have what they need. They do not have that now.\n  The bill last night that we passed provides funding to ensure our \ntroops, until the first of October--active and retired--get some of the \nmoney they need. But we have to restore and renovate what has been \nruined and damaged in Iraq.\n  Jack Reed, a graduate of West Point, believes it will take nearly \n$100 billion to bring our military up to what it should be. We are \ngoing to work toward that in the Defense authorization bill. That \ncommittee is chaired by Carl Levin. So we are going to make \ninvestments, critical investments to address troop readiness problems \nin the Army and Marine Corps caused by the President's flawed Iraq \npolicy.\n  We will take a number of steps to reconfigure our national security \nstrategy to better meet the threats and challenges we face today. That \nincludes returning focus to the growing and increasingly overlooked \nproblems in Afghanistan and working to improve special operations \ncapabilities.\n  So once the next work session is complete, we will have taken action \non all 10 of our day one priorities and passed most of them with \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Now, we have had to fight to get that support, with cloture, on many \ndifferent issues to get to where we could have a vote. But we have made \nit, and I appreciate that help from the Republicans.\n  We have also successfully addressed many crucial issues not on that \nlist. The FDA reauthorization bill we passed facilitates the timely \nreview of new drugs while improving the safety of the medicines \npatients take and the food we eat. We passed the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, known as WRDA, the first one in about 6 or 7 years. It \nwill protect America's environment and keep our economy strong. We also \npassed the America COMPETES Act, which is an act to return our country \nto a position of leadership in science, research, and technology.\n  I would say by far the most important fight we have taken up this \nyear is our effort to oppose the President's failed Iraq policy and \nbring the war to a safe and responsible end. The next work period, as I \nhave indicated, will oppose the President's failed policy regarding the \nwar at every turn. The Defense authorization bill will be a major part \nof that battle. We will continue this fight every day. We have had some \nbipartisan victories this year and some tough fights as well. Progress \nespecially on the war has not come easy and that is not likely to \nchange. But if we continue to work in good faith, seeking \nbipartisanship at every opportunity, I have no doubt we can accomplish \ngreat things for the American people.\n  Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I voted in favor of the Vitter amendment \nyesterday because I do not support a plan that tells those who came to \nthis country illegally up until December 31 of last year that they are \nexcused and now have legal status.\n  I think that is a mistake.\n  But I do want to state clearly that there are a fair number of those \n12 million people who came in here without legal authorization whose \nstatus must be resolved in a sensitive way. I am talking about those \nwho have been here for decades, who have raised families, worked hard, \nand been model citizens. I believe we should adjust their status and \ngive them an opportunity to earn citizenship.\n  That same right, however, should not apply to someone who just last \nDecember decided that they were going to sneak into this country \nillegally.\n  My understanding is that we will have additional amendments that will \nbe sensitive to the need to distinguish that difference and I intend to \nsupport the amendments that will provide the sensitivity to those \nimmigrants who have been here leading productive lives for a long \nperiod of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6949-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, in April, Ted Stevens became the longest \nserving Republican Member of the United States Senate in our country's \n230-year history. I join my colleagues in congratulating the Senator \nand thanking him for his many years of service and our friendship.\n  Much has already been said about Senator Stevens' sometimes grouchy \nand intimidating demeanor. But if we look past the hulk ties, the \nscowling countenance, the vigorous defense of any and all attacks on \nAlaskan priorities, and the cowed staff who fear that they have fallen \non the wrong side of our esteemed senior Senator, we see another, more \ncompassionate side.\n  When I first arrived in Washington, DC, in 1987, my son was entering \nfirst grade at the same time as Ted's beloved daughter. Sam and Lily \nbecame fast friends, and so did their parents.\n  Ted and Catherine were very close friends of ours and like godparents \nto Sam. Anyone who knows Ted well\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\nknows how important his family is and the high value he places on his \nchildren and their friends. He is truly a most kind, gentle, and \nreadily approachable father, uncle, and godfather.\n  His concern about others' children and family members is equally \nheartfelt. As he exercises his many leadership roles, Senator Stevens \nis always willing to take our family obligations into account. He \nrealizes how important it is to schedule time for our families in the \nchaotic, hectic life we lead in the United States Senate.\n  In addition to the close personal friendship we have enjoyed with the \nStevens family, I have had the opportunity to work closely with \nChairman Stevens as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  As chairman, Ted is solicitous of the concerns of even his most \njunior members. He is also a devoted friend of his partner--sometimes \nranking member and sometimes chairman--Senator Dan Inouye.\n  While there is never any doubt that he and Senator Inouye control the \nDefense Appropriations call, Senator Stevens is sensitive and receptive \nto the needs of other Members to the greatest extent possible.\n  He is a very passionate defender of the Appropriations Committee, its \nprerogatives, and its responsibilities. Woe unto the person who attacks \nthe appropriations process or the work that he does. One soon learns \nthat such a position is not one to be taken lightly. One had better be \nprepared for a bruising fight.\n  As President pro tempore, he was a faithful and dedicated leader of \nthe Senate. Now that he is--temporarily--out of that position, he \ncontinues a close working relationship with his good friend and \ncolleague Senator Robert C. Byrd, the current President pro tem.\n  It is, indeed, an honor to have him as our leading senior Republican \nin the Senate.\n  The Senator's influence extends far beyond the Senate to Alaska, the \nNation and the world.\n  Many of the accomplishments of the Senate over the last 4 decades \nbear the mark of Ted Stevens. He has been tireless in his leadership to \nsecure a strong military--and has funded a strong personnel system, the \nmost needed, up-to-date equipment and the most promising research. The \ncurrent strength and superiority of the U.S. Armed Forces is due in no \nsmall part to Senator Stevens.\n  He has also been a leader in the natural resources, transportation \nissues, and climate change issues important to all of America but that \nparticularly affect his home state.\n  Ted is passionate about Alaska--its natural beauty, its people, its \nneeds and its fishing. Many of us have enjoyed traveling to Alaska with \nSenator Stevens and discovering first-hand the treasures it has to \noffer.\n  The many roads, parks and buildings named for him are but a hint of \nall he has done for the State. His contributions are extensive and \nlasting, from improving the infrastructure to safeguarding the wildlife \nand natural resources Alaska has in abundance.\n  Alaskans rightly dubbed the Senator the ``Alaska of the Twentieth \nCentury.'' I am sure Senator Stevens would remind us that he is not \ndone yet. Odds are he is a favorite to be ``Alaskan of the Twenty-first \nCentury'' as well.\n  It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve with Ted \nStevens. I look forward to many more years of working together.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge an esteemed \ncolleague and his long and storied service to the United States Senate. \nSenator Ted Stevens has given much to this great country of ours. Born \nin Indiana, he spent his college years in the West, his law school \nyears in the East, and made significant contributions in a place far \nnorth of here. Yet he achieved much of this by heading south, to our \nNation's Capital. His career reflects his dedication not only to Alaska \nbut to all of America. He has touched every corner of this country--and \nbeyond. Fighting in China during World War II, he served our Nation \nvaliantly as a member of the Army Air Corps where he flew support \nmissions for the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force. Now, more than \nsix decades later, he is still serving our country.\n  Following work as an attorney in Alaska in the 1950s, Ted Stevens \nheaded for Washington to work for the Department of Interior under the \nadministration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It is worth noting \nthat it was President Eisenhower who signed Alaska into statehood in \nJuly of 1958. Not too long after Alaska found statehood, he decided to \nreturn to the home he had made in the Last Frontier. Soon, he was \nserving in the State house of representatives--a body of which he \nbecame the majority leader in 1964. While he may have initially found \nhis way to the U.S. Senate by virtue of appointment in 1968, he soon \nhad the weight of his State's voters behind him.\n  Now serving his seventh term in office, Senator Stevens has been a \nreliable supporter of his home State's interests and has supported our \ncountry in many of its most trying times. The institutional knowledge \nand wisdom which Senator Stevens brings to the Senate benefits this \nbody greatly. All of us appreciate his work and contributions to \nAmerica. Be it as the former chairman of the Commerce Committee, the \nformer chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a strong voice and \ndedicated member of the Homeland Security Committeeor for his work on \nthe Rules Committee--we thank him for his leadership, past and present.\n  Congratulations to Senator Stevens on becoming the longest serving \nRepublican in Senate history. His more than 14,000 days in this body \nare a remarkable testament to his hard work, staying power, and skills \nas a Senator. I know the people of Alaska appreciate all that he has \ndone for them over these numerous decades. On behalf of my fellow \nFloridians, I thank Senator Stevens for his service to America and to \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6950-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6950-S6951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL BARRY COSTELLO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, In the opening days of the war in Iraq in \n2003, before ground forces moved into the country, I received an e-mail \nat a particularly suitable moment. Just when I was about to step into a \nmeeting with President Bush at the White House, in came a message from \nmy friend and colleague, then two-star Rear Admiral Barry Costello.\n  Admiral Costello was in command of Cruiser-Destroyer Group One, based \nin the Persian Gulf. Its flotilla, including the aircraft carrier USS \nConstellation, was launching cruise missile and air strikes, while its \ncontingent of over 7,000 marines waited to move into the country. Barry \npoignantly said, ``we are in the forefront--and are working hard to \nmake America proud.''\n  I showed that note to the President. He and I disagreed on pretty \nmuch everything in the runup to the war, but at that moment we had a \nshared pride in Barry and the men and women under his command. The \nexpertise, dedication, and sheer patriotism on display there in the \ngulf was beyond question. That moment crystallized the depth of \ngratitude that not only we elected leaders in Washington but also every \nVermonter and American feel for our Armed Forces.\n  Barry Costello has recently retired from the Navy after a stellar 36-\nyear career. At every stage, before and after his command during the \nsecond Iraq war, professionalism and pure competence have been deeply \netched in Barry's career. Whether in postings on the Joint Staff or on \nthe USS Elliot, which he commanded, Barry has impressed those above and \nbelow him in the chain of command. His knowledge of the Navy--its \norganization, its mission, its capabilities is unrivaled.\n  That thoroughgoing command of his surroundings, that superb ability \nto contribute to the larger organization made him a natural to serve as \na legislative liaison here in the Senate and Congress as a whole. \nWhenever I or any of my colleagues had a question about some program, \nhowever obscure, Barry could answer it or get us answer in pretty short \norder. He was a strong conduit in the other direction too, providing \ninsights to the senior Navy and Department of Defense leadership about \nthe concerns of Congress. In short, he was the perfect liaison.\n  It was fitting that Barry capped his career with command of the \nNavy's Third Fleet, based out in San Diego. One of the most powerful \nforces in our military's arsenal, the Third Fleet established itself \nwith distinguished service under the legendary ADM William\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\nF. ``Bull'' Halsey. Barry's leadership combines the steadfastness of \nHalsey and the eagle-eye vision of a Nimitz. At the Third Fleet, he \nshowed himself a Navy officer's officer.\n  At 56, Barry still has ample contributions to make to our country, \nwhether in industry or further public service. He has already served as \nan inspiration to the Navy and Vermont, and I have no doubt that he \nwill continue make enormous strides on behalf of others in whatever \nendeavors he pursues.\n  I know I will run across Barry very soon, but I want to congratulate \nhim, his loving wife LuAnne, and their two sons Brendan and Aiden. The \nSenate, Vermont, and the country join me in expressing our deep \ngratitude. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6951-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6951-S6952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RURAL BROADBAND\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to speak about rural \nAmerica, and the need to ensure that this cornerstone of our way of \nlife has the same access and availability to modern technology that \nmany Americans take for granted. Specifically, I am referring to the \navailability of high-speed Internet, also known as broadband.\n  Broadband Internet is essential to rural development. It does for \nrural areas today what interstate highways did in the 20th century, and \nrailroads did in the 19 century. It is key to attracting new businesses \nto rural areas, and helping our existing rural businesses grow and \nbecome more competitive.\n  Unfortunately, rural America continues to lag behind its urban and \nsuburban counterparts when it comes to the availability of this \nessential resource. It is not that rural folks do not want broadband, \nbut only that they do not have as much access.\n  In the 2002 farm bill, Congress created a loan and loan guarantee \nprogram to help build broadband out to rural areas that lacked this \ncrucial service.\n  The Rural Utilities Service, RUS, an agency within the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, was charged with the responsibility of \nadministering the broadband loan program and using it to promote access \nin unserved, rural areas.\n  Unfortunately, the agency's implementation and administration of this \nprogram strayed from the rural focus Congress intended.\n  Instead of targeting our rural areas, huge sums of money have been \nused to provide broadband in urban areas, suburban developments, and \ntowns that already have service.\n  Instances of waste and abuse have been clearly illustrated by the \nUSDA inspector general, in hearings held by both the House and Senate \nAgriculture Committees, and in prominent news reports.\n  There is wide, bipartisan agreement on what is wrong with this \nprogram. I believe that there should also be wide, bipartisan agreement \non how to move forward.\n  While a number of legislative and regulatory fixes have been \nsuggested here in Congress and by the RUS, none so far have been \ncomprehensive enough to surmount the challenges of deploying broadband \nin rural America.\n  I have been proud to reach out to my friend and colleague, Senator \nSalazar of Colorado, on the Senate Agriculture Committee to work toward \na solution. It is the Committee on Agriculture that has jurisdiction \nover this program, and it is from this committee that a way forward \nmust be found.\n  Together, myself and the distinguished junior Senator from Colorado, \nhave worked toward a consensus driven, comprehensive approach to \npromoting broadband in rural America. On Monday of this week, we \nintroduced legislation to accomplish this goal, the Rural Broadband \nImprovement Act of 2007.\n  This legislation will provide the secretary with additional guidance \nto direct broadband loans to those truly in need by clarifying where, \nwhen, and to whom loans can be made. It ties approval of loans to a \nrequirement of nonduplication of service, making this legislation \nsignificantly more robust and less ambiguous than the current statute.\n  The issue of duplication of service, more than any other issue, has \nbeen the subject of criticism of the RUS. When RUS makes loans in areas \nthat already have broadband service, it has a twofold negative affect.\n  First, it undermines the market. Often, rural towns may enjoy \nbroadband availability. Small, independent providers that are already \npresent in rural towns have their subscribers pulled out from under \nthem by a competitor who, because they have an RUS loan, have an unfair \nadvantage with which to offer lower rates. This can threaten the very \nexistence of some locally owned, independent broadband providers that \ninvested in rural towns without an RUS loan.\n  Second, when loans are going to areas that already have service, it \nmeans that truly unserved, rural areas for which this program was \ncreated continue to be neglected. Indeed, it is the outlying, sparsely \npopulated areas that are in need of broadband service. These are the \nareas broadband loans should be made to serve--not overbuilding towns \nwhere the service is already present.\n  This is unacceptable. That is why this legislation which I am \nintroducing on behalf of myself and my colleague from Colorado will \nattach to the definition of eligible rural community, a clearly defined \nrequirement of nonduplication of broadband service.\n  Reforming and improving the broadband loan program means doing more \nthan just addressing this one aspect for which it has been criticized. \nIt also means eliminating unnecessary and unprecedented limitations on \nwhat borrowers are eligible to participate.\n  In particular, I am referring to the conspicuous 2 percent telephone \nsubscriber line limit. This limitation acts as a disincentive for \ngrowth; unnecessarily penalizes larger, but still rural-focused phone \ncompanies; and ignores the reality that more and more households are \nabandoning land line subscriptions in favor of wireless communication. \nThe bottom line is that limiting what providers can participate in the \nprogram does nothing to expedite broadband deployment in rural areas.\n  This legislation also streamlines the application and post-\napplication requirements. For many small and independent providers with \nlimited staff, it can be discouraging to look at a 38-page application \nguide to a 57-page application. What's more, those who go through this \narduous process may wait for a seemingly indefinite period of time for \na yes or no to whether their application is approved.\n  To address these matters, the act directs the Secretary to complete \napplication processing within 180 days and allows parent companies and \ntheir wholly owned subsidiaries to file a single, consolidated \napplication and post application audit report.\n  The bill further streamlines the application process by eliminating \nvarious other duplicative and burdensome application requirements, and \ndirects the agency to hire whatever additional administrative, legal, \nand field staff are necessary to meet these requirements.\n  The act also contains powerful incentives to increase the feasibility \nof loans. First, it allows limited access to towns where broadband may \nbe available, but in circumstances when doing so is necessary to \nbuilding broadband out to the sparsely populated and outlying areas \nthat have no service at all. I do want to stress, however, that this is \nnot a loop-hole that will lead back to the problems of duplication and \noverbuild. The majority of households to be served by the project \nfinanced with an RUS loan must be without access to broadband. \nAdditionally, the act creates better transparency and requires \nincumbent providers to be properly notified when an RUS applicant plans \non doing so.\n  Second, the act ensures that collateral requirements are commensurate \nto the risk of the loan.\n  Third, instead of requiring an inflexible 20 percent equity \nrequirement, the act provides more flexibility for small and start up \ncompanies by requiring only 10 percent equity, and allowing the agency \nto waive this requirement so long as the applicant can prove that it \nwill be able to pay back the principal of the loan plus interest.\n  This legislation also codifies an innovative grant program based on \nthe successes illustrated in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Broadband \ndeployment in rural areas will work better once we know where it \nalready is. To do this, grants will be made available to help fund \npartnerships between state\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\ngovernments and the private sector to map where broadband is available \nin rural areas, and conduct outreach to areas where it is still \nunavailable.\n  I and my colleague, Senator Salazar, have always shared a concern for \nour rural citizens. I am proud to work with my neighbor to the west on \nthis issue, and I look forward to working with my other colleagues on \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee as we begin work on the 2007 farm \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6952-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, generation by generation, the face of \nAmerica is always changing. In the next quarter of a century, the laugh \nlines of that face will deepen as the number of older Americans \nexplodes. Today, those over 65 account for 12 percent of our \npopulation; in 2030, they will account for 20 percent. Academic \nexperts, policy wonks, economists, and health care providers are \nconjecturing broadly about how this demographic wave will affect our \nsociety. As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am \nlistening carefully.\n  It is the charge of the Aging Committee to plan accordingly for the \nchallenges facing our seniors tomorrow and to tackle the problems \nconfronting them today. Older American Month, which occurs each May, \ngives us an opportunity to highlight these issues but let me assure you \nthat it is impossible to relegate senior issues into one neat category, \nand soon it will be impossible to confine our attention to them to just \n1 month.\n  Nearly every issue dealt with by Congress affects older Americans, or \nis affected by them, in a unique way. From emergency preparedness to \nbroadcast technology, from the size of the labor force to regulation of \ncorporate marketing practices, these issues are worthy of our attention \nfrom the older person's perspective. Then there are, of course, the \nmore obvious challenges ahead of us, such as preserving Social \nSecurity, strengthening Medicare, and improving long-term care.\n  In the last 5 months alone, the Aging Committee has held hearings on \na myriad of matters that are of vital concern to seniors. We have \nexamined health care coverage for America's poorest seniors under \nMedicare Part D's low-income subsidy. We heard from the Vice Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve about the impact that millions of retiring baby \nboomers will have on our Nation's economy, and we learned about how \nbest to retain and cater to the needs of older workers.\n  We have deliberated on the progress made by the nursing home industry \nover the last 20 years, as well as what currently needs to be done \nabout the most neglectful, decrepit homes. Our investigative unit has \nshone a bright light on the shameful, deceptive sales tactics employed \nby certain providers of private Medicare Advantage plans.\n  We have put forth compelling evidence for the continuation of \nSeniorCare, Wisconsin's highly efficient drug coverage program, in \nspite of the administration's desire to terminate it. And, I couldn't \nbe more pleased to say, we worked with the rest of the Wisconsin \ndelegation and in collaboration with Governor Jim Doyle to find a \nlegislative fix to save SeniorCare, extending the program through \nDecember 31, 2009.\n  As demonstrated by the work I have described, it is easy to see that \nprotecting seniors--whether from fraud, poverty, or mistreatment--is a \npriority for the Aging Committee. However, it is also our priority to \nenable them. Though older Americans are often considered to be a \nvulnerable segment of the population, in many ways senior citizens \nstrengthen our society. America's seniors have had decades to master \nskills and garner accomplishments, often rendering them our best \nleaders and innovators. A lot of them are out in the forefront of \nprofessional fields, staying active within community and family life in \nvarious capacities, and leading by example.\n  The aging of America will affect every part our society, and it will \ntouch every family in decades to come. We reap the benefits of the \ncontinued contributions of older Americans, and in return they deserve \nthe best quality of life our Nation can afford them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6952-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING MARK STEPHENS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mark Stephens, an \nattorney with the Postal Regulatory Commission's Office of General \nCounsel, is retiring after a 33-year career. He joined the former \nPostal Rate Commission in 1974, and participated in the analysis and \nreview of numerous postal rate, classification, and complaint cases.\n  Mark proudly notes that he started his Federal service career as a \nletter carrier for the old Post Office Department where he worked for \nthree months during the summer of 1968. During his long tenure with the \nCommission, Mark also served in the Office of Consumer Advocate.\n  Mark's colleagues point to his professionalism, analytical and \nwriting ability, and character as the embodiment of the finest \nqualities of public service. His insights and thoughtful counsel made a \nsubstantial contribution to the Commission's successful fulfillment of \nits statutory responsibilities. Mark has been a valued colleague to \nthose at the Commission and his retirement will leave a void that will \nbe difficult to fill.\n  Upon leaving the Postal Regulatory Commission, Mark intends to spend \nmore time with his family, but will likely continue to monitor the \nprogress of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 which \nsignificantly enhanced the authority of the PRC. Mark Stephens is a \npublic servant who made a difference, and I wish him much future \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6952-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING DETECTIVE STEVEN SILFIES\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

During the past year, Detective \nSilfies has played an integral role in the investigation of six \nmurders. His devotion has led to two arrests in those investigations. \nSilfies also has played a prominent role in the solving of several cold \ncases. These include an arrest in a 27-year-old case of an out-of-State \nresident. Detective Silfies took a leading role in another cold case \ninvolving an out-of-State resident. This was a 13-year-old case in \nwhich Silfies uncovered overlooked evidence.\n  I congratulate Detective Silfies on this achievement. To be singled \nout among such a dedicated police force is truly an honor. He is an \ninspiration to the citizens of Kentucky and to dedicated police \neverywhere.

Norm was known by \neveryone for his fairness and honesty. He was a thoughtful leader who \nhelped guide our community through difficult times.

We all breathed easier \nknowing that Norm Maleng would handle the cases and that justice would \nbe served.\n  To me, Norm Maleng was always the King County prosecutor. Norm held \nthe position so long, and did his job so well, that it is hard for me \nto remember anyone else who held the job before him.\n  For all of us in public office, Norm was an icon.

A bill for the relief of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \nMicaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I offer private immigration \nrelief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jose \nAlberto Martinez Moreno and Micaela Lopez Martinez and their daughter, \nAdilene Martinez; Mexican nationals now living in San Francisco, \nCalifornia.\n  This family embodies the true American success story and I believe \nthey merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary \nform of relief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Martinez came to the United States 20 years ago from Mexico. He \nstarted working as a busboy in restaurants in San Francisco. In 1990, \nhe began working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award winning Italian \nrestaurant in San Francisco.\n  According to the people who worked with him, he ``never made \nmistakes, never lost his temper, and never seemed to sweat.''\n  Over the past 20 years, Jose Martinez has worked his way through the \nranks. Today, he is the sous chef at Palio, where he is respected by \neveryone in the restaurant, from dishwashers to cooks, busboys to \nwaiters, bartenders to managers.\n  Mr. Martinez has unique skills: he is an excellent chef; he is \nbilingual; he is a leader in the workplace. He is described as ``an \nexemplary employee'' who is not only ``good at his job, but is also a \ngreat boss to his subordinates.''\n  He and his wife, Micaela, have made a home in San Francisco. Micaela \nhas been working as a housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of \nwhom are United States citizens. Their oldest child Adilene, 19, is \nundocumented. Adilene recently graduated from the Immaculate Conception \nAcademy and hopes to attend college.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for allowing the family to remain \nin the United States is that they are eligible for a green card. \nUnfortunately, there is such a backlog for green cards right now that \neven though he has a work permit, owns a home in San Francisco, works \ntwo jobs, and has been in the United States for 20 years with a clean \nrecord, he and his family will be deported.\n  Mr. Martinez and his family have applied unsuccessfully for legal \nstatus several ways:\n  In 2000, Mr. and Mrs. Martinez filed for political asylum. Their case \nwas denied and a subsequent application for a Cancellation of Removal \nwas also denied because the immigration court judge could not find \n``requisite hardship'' required for this relief.\n  Ironically, the immigration judge who reviewed their case found that \nMr. Martinez's culinary ability was a negative factor, as it indicated \nthat he could find a job in Mexico.\n  In 2001, his sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Mr. \nMartinez to get a green card. Unfortunately, because of the current \ngreen card backlog, Mr. Martinez has several years to wait before he is \neligible for a green card.\n  Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio \nD'Asti, has petitioned for legal status for Mr. Martinez based on Mr. \nMartinez's unique skills as a chef. Although Mr. Martinez's work \npetition was approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nthere is a backlog on these visas, and Mr. Martinez is on a waiting \nlist for a green card through this channel, as well.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Martinez have no other administrative options available \nto them at this point and if deported, they will face a 5 to 10 year \nban from returning to the United States.\n  The Martinez family has become an important and valued part of their \ncommunity. They are active members of their church, their children's \nschool, and Comite de Padres Unido, a grassroots immigrant organization \nin California.\n  They volunteer extensively, advocating for safe new parks in the \ncommunity for the children, volunteering at their children's school, \nand working on a voter registration campaign, even though they are \nunable to vote themselves.\n  In fact, I have received 46 letters of support from teachers, church \nmembers, and members of their community who attest to their honesty, \nresponsibility, and long-standing commitment to their community. Their \nsupporters include San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom; former Mayor \nWillie Brown; President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, \nAaron Peskin; and the Director of Immigration Policy at the Immigrant \nLegal Resource Center, Mark Silverman.\n  This family has truly embraced the American dream. I believe their \ncontinued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the \nvalues we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have introduced \ntoday will enable the Martinez family to continue to make significant \ncontributions to their community as well as the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement, the letters of community \nsupport, and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to express my unequivocal \n     support for your efforts to assist Jose Alberto Martinez and \n     his family regarding immigration challenges that they \n     currently face.\n       As you know, Mr. Martinez is a key employee of the highly \n     regarded Palio d'Asti Restaurant here in San Francisco. His \n     current occupation as a Sous Chef at Palio d'Asti is part of \n     a career that spans 20 years in the San Francisco restaurant \n     industry. Mr. Martinez is a San Francisco homeowner with a \n     wife and three children. By all accounts he is a model \n     resident and contributing community member. He exemplifies \n     the hardworking immigrant communities that have made San \n     Francisco what it is over the last 150-plus years.\n       I understand that despite Mr. Martinez's sponsorship \n     through the PERM program, and his history as a law-abiding \n     taxpayer in our community, he and his wife face a deportation \n     order. I believe that this order not only threatens the \n     future of his family, but negatively impacts our local \n     restaurant industry and Mexican-American community. I \n     therefore thank you for your efforts to what you can to help \n     allow Mr. Martinez and his family to remain in San Francisco, \n     working hard to achieve the American dream while contributing \n     to our community.\n       Should you have any questions about this letter, please \n     contact my Director of Government Affairs, Wade Crowfoot at \n     415-554-6640.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Gavin Newsom.\n\n[[Page S6961]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                            San Francisco, CA,\n\n                                                   Apri1 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to you to voice my support \n     for Jose Alberto Martinez, Sous Chef of the well established \n     Palio d'Asti Restaurant. Like thousands of San Franciscans \n     and visitors to San Francisco, I have eaten food he has \n     prepared for the last 20 years, Jose has supported the top \n     Chefs, and fed hundreds of thousands of diners, in San \n     Francisco primarily at Stars and Palio d'Asti (though also at \n     the Orchard and Omni hotels) and has maintained a spotless \n     record. Jose runs the kitchen with an even-hand and touch of \n     class. Jose is also a San Francisco homeowner with his wife \n     and their three children.\n       Jose's boss, Daniel Scherotter, Palio's longtime chef and \n     Gianni Fassio, the former owner of Palio, have alerted me \n     that this pillar of the restaurant community is facing an \n     imminent deportation order.\n       Fassio and Scherotter worked with Jose through the PERM \n     Program to get him a work visa, proving that Jose was an \n     integral, irreplaceable part of their business. I would \n     maintain that Jose is exactly the kind of hardworking \n     immigrant that has always been the bedrock of San Francisco \n     and its restaurant community. Please, I urge you to do \n     anything in your power to help keep Jose and his family \n     together here in San Francisco. Please intervene on Jose's \n     behalf in order to let him stay in line for a green card and \n     not be deported.\n           Sincerely,\n     Willie L.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing in support of Jose \n     Alberto Martinez, the longtime Sous Chef of Palio d'Asti \n     Restaurant, one of the largest and best known restaurants in \n     my district. Palio has been an exemplary restaurant, both \n     under previous owner Gianni Fassio, and under the chef who \n     eventually bought him out, Daniel Scheratter. Jose makes it \n     possible for Mr. Scherotter to represent his industry in his \n     position as Vice Plesident of the Golden Gate Restaurant \n     Association.\n       Mr. Scherotter has brought it to my attention that, despite \n     Fassio's and Scherotter's successful sponsorship for a work \n     permit under the PERM program, and despite a clean record as \n     a lawabiding taxpayer, home owner and family man, Mr. \n     Martinez and his wife are facing a deportation order. I \n     respectfully urge you to do anything possible to help Mr. \n     Martinez stay with his three children, contribute to the \n     economy and the restaurant industry, and continue to live the \n     American Dream,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Aaron Peskin,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Jose Alberto Martinez has worked \n     for me at Palio d'Asti Restaurant as my Sous Chef for over \n     six years. He is my right hand in every way. He always comes \n     to work on time and ready to enjoy getting his job done well, \n     I need only teach him something once, and he gets it, never \n     making the same mistake twice. None of this comes as a \n     surprise, to me though, because I worked with him as a cook \n     here at Palio 13 years ago. When I needed a Sous Chef to run \n     the kitchen at night, I made one phone call, to Jose.\n       Jose started working as a cook at Palio in 1990, when it \n     opened. I came along as a cook climbing up the ladder after \n     working in Italy in the fall of 1994, and stayed for a year \n     and a ha1f. Jose and his brother Mauricio were the pillars of \n     dinner service. The nights I got to work with both of them \n     were lessons in how professional cooks cook. Jose never made \n     mistakes, never lost his temper, and never seemed to sweat or \n     really even move. I thought I knew everything and talked \n     about it, but I could never reach the pure, silent efficiency \n     of motion that Jose embodied. At night, the Sous Chef never \n     even had to come into the kitchen, because he had the dream \n     team in charge. About a year after I started, the owner, \n     Gianni Fassio, had bypass surgery, and decided to close \n     dinner service. Jose and I had to leave to move on and up, \n     elsewhere.\n       In the late summer of 1999, I was working at the Kimpton \n     Group as an Executive Chef and General Manager at Puccini and \n     Pinetti, when Mr. Fassio approached me about coming back to \n     Palio, this time as the Executive Chef. He was having \n     mangement problems, which translate into cost and quality \n     problems. The hardest part about running a restaurant or any \n     business for that matter, is finding good management. I had \n     to fire 3 sous chefs upon arrival for blatant incompetence, \n     dishonesty, sexual harassment, bad cooking, alcohol abuse and \n     any number of other sins.\n       I tried a couple of classically trained Ameican Sous Chefs \n     with extensive education and experience, but one thing after \n     another would pop up--alcoholism, lack of common sense, \n     inability to handle pressure or criticism, big egos, \n     inability to communicate with, train or maintain staff, and I \n     can go on. I thought about what I needed: a great cook, a \n     leader, someone who spoke English and Spanish, someone who \n     could learn and take constructive criticism, someone who \n     would represent what I wanted on the plate and in person when \n     I was elewhere, So I called Jose.\n       It took time, Jose was working for a very well respected \n     French Chef as a cook. I offered him more money and a \n     management title, but since dinner had closed on him before, \n     he didn't know if the restaurant would be around for long. He \n     didn't want to bite off more than he could chew, as he was \n     very comfortable slaving away cooking and had never been \n     truly responsible before. Jose is all about stability, which \n     has made my life a dream since he finally started.\n       I taught Jose how to order all of the meat, poultry, and \n     fish and produce every night, taking into account the \n     reservations, historical sales figures, catering, parties, \n     prices and seasonality. He maintains a tight ship with single \n     digit turnover on his shift. His staff worships him and his \n     food is flawless. His ordering is precise, and he has learned \n     to think the way I think. Jose dwells in the details and \n     makes sure that everything is done right. When he started, he \n     told me that no matter what, if he did something wrong, that \n     he wanted me to tell him rather than be upset. That being \n     said, the things I have ever needed to correct him on \n     cumulatively amount to a hill of beans. He cooks a station or \n     two at a time, manages the other employees, the inventory and \n     the ordering while still supporting a family, another job and \n     a sense of humor. He has made it possible for me to buy out \n     Gianni Fassio and start out in business for myse1f.\n       My goal is to make Jose into my chef, as I use this \n     restaurant as a mother ship to open other restaurants in the \n     city. He's helped me bring his brother Mauricio, the other \n     half of the dynamic duo back to Palio, and with them there, I \n     can feel comfortable growing our business. I need Jose and \n     this restaurant needs Jose. I want to take him to Italy so he \n     can see how it is over there, and so his vision is not just \n     mine. but also authentic in its own right. When he gets \n     enough money together to open his own restaurant, I will \n     invest in it without hesitation because sure things are hard \n     investments to come by and Jose Alberto Martinez is a sure \n     thing.\n       I am willing to do anything to keep Jose here and happy. He \n     is the best possible person to run my business at night, and \n     eventually, I believe, all day. He has worked hard and played \n     by the rules since he got here 20 years ago. He is a \n     homeowner in San Francisco and a saint, respected by everyone \n     in the restaurant, from dishwashers to cooks, busboys to \n     waiters, bartenders to managers. He is well on his way to \n     reaching the American dream, and I can't think of anyone who \n     deserves it more, I implore you to appreciate what this man \n     means to me and to Palio.\n       Please tell me any way that I can help Jose stay here in \n     San Francisco as a part of the Palio d'Asti family.\n     Daniel H.

Jose and Micaela are both citizens of Mexico and have \n     made every attempt to regularize their status during their \n     time in the United States. He and his wife have made a life \n     for themselves here in the Bay Area and indeed, have given \n     birth to two of their children here.\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\n       Jose and Micaela have been part of the Irish community for \n     over ten years and are well known and respected within our \n     community. They are known as decent, hard working, dedicated \n     people--both to their employers and to their family. They \n     have given their three children every opportunity that they \n     themselves did not have. Both he and his wife are assets to \n     our community.\n       Mr. Martinez has indeed realized his own part of the \n     American Dream, working his way from dishwasher to Sous Chef \n     at the renowned Palio d'Asti restaurant in San Francisco. \n     Commitment, dedication and sheer hard work have enabled them \n     to buy their own home in San Francisco, a feat by anyone's \n     standards. They are the epitome of what it means to be \n     American.\n       If Jose and Micaela are forced to leave the United States, \n     yet another family will be torn apart. Their three children, \n     aged 10, 14 and 17, will remain in San Francisco as there is \n     nothing for them in Mexico--they have never even been to \n     Mexico. They will grow up without the love, guidance and \n     nurture of their parents--a dire loss to any young persons \n     life.\n       The Irish Immigration Pastoral Center, which provides \n     assistance to Irish immigrants in the Bay Area, would be \n     greatfull if You could look favorably on Mr. and Mrs. \n     Martinez in their request to remain in the United States.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                  Celine Kennelly,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 18, 2007.\n       To Whom It May Concern: I have known Jose Alberto Martinez \n     and his wife Micaela since 1991 when Jose and his brother \n     Maricio worked as cooks under my supervision at Palio d'Asti \n     Resturant in San Francisco, We worked together for \n     approximately three years.\n       Jose proved himself to be an extremely talented and \n     responsible cook, anchoring the kitchen with little or no \n     supervision. While working for us at Palio, he also held down \n     part time jobs at some of the Bay Area's other top \n     restaurants in order to learn more and move ahead. And \n     although we didn't interact socially, I know he was an active \n     leader active in his church and prioritized time with his \n     family.\n       Jose's hard work and commitment to his family, his \n     community and his job make him ideal candidate for U.S. \n     citizenship. Whether as an immigrant or a citizen, Jose \n     Martinez is an upstanding member of our community,\n       If you have any question regarding Jose Martinez, please \n     call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Craig Stall,\n\n      Proprietor, Delfina Restuarant.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Kelly's Family Daycare,\n\n                                San Francisco, CA, April 18, 2007.\n     Re Michela and Jose Alberto Martinez.\n\n       Dear Sir/Madam: Michela Martinez has worked for my family \n     for many years as our housekeeper.

She has \n     always had a key to our home and we trust her with our \n     property and our children as well.\n       Jose Martinez has worked for my husband as a painting \n     subcontractor and is held in high esteem as well.\n       I have no reservations about giving this couple a reference \n     and wish them the best wishes and speedy resolution of their \n     immigration issues.

Jose and Micaela have lived in \n     San Francisco for almost twenty years and have raised their \n     three children here, two of whom are U.S. born. They are a \n     dedicated and loving couple and deserve the opportunity to \n     continue to give to the community that has welcomed them so \n     warmly. I know Micaela personally and I know that it would be \n     a very great and excessive burden for her to leave her young \n     family behind in California--there is nothing for them in \n     Mexico. As a priest, I see far too much hurt, when parents \n     are separated from their children.\n       My thoughts and prayers are with Jose and Micaela and their \n     family during this difficult time of uncertainty. I would ask \n     that you look favorably on their situation and be \n     compassionate to a family that wants to make America its \n     home.\n       Please do not force them to separate and cause the \n     destruction of this family.\n       With every best wish and kind regard, I remain.\n           Yours in Christ.\n                                                  Brendan McBride,\n                                              Priest in Residence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S.J. Res. 15. A joint resolution to revise United States policy on \nIraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 15\n\n       Whereas in October 2002, Congress approved, and the \n     President signed into law, the Authorization for Use of \n     Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law \n     107-243);\n       Whereas the preamble of Public Law 107-243 sets forth the \n     threats to the national security of the United States that \n     required the authorization for the use of force, and those \n     threats were the Iraqi regime led by Saddam Hussein, its \n     weapons of mass destruction programs, its past record of \n     using chemical weapons, and its record of harboring and \n     supporting international terrorist organizations;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein has been executed after conviction \n     for committing crimes against humanity, United States \n     intelligence and military units have not discovered weapons \n     of mass destruction in Iraq, and thorough reviews by the Iraq \n     Survey Group and the Special Advisor to the Director of \n     Central Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \n     concluded that Iraq did not have any active weapons of mass \n     destruction programs in the final years of the Saddam Hussein \n     regime;\n       Whereas with the removal of the Iraqi regime led by Saddam \n     Hussein, the determination that there were no weapons of mass \n     destruction in Iraq, and the establishment of a democratic \n     constitution and a freely-elected government in Iraq, the \n     United States objectives set forth in Public Law 107-243 are \n     no longer relevant to the current situation;\n       Whereas sectarian violence is the primary cause of \n     instability in Iraq;\n       Whereas, Iraqis must reach a comprehensive and sustainable \n     political settlement in order to achieve stability, and the \n     failure of the Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary \n     cause of increasing violence in Iraq;\n       Whereas the responsibility for halting sectarian violence \n     in Iraq must rest primarily with the Government of Iraq and \n     Iraqi security forces, and not United States Armed Forces;\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``United States \n     Policy in Iraq Resolution of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Con Res. 34\n\n       Whereas the United States continues to rely extensively \n     upon the personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air \n     Force, and Coast Guard who are deployed overseas and \n     stationed at military support installations within the United \n     States;\n       Whereas uniformed services personnel, regardless of branch \n     of service or whether serving in the active or a reserve \n     component, have carried out their mission objectives with \n     valor, distinction, and steadfast dedication to the cause of \n     liberty and democracy;\n       Whereas 1,600,000 uniformed service men and women have \n     deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, many of whom have served \n     multiple deployments;\n       Whereas there are currently more than 3,000,000 family \n     members and dependents of those serving on active duty and \n     reserve components;\n       Whereas nearly 40 percent of the members of the Armed \n     Forces, while deployed away from their permanent duty \n     stations, have left families with children behind;\n       Whereas over \\1/2\\ of all service men and women who have \n     deployed to Iraq are married;\n       Whereas military families have persevered in the face of \n     challenges and continue to provide critically important \n     comfort and care and numerous other contributions to their \n     loved ones deployed overseas or stationed across the Nation;\n       Whereas there currently is a 4 percent gap between the pay \n     of our service men and women and the private sector, and;\n       Whereas it is in our national interest to offer to the \n     members of the Armed Forces comparable pay to that which the \n     civilian sector provides in order to retain our highly \n     qualified men and women in uniform and to faithfully reward \n     their valiant service to our Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should increase basic pay \n     for members of all components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, \n     and Marine Corps by 3.5 percent, effective January 1, 2008; \n     and\n       (2) Congress and the President should provide a special \n     survivor indemnity allowance for persons affected by required \n     Survivor Benefit Plan annuity offsets for dependency and \n     indemnity compensation.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution to \ninsure that our troops get the pay raise they deserve. We are all proud \nof our men and women in the American military who continue to perform \nmagnificently in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world. They represent \nthe best that this country has to offer, and America owes them and \ntheir families a special debt of honor and gratitude. In light of their \nsacrifice, my resolution simply states that the Congress and the \nPresident should support a 3.5-percent increase in military pay in 2008 \nand provide a special survivor indemnity allowance to help American \nmilitary families.\n  Unfortunately, these provisions are opposed by the Bush \nadministration.\n  On May 16, the Office of Management and Budget's Statement of \nAdministration Policy for the House fiscal year 2008 Department of \nDefense Authorization bill opposes section 644 of the bill, which would \npay military families a monthly special survivor indemnity allowance \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund, calling the \nexisting benefits ``sufficient.'' The Statement of Administration \nPolicy also ``strongly opposes'' the provision of the House bill which \nprovides a 0.5-percent increase in military pay above the President's \nproposed 3.0 percent across-the-board pay increase, calling it \n``unnecessary.''\n  I am concerned that the Bush administration's actions have failed to \nappropriately honor our military families who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice. These actions also stand in direct contrast to the will of \nthe American people who support all efforts to support our troops.\n  Just go to the Military Times' own blog and read what the troops \nthemselves say, more eloquently than any politician could put it: ``If \nthere is someone in the administration that feels that we, the hard \nworking American soldiers, don't need additional pay raises, then maybe \nthey should get from behind their desk and pick up a gun and vest and \ngo stand guard at the entry control points in Iraq. And while they are \nout there, lets take away their 6 figure income and give them $3.50 per \nday on top of anywhere from $15 to $45K per year. For all that we give \nto keep our country safe, the administration should at least want to \nhelp us eliminate any burden we may have financially. No I'm not saying \nmake us rich and no one who enters the armed services expects to ever \nbe rich but we don't expect to have to take out loans just to put food \non the table for our families either.''\n  On this issue of fundamental fairness, the administration told \nCongress to back down. On this question, the troops will not back down \nand neither will we.\n  Those who have stood for us should know that we stand with them, \ntoday and always. Maintaining these provisions can do something to ease \ntheir burden, but truly supporting our troops requires that we act not \njust as individuals, but as a nation. I ask all my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution to honor our troops and our military families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6963-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1255.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1537, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1537) to authorize the transfer of certain funds \n     from the Senate Gift Shop Revolving Fund to the Senate \n     Employee Child Care Center.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have to say this: The night before last \nat 9 o'clock at night, I got a call from the White House. They were \nupset because of this Christmas ornament issue on the emergency \nsupplemental; it is so bad--Christmas tree ornaments in the emergency \nsupplemental.\n  I said: Do you know what it is about? It is about the Senate Day Care \nCenter.\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\nThey have sold Christmas tree ornaments every year to defray the cost \nfor Senate employees for childcare. It doesn't cost the Government \nanything, but some lawyer said they didn't have the legal authority to \ndo that, and we put language in the emergency supplemental to allow the \nSenate Day Care to sell Christmas tree ornaments.\n  They said: If you put it in there, the President is going to veto the \nbill. So we took it out.\n  Can you imagine that? It is hard for me to comprehend, in a budget \ninvolving $120 billion, the President threatens to veto it over \nChristmas tree ornaments, something that costs the Government nothing \nand helps our very valued Senate employees take care of their kids.\n  Anyway, I couldn't pass that up.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three times, passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statement \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record, with no intervening \naction or debate. And we got it done anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1537) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRANSFERS FROM SENATE GIFT SHOP REVOLVING FUND.\n\n       Section 2(c) of Public Law 102-392 (2 U.S.C. 121d(c)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) The Secretary of the Senate may transfer from the \n     fund to the Senate Employee Child Care Center proceeds from \n     the sale of holiday ornaments by the Senate Gift Shop for the \n     purpose of funding necessary activities and expenses of the \n     Center, including scholarships, educational supplies, and \n     equipment.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6969-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 4, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I know everyone wants to leave, but I have \nto say this. As a younger man, I had a few fights in the ring. They \nwere very minor compared to real fights in the ring with good fighters, \nbut I had some. Today, I had the pleasure of visiting with a Las Vegas \nresident, Floyd Mayweather, who just beat Oscar De La Hoya in a split \ndecision--a very big fight in Las Vegas. He is a Las Vegas resident, as \nI mentioned, and I wanted the record to reflect how gracious this man \nwas to everyone who came up to him in the Senate. He signed autographs, \nhe allowed a lot of pictures to be taken. He was just so nice and such \na humble man.\n  When the books are written about great fighters, he will have to be \nnear the top of the list, if not at the top. He has been deemed to be \nthe greatest pound-per-pound fighter in the history of America, \ncomparable to Sugar Ray Robinson.\n  It is nice that someone who is so famous would remember his roots and \nhave the humility that he does to treat me, someone whom he came to \nsee, no better than he treated all the people that he visited. So \nNevada is fortunate that he considers Las Vegas his home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/25/senate-section/article/S6969-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 4, 2007, AT 2:30 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
