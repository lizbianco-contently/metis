Mr. President, 76 years ago, Franklin Roosevelt, who was \nthen the Governor of New York, was engaged in a fierce Presidential \ncampaign. The country was reeling from the stock market crash of 1929. \nConsumer confidence in banks had plummeted. The Great Depression was in \nfull force at that time, and the American people had lost confidence \nthat President Herbert Hoover had what it took to lead the country out \nof economic darkness.\n  In April 1932, Governor Roosevelt, seeking the Democratic nomination \nfor President, took to the radio waves and said this:\n\n       I do not want to limit myself to politics. I do not want to \n     feel that I am addressing an audience of Democrats or that I \n     speak merely as a Democrat myself. The present condition of \n     our national affairs is too serious to be viewed through \n     partisan eyes for partisan purposes.\n\n  He went on to say that troubled times call for us to:\n\n     put [our] faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom \n     of the economic pyramid. . . . The two billion dollar fund \n     which President Hoover and Congress have put at the disposal \n     of big banks, the railroads and the corporations is not for \n     [the average person].\n       Here should be an objective of government itself--to \n     provide at least as much assistance to the little fellow as \n     it is now giving to the large banks and corporations. This is \n     [an] example of building from the bottom up.\n\n  Mr. President, the more things change, the more they seem to stay the \nsame. Recently, the Federal Reserve provided taxpayers' money to \nprevent the collapse of Bear Stearns. The Fed took the additional \nunprecedented step of opening its discount lending window to securities \nfirms, even though--unlike banks--those firms aren't regulated by the \nFed.\n  I understand the need to take some bold steps. I believe the Federal \nReserve is doing what they think is best in the face of a deep and \ngrowing economic crisis. While on principle the spirit of capitalism \nwould call for Wall Street firms to shoulder the burden of loss along \nwith the spoils of profit, it is incumbent upon our Government to look \nfor the greater good. But we must not neglect the lessons of history. \nIf we agree that it is a responsibility of Government to provide \nliquidity and security to the titans of Wall Street--and we do--then \nhow can we think it is any less our responsibility to do the same for \nMain Street?\n  The American people are suffering. We are paying more than ever for \ngasoline, groceries, and heat for our homes. Home values are falling--\nin January\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\nalone, almost 13 percent. Millions face foreclosure, and communities \nare suffering because of the housing meltdown. This crisis is real, it \nis immediate, and it calls for Congress to take action. Every day that \nCongress and the President do nothing is another day closer to \nanother American family losing their home. This is not the time for \npolitics or partisanship. It is, as President Roosevelt said, time to \ngive some ``assistance to the little fellow''--those were his words--it \nis time to do the right thing, the responsible thing, for the American \npeople--the little fellow.\n\n  Last work period, Democrats introduced a housing bill. The President \nand his Republican Senators filibustered and blocked this much needed \nlegislation. This legislation is not a catch-all or a silver bullet, \nbut financial experts agree it is a good start. If passed, it would \nhave an immediate positive impact on struggling homeowners and hard-hit \nneighborhoods.\n  Mr. President, I have talked in length about this legislation to \nChairman Bernanke. I have spoken to Secretary Paulson. I think they \nhave done good work. But I think if they were asked point blank--and I \nam not going to, certainly, state here publicly any of the things they \nsaid to me, but someone can ask them themselves--I think they would say \nour legislation is a step in the right direction. If this law passed \ntoday, it would have an immediate positive impact on struggling \nhomeowners and hard-hit neighborhoods.\n  These are the five points of our plan:\n  First, we help families keep their homes by increasing funds for \npreforeclosure counseling. It is imperative we do that.\n  Second, we expand refinancing opportunities for homeowners stuck in \nbad loans. Mortgage revenue bonds--the President said he liked that in \nhis State of the Union Message.\n  Third, we provide funds to help the highest need communities purchase \nand rehabilitate foreclosed properties, as well as tax relief to \nstruggling businesses affected by the housing downturn.\n  Fourth, we help families avoid foreclosure in the future by improving \nloan disclosures and transparency during the original loan and \nrefinancing process.\n  Fifth, we amend the Bankruptcy Code to allow home loans on primary \nresidences to be modified in certain circumstances, with very strict \nguidelines. We have a tax provision which is extremely important to the \nhomebuilding industry: loss carryback. We have a program that allows \nthe bankruptcy courts to step in on primary residences and, if \nnecessary, help adjust those loans.\n  It is time we pass this bill.\n  Last work period, Republicans blocked a vote on this, as I have said \nbefore. One Republican Senator said that all Republicans wanted was the \nopportunity to propose amendments. Mr. President, I have said on this \nfloor, I have said privately, I have said at press conferences--the \nrecord will clearly show--Democrats are happy to allow amendments. \nDemocrats want to offer amendments. Republicans want to offer \namendments. We would like nothing more than an open debate on this bill \nand how we might be able to make it better. I have told my \ndistinguished counterpart, Senator McConnell, if Republicans object to \nparts of our bill, they are welcome to seek enough votes to amend it, \nto change it. That is how the legislative process is supposed to work.\n  It would be a fool's errand to put our proposal up and the Republican \nproposal up and move to invoke cloture on each one of those. It would \ntake 60 votes. That is not what we need to do. It would be failure for \nsure.\n  Why don't we move forward on our bill? There will be a vote at 2:15 \ntomorrow. If my colleagues want to have a limited number of amendments, \nfine, let's have a limited number of amendments dealing with this \nproblem. Experts say we are in a crisis and have to do something now.\n  I respect Secretary Paulson very much. I like Secretary Paulson. The \nproposals he made at 10 o'clock today are certainly worth considering, \nbut they are not going to do one simple thing to help the people who \nare now in foreclosure--nothing. It is for the future. That deals with \nthe future. We need to deal with the present. But so far my Republican \nfriends have not allowed this bill to proceed to the point at which \namendments can be offered. In short, they have stalled this necessary \nhelp to working Americans.\n  Tomorrow, we will have another opportunity to work on this piece of \nlegislation. We cannot sit on our hands. We cannot take a wait-and-see \napproach. And we cannot embrace the status quo as the economy continues \nto deteriorate. Let's legislate. Let's work to help beleaguered \nAmericans. Democrats have no agenda but to get this bill passed quickly \nand fairly so the American people can reap the benefits. If we are able \nto pass this legislation, it will be one where credit can go to \neverybody. This is something we need to do. We cannot do it alone. We \nhave 51 Senators. They have 49. We have to do this together or it will \nnot be done at all. In America's darkest economic hour, that was the \nleadership Franklin Roosevelt showed--and that is what we must do as we \nface our own crisis today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2208-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2208-S2209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in this work period, we will, once again, \nbecause of the supplemental, turn to the raging civil war in Iraq.\n  To say that the Bush-Cheney spin machine lacks credibility is an \nunderstatement as it relates to the war in Iraq.\n  Last week, the President marked the beginning of the sixth year of \nthis war by delivering more of the same disconnected rhetoric. But at \nthe same time he was giving this talk of progress, the facts on the \nground betrayed this happy-talk. As Republican Senator Chuck Hagel \nsaid, the President's words--compared with the real facts on the \nground--are like ``Alice in Wonderland.'' That is what Senator Hagel \nsaid. The situation on the ground in Iraq is fluid and rapidly \nchanging.\n  Mr. President, I was stunned this morning when I got up and listened \nto the radio. Sadr has said: OK, lay down your arms on a couple \nconditions--release all the prisoners, don't do any more arrests, and \nleave us alone.\n  Mr. President, within a couple of months after this war started, the \ncommanders on the ground in Iraq came and told us that this man was a \ncriminal and he would be in jail within a matter of a couple weeks. \nNow, whether that is true or not, that is up for others to decide, but \nthat is what we were told. And here is this man now, 5 years later, who \nin effect is telling the elected leader of Iraq what to do and what not \nto do.\n  It is clear that the Iraqi civil war persists. Within the past few \ndays, nearly 1,000 Iraqis have been killed in Basra alone. This war is \na war of Shiite versus Shiite, al-Maliki versus al-Sadr, Iraqi versus \nIraqi, Sunni versus Shia, Shia versus Sunni. Who is in the middle of \nall of this? The American troops.\n  The President's spokesperson said: This is it. We are now in a \nsituation where the Iraqis are going to take care of their own. But, of \ncourse, the police, when confronted, turned over their arms to al-Sadr \nand walked away. They gave them their guns--I assume their badges--and \nwalked away. The American troops were called in; air power and ground \ntroops were called in. The Iraqis could not handle the situation.\n  As one Iraq teacher said in the New York Times this weekend, in the \nclosing paragraphs of a very long article:\n\n       ``Unfortunately we were expecting one thing but we saw \n     something else,'' said Ali Hussam, 48, a teacher, who said \n     that after Saddam Hussein the people of Basra hoped for \n     peace. ``But unfortunately with the presence of this new \n     government and this democracy that was brought to us by the \n     invader it made us kill each other.''\n       ``And the war is now between us,'' he said. But, \n     unfortunately, with the presence of this new government \n     and this democracy that was brought to us by the invader, \n     it made us kill each other.\n       And the war is now between us.\n\n  That is what he said:\n\n       And the war is now between us.\n\n  When the Vice President of the United States goes to Iraq, it is \nsecret. No one knows he is going there. It is not on his schedule. He \nis under very high security. When the President of Iran goes to Iraq, \nhe announces 2 weeks in advance he is coming--not in the dead of the \nnight, 2 weeks in advance.\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\n  I support our troops. Whenever I say something like that, I think of \nthe Presiding Officer and others in this Chamber who know what it means \nto support our troops, as someone who has carried weapons in support of \nhis country and as someone who has been injured as a result of wearing \nthe uniform of this country. So I say this with a lot of humility, but \nI, along with everyone in this Senate, support our troops. Every one of \nus is honored by their sacrifice and grateful beyond expression for \ntheir outstanding work.\n  When it comes to judging the Iraq war, only one question matters: Are \nwe safer? The answer is undeniably no, and no amount of spin from the \nWhite House can change that.\n  Because of Iraq, our military is stretched thin and its ability to \naddress new threats is compromised. Many of our troops are now on their \nthird, fourth, and some are on their fifth tours of duty in Iraq.\n  Are we safer with bin Laden free and al-Qaida strengthening? Of \ncourse not.\n  Because of Iraq, our National Guard--the brave men and women charged \nwith protecting us from disastrous threats here at home--don't have the \nmanpower or the equipment to do their job effectively at home. Are we \nsafer with a weakened National Guard to protect us at home? Of course \nnot.\n  Because of Iraq and the Bush administration's shoot first, talk later \nstyle of cowboy diplomacy, our moral authority in the world is \nshattered, and to talk about this being cowboy diplomacy is an insult \nto cowboys. Our former allies are unwilling to stand by our side. Our \nability to solve conflicts through diplomacy are diminished.\n  Are we safer as a weakened moral force in the world? Of course not. \nThe American people know this by overwhelming numbers. They continue to \noppose this war, and with good reason: We are objectively less safe \nbecause of Iraq.\n  The cost of the war to our country has been enormous, not only in the \nloss of lives--now more than 4,000--but also tens of thousands wounded, \na third of them gravely. We are now spending $5,000 every second in \nIraq--every second--$12 billion a month. No weekends off. No holidays \noff. We are spending $5,000 a second of borrowed taxpayers' money. The \nPresident told us the war would cost no more than $60 billion. Nobel \nPrize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said it is going to cost us $3 \ntrillion.\n  In Iraq, we--the American taxpayers--are building hospitals, roads, \nbridges, dams, water systems, sewer systems, barracks for the Iraqis, \nwhen we should be helping millions of Americans avoid losing their \nhomes to foreclosure. We are policing the streets in Baghdad when we \nshould be investing in health care and a better education system. We \nare protecting oilfields in Basra when we should be funding renewable \nenergy production to help stem the tide of global warming.\n  When all is finally said and done, experts say the war is going to \ncost as much as $3 trillion or more, as I have said. Where does this \ncome from? It is all borrowed for future generations to pay back. The \nlegacy of our generation could be to leave our children and \ngrandchildren with a safer, cleaner, and more prosperous country. \nInstead, the war in Iraq will ensure that we leave future generations \nwith trillions of dollars in debt.\n  Instead of making our country safer, we are greasing the pocketbooks \nof corrupt Iraqi politicians and buying their temporary cooperation. \nLet's not forget this: Iraq is a rich country. It is not a poor \ncountry--far from it. Its oil resources make it one of the world's \nwealthiest countries. With the price of oil skyrocketing as it has, \nthink of the money that is going into their coffers. Record-high oil \nprices have supplied Iraq with literally more money than they know what \nto do with, but we keep spending $5,000 a second in Iraq. As we borrow \nand spend billions of dollars to provide the security that the Iraqi \nGovernment has failed to create for themselves, Iraq is bringing in \nbillions of oil money faster than they can open bank accounts to store \nit all.\n  If a parent gives a teenager the choice of either getting a job or \nreceiving an allowance for doing nothing, the teenager will often \nchoose to do nothing. As long as we guarantee to the Iraqi Government \nthat our troops and our money will support them, they will never have \nan incentive to do the job themselves. The security welfare state we \nhave created will go on and on forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2209-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2209-S2211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SOLVING PROBLEMS OR POLITICAL POSITIONING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate certainly has a lot of work \nto do, and we have a good stretch of time in front of us in which to do \nit. First and foremost, Americans are waiting on Congress to address \nthe housing crisis and the broader economy as well. They are waiting \nfor us to give intelligence officials the tools they need in the hunt \nfor terrorists. They are waiting on us to confirm qualified judges. \nFarmers are waiting for a farm bill that has been in limbo for \nliterally months. All of us are eager to hear next week's report from \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker on political and military \nprogress over in Iraq.\n  In all of these areas, the Democratic leadership has an option: It \ncan work with Republicans to deliver help to the American people or it \ncan follow the partisan path that views every piece of legislation as \nan opportunity not to solve problems but to position itself for the \nnext election.\n  Some on the other side are talking openly about a grand strategy for \npicking up more seats in November, but their vision seems to end right \nthere. They seem to forget that once these seats are filled, people \nexpect us to accomplish something. The political route, as we have seen \ntime and time again, doesn't accomplish much.\n  America faces urgent problems, and most people care more about \naddressing them than about anybody's elective prospects. We came \ntogether earlier this year on an economic growth package and had an \naccomplishment. It was a good start, but it didn't last. As the Senate \nbegan to address the housing slump, our friends on the other side shut \nRepublicans out of the debate and offered a proposal of their own that \nwas guaranteed to fail. They proposed an ill-conceived plan that will \nsubstantially increase monthly mortgage payments on everyone who buys a \nnew home or refinances. But why would Congress want to raise mortgages \nat a time like this? There is simply no way that proposal is going to \nfly. If our friends on the other side want to help homeowners, they \nneed to work with Republicans on proposals that will draw substantial \nbipartisan support.\n  Republicans have put a number of sensible ideas on the table, \nincluding $10 billion to refinance distressed subprime mortgages and \n$15,000 tax credits for people who buy foreclosed homes as their \nprimary residence--a proposal that will raise the value of homes and \nincrease the stability and security of neighborhoods that have been hit \nhard by foreclosures. We have proposed new tax benefits for struggling \nbusinesses, new truth-in-lending requirements, expanded protections \nagainst foreclosure for returning veterans, and FHA reform to assist \nstruggling homeowners who are trying to stay in their homes.\n  Our proposals to address the current housing crisis have broad \nbipartisan support. Unlike the Democratic bill which skipped the \ncommittee process, the FHA reform piece we proposed passed in committee \nby a vote of 20 to 1.\n  For the good of the economy, we asked our friends on the other side \nto allow a vote on these sensibly, targeted provisions. The partisan \nhousing bill Democrats put forward failed. Why not give our bipartisan \nalternative, which will help homeowners without raising their \nmortgages, a chance to succeed?\n  Another thing Congress can do to help the economy is to expand \nmarkets for U.S. goods abroad, and that is what the Colombian Free \nTrade Agreement would do. The Colombian Free Trade Agreement is more \nthan an act of friendship between allies; it would also strengthen our \neconomy, and it would send a strong signal to Colombia and our other \nLatin American allies that the United States stands with those who \nsupport strong markets and free societies in the face of intimidation \nand threats.\n  Our friends on the other side can help American farmers by finishing \nthe\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nfarm bill. More than 3 months has passed since the Senate completed \naction on this legislation. Yet House Democrats still have yet to \nappoint conferees to put together a final product. With the short-term \nextension of current law expiring in just a few weeks, American farmers \nare about to enter the planting season without any certainty about \nlegislation that significantly affects their lives.\n  Turning to national security, it has been nearly a year since the \nDirector of National Intelligence asked Congress to modernize our \nNation's electronic surveillance laws. The House had a chance to make \nthe necessary changes before the recess, but it chose an irresponsible \npath instead, passing an amendment to the bipartisan Senate bill that \nincluded none of the things the National Director of Intelligence had \ncalled for. Ignoring the carefully crafted Senate bill, the House \ndecided it was more important to let people sue phone companies that \nstepped up when the country needed them. The clock is ticking on the \nlegal authorities contained in the current temporary fix, and a burden \nhas been placed on House leadership to show that it can be trusted in \nmatters of national security.\n  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be here next week, and \nAmericans are eager to hear what they have to say.\n  Under the leadership of these two men, our prospects for protecting \nAmerica's national security interests in the Persian Gulf have vastly \nimproved. Last year's bold decision to launch a counterinsurgency plan \nunder the direction of General Petraeus has renewed our hopes for a \nunified Iraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself as an ally in \nthe war on terror. Our men and women in uniform have protected the \nIraqi people, scattered al-Qaida, deterred militias, and helped create \nan environment that has led to progress not only at the tactical level \nbut in governing and reconciliation as well.\n  Six months ago, General Petraeus proposed a plan for bringing \ncounterinsurgency forces back home and transitioning their mission from \ncombat to partnership and oversight. A reduction in forces is underway, \nand the Iraqi people are now preparing for provincial elections, \nhopefully this October. Thanks to the efforts of the counterinsurgency \nforces, Sunni allies now serving as sons of Iraq will have a real stake \nin these elections.\n  Last week's decision by the Maliki government to go on offense \nagainst Shiite militias in Basra and Baghdad showed us that we have \ncome a long way from the days when the Iraqi security forces wouldn't \neven show up for a fight. Now they are taking the lead in major combat \noperations, with recent offensives against the Iranian-trained Special \nGroups, al-Qaida in Iraq, and the militias.\n  Next week, we will learn more about the pace of transitioning the \nmission. But with U.S. forces still in harm's way, the Senate needs to \nquickly approve the supplemental spending bill without any unrelated \nnondefense spending. It would be pointless to repeat the partisan \nbattles over the supplemental that consumed so much of our time and our \nenergy last year. We should set aside policy prescriptions and \nwithdrawal timelines based on political calculations in Washington and \ndeliver the funds our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan need.\n  As we seek to help the Iraqi people stand up a stable government, we \nshould not neglect our own by allowing vacancies on Federal courts to \ngo unfilled. Three months into the new year, the Senate has not \nconfirmed a single judicial nominee of any kind. Let me say that again. \nThree months into the new year, the Senate has not confirmed a single \njudicial nominee of any kind, and it has held only one hearing on a \ncircuit nominee since September of last year. The process, it appears, \nhas ground to a complete halt. This is unacceptable, it is unfair, and \nthe excuses we have heard are not convincing.\n  Some nominees have waited hundreds of days for a simple hearing, \nincluding those who satisfy the specific criteria of the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee for quick action, such as strong support of \nhome State senators. These vacancies need to be filled, especially in \nplaces that have been declared judicial emergencies such as the Fourth \nCircuit, where one of every three seats is currently vacant. Nominees \nfor seats on the Fourth Circuit--which covers North Carolina, Virginia, \nMaryland, West Virginia, and South Carolina--are ready, well qualified, \nand they have been waiting and waiting.\n  Since the committee has nearly stopped holding even simple hearings \nfor circuit court nominees for the last several months, it should make \nup for lost time by holding hearings on more than one circuit court \nnominee at a time, as both Democratic and Republican chairmen have done \nin the past. That way, we can get these nominees confirmed.\n  It is time our friends on the other side stop blaming others for \ntheir failures to act on judicial nominations. If they don't, \nregretfully, Republicans will be forced to consider other options.\n  The Senate faces difficult challenges domestically and \ninternationally. Conventional wisdom says we want to address them \nbecause it is an election year. Experience suggests some of our friends \non the other side will prefer political efforts to bipartisan \naccomplishments. We saw signs of hope for a more responsible and \nproductive path in a rush of bipartisan accomplishments at the end of \nlast year and in a bipartisan economic growth bill this year, and we \nhave an immediate opportunity in the work period that starts today to \nchoose the better path on an issue that is vexing millions of \nhomeowners.\n  Knowing that public patience with partisan political games is wearing \nthin, I am confident we will seize the opportunity and deliver \nsomething soon for the American people. Then, hopefully, we can follow \nit up with other accomplishments. We have the potential for a very \nproductive work period. Why don't we get to work and see what we can \naccomplish over the next 8 weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the first indication we have to move forward \nand have a productive work period is to see if we can do something to \nhelp the beleaguered people who are losing their homes as we speak. We \nhave the opportunity to do that tomorrow.\n  For those within the sound of my voice, before we can move to a piece \nof legislation, the Republicans have to sign off on that. They can do \nit by approving what we call a motion to proceed. That motion to \nproceed failed before because the Republicans voted no on our ability \nto proceed. We need 60 votes to do that. I hope they will join with us \nto move to this housing package and work to help us come up with a good \npiece of legislation to show there must be some merit to our \nlegislation.\n  I have seen Senator Bond's legislation. It has most of our stuff in \nit. It is a pretty good piece of legislation. It also has some other \nthings in it. It seems to me we are at a good starting point if we have \none of the main Republican proponents of housing legislation who \nincludes in his legislation much of what we want to go forward on. So I \nthink that is a good start. So I hope we can do that tomorrow. If we \nmove forward on the piece of legislation we have, we will finish this. \nWe can do it this week and send it to the House and I think they can \nwork much more quickly than we do. That would be a good indication we \nare going to work together.\n  Let me say this about a couple of other things. As to the \nconfirmation of judges, Josh Bolten, the President's Chief of Staff, \nand I spent a lot of time the week before we went on the Easter recess. \nWe were able to accomplish a lot of good things. I don't know the exact \nnumber, but we were able to work through scores of Republican \nnominations the President sent forward. I think the Democrats got 5 or \n6 and the Republicans got 50 or 60. We don't have the opportunity to \nsend as many names to the President as he sends to us. The President's \nChief of Staff wrote a nice letter, which I received last week, saying \nwe have established a working facility. He is assigning one of his \npeople at the White House, and I have assigned my Chief of Staff. If \nthere are things we cannot work out, Mr. Bolten and I will work on it \nface to face. Part of that is judges. We are going to do our best to \nwork out something on judges. That is part of the entire package.\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\n  Now, even Mr. Bolten would recognize the number of judges being sent \nto us has been pretty slow. But that is no excuse. We will be happy to \nmove forward on nominations, generally. The White House needs a lot of \nthese people, and we understand that. There has to be a give and take \non this, as the White House showed the week before the recess, which \nMr. Bolten and I worked on.\n  So I am convinced there are a lot of things we can do. The farm bill \nis something where we also need the cooperation of the White House. The \nmanagers of this bill have worked very hard--the Senator from Georgia \nand the Senator from Iowa--along with the two managers of the bill, as \nit relates to finance, who have worked with their counterparts in the \nHouse. We need to get a little better work from the White House. We \nhave basically worked out the numbers. We cut back the President's \nnumbers. We are working on the offsets now. That should be something we \ncan do. We need to have the White House engaged in this, but more so \nthan they have been.\n  The farm bill is important. I tell my distinguished counterpart that \nI heard about this farm bill during the break. I had calls from many of \nmy Senators asking what can be done about this. We are trying. As \nSenator McConnell notes, Senator Chambliss, the ranking member on the \nAgriculture Committee, has worked with Senator Harkin. We are doing our \nbest to work through this. I hope we can get something done so we don't \nhave to extend it again. The bill expires again on April 18. We cannot \ngo on without renewing this bill and/or passing a new bill. If we do \nnot renew this legislation, the price of milk will basically go back to \n1949 levels. Based on that, a half gallon of milk would be about $5. So \nwe have a lot of work to do.\n  I appreciate the constructive attitude of the Senator from Kentucky. \nI don't agree with a lot of his illustrations, but I think it was a \npositive statement. I hope we can work something out on these and other \nissues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the spirit in which the \nmajority leader addressed my remarks on the housing issue. I think it \nis safe to say there is interest on both sides in moving forward. \nWhatever reservations we have on this side relate to how the minority \nwill be treated once we have made the decision to move forward. This is \nsomething the majority leader and I will continue to discuss, as we \nhave in the last few weeks.\n  With regard to judges, with the best of intentions, the majority \nleader and I both came up with what we thought was a reasonable goal \nfor the number of circuit judges that ought to be approved in this \nCongress based on the pattern of each of the last three Presidents, \nwhich had, from their point of view, the misfortune of ending their \nterms with the opposition in control of the Senate. The lowest number \nachieved in circuit judges was under President Clinton. It was 15. We \ncurrently have six. If we are going to have any chance of getting to \nwhat the majority leader and I agreed was at least a modest, achievable \ngoal in this Congress, we have a ways to go. I am not blaming him for \nthat. It strikes me that the Judiciary Committee simply isn't \nfunctioning. But it remains the goal of mine--and I hope it is still \nhis goal--to meet a sort of minimal threshold of an acceptable level of \ncircuit judge confirmations.\n  I appreciate the attitude in which the majority leader has pursued \nthat issue from the beginning of this Congress. I hope we can continue \nto work to try to get to some level that would be widely considered by \nany objective standard as a fair number in this situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2211-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, I will pay tribute and make some \ncelebratory remarks about two exciting lives in my community. First is \nthe upcoming celebration of the 80th birthday of Mack Henderson, a man \nin my community who, besides being a leader, has been a warm and \ntrusted friend. He and his wife Jean have been pillars of our \ncommunity. The women's health care facility in Kennesaw was named after \nthem as a tribute. Mack's daughter lives in this area, in Alexandria, \nVA. She has been a great friend to me. The entire Henderson family is \ngoing to gather to celebrate the 80th birthday of Mack Henderson, a \ngreat American and a great citizen of Cobb County. I wish him a most \nhappy birthday.\n  On March 10, another birthday occurred--the very first of my \ngrandson, William Edwin Isakson, born to my son Kevin and his wife \nKatherine Isakson. William is our eighth grandchild. He weighed 7 pound \n9 ounces. He has a great future ahead, and I wish him the very best.\n  It occurred to me, when I was coming to the floor to pay tribute to \nMack Henderson on his 80th birthday and to recognize the birth of my \neighth grandchild, that as I look into the future, I wonder about what \nhas been said in recent months about Social Security and Medicare and \nabout what Mack Henderson has enjoyed in his life and what I hope we \ncan save and procure for the life of young William Edwin Isakson.\n  In Mack's early years, Social Security was created. It was a promise \nto Mack and to every citizen in America that when you reach the age of \n65, and when you sign up and are declared eligible, you will receive a \nsupplement to help you in your retirement years. Mack has been retired \nfor 15 years and is enjoying the benefit of that.\n  Last week, the Social Security Administration sent out a mailer \nnotifying us that the time the Social Security goes bust is now moved \nforward to 2041. So in Mack's lifetime, Social Security was created, \nand by the 33rd birthday of my new grandson, Social Security will be \ngone. Even worse, Medicare, created after Social Security, has \nbenefitted Mack. He has had a heart transplant and other medical \nproblems, and he came through them with the help and assistance of \nMedicare. As for my grandson William, before he is a teenager, Medicare \nwill be broke, inverted, and gone. As a Member of the Senate who takes \na privilege to come to this floor and celebrate the birthday of a great \nfriend and the birth of a new grandson, I know I have some work to do. \nSo do the other 99 Senators and the 435 Representatives on the other \nside of this building.\n  The President who serves now, and who will go out of office in \nJanuary, has made an effort on Social Security, and it was rejected by \norganizations and others. It was an effort of privatization.\n  The next President will not be so lucky to be able to neglect this. \nTime is running out. The next President will probably serve for 8 \nyears. When they are out, it will be 2018, 1 year before Medicare goes \nbroke. I don't think we can afford to allow that to happen.\n  As I come to the floor and pay tribute to these great lives which are \nso meaningful and significant to me, it is also an early warning for \nall of us to get to work on Medicare and Social Security. I commend \nJudd Gregg, the Senator from New Hampshire, for his efforts time and \nagain to get us to deal forthrightly with these issues. They are not \ngoing to be easy.\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\n  I don't want to ever face seeing Medicare go out of business and \nSocial Security go broke. I am willing to stand up and take the heat \nand make the recommendations and work hand in glove with my fellow \nRepublicans and with Democrats to see to it that the events on those \ntwo dates--the date of the death of Medicare in 2019 and end of Social \nSecurity in 2041--never take place. Between the two sides of the \npolitical spectrum, we can find common ground if we have a willingness \nto establish a goal and achieve it. I will never forget when President \nJohn F. Kennedy came forth to the people in America and declared that \none day--8 years later--the United States would launch a man to the \nMoon, land him on the Moon, and bring him home safely. We didn't know \nhow to do that; we didn't have the foggiest idea. We were getting \nbeaten badly by the Soviet Union in mathematics, science, exploration \nand technology, and he was daring us to do something nobody knew how to \ndo. We did it by July of 1969.\n  I don't think saving Medicare and Social Security is as difficult or \nas technical as getting a man to the Moon and bringing him home. But it \nis equally as important--maybe more so--for the health, welfare, and \nlivelihoods of our oldest friends who are in the twilight of their \nyears and our children born to us this year; and it is very important \nto the United States.\n  So this Senator pledges to his newest grandson that I will stand up \nanytime, anyplace, or anywhere and work with my colleagues in the \nSenate to begin the job of seeing that we fix Medicare and Social \nSecurity and that we preserve the promise for our grandchildren that \nour grandfathers have enjoyed and prospered with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend, the Senator from \nGeorgia, on his new grandson. We all hope this country continues to \nhold the promise it has held for so many decades now for all American \nchildren.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2212-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2212-S2213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come today to talk a bit about the \neconomy and where we find ourselves. This week we are going to talk \nabout housing.\n  The effort we have made in the Senate in the majority party to pass \nemergency housing legislation is very important. I want to put up some \ncharts that show what was happening in this country with respect to \nhousing and what was happening at least to begin to cause the partial \ncollapse we have seen.\n  This is an advertisement by a company called Millennia Mortgage. Here \nis what it said to the American people. I don't know this company, but \nthey said:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will \n     give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. . . . Our loan program \n     may reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 \n     percent and allow you no payments for the first 12 months. \n     Call us today.\n\n  Millennia Mortgage. Come over here and get a mortgage from us. You \ndon't have to make a payment for 12 months, they said.\n  Here is a company appropriately named. I don't know this company \neither--Zoom Credit. They told the American people:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit's in the tank. Zoom Credit is like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair, debt \n     consolidation, too, bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who \n     cares?\n\n  That is what Zoom Credit had to say to the American people.\n  Then Countrywide, the country's largest mortgage lender, said:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us . . .\n\n  Just call us; that is not a problem. If you are a bad risk, you don't \npay your bills, call us. This from the largest mortgage lender in this \ncountry.\n  And then we wonder what happened? What could have caused all of this \neconomic trouble? Everyone understands this does not work. Mortgage \nrevenue companies advertising: Come to us if you have bad credit; let \nus give you a loan of some type. And by the way, the same companies, in \nmany cases, applied what is called predatory lending--high-pressure, \ncold-call telephone sales to people who say: I know you have a \nmortgage, but we will give you a different mortgage. We will give you \none with a 2-percent interest rate, not telling them it will reset to 7 \npercent or 9 percent or, in some cases, more with prepayment penalties. \nAnd the broker who was able to convince someone to do that got a big \nfat bonus. The mortgage company, well, they got mortgages with big \ninterest rates once they reset, and prepayment penalties so the people \ncould not get out of them. Then what they were able to do was slice \nthem up and put them into--like they did in the old days, like they \nwould pack sawdust into sausages for filler--they would take good \nmortgages, bad mortgages, subprime, potentially bad, put them all \ntogether, slice them up, dice them, and ship them off to a hedge fund \nthat buys them--in some cases the mortgage banks had their own mortgage \nsides to purchase these securitized investments--and no one knew what \nwas in them. Very much like sausage, I might say. Nobody knew what was \nthere.\n  Now all of a sudden, they have all of this paper out there and we \nhave about 7.2 million families with what are called subprime \nmortgages, an outstanding value of $1.3 trillion. It is estimated that \n2 million families will lose their homes in the next 2 years. By the \nway, 2 million families, that is 5.4 million people who will be \naffected by the loss of their home in the next couple of years.\n  We put together legislation to try to address this issue in the \nSenate, and we have had great difficulty moving it. We hope in the next \nday or so we will at least be able to get a motion to proceed.\n  It is interesting, when we are talking about trying to help some \npeople avoid losing their homes, they say: Well, we don't want to help \nfolks such as that. I agree that those who were buying houses for the \nsake of flipping them, making a bunch of money in the bubble of housing \nprices, I am not interested very much in them, but I am very interested \nin someone who was a victim of predatory lending by a bunch of folks \nwho were getting rich, making a lot of money and those folks are now \nthreatened with losing their house. I am very interested in seeing if \nwe can help them a bit.\n  It is interesting, the big folks always get help. The Federal Reserve \nBoard and the administration, with Treasury Secretary Paulson, have \nrushed in. They arranged for JP Morgan to buy Bear Stearns, a big old \ninvestment bank. Bear Stearns was worth about $20 billion a couple of \nmonths ago. It was acquired by JP Morgan for $1.3 billion in the last \ncouple of weeks and the Federal Government, through the Federal Reserve \nBoard, will put up $29 billion to pick up the risks on the assets. \nThink of that. One investment bank gets a $1.3 billion acquisition of \nanother investment bank that was worth $20 billion a couple of weeks \nago, and the Federal taxpayers come in to provide $29 billion as a \nsafety net for the risk JP Morgan assumes.\n  On top of that, the Fed comes in and says for the first time since \nthe Great Depression that they will make direct loans to investment \nbanks. They have previously made loans to depository banks over which \nthey have regulatory control, but now they will make direct loans to \ninvestment banks.\n  In addition, they will make a $200 billion loan available to Wall \nStreet bond dealers. It is kind of a form of no-fault capitalism.\n  I don't know whether the Fed and the Bush administration are doing \nthe right thing. I don't know. I know we cannot, none of us--the \nadministration or the Fed or the Congress--decide to do nothing. We are \ntrying to decide on behalf of families who are about to lose homes to \nsee if we can't do something to give them some help. Obviously, a lot \nof help has been extended to the Wall Street interests--a lot of help, \n$30 billion, $200 billion, direct lending to investment banks. That is \na lot of help. But when it comes to the homeowners, well, not so fast; \nlet's worry about that, they say.\n\n  The Secretary of the Treasury has made the point that the problem has\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\nnot been the lack of regulation. That has exactly been the problem, \nlack of regulation. We must have some kind of regulatory authority to \nlook over the shoulder and watch and see what is happening. But the \nfact is there has been no regulation.\n  The fact is the Federal Reserve Board in the Greenspan era, more \nrecently Bernanke, and the Bush administration have watched while all \nof these financial engineers have created the most sophisticated of \nsecurities and devices. The financial engineers created things such as \nderivatives, collateralized debt obligations, called CDOs, credit \ndefault swaps--$23 trillion of notional values out there in credit \ndefault swaps--loan syndications, securitization, off-the-balance-sheet \ndebt vehicles. It is unbelievable what has been going on, all in the \nname of financial engineering, and while the economy was going up, \neverybody thought they were all geniuses. And now as it is collapsing \nlike a house of cards, the Federal Reserve and the head of the Treasury \nDepartment rush to try to help the big interests. The question is, what \nabout the rest of the folks who are getting hurt? There are a lot of \nthem. What about the rest?\n  I mentioned Bear Stearns was about to go belly up and the Fed and the \nTreasury Department assessed that could not happen because it would \naffect the entire financial system. I don't know whether they are \nright. I know it has become a kind of no-fault capitalism when the \ninvestment banks can take very big risks, and then when it comes time \nthat it does not work out, the taxpayers come in and say: Don't worry, \nwe will put up a safety net.\n  About 16 months ago, Bear Stearns gave the chairman of Bear Stearns, \nJames Cayne, a stock bonus of $14.8 million. The year before, he had \ngotten $30.3 million in compensation. This company that went belly up \nover the last 5 years, the chairman, Mr. Cayne, made $156 million in \nincome. Let me say that again. This is a company that went belly up \nbecause it took risks that were way outside the norm, in my judgment. \nThe chairman received $156 million between 2002 and 2006. The CEO, Alan \nSchwartz, received $141 million in income during that same period, and \nthe former company president, Warren Spector, $168 million.\n  Let me say that again. Three top officials at Bear Stearns, 15, 16 \nmonths ago received very large bonuses, and in the last 5 years \nreceived the following compensations: $156 million, $141 million, and \n$168 million. This is like hogs in a trough, all except for the \ngrunting and shoving, which we cannot yet hear, but we will, I assume. \nIt is unbelievable. There is unbelievable greed in this system.\n  We are told again by the Secretary of the Treasury that this was not \nthe fault of a lack of regulation. Of course, it was the fault of no \nregulation.\n  This is from the Wall Street Journal, March 2008:\n\n       A year ago at a Honolulu hotel, the heads of three Federal \n     regulatory agencies charged with guarding the soundness of \n     America's banks delivered this message: We're the ones you \n     want regulating you.\n\n  Essentially telling them, we are going to compete for lax \nregulations. It doesn't matter what you do, we are not going to watch \nvery much because we believe in deregulation.\n  So we have an unbelievable amount of hedge fund activity that did not \nuse to exist in this country. It is now completely deregulated--hedge \nfunds involved in derivatives way behind the curtain, and nobody knows \nwhat is going on; mortgage companies advertising that you ought to get \na mortgage from them if you have bad credit because they wish to give \nyou a mortgage, and then they slice it up in securities and send it \naround the world and no one knows what is in these securities. All of a \nsudden that piece of sausage explodes and we wonder why? It exploded \nbecause it never made good business sense, and now the American \ntaxpayers are going to bail them all out.\n  We cannot begin to address this problem unless we understand that \nwhen the big interests are going to make hundreds of millions, even \nbillions of dollars as a result of almost unprecedented greed, there \nneeds to be some regulation. That is a fact. Regulation is not a four-\nletter word. It is an essential part of good government.\n  Long ago, I and others have been on the floor of the Senate talking \nabout need for some regulation with respect to hedge funds, but we have \nnot been able to get legislation through the Congress. But this is not \njust about regulating hedge funds; it is about the agencies that are \nalready empowered to regulate refusing to do their jobs.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury today announced a series of steps that \nhe portrays as a substantial addressing of the issues that are now \ninvolved in subprime lending and the other financial difficulties. But \nin many ways, it is moving the boxes around and, it appears to me to be \nderegulation rather than the need for additional regulation and \nadditional oversight.\n  It is not just in this area of housing, it is not just in the area of \ninvestment banking or hedge funds. I have mentioned on the floor \npreviously that there is unbelievable speculation in a range of areas. \nOil--the fact is I believe, and there are some experts who believe, \nthat the price of oil at the moment is about $30 above where it ought \nto be. Why? Because for the first time hedge funds and investment banks \nare hip deep in the oil futures market, driving up the price of oil, \nhaving nothing at all to do with the supply and demand of oil. Once \nagain, unbelievable speculation. For what purpose? For the purpose of \nunbelievable profitability.\n  We have not had investment banks previously buying oil storage \ncapability so they can buy oil on the futures market and take it off \nthe market and put it in storage and wait until the price goes up. We \nhave not had that before. That is the kind of speculation that I think \nis counter to the interests of this country's economy. It is not \ncounter to the interests of those who want very large profits, even if \nthe rest of the American people have to pay for that unbelievable \nspeculation.\n  There are some who say, if we can address this issue now, the issue \nof housing, the issue of predatory lending, if we can address the issue \nof investment banks, the issues of some hedge funds, that will all be \nfine. That is not the case either. There are some other underlying \nproblems that almost everyone in this world knows but no one is \ninterested in doing anything about it. The dollar is losing value \nsubstantially for a number of reasons, but at least two of those \nreasons are obvious: No. 1, an $800 billion trade deficit; No. 2, the \n$700 billion required additional borrowing this year because of budget \npolicy.\n\n  I know the President says the deficit is a projected $410 billion. \nThat is not true. Take a look at what our country is going to be \nrequired to borrow in the coming years--$700 billion. You add an $800 \nbillion trade deficit to a $700 billion borrowing requirement because \nof a reckless budget policy and you have $1.5 trillion borrowing in 1 \nyear against a $14 trillion economy. People know that doesn't work.\n  I mean, the fact is, we have to fix this system, and we start, it \nseems to me, this week, with the proposition that if we can deal with \nthe housing piece, at least you start trying to help some of the \nAmerican people who really deserve some help at this point in order to \nkeep their homes. That is the first piece of legislation on the floor \nof the Senate this week. That is a reasonable thing to do. If this \nGovernment, at its highest levels, can take billions and tens of \nbillions of dollars around Wall Street and say to the Wall Street \nfirms, here is $29 billion if you will pay $1.3 billion for a firm that \nused to be worth $20 billion a couple weeks ago--if we can do that and \nassume all that risk on behalf of the American taxpayers for the kind \nof activities on Wall Street that represent, in my judgment, unsound \nbusiness practices and unbelievable speculation, this Congress can \ncertainly reach out to home owners across this country to say that we \nwant to give them some help. We will see tomorrow or the next day what \nmight or might not happen with respect to the willingness of this \nSenate to address this housing issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2213-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2213-S2216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I had a chance to meet Herman \nWouk, who is one of America's greatest authors. He wrote ``Caine \nMutiny'' and he wrote ``War and Remembrance.'' He is 91 years old and a \nremarkable man, just a remarkable man. He was telling me something kind \nof in jest. He said:\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nYou know, I don't know much about what happened after 1945, but I know \neverything that happened before 1945. He was talking about his body of \nwork, his research on the Second World War and prior to that period of \ntime. And he wrote wonderful books, as all of us know. He is one of \nAmerica's greatest authors.\n  Herman Wouk and I were talking about the Iraq war and talking about \nthe stories about the Iraq war, and he said to me: Do you know anything \nabout the Truman Committee? Do you know anything about what happened in \nthe Second World War with President Harry Truman, then-Senator Harry \nTruman, who created a committee, a special committee in the United \nStates Senate, bipartisan, to go after this issue of contract fraud \nthat was going on with respect to defense contracting? I told him I \ncertainly did know about the Truman committee, and we have had, I \nbelieve, four votes in the Senate that I offered as amendments to \nestablish a Truman committee.\n  At this point I want to show my colleagues a photograph of a man. I \ndon't know this man personally. This comes from a Thursday, March 27, \nedition of the New York Times.\n  I read an article about this man on an airplane, and I was struck by \nit because it is such an unbelievable story, and it is another chapter \nof, in my judgment, a shameful series of chapters of abuse of the \nAmerican people by contractors with respect to the Iraq war.\n  The New York Times published this article, and this is a picture of a \n22-year-old man from Miami Beach. He had gotten contracts worth over \n$300 million in U.S. taxpayers' dollars, and he had signed a contract \nwith the U.S. Army to provide arms to Afghan soldiers.\n  Apparently, we, as taxpayers, and the U.S. Army, were trying to \nprovide additional arms for the Afghan Army with which to fight and \ndefend itself. So this 22-year-old man got a $300 million contract from \nthe Army Sustainment Command, through a company that had been a shell \nfor a number of years established by this man's father. Mr. Diveroli is \nhis name. This is a mug shot from the Miami Dade Police Department. He \nhad allegedly assaulted a parking lot attendant and had a forged \ndriver's license when he was arrested, which made him out to be 4 years \nolder than he really was. He told police he had gotten the forged \ndriver's license to buy alcohol, but now that he was over 21 he didn't \nneed it any longer.\n  So this is a 22-year-old man who was the CEO of a company called AEY \nbased in Miami Beach. And this is a picture of the building that was \nheadquarters for his company, but there was nothing on any door in the \nbuilding. Apparently, in one part of this building an office was \nsupposed to be his office, but there was nothing that identified his \noffice.\n  And here is a picture of his vice president, the vice president of \nthis company, this company to which the U.S. Army gave a $300 million \ncontract. The vice president is a 25-year-old masseur named David \nPackouz. He is the former vice president of the firm that got $300 \nmillion. So you have a 22-year-old and a 25-year-old masseur who get \n$300 million from the U.S. Army.\n  Now, what did they do with the $300 million? Well, the next \nphotograph, again from the New York Times, shows outdated ammunition \nsold to Afghan forces, including 40-year-old Chinese-made cartridges. \nSo these folks got $300 million and they were providing mid-1960s \ncartridges to the Afghan Army, which the Afghan Army was receiving in \ncardboard boxes that had not been properly taped and were falling \napart. The Afghan Army described these armaments as junk. Here is an \nAfghan policeman surveying 42-year-old Chinese ammunition that arrived \nin crumbling boxes.\n  Again, American taxpayers, through the Army Sustainment Command, paid \nhundreds of millions of dollars to a company that previously had been a \nshell company, a shell corporation, now run by a 22-year-old who says \nthat he is the only employee of the corporation.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have spent a lot of time on the floor of the \nSenate on these kinds of issues. It is pretty unbelievable when you \nthink about it. I don't know Mr. Diveroli personally. Never met him. I \ndo know that three reporters from the New York Times \ndid some extraordinary work--C.J. Chivers, Eric Schmitt, and Nicholas \nWood, to expose his activities. I don't know how long it took them to \ndo this investigative piece, but it is two full pages inside the New \nYork Times. They obviously traveled to Afghanistan and other countries \nto finish this investigative piece. We wouldn't know about this issue \nwere it not for investigative reports by the New York Times.\n  In January of 2007, that is just 14 months ago, the most recent \naward, which I believe was $150 million, was given by the Army \nSustainment Command, and the Army Sustainment Command said:\n\n       AEY's proposal represented the best value to the \n     government.\n\n  I am telling you, this part of the U.S. Army has a lot of explaining \nto do to this Congress and to the American people. This is the same \nArmy Sustainment Command and, incidentally, the same general in charge \nof the Army Sustainment Command who went to a hearing here in the \nSenate, and following my testimony before a hearing about the water \nproblems in Iraq and about Halliburton Corporation providing water to \nthe troops, nonpotable water that was twice as contaminated as raw \nwater from the Euphrates River, we had the evidence, internal \nHalliburton memorandums, saying it was a near miss. It could have \ncaused mass sickness or death. This is the same general who went to \nthat Senate committee and said: Never happened.\n\n  Well, now the inspector general has finished an investigation and \nsaid in fact it did happen. It did happen. This general has some \nexplaining to do.\n  I have asked Secretary Gates, the Defense Secretary, to ask this \ngeneral to explain himself, and so should this Congress.\n  But I don't understand, I just don't understand how even following \ninformation sent to this country, to the Army Sustainment Command by \nU.S. military officers in Afghanistan, saying what they are sending \nover here in the form of armaments under this contract is junk and it \nneeds to stop, even following that it continued. It is an unbelievable \namount of government waste.\n  This is but one issue. And we wouldn't know about it if it were not \nfor the New York Times. This has been going on for years. We have been \nfighting in Iraq longer than we were fighting in the Second World War.\n  Now, let me go back to something they did in the Second World War. \nHarry Truman, in this Chamber, stood up and offered a proposal to \ncreate the Truman Committee, bipartisan. For $15,000, they created a \ncommittee, and it worked for 7 years and saved $15 billion \ninvestigating waste, fraud, and abuse in defense spending during the \nSecond World War. Now, Mr. President, I have been trying for 4 years to \nget this Congress to empower a committee and to impanel a bipartisan \ncommittee to go after this kind of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Let me go over just a few of the things. I have held, I believe, \nabout 12 hearings in the Policy Committee, but the Democratic Policy \nCommittee does not have subpoena power, and I have only held these \nhearings because other committees have not. Oversight is a \nresponsibility of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I want to show a photograph of Bunnatine Greenhouse. I \nhave done it on many occasions. But the reason I wanted to show the \nphotograph is because Bunnatine Greenhouse is a very courageous woman. \nThis woman rose to become the highest civilian official at the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers. This is a remarkable woman. By all accounts, \naccording to people outside of government, she was the finest \npurchasing agent and an unbelievable public servant. But she blew the \nwhistle on abusive Halliburton contracts. She said it was the most \nsignificant abuse of contracting authority she had seen in her career.\n  Guess what happened to her. It is what happens to too many \nwhistleblowers. She got demoted and lost her job. She got demoted \nbecause she had the guts to speak out.\n  This whole issue has now been subsumed behind the wall in the Defense \nDepartment. We can't talk about it now because it is under \ninvestigation. This woman lost her job nearly 4 years\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nago and was replaced, by the way, by someone who had no experience, not \na day's worth of experience in contracting authority. That is the way \nit works over there. You blow the whistle, you pay for it with your \ncareer.\n  I called the person that hired Bunnatine Greenhouse one night at his \nhome--LTG Joe Ballard. He had since retired from the military. And I \nsaid: General Ballard, Bunnatine Greenhouse spoke out about the \nbillions of dollars given the Halliburton Corporation and the abuse and \nthe way those contracts were let and she was demoted. Tell me about \nBunnatine Greenhouse. You hired her.\n  He said: She is the best. She got a raw deal.\n  This is from General Ballard, since retired. Well, the Pentagon \ndecided to award a big no-bid, sole-source contract to the Halliburton \nCorporation. It is called Restore Iraqi Oil, the RIO-C, and then they \nhad other contracts--the LOGCAP contract. The waivers that were \nrequired were not given. This was short-circuited, and we have seen the \nresult of this now for a long period of time.\n  Mr. President, I have been to the floor a good many times to talk \nabout the hearings I have held, and I don't mean to single out \nHalliburton, it is just the company that has gotten the biggest \ncontracts. But when a company gets hundreds of millions of dollars, or \nbillions of dollars and then, in my judgment, is not performing and is \ntaking all the money, we have a right to ask questions. We had $85,000 \nbrand new trucks left beside the road in a zone that was not considered \nhostile at all, to be torched and set on fire because they didn't have \nenough equipment, or didn't have a wrench to fix a tire; $85,000 brand \nnew trucks left to be torched beside the road in safe areas because \nthey had a plugged fuel tank. The attitude is that it doesn't matter, \nthe taxpayers will pay for that. It doesn't matter, it is a cost-plus \ncontract. A cost-plus contract, taxpayers will pay for that.\n  Let me show a towel. It is sometimes the smallest issues that make \nthe biggest points. Henry Bunting came and testified for the \nHalliburton Corporation. He worked in Kuwait. He was the purchasing \nagent for our troops in Iraq.\n  One of his jobs was to purchase towels, so he wrote out a purchase \norder for towels for the troops and his supervisor looked at that and \nsaid no, you can't buy those towels. Bunting wanted to buy plain white \ntowels. He was told that he needed to buy a towel that has KBR's logo, \nKellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, embroidered on it. \nHe said the problem is that will triple the cost of the towels they are \nbuying for the troops. His supervisor said you don't understand, it \ndoesn't matter. These are cost-plus contracts. It doesn't matter.\n  Henry Bunting told us about tripling or quadrupling the cost of \ntowels, about paying $45 for a case of Coca-Cola, about $7,600 for a 1-\nmonth lease of an SUV, about 25 tons of nails sitting on the ground, on \nthe sand of Iraq, because somebody ordered 50,000 pounds of nails and \nordered them too short. It doesn't matter, the taxpayer pays for all \nthat. Throw them on the sand and reorder.\n  How about charging for 42,000 meals for the soldiers, a day, and \nserving only 14,000 meals a day? Missing, 28,000 meals. It doesn't look \nlike an innocent mistake to me. Rory Mayberry came to testify at a \nhearing I held. He was a supervisor of food service for the Halliburton \nsubsidiary. He said we were told that when an auditor came by, don't \nyou dare talk to an auditor. We forbid you to speak to a government \nauditor. He said they were routinely charging for more food for \nsoldiers than solders existed--routinely. He said they were routinely \nserving expired, date-stamped food. The supervisor said it doesn't \nmatter, serve it to the troops.\n  I mentioned the issue of water quality; again, the issue of \nrequirement in the contract to provide water to our troops at the \nmilitary bases in Iraq. That was a Halliburton contract. A couple of \nwhistleblowers came to me and gave me the internal memorandum in the \ncompany. They were providing water that was twice as contaminated as \nraw water from the Euphrates River. I had it in writing. Yet \nHalliburton denied it and so did the U.S. Army. Only when the inspector \ngeneral did the investigation I requested did we find out Halliburton \nwas not telling the truth, nor was the U.S. Army. That is a sad \ncomment.\n  I want to show a picture of some money. The fellow who was holding \nthis cash came to testify. I believe I have a chart that shows the \nmoney. These are one-hundred dollar bills, in bricks, wrapped with \nSaran Wrap. This guy, named Frank--this was in a building in Baghdad. \nDown below in the vault of that building were several billion dollars.\n  By the way, $18 billion of cash was loaded on C-130s, from this \ncountry, to go to Iraq--$18 billion in cash. It was not accounted for.\n  There was a man who was contracted to be able to do the accounting. \nHis name was Howell. His address was a residential home in San Diego, \nCA, and his company allegedly was NorthStar Consulting. No one has ever \nbeen able to find anything NorthStar Consulting did, except we know \nthey got $1.4 million and there is no evidence they had any accounting \non staff, any accountant at all. There is no evidence that any of the \n$18 billion in cash that was moved by C-130 airplanes to Iraq was \naccounted for.\n  This is $2 million. This $2 million.\n  By the way, Frank said from time to time they would throw these \naround as footballs in the office because there was a lot of cash \naround there. He said the refrain in their office was: You bring a bag \nbecause we pay in cash. He said it was like the Wild West.\n  This belonged to Custer Battles, by the way, this cash. They showed \nup in Iraq with no experience, a new company. They got $100 million in \nnew contracts very quickly and then a whistleblower--at least the \nwhistleblower says they threatened to kill him. He said you can't do \nthis. They took forklift trucks that belonged to the Baghdad Airport, \nallegedly painted them blue, and then sold them back to the Coalition \nProvisional Authority. That was us, by the way. We were paying for all \nof that. Custer Battles, this was one of their payments. I expect they \nhave been under criminal investigation now for some while--and if they \nhave not, they should be. That was only $2 million, but they got $100 \nmillion.\n  There is so much to say about these issues. The Parsons Corporation \nis a company that was to build health clinics in Iraq. The Parsons \nCorporation was provided $243 million in a contract by us to build or \nrepair 142 health clinics in the country of Iraq. Three years later the \n$200 million was gone, but there were only 20 health clinics and those \nthat existed were of shoddy construction. A man who was an Iraqi \nphysician, a doctor, came and talked to me about it. He said he went to \nthe Iraqi health minister because he knew this money was supposed to go \nto address health issues in Iraq. He said to the Iraqi health minister, \nI understand an American company got $200-plus million. I want to tour \nall these healthcare facilities that were supposed to be built. The \nIraqi health minister said you don't understand. Many of these were \nimaginary clinics.\n  The money is gone. The American taxpayer got fleeced again. The money \nis all gone, but the clinics don't exist.\n  We have shoveled money out the door here in this Congress. This \nPresident has said I want to send soldiers to war but I do not intend \nto pay for it. Not a cent of it has been paid for. Since the war \nstarted, every single dollar has been requested as an emergency by the \nPresident, emergency spending. It is unbelievable; nearly two-thirds of \na trillion dollars emergency spending. A substantial amount of money \nhas been shoveled out the door here for contracting, very big contracts \nin Iraq--some reconstruction, some replenishment of military accounts, \nbut very large contracts with almost no oversight. The American \ntaxpayer has been stolen blind. This is easy to say, in my judgment, \nthe largest amount of waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this \ncountry.\n  It has gone on for over 5 years. There is no excuse, none, for this \nCongress not creating a Truman committee with subpoena power, \nbipartisan, to investigate and bring justice and provide the oversight \nnecessary on this kind of contract abuse. There is no excuse.\n  I know some over the years have made excuses. I have offered the \namendment three times, perhaps four, but we voted on it three times. I \nhave people stand up in the Senate and say\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nwe are doing the oversight hearings, we are doing hearings. We are not. \nThat is not true. The Appropriations Committee did one a month ago \nafter I pushed and pushed. I appreciate the Appropriations Committee \ndoing it. We will do another one in about a month, a little less than a \nmonth. That is fine. That is not a substitute for doing 60 hearings a \nyear for 7 years, as the Truman committee did.\n  American taxpayers deserve better than they have gotten from this \nPresident and from the Congress for the last 5 years.\n  Senator Reid and I have talked about this a great deal. Senator Reid \nhas aggressively supported the creation of a special committee, a \nbipartisan committee to investigate this kind of waste, fraud, and \nabuse. It is long past the time we do it.\n  I come back to the point I made originally. When I pick up a New York \nTimes and see that $300 million of contracts is given to a shell \ncorporation in Miami, FL, with no name on the door of the building, a \ncorporation headed by a 22-year-old as president, a 26-year-old masseur \nas vice president, I ask the question: Who makes those judgments? Who \nis responsible? Who is accountable?\n  From that several hundred million dollars, 50-year-old weaponry is \nsent to Afghanistan in the name of American taxpayers, in boxes that \nare not taped up properly, weaponry that comes, in some cases, from the \n1960s, in China.\n  That is unbelievable to me. Some might be able to read the New York \nTimes piece and say that is all right, I have read this before. I have \nread we were double charged for gasoline for our American troops in \nIraq. I have read we were overcharged for meals. I read we paid for \nhealth clinics that did not get built. I read all these things. You \nknow what, it is not such a big deal.\n  It is a big deal with me. It ought to be a big deal with this \nCongress. The American people, I think, are sick and tired of this and \nthey deserve a Congress that is going to do something about it.\n  I obviously wish I didn't have to come to the floor to talk about \nthis. I wish instead my energy was devoted to a committee that had \nsubpoena power. The very first thing we should do--and, by the way, I \nam writing a letter to the appropriate subcommittee saying I want you \nto subpoena the principals in this contract and I want you to subpoena \nthe general in charge of the Army Sustainment Command and I want them \nto come to testify and explain to the American people and explain to us \nhow is it during wartime that we seem to blink and turn our head to \nwhat is, I believe, war profiteering. Who has allowed us be that immune \nto the interests of the American troops? This undermines and disserves \nthe American soldiers. It certainly disserves the American taxpayers \nand does not represent the best interests of this country.\n  In the coming days I intend to come to the floor a good many times to \nspeak about this and be a general burr under the saddle--which is a \nterm that people are perhaps more acquainted with in my home State \nbecause we raise a lot of horses. But it seems to me the only way to \nget this sort of thing done is to be a problem and to embarrass those \nwho do not want to do it, and I am prepared to do that. I think it is \nlong past the time to say to the American people: You don't have to \nread it anymore in the newspaper. The newspaper is not going to be \nrequired to do oversight for this Congress. The Congress finally, at \nlong last, will do its own oversight and will do a good job and tell \nthe American people you can count on us. That has not been the case \nearlier when this war started because no one wanted to do the necessary \nkind of oversight because it was the kind of oversight that would \nprobably raise some hackles and embarrass some folks.\n  I might also say, there was a piece of legislation passed--in fact, \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Webb, and Senator McCaskill and others \nput it together last year, which I supported--which deals with a Truman \ncommission. It is not the equivalent of a Truman committee. A Truman \ncommittee is a standing committee with subpoena power, but the Truman \nCommission is a step forward and I supported it. It will be a \ncommission that operates on a one-time basis to develop recommendations \nand take a look at what is happening.\n  The Wartime Contracting Commission has a 2-year sunset, and I commend \nmy colleagues for trying to put together and for successfully putting \ntogether a commission, but I do say that we need in this Congress a \ncommittee, a bipartisan select committee, with subpoena power and we \nneed it now.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for \nsuch time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2216-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2216-S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AMERICAN HISTORY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in the Senate, we are surrounded by history. \nThe same can be said of the Capitol itself and, of course, of \nWashington, DC. It is very humbling to think that when we travel around \nthe Nation's Capital, we are following the paths that many great \nstatesmen walked before us.\n  Reflecting on our past can be a source of great pleasure, and it can \nlead to great insight. Learning about the lives of great Americans--the \ngrand accomplishments and humanizing habits--is both entertaining and \neducational. Indeed, it is emblazoned in the rotunda in the Library of \nCongress that ``History is the biography of great men.'' The \naccomplishments of great Americans give us heights to which to aspire, \nand their failures give us guidance for our own pursuits.\n  Unfortunately, the pleasure of knowing history escapes many younger \nAmericans. Study after study has shown that our students lack even a \nrudimentary knowledge of American history.\n  The most recent National Assessment of Education Progress found that \nelementary, middle, and high school students fall short in terms of \nwhat they know about U.S. history. According to the NAEP, the Nation's \nreport card, roughly a third of fourth graders and eighth graders fall \nbelow what is deemed a ``basic'' level of proficiency in U.S. history. \nOur high schoolers fare much worse. More than half of 12th graders fall \nbelow the ``basic level.''\n  The news does not improve as students move on to college. Older \nstudents fare poorly as well, even those who attend what are considered \nour top universities and colleges. A recent survey of college freshmen \nand seniors revealed that many students are ignorant of what many of us \nconsider basic facts of American history. For instance, only 47 percent \nof freshmen knew that Yorktown brought the Revolutionary War to an end. \nSeniors did even worse--only 45 percent knew. Another example: 42 \npercent of college freshmen could not identify on a multiple-choice \ntest the 25-year period during which Abraham Lincoln was elected \nPresident. And another: 15 percent of seniors did not know that the \nDeclaration of Independence denotes the inalienable rights of life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  The results are disappointing, to say the least. They reveal that \nyounger Americans have a poor concept of what is necessary for good \ncitizenship. What is the basis for the social compact of Americans? \nMany younger Americans do not know that our Government was founded on \nprinciples and values of innate equality and liberty. We have known \nabout these deficiencies for a long time. Yet very little progress has \noccurred. This must change if American voters are to be able to \nevaluate candidates and issues on the basis of American principles and \nvalues.\n  It was 13 years ago that the Senate debated the national illiteracy \nof U.S. history. At that time, the Senate was considering controversial \nnational U.S. history standards. These standards were flawed, \nneglecting important individuals, ideas, and events for the sake\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\nof politically correct subjects. As poor as the standards were, they \ndid respond to what many recognized as a serious and legitimate \nproblem: the Nation's children were not learning U.S. history.\n  As Senator Slade Gorton noted during that debate:\n\n       The founding truths of this country may have been self-\n     evident to the Founders, but as studies have demonstrated \n     again and again, they are not genetically transmitted.\n\n  Studies have continued to demonstrate just that.\n  So what to do about it? Most of what we learn about our country we \nlearn in school, but today's curricula does little to interest our \nstudents. So says former Secretary of Education William Bennett. In an \narticle in National Review last year, he wrote:\n\n       It's not our children's fault. . . .Many of our history \n     books are either too tendentious--disseminating a one-sided, \n     politically correct view of history of the greatest nation \n     that ever existed; or, worse, they are boring--providing a \n     watered down, anemic version of a people who have fought wars \n     at home and abroad for the purposes of liberty and equality, \n     conquered deadly diseases, and placed men on the moon.\n\n  Today's textbooks, say scholars like Bennett, do not relate the drama \nof our Nation, they are lifeless and boring, and they shy away from \nconveying the uniqueness and the extraordinary nature of America. Ours \nis a very special Nation based on what our Founders called ``truths.'' \nIs it conceivable that our unprecedented freedom, success, and \nleadership is influenced by these truths and the governmental \nstructures designed to reflect them? You would not know it from some \nhistories.\n  I believe our students would be well served by reading texts such as \n``A Patriot's History of the United States.'' I like the way the \nauthors of this book describe their approach to writing a volume of \nAmerican history. They say:\n\n       We remain convinced that if the story of America's past is \n     told fairly, the result cannot be anything but a deepened \n     patriotism, a sense of awe at the obstacles overcome, the \n     passion invested, the blood and tears spilled, and the nation \n     that was built.\n\n  That is the spirit we should convey to our children. And it does not \nhave to be politically correct--just fair. Of course, American history \ncannot ignore the bad, but it also should not neglect individuals, \nideas, and events that inspire.\n  My colleague, Senator Lieberman, had it right in 1995. He said:\n\n       We do not need sanitized history that only celebrates our \n     triumphs. . . .But we also do not need to give our children a \n     warped and negative view of Western civilization, of American \n     civilization, of the accomplishments, the extraordinary \n     accomplishments and contributions of both.\n\n  Why is this important today? First, to quote my colleague from \nConnecticut again:\n\n       History is important. We learn from it. It tells us who we \n     are, and from our sense of who we are, we help determine who \n     we will be by our actions.\n\n  It is especially important in an election year, where knowledge of \nthe past can help us evaluate events and candidates of today.\n  It is imperative that in these times Americans understand who we are \nas Americans. Americans must comprehend the principles and values on \nwhich this country was built because we are engaged in a great \nideological confrontation with people who are dedicated to destroying \nus--a confrontation that will be arduous and difficult. The terrorist \nconflict in which we are engaged is one of values and principles, and \nfuture generations cannot act on these values if they are ignorant of \nAmerican history.\n  When citizens begin to grow ignorant of who they are, one of the \nfirst symptoms is a loss of willpower. Learning about our past tells us \nwho we are, and with that knowledge we are equipped to face the \nchallenges and fight the wars we face today and in the future. Indeed, \nif future generations do not appreciate what we have--why it is so \nprecious, why it needs defending--they will not do the hard things \nnecessary to defend it.\n  In a speech to Harvard University's graduating class of 1978, \nAlexander Solzhenitsyn confronted the West's weak confrontation of \ncommunism.\n  It is probably worth noting here another item in the survey of \ncollege students I mentioned earlier. That survey found that about a \nquarter of freshmen were unable to complete this sentence correctly: \n``The major powers at odds with each other in the 'Cold War' were the \nUnited States and [blank].'' A quarter of the students could not come \nup with the name--Soviet Union--and it was a multiple-choice quiz.\n  Solzhenitsyn's speech is particularly instructive even as we face a \ndifferent ideological threat today. He warned:\n\n       No weapons, no matter how powerful, can help the West until \n     it overcomes its loss of willpower.\n\n  Some of the debates we have been having in the Senate raise the \nquestion of whether we are there again.\n  Thirty years after Solzhenitsyn, we need to summon willpower for this \nnew conflict. We are engaged in a struggle against a radical ideology \nwhose adherents want to eradicate us. The enemy we are fighting hates \nus because of our values and our principles, the origins of which are \nunknown to many young Americans. But a lack of willpower has inhibited \nour struggle against these global terrorists.\n  Last year, the Senate spent many hours debating whether to withdraw \nfrom Iraq before we had completed our mission. We have spent too much \ntime arguing over terrorists' civil rights. Solzhenitsyn, in fact, \npresaged our current debate in 1978 when he observed:\n\n       When a government starts an earnest fight against \n     terrorism, public opinion immediately accuses it of violating \n     the terrorist's civil rights.\n\n  Such accusations are a sign of a lack of will to defeat an implacable \nenemy.\n  This brings me to a final figure, another Soviet dissident and \nanother witness to the destructive power of dangerous ideologies, like \nSolzhenitsyn. These are both men who understand the necessity of \nwillpower in the face of evil.\n  A couple of years ago, writing in the journal ``The New Criterion,'' \nRoger Kimball, in his essay ``After the suicide of the West,'' \ndiscussed the insights of the Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, who \nlived both through the fascism of the Nazis and the communism of the \nSoviet Empire. He was also active in the Polish Solidarity movement. \nKimball paraphrases Kolakowski and illuminates why knowledge of our \nhistory is so key for the maintenance of our willpower. Kimball writes:\n\n       Kolakowski is surely right that our liberal, pluralistic \n     democracy depends for its survival not only on the continued \n     existence of its institutions, but also ``on belief in their \n     value and a widespread will to defend them.''\n\n  One can surely question whether the next generation of Americans \nreally believes in the value of our institutions. After all, what is it \nthey have to base their judgment on when they know very little about \nthe institutions themselves?\n  A few years ago, in 2003, the Library of Congress recognized \nKolakowski for his intellectual achievements. After receiving his \naward, he made a speech in which he passionately explained why history \nis so important and why it is an important matter for discussion.\n  He said:\n\n       Historical knowledge is crucial to each of us: to \n     schoolchildren and students, to young and to old. We must \n     absorb history as our own, with all its horrors and \n     monstrosities, as well as its beauty and splendor, its \n     cruelties and persecutions, as well as all the magnificent \n     works of the human mind and hand; we must do this if we are \n     to know our proper place in the universe, to know who we are \n     and how we should act.\n\n  And he goes on:\n\n       One might ask what is the point of repeating these \n     banalities? The answer is that it is important to keep on \n     repeating them again and again, because these are banalities \n     we often find it convenient to forget; and if we forget them \n     and they fall into oblivion, we will be condemning our \n     culture, that is to say ourselves, to ultimate and \n     irrevocable ruin.\n\n  Studies of our young people's knowledge of history confirm the wisdom \nof this observation and raise questions about the risk to our history \nof falling into oblivion.\n  ``Thankfully, historical amnesia still has a cure,'' Secretary Bill \nBennett reminds us. ``Let us begin the regimen now.''\n  We need a cure, because as long as we suffer from this amnesia, we \nwill be fighting two wars: a war against our enemies who wish to do us \nharm and a war against our will, the loss of which will let them.\n  The fate of future generations depends on how we answer the enemy's \nchallenge today. To do that, we must\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\nclearly understand the values and principles that make us who we are. \nThe truth is no one will fight long, either literally or figuratively, \nfor values and principles he doesn't understand.\n  Americans must know what is worth fighting for, must maintain the \nwillpower to do it, and must apply the lessons of our past to our \ncurrent threats. So we must find a way to help students understand the \nvalues and the principles upon which our Nation is founded. The \nsolution begins at a fundamental level of learning and education. Our \nstudents need textbooks that capture the life of history--Bill Bennett \nsuggests a national contest for better history textbooks--and draw \nyoung people to the study of our Nation's story.\n  The solution, however, must go beyond changes to curriculum. As a \nnation, we must learn to embrace our history again and discard the \npolitically correct, relativistic version of our history that has \npersisted for far too long. We must act now to preserve for future \ngenerations what we know to be so important. Let us get about the job.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last year, Americans across the \ncountry have watched as our economy has faltered, and for far too many \nfamilies the economic downturn has hit home in the form of a \nforeclosure. This is a time when we badly need a strong and effective \nresponse from the administration led, in part, by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  But instead of helping the millions of families who are struggling to \nstay above water, HUD has been almost constantly distracted by the \nethical questions that have been facing its Secretary, Alphonso \nJackson. Ten days ago, I felt the problem had reached a breaking point, \nso I called for Secretary Jackson's resignation. Today, Mr. Jackson \nannounced he has decided to move on, and President Bush must now \nnominate a new Housing Secretary with the experience and the \ncredibility to attack this crisis rather than hide from it.\n  Mr. President, I hope this development is a sign that the \nadministration wants to finally make the needs of American families a \npriority. I hope it is a sign that the administration wants to work \nwith Congress on a meaningful response to the crisis that has swept \nacross this Nation. I hope President Bush will change his position and \nsupport our effort to pass legislation that will help millions of \nfamilies who are facing foreclosure today.\n  This week, we will give President Bush and the Republican Senators \nthat chance again as we take up the Foreclosure Prevention Act for the \nsecond time this year. Until now, it seems that some on the other side \nof the aisle have been more responsive to Wall Street than Main Street.\n  So I hope my colleagues who were home over the break have listened, \nas I have, to the concerns of their constituents and have now returned \nready to work and address our Nation's housing crisis. This truly is a \ncrisis. I wish to spend a couple minutes talking about why we have to \ntake action now.\n  As many as 2 million American families are going to lose their homes \nto foreclosure this year. Each foreclosure represents a family whose \ndream of a comfortable home and secure future has been dashed. Each \nforeclosure weakens the foundation of our entire economy and our \ncommunities. Foreclosures have left our neighborhoods full of vacant \nhomes. Foreclosures have left our families distressed and troubled, and \ncommunities are now reporting a higher crime rate as a result of this \ncrisis. State and local governments are seeing their tax revenues drop \neven as their needs are piling up. We in Congress can help prevent this \nby investing in our communities and providing support for families who \nrisk losing everything.\n  The Foreclosure Prevention Act would make changes in bankruptcy laws \nso that more financially troubled families could keep their homes. It \nwould change lending laws to prevent more borrowers from accepting \nterms they don't understand and cannot afford. It would provide an \nadditional $200 million to help housing counselors continue to reach \nout to families who are at risk of foreclosure.\n  I wish to focus on the last point because it is extremely important. \nToo many homeowners today don't know they can get help when they get \nbehind on their mortgage. Too many of them don't contact their lender \nwhen they miss their first payment. Too many are just intimidated or \ndon't feel they can trust anyone. The Foreclosure Prevention Act would \ngive counseling agencies the resources they need to reach out and let \nborrowers know they have options. Counseling can help families \nnegotiate with their lenders, readjust their payments, or learn how to \nbudget their expenses better.\n  Last month, I had the opportunity to meet a single mother from Ohio. \nShe had fallen on hard times which, in turn, led her to fall behind in \nher mortgage. Luckily, with housing counseling made possible by \nNeighborWorks America, she and her children were able to stay in their \nhome. She explained to me that when she got behind, she was simply \noverwhelmed; she didn't know what to do. She said this is not something \nabout which they teach you in school.\n  Our economic health in this country depends on Americans having a \nsafe and stable place to live and raise their families. We want every \nfamily to know there is help out there. The Foreclosure Prevention Act \nwould help make sure families that risk losing everything get the help \nthey need before it is too late.\n  Across this country, people are worried about whether they are going \nto be able to keep their homes, whether their jobs will be eliminated, \nand how they are going to pay for health care when they or their \nchildren get sick. These are real families, and these are real \ncommunities in need of help.\n  We need to pass this reform immediately. Americans want action. We \nwanted to pass it last month, and we were stopped by Republican efforts \nto block this bill. So I hope now, as we have returned from the recess, \nPresident Bush and our Republican colleagues will support our efforts. \nI hope they will come with us tomorrow, stand with us, and pass \nmeaningful reform that will give homeowners the help they need, allow \nthem to keep their homes, give their families hope, and ultimately make \nour communities strong again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of my fellow Americans are very \naware of the exhilaration but also the dangers and risks of commercial \nfishing in Alaska's Bering Sea. The pictures and the stories--and even \nthe sounds--are brought into our living rooms every week on the \nDiscovery Channel program ``The Deadliest Catch.'' Many have seen it.\n  When the Bering Sea fishing fleet finds itself in trouble, they rely \non the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard to truly make order from \nthe chaos. These stories have not escaped Hollywood's attention. It is \nnot only seen on ``The Deadliest Catch,'' but there was a 2006 feature \nfilm, ``The Guardian,'' starring Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher, \nwhich paid tribute to the Coast Guard search and rescue teams based at \nAir Station Kodiak in Alaska. Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak is home to \naircrews and rescue swimmers who endure some of the\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\nharshest winds and seas in the world. They put their own lives on the \nline every day so that others may live.\n  The events that were depicted in ``The Guardian'' were fictional, but \nthe events that transpired this past Easter morning in the Bering Sea \nwere very real. I rise today to honor the men and women of the U.S. \nCoast Guard who participated in efforts to rescue the 47-member crew of \nthe fishing vessel Alaska Ranger. As a direct result of these heroic \nefforts, 42 members of the Ranger's crew survived. There were no Coast \nGuard lives lost. In the words of RADM Arthur Brooks, commander of the \nSeventeenth Coast Guard District, it was ``one of the greatest search \nand rescue efforts in modern history.''\n  Let me kind of paint the scene for you. It was 2:52 a.m. local time \non Easter Sunday, March 23, that the Alaska Ranger, a Seattle-based \nfactory trawler, radioed the Coast Guard Communications Station Kodiak \nwith a distress call. The vessel at that time was located 120 miles \nwest of Dutch Harbor at the end of the Aleutian Chain. The vessel was \ntaking on water. There were 25-knot winds and seas 6 to 8 feet high.\n  The Coast Guard immediately launched a rescue effort. There was a \ncutter, two helicopters, and a C-130. The crew of the Ranger had to \nabandon ship before the first Coast Guard asset arrived.\n  First to arrive on the scene is a Coast Guard Jayhawk Rescue \nHelicopter, deployed from St. Paul Island, located about 230 miles to \nthe north of where the Alaska Ranger was at the time.\n  The Jayhawk carried a crew of four men. There was no backup. The \nJayhawk arrives on the scene about 5:30 a.m. This is about 2\\1/2\\ hours \nafter the first distress call. This helps put in perspective the \ndistances with which we are dealing. By this point in time, the Alaska \nRanger has already sunk in the water. The vessel is completely gone. It \nhas already sunk in water that is more than 6,300 feet deep.\n  The air crew flies in and looks upon this sea of flashing strobe \nlights. Keep in mind, this is 5:30 in the morning. It is still dark. \nThey have wind and sleet and waves coming up, and they see this sea of \nflashing strobe lights, probably a mile end to end. They are looking \ndown at this scene through the helicopter thinking there is a light \nthere: Is that a liferaft? Yet another light and another light. Each \nlight is a member of the Ranger's crew wearing a survival suit. Some \nare in liferafts, but others were literally in this human chain \nstretching almost a mile in length. Others are floating alone. The \nwater temperature in the sea is about 32 degrees.\n  Rescue swimmer O'Brien Hollow is lowered into the water to triage the \nsurvivors. One by one, he positions the survivors to be hoisted into \nthe helicopter above. The helicopter is tossing above in these very \nheavy winds. Hollow is tethered to the helicopter from above.\n  We also have then the Coast Guard cutter Munro. It has been diverted \nfrom its position 130 nautical miles south of the incident. It is \nracing to the scene at the speed of about 30 knots.\n  The Munro carries a Dolphin rescue helicopter which lifts off the \nMunro some 80 miles before the cutter arrives at the scene.\n  Rescue swimmer Abram Heller is lowered into the water and begins to \ngather victims to be hoisted into the basket to be lifted up into the \nhelicopter. Heller stays in the water to make room on the Dolphin for \nsurvivors.\n  One has to remember, they have some 47 men in the water. They are \ntrying to lift them into the basket and then into the helicopter, but \nthe helicopter can only accommodate so many people. The rescue swimmer \nis saying: I am going to stay down here; move this group to safety.\n  The Jayhawk then departs the scene for the Munro, but the Jayhawk \ncannot land on the cutter's deck because it is too big. So the Jayhawk \ncrew hoists the survivors down to the Munro's deck one by one. Just as \nthey have been lifting survivors out of the sea into this helicopter \nthat is pitching around in the air, they now have to be dropped down to \nthe deck one at a time in the basket.\n  In the meantime, a fuel line is sent up from the Munro's deck to \nrefuel the Jayhawk, and it then departs to the scene.\n  The Jayhawk recovers Heller, the rescue swimmer who has been down \nthere with the survivors, and rescues more survivors. In total, the \nJayhawk is responsible for saving 15 lives. The Dolphin saves five \nlives.\n  The third player in this supremely heroic effort is a Coast Guard C-\n130, which circled over the scene serving as an airborne coordination \nand communications platform.\n  The Coast Guard also received substantial assistance from the \nRanger's sister fishing vessel, the Alaska Warrior. The Alaska Warrior \nalso had been out on the Alaska fishing grounds. They left their \nfishing grounds to pick up 22 survivors from the Ranger who were in \nliferafts and then returned them to Dutch Harbor.\n  Unfortunately, four of the Ranger's crew members could not be saved. \nOne still remains unaccounted for. The Coast Guard sent the Jayhawk and \na C-130 back to the scene with fresh crews to search for the missing \nmariner but without success. The search for the missing crew member was \nsuspended on Tuesday, March 25.\n  The Coast Guard uses the maritime phrase ``Bravo Zulu'' to recognize \na job well done, and this was truly a job well done. While the Coast \nGuard rigorously trains its people to perform this mission, it is very \nrare to undertake a mission of this intensity and this complexity.\n  Rescue swimmers Hollow and Heller had participated in rescues before \nbut nothing approaching this kind of a rescue. In fact, rescues of this \nnature are extremely rare. After very carefully examining the records \ndating back over 30 years, the Coast Guard could only find a couple \nmass rescue cases that were even remotely similar to what we \nexperienced on Easter.\n  While dramatic search-and-rescue cases are no stranger to Alaska, \nmost involve 10 victims or less. Others involve a much more orderly \nabandonment of a vessel. This was the case in 1980, when the cruise \nship Prinsendam went down near Yakutat, AK. But large numbers of people \nabandoning ship directly into the water hardly ever happens. That is \none more reason why this rescue effort was remarkable. But it is not \nthe only reason.\n  The risks that were involved in this case were extreme. They had, \nagain, darkness, extremely high winds, high seas, ice, freezing \ntemperatures, extremely long distances from any supporting \ninfrastructure, and all these conditions present unique hazards to the \nrescuers.\n  Success such as this could not occur without the commitment of a \ngreat many people. The crews of the Jayhawk, the Dolphin, and the Munro \nwill long be remembered for their heroism.\n  Backing them were the watch standers at Coast Guard Communications \nStation Kodiak. These were the folks who answered the Alaska Ranger's \nmayday call. The C-130 crews, the Kodiak Air Station duty officers, and \nthe District 17 command center controllers in Juneau also contributed. \nIn total, something on the order of 170 Alaska-based Coast Guard men \nand women were involved in this effort.\n  ADM Thad Allen has already expressed ``Bravo Zulu'' to all the men \nand women involved with this effort. I am honored to take a few minutes \nfrom the Senate's day to praise these men and women of the U.S. Coast \nGuard on a job well done. Our Nation is always well served by these \nhighly trained individuals who stand ``always ready.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2219-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2219-S2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2008\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes today to \nspeak about legislation I introduced before we went on our 2-week \nrecess. This is legislation that is cosponsored by my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  It made great sense when the price of oil hit $111.72 a barrel, which \nis an all-time record high, and it still makes sense today, even with \nthe price of oil having declined to $101, as it is today. It is a bill \nthat will call for the United States to actually take steps to produce \nmore oil, to actually help increase global supplies of petroleum to \nlower prices, and to use all the Federal revenues from the oil \nproduction to fund many forms of alternative energy and the programs \nthat help Americans deal with high energy and food prices.\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\n  The legislation is entitled the ``American Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2008.'' This legislation would automatically open the \nCoastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern Alaska \nif the world price of oil tops $125 a barrel for 5 days. In return, it \nallocates all the Federal revenues that would come from that oil to \nboth alternative energy development and to provide programs to help \nimprove energy efficiencies to those in need.\n  The revenue includes the estimated $3.5 billion of Federal lease, \nbonus, and royalty revenues within the first 5 years, plus all the oil \nproduction tax revenues over the life of the field.\n  This is an estimated $191 billion to $297 billion to fund wind, \nsolar, biomass, geothermal, ocean, landfill gas--everything covered by \nthe two Energy bills we passed in 2005 and 2007, plus programs such as \nLIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, that provides \naid to help low-income residents pay for home heating and cooling, the \nweatherization program that helps people improve their insulation to \ncut energy costs, and also to the Women, Infants, and Children's \nnutrition program that provides a safety net for nutrition costs, when \nenergy prices rise so high women cannot afford to buy food for their \nbabies and young infants. By the way, the estimates of those total \nrevenues are not my estimates that I have worked up; they were \ndeveloped by the Congressional Research Service.\n  We know there is a lot of hand-wringing in Washington about what to \ndo about record-high oil prices that are strangling our economy from \nthe east coast all the way west and certainly up to Alaska. Rather than \nbegging Arab oil sheiks to produce more oil, America should produce our \nown oil to send a signal that we are willing to increase our own \nsupplies and drive down prices.\n  Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain is likely to hold the largest reserve \nof traditional oil left on land in Northern America. If the price rises \nany higher, we should explore the area and find out if there is oil \nthere. And if there is, we ought to produce it and use the revenues to \nwean ourselves from the fossil fuels and to promote energy \nconservation.\n  We know so many Americans are hurting every time they fill up their \ncars at the pump. And while prices may moderate fractionally, the AAA \nearly this month reported gasoline prices have risen 26.9 cents \nnationwide since February 10. In Alaska, my home State, the average \nprice of gasoline is $3.36 a gallon for regular. This is trailing \nCalifornia and Hawaii by a little bit.\n  Americans are having an equally hard time affording their winter \nheating bills and will have similar problems with their summer air-\nconditioning bills. So it only makes sense the revenues from finding \nand producing U.S. oil go to help the people who are having trouble \nmaking ends meet, given the high fuel prices we are facing.\n  By this legislation, only 2,000 acres of the 1.5 million acres of the \nArctic Coastal Plain can be physically disturbed. The bill includes a \nhost of environmental protections. It requires directional drilling to \nbe used to minimize disturbance to the wildlife. That means wells can \nbe drilled from a single oil pad that can go underground up to 8 miles \naway to find the oil pockets. That means that there will be nearly 100 \nsquare miles of habitat for caribou and musk oxen and the birds between \nthese well pads.\n  The bill mandates exploration only occurs in winter, when there are \nno animals on the Coastal Plain to be disturbed. It requires the use of \nice roads that disappear in the summer to protect the wildlife. It \nallows special areas to be designated to protect key habitat to keep \nany activity out. It contains dozens of other stipulations to guard \nagainst noise, flight disturbances, spills or land-use problems.\n  The bill also sets up a special fund to help protect Alaska and \nCanadian Natives should they face any disruptions because of the \nlimited development that would be allowed.\n  The bill earmarks not just the $3.5 billion of expected initial \nFederal lease royalties and the potential $192 billion to $297 billion \nof total Federal income taxes from the first 30 years of energy \nproduction, to be split evenly, half would be going then to alternative \nenergy projects contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007 that we approved in \nDecember. The other half would be allocated evenly to LIHEAP, \nweatherization, and to the WIC programs.\n  In a hearing we held earlier this month, there was a discussion about \nLIHEAP and LIHEAP funding. We recognized that LIHEAP needs $2 billion a \nyear in additional funding to be fully funded. This legislation could \ndo this for 30 years if we were to pass it.\n  We need a balanced program to increase alternative energy development \nand improve energy efficiency, but we also need to fund these programs \nwithout increasing our Federal debt. Look at the fights we are having \nto find the offsets to pay for extending tax breaks to further \nalternative energy. The best way to fund alternatives is by raising new \nrevenue. Look at the pain we are having in crafting and approving the \nongoing budget resolution.\n\n  We know this pain is going to continue for years if we don't do \nsomething, and the best way is by using the funds from the fossil fuels \nto build alternatives. By doing that, we are using domestic oil as a \nbridge, as a bridge to pay for the alternative fuels that will allow us \nto reduce our use of fossil fuels and cut our carbon emissions.\n  Opening ANWR does so many things. It makes us less dependent on \nforeign oil, it cuts our balance of payments deficit, it improves our \neconomy, it keeps our jobs at home instead of exporting them to foreign \noil producers such as Venezuela and the Middle East. More importantly, \nsignaling we are finally serious about helping ourselves, that we will \nproduce oil from ANWR, will help to drive down the psychology and the \nspeculation that is currently acting to drive up world oil prices.\n  Admittedly, if we were to open ANWR tomorrow, it is not going to \nproduce more oil tomorrow, but it will or it can dampen the speculation \nthat is helping to fuel higher prices. It is absolutely the right thing \nto do today, and it is vital if prices rise higher, as we believe they \nwill.\n  The U.S. economy is at risk if prices rise, not counting the health \nof our low- and middle-income residents. Folks are drowning under the \nhigh cost of gasoline and the high cost of heating oil. This bill helps \nto reduce that pain. If the prices get any higher, we have to produce \nmore oil as a means of driving down market forces.\n  This bill contains all of the environmental safeguards that will \nallow us to open a tiny fraction of the 40 million acres of the Arctic \nCoastal Plain in Alaska without harming the wildlife or the \nenvironment. It won't hurt the polar bears. It won't hurt the yellow \nloon. And doing onshore development certainly protects the marine \nenvironment and the whale and the walrus and the polar bear that spends \n90 percent of its life offshore on the Arctic ice pack.\n  This bill is cautious. It doesn't open the refuge tomorrow, but it \nsimply says if oil prices rise much further we have to take action to \nshow markets that we are serious about helping ourselves and producing \nmore domestic supplies of oil and natural gas. It responsibly takes all \nthe proceeds and puts them toward alternatives and safety net program \nfor those who can't afford these prices. Using these monies for these \nexisting programs will free up funds in the Federal budget to help \nreduce the debt or fund other vital services.\n  I am realistic about the fate of this legislation. I doubt that the \nleadership in this body will allow this bill to come up for a vote \nright now. But everyone here, from Senators who represent farmers who \nwon't be able to afford to till their fields this spring during the \nplanting season due to the high prices, to those who represent cold \nStates, where home heating oil is a problem, to those Senators who \nrepresent warm States, where air-conditioning costs will be a concern, \nto those of us who represent fishermen who are worried about how they \nwill afford the fuel to go out and earn their living, we should come \ntogether to support this commonsense way to help reduce prices and to \nactually help provide a real long-term solution to our supply problems.\n  We owe to it our constituents to do what is right, and I believe this \nis what is right for our Nation's future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2221-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n                      IN HONOR OF CESAR CHAVEZ DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in appreciation of the life and \nlasting legacy of civil rights activist and labor leader, Cesar Chavez.\n  Cesar Chavez came from humble beginnings, born on March 31, 1927, in \na small farm outside of Yuma, AZ. Through his experiences as a laborer \nand migrant worker in the fields of the southwest United States, he \nrecognized a need for change; change that would bring social and \neconomic equality to those who tilled America's soil and harvested \nAmerica's crops. The exploitation and discrimination experienced and \nobserved by Mr. Chavez energized his courageous fight for fair and \nequal treatment for his hardworking colleagues of all backgrounds.\n  As a member of the U.S. Navy he served in the western Pacific during \nthe end of World War II to protect the freedoms that he often did not \nenjoy. He demonstrated his dedication to two great values--community \nand compassion--by building a powerful coalition of grass roots \norganizations and inspiring individuals of all backgrounds to join a \ncampaign for social equality.\n  Cesar Chavez is not only an icon for Mexican-American communities \nacross this great country, but also an American icon for all those who \nhave felt the pain of injustice and for those who recognize the \ncontinuing need to allow equal access to the resources of our great \nNation. His tireless efforts to help bring our country closer to its \nideals of freedom and equality of opportunity shall be recognized today \nas they were when he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom. His legacy inspires hope, action, and prosperity for those who \nare often burdened by marginalization and discrimination. Our society \nowes gratitude to the indelible mark that Mr. Chavez has left on our \nNation.\n  I appreciate the Clark County Commission for commemorating the legacy \nof a giant in our Nation's labor movement by declaring March 31, 2008, \nas Cesar Chavez Day. I join the Commission, and many throughout Nevada, \nin honoring Mr. Chavez's visionary leadership. We must continue to \nrecognize the value in Cesar Chavez's legacy, which has become a symbol \nof dignity and perseverance for all workers, whether in the fields, in \nthe factories, or behind the counter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2221-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2221-S2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VETERANS EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE.\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative branch.\n       (b) Purpose of regulations. The regulations set forth \n     herein are the substantive regulations that the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n       H Regs:   (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch.

Sec. 1301 \n     (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; (4) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n       S Regs:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch.

Accordingly, these regulations \n     shall not apply to any employing office that only employs \n     individuals excluded from the definition of covered employee.\n       C Reg:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch.

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(A) of \n     the VEOA generally authorizes the Board to issue \n     regulations to implement section 4(c). In addition, \n     section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations that are ``the same as the most \n     relevant substantive regulations (applicable with respect \n     to the Executive branch) promulgated to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in paragraph (2)'' of \n     section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory provisions are \n     section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I \n     of chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. The \n     regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters \n     for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA requires a \n     regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment based on the information available to \n     it at the time of promulgation of these regulations, that, \n     with the exception of the regulations adopted and set \n     forth herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) \n     promulgated to implement the statutory provisions referred \n     to in paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA that \n     need be adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     branch)'', section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative branch through the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.104.

Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA.

The \n     provisions of sections 1.109 and 1.110 below shall apply to \n     the appointment of a preference eligible applicant to a \n     restricted covered position. The provisions of section 1.108 \n     shall apply to the appointment of a preference eligible \n     applicant to a restricted covered position, in the event that \n     there is more than one preference eligible applicant for the \n     position.\n       Custodian--One whose primary duty is the performance of \n     cleaning or other ordinary routine maintenance duties in or \n     about a government building or a building under Federal \n     control, park, monument, or other Federal reservation.\n       Elevator operator--One whose primary duty is the running of \n     freight or passenger elevators.

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO NON-\n                   RESTRICTED COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Where an employing office has duly adopted a policy \n     requiring the numerical scoring or rating of applicants for \n     covered positions, the employing office shall add points to \n     the earned ratings of those preference eligible applicants \n     who receive passing scores in an entrance examination, in a \n     manner that is proportionately comparable to the points \n     prescribed in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309. For example, five \n     preference points shall be granted to preference eligible \n     applicants in a 100-point system, one point shall be granted \n     in a 20-point system, and so on.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor that is given \n     weight in a manner that is proportionately comparable to the \n     points prescribed in 5 U.S.C.

CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO COVERED \n                   POSITIONS.\n\n       When considering applicants for covered positions in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, employing offices \n     shall provide preference eligible applicants with credit:\n       (a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an \n     extension of time spent in the position in which the \n     applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance \n     into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual \n     duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a \n     combination of both methods. Employing offices shall credit \n     time spent in the military service according to the method \n     that will be of most benefit to the preference eligible \n     applicant.\n       (b) for all experience material to the position for which \n     the applicant is being considered, including experience \n     gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and \n     organizational activities, regardless of whether he/she \n     received pay therefor.\n\n     SEC. 1.110. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN APPOINTMENTS \n                   TO COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Subject to (c) below, in determining qualifications of \n     a preference eligible for appointment, an employing office \n     shall waive:\n       (1) with respect to a preference eligible applicant, \n     requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) with respect to a preference eligible applicant to whom \n     it has made a conditional offer of employment, physical \n     requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on \n     the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation \n     of an accredited physician submitted by the preference \n     eligible applicant, the preference eligible applicant is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position;\n       (b) Subject to (c) below, if an employing office \n     determines, on the basis of evidence before it, including any \n     recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the \n     preference eligible applicant, that an applicant to whom it \n     has made a conditional offer of employment is preference \n     eligible as a disabled veteran as described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108(3)(c) and who has a compensable service-connected \n     disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the \n     physical requirements of the covered position, the employing \n     office shall notify the preference eligible applicant of the \n     reasons for the determination and of the right to respond and \n     to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. The director \n     of the employing office may, by providing written notice to \n     the preference eligible applicant, shorten the period for \n     submitting a response with respect to an appointment to a \n     particular covered position, if necessary because of a need \n     to fill the covered position immediately. Should the \n     preference eligible applicant make a timely response, the \n     highest ranking individual or group of individuals with \n     authority to make employment decisions on behalf of the \n     employing office shall render a final determination of the \n     physical ability of the preference eligible applicant to \n     perform the duties of the position, taking into account the \n     response and any additional information provided by the \n     preference eligible applicant. When the employing office has \n     completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the \n     basis of physical disability, it shall send its findings to \n     the preference eligible applicant.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligations it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n         Subpart D--Veterans' preference in reductions in force\n\nSec.\n1.111.

DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       (a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees \n     within a particular position or job classification, at or \n     within a particular competitive area, as those terms are \n     defined below.\n       (b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing \n     office's organizational structure, as determined by the \n     employing office, in which covered employees compete for \n     retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms \n     of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and \n     geographical location, and it must include all employees \n     within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area \n     may consist of all or part of an employing office. The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office within the local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\n     applies and thereafter he/she continued to be so employed \n     without a break in service of more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       H Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to \n     a change in party leadership or majority party status within \n     the House of Congress where the employee is employed.\n       C Reg:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would \n     not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered \n     employee needs more than 90 days after the reduction in force \n     to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-\n     day standard may be extended if placement is made under this \n     part to a program accorded low priority by the employing \n     office, or to a vacant position.\n\n     SEC. 1.112. APPLICATION OF PREFERENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable. Provided, a preference eligible employee who is \n     a ``disabled veteran'' under section 1.102(h) above who has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more and whose performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable by an employing office is entitled to be \n     retained in preference to other preference eligible \n     employees. Provided, this section does not relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may be subject \n     to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9).\n\n     SEC. 1.113. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       In computing length of service in connection with a \n     reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit \n     to preference eligible covered employees as follows:\n       (a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a \n     retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit \n     for the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces;\n       (b) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for:\n       (1) the length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if he is included under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501(a)(3)(A), \n     (B), or (C); and\n       (c) a preference eligible covered employee is entitled to \n     credit for:\n       (1) service rendered as an employee of a county committee \n     established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation \n     and Allotment Act or of a committee or association of \n     producers described in section 10(b) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act; and\n       (2) service rendered as an employee described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c) if such employee moves or has moved, on or after \n     January 1, 1966, without a break in service of more than 3 \n     days, from a position in a nonappropriated fund \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard, respectively, that is not described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c).\n\n     SEC. 1.114. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN REDUCTIONS IN \n                   FORCE.\n\n       (a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference \n     eligible, the employing office shall waive, in determining \n     the covered employee's retention status in a reduction in \n     force:\n       (1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the \n     employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, \n     including any recommendation of an accredited physician \n     submitted by the employee, the preference eligible covered \n     employee is physically able to perform efficiently the duties \n     of the position.\n       (b) If an employing office determines that a covered \n     employee who is a preference eligible as a disabled veteran \n     as described in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(c) and has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of the \n     covered position, the employing office shall notify the \n     preference eligible covered employee of the reasons for the \n     determination and of the right to respond and to submit \n     additional information to the employing office within 15 days \n     of the date of the notification. Should the preference \n     eligible covered employee make a timely response, the highest \n     ranking individual or group of individuals with authority to \n     make employment decisions on behalf of the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible covered employee to perform the \n     duties of the covered position, taking into account the \n     evidence before it, including the response and any additional \n     information provided by the preference eligible. When the \n     employing office has completed its review of the proposed \n     disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it \n     shall send its findings to the preference eligible covered \n     employee.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 1.115. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS.\n\n       (a) When a function is transferred from one employing \n     office to another employing office, each covered employee in \n     the affected position classifications or job classifications \n     in the function that is to be transferred shall be \n     transferred to the receiving employing office for employment \n     in a covered position for which he/she is qualified before \n     the receiving employing office may make an appointment from \n     another source to that position.\n       (b) When one employing office is replaced by another \n     employing office, each covered employee in the affected \n     position classifications or job classifications in the \n     employing office to be replaced shall be transferred to the \n     replacing employing office for employment in a covered \n     position for which he/she is qualified before the replacing \n     employing office may make an appointment from another source \n     to that position.\n\n Subpart E--Adoption of Veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                      informational requirements.\n\nSec.\n1.116.

Upon timely request and \n     the demonstration of good cause, the Executive Director, in \n     his/her discretion, may grant such an employing office \n     additional time for preparing its policy. Each such employing \n     office will make its policies available to applicants for \n     appointment to a covered position and to covered employees in \n     accordance with these regulations. The act of adopting a \n     veterans' preference policy shall not relieve any employing \n     office of any other responsibility or requirement of the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 or these \n     regulations. An employing office may amend or replace its \n     veterans' preference policies as it deems necessary or \n     appropriate, so long as the resulting policies are consistent \n     with the VEOA and these regulations.\n\n     SEC. 1.117. PRESERVATION OF RECORDS MADE OR KEPT.\n\n       An employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees or that seeks applicants for a covered position \n     shall maintain any records relating to the application of its \n     veterans' preference policy to applicants for covered \n     positions and to workforce adjustment decisions affecting \n     covered employees for a period of at least one year from the \n     date of the making of the record or the date\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\n     of the personnel action involved or, if later, one year from \n     the date on which the applicant or covered employee is \n     notified of the personnel action. Where a claim has been \n     brought under section 401 of the CAA against an employing \n     office under the VEOA, the respondent employing office shall \n     preserve all personnel records relevant to the claim until \n     final disposition of the claim. The term ``personnel records \n     relevant to the claim'', for example, would include records \n     relating to the veterans' preference determination regarding \n     the person bringing the claim and records relating to any \n     veterans' preference determinations regarding other \n     applicants for the covered position the person sought, or \n     records relating to the veterans' preference determinations \n     regarding other covered employees in the person's position or \n     job classification.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the \ngiants in Ohio history, Senator Howard Metzenbaum. On March 12, Ohio \nand our Nation lost a public servant who dedicated 19 years of his life \nto this institution and to defending and advocating the principles and \nideals he held so passionately.\n  Though our political views differed, I admired and respected Howard's \ntenacious work for those things he felt would make a difference for \nOhio and our country. One always knew where he stood.\n  Much has been said about how Howard was a self-made man. He \nepitomized the nose-to-the-grindstone, Midwestern work ethic. As a \nfellow Clevelander, he grew up poor. But that did not prevent Howard \nfrom seizing opportunities as they presented themselves. And he seized \nthose opportunities even as a young boy. Howard graduated from the Ohio \nState University College of Law, working the entire time to put himself \nthrough school.\n  As public servants for Ohio, Howard and I were brought together on \nmany issues and occasions. Many times we did not see eye to eye. \nHowever, there were also times when we worked together. While I was \nGovernor of Ohio, then-Senator Metzenbaum, Representative Marcy Kaptur \nand I worked together in a bipartisan fashion to plant the seed for the \nVeteran's Glass City Skyway bridge in Toledo, Ohio. Through his \nleadership, we were able to dedicate the bridge this past summer.\n  Some of my colleagues today were here for parts of Howard's 19 years \nin\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\nthe Senate. Those who were here and were on the opposite side of an \nissue quickly found out what a formidable challenge and powerhouse he \ncould be. Howard did not go along to get along. Howard did what he \nthought was right and what he thought was in the best interests for the \npeople he represented.\n  It was with respect for his service and convictions that Howard was \nhonored in 2005 by renaming the renovated United States Courthouse in \nCleveland the Howard M. Metzenbaum Courthouse--a fitting tribute to a \nman who, when he perceived an injustice, fought so hard to make a wrong \nright. Howard Metzenbaum made a difference.\n  Howard will be missed. His family, including his wife Shirley and his \nfour daughters, Shelly, Amy, Susan and Barbara, are in our prayers.\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, a great son of Ohio, Senator Howard \nMetzenbaum passed away March 12, in Florida. He was personally \ninspirational to so many. He changed the lives of Ohioans. He changed \nthe lives of so many Americans through his lifetime commitment to \npublic service. I am honored to hold his seat in the Senate and I am \nhonored to follow in his footsteps. Senate tradition dictates that many \nMembers of the Senate carve their names in the desk drawers of the \ndesks that have been lining the rows of the Senate. Whoever has Senator \nMetzenbaum's desk can, with all of us, share in the legacy of his \ngreatness.\n  Senator Metzenbaum and Senator John Glenn, who served together for \nalmost two decades, made an unparalleled team for Ohio. In the Senate, \nas Senator Reid mentioned, Metzenbaum was a child of poverty. He was a \nchild of prejudice growing up in the east side as a Jew and suffered \nboth from his family's poverty and anti-Semitism, in all too many \ncases. He worked his way at a job, as a 10-year-old. He worked his way \nthrough Ohio State.\n  In the Senate, Senator Metzenbaum was a master of a constant presence \nin an often empty Chamber. Once, when a 2-week filibuster was cut off, \nMetzenbaum was still determined to block action on lifting natural gas \nprice controls. He and a partner sent the Senate into round-the-clock \nsessions by demanding rollcall votes on 500 amendments. He didn't care \nif he angered his colleagues. He didn't care if he was liked every day \nby his colleagues. What he cared about is fighting for economic justice \nand social justice for the 10 million citizens whom he represented and \nfor the 250 million Americans or so when he served in the Senate.\n  According to the Washington Post, in 1982, the Senator saved $10 \nmillion by blocking special interest tax breaks and porkbarrel \nprograms. I remember watching him. I served in the House, the beginning \nof my House career and the end of his Senate career, and I watched him \nas a younger elected official in State politics. He stood in front of \nan audience; the energy just burst from him, and the fiery passion for \neconomic justice and social justice poured forth from him. He would \nstart on the podium, the first politician I saw do this, and as he \nworked his way into the speech, he would come from the podium and he \nwould walk into the audience. People would always respond with the same \nkind of passion and be inspired by him. That is my clearest, favorite \nmemory of him.\n  His legislative record, of course, was so important too. One of the \nmost important things he did was the plant closing legislation, giving \na 60-day notice to workers who, too often, have seen their jobs \ndisappear with nothing to show--pensions and more. He fought for people \nwho had less privilege than he did, and he always fought for \nopportunity for people of both genders. That is what he will be \nremembered for.\n  I particularly admire his family. Howard was a great family man, a \nman who cared very much about Shirley, his wife, and four daughters, \nShelly, Amy, Susan, and Barbara. He will be greatly missed. He later \nbecame head of the Consumer Federation of America, never giving up his \npassion for fighting for ordinary people and being a warrior for social \nand economic justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2226-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING THE CREATION OF THE 310TH SPACE WING\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 310th \nSpace Wing, which was officially activated on Friday, March 7, 2008. \nThis newly created wing is comprised of 16 subordinate units located at \nColorado's Schriever AFB, Peterson AFB, and Buckley AFB, as well as \nVandenberg AFB, CA. This wing is an expansion of the 310th Space Group, \ncurrently based at Schriever AFB in Colorado Springs, CO.\n  Over the last 15 years the outstanding members of the 310th Space \nGroup have played a critical role in space operations, providing \nunrivaled support in operating and defending our space systems. This \nexpansion is a testament to both their performance and mission, while \nalso reinforcing my belief that space is a vital component to fighting \nand winning our nation's wars.\n  The 310th's history dates back to World War II when it began as the \n310th Bombardment Group on March 15, 1942. The unit flew B-25 \n``Mitchell'' bombers in support of operations in Tunisia, Sicily, \nItaly, Sardinia, France, Austria, and Yugoslavia. During those \ncampaigns, the 310th perfected ``skip bombing'' techniques against \nbridges, airborne, and rail yard targets. Developed to allow aviators \nto come into the target area low and fast to avoid deadly anti-aircraft \nfire, the bombs actually ``skipped'' over the surface of the water in a \nmanner similar to skipping a stone and either bounced into the side of, \nor exploded over the target, proving extremely effective.\n  The 310th was reactivated 1997, as the 310th Space Group, and rapidly \ngrew to meet the Air Force Reserve's expanding role in space \noperations. As the cochairman of the Congressional Space Power Caucus \nand a Coloradoan, I am extremely proud of the 310th and all who serve \nin it and congratulate them on their success in becoming a \nwing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2226-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE NORTHERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 20th \nanniversary of the Robert and Jane Meyerhoff Scholarship Program at the \nUniversity of Maryland Baltimore County, UMBC.\n  The Meyerhoff Scholarship Program is among the most successful \nundergraduate diversity programs in our Nation, helping thousands of \nminority students reach their full potential in mathematics, the \nsciences, and engineering fields. Since its inception, Meyerhoff \nscholars number more than 800, with 557 graduates across the Nation and \n267 undergraduates and graduate fellows enrolled at UMBC.\n  More than two decades ago, UMBC president Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski, a \nmathematician, author, and education innovator, lamented that there \nwere few minorities in the sciences and that the education pipeline did \nnot suggest that that situation would change.\n  Through the generosity and vision of Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, Dr. \nHrabowski was able to establish the Robert and Jane Meyerhoff \nScholarship Program at UMBC. The program seeks and attracts top-notch \nminority high school students and is able to provide\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\nuniversity educational expenses as well as a demanding academic program \nconcentrating in science, math, and engineering. The UMBC corporate \ncommunity is able to use the talents of the students while providing \ninternships, jobs, and research opportunities.\n  The Meyerhoff Scholarship Program has become a leading national model \nfor diversifying America's scientific and engineering workforce, \npreparing large numbers of African Americans and others for careers in \nscience, medicine, engineering, information technology, teaching, and \npublic health.\n  On April 4 and 5, the Meyerhoff Scholarship students, their mentors, \nprofessors, and families will gather for a research symposium to \ncelebrate their 20 years of progress and success. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in saluting the vision and perseverance of UMBC president \nDr. Freeman A. Hrabowski and the generosity of Robert Meyerhoff and his \nlate wife Jane. Together they have changed lives and \nexpectations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2227-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2227-S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. WALTER PAVASARIS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a \nvisionary in the field of music education, Dr. Walter Pavasaris. Dr. \nPavasaris, a native of New Britain, CT, has been selected to receive \nthe Massachusetts Music Educators Distinguished Service Award.\n  Walter M. Pavasaris has been a music educator and curriculum \ncoordinator in Massachusetts for the past 31 years. During that time he \nhas taught all levels of K-12 music, including both general and \ninstrumental, as well as teaching undergraduate and graduate level \ncourses in various collegiate settings. In Walter's position as \ncoordinator of fine and performing arts for the Lexington Public \nSchools, he is responsible for the implementation of the K-12 \ncurriculum in the areas of music, visual arts, and drama. He leads a \nfaculty of 41 highly motivated professional artists/educators. In \naddition to his responsibilities in Lexington, Walter also serves on \nthe music education faculty at the Boston Conservatory of Music.\n  In 1971, Walter graduated from the University of Hartford, Hartt \nCollege of Music, with a bachelor of music education degree. While at \nHartt he studied double bass with Bert Turetzky, Leland Tolo, and also \ntraveled to Boston and Tanglewood to study with William Rhein, \nassociate principal double bassist of the Boston Symphony. While \ncompleting his undergraduate degree at Hartt, Walter was active as a \nfreelance musician playing in a variety of small combos and big bands \nin the greater Hartford, CT, area. Additionally, he played in the Smith \nCollege Orchestra, Springfield, MA, Symphony and New Britain, CT, \nSymphony. In his senior year Walter was recognized by Hartt College of \nMusic as an Outstanding Music Educator based on his outstanding \nleadership, participation, and scholarship in the field of music.\n  Following his graduation from Hartt College of Music, Walter won an \naudition and was selected to become a member of the U.S. Military \nAcademy Band at West Point, NY. During the next 3 years he played \nsousaphone in the marching band and double bass in the concert band and \nchamber orchestra. While at West Point, Walter was a member of the \nHudson Valley Philharmonic Orchestra. During this time, he studied with \nNew York Philharmonic double bassist Orin O'Brien.\n  Upon his discharge from the Army, Walter began his graduate studies \nat the University of Michigan majoring in stringed instruments. While \nat Michigan, he was a teaching fellow in the String Department. He \nstudied double bass with Larry Hurst. During his years at Michigan, \nWalter played in a variety of orchestral ensembles and was the double \nbassist in the wind ensemble conducted by H. Robert Reynolds. He earned \nhis master of music in string instruments in December 1976.\n  In September of 1977, Dr. Pavasaris joined the music faculty of the \nBelmont, MA, public schools. During his first few years in Belmont, his \nteaching responsibilities included being the director of orchestras and \nstring teacher for grades 3 to 12, and conducting one of the middle \nschool bands. As string enrollments flourished, his responsibilities \nshifted to overseeing the entire string and orchestral curriculum in \ngrades 3 to 12. In addition to teaching large heterogeneous grouped \nweekly string lessons in each of the elementary schools, Walter \nencouraged his students to also be part of the very popular ``Saturday \nMorning'' music program, which he administered during many of the years \nhe was in Belmont. It was in this program that all elementary students, \nstudying an instrument, received a small homogenously grouped lesson as \nwell as the opportunity to participate in either the All-Town String \nOrchestra or Band.\n  During his years in Belmont, the Belmont High School and Chenery \nMiddle School Orchestras expanded their music making both within and \noutside the community. Under his baton, the middle and high school \norchestra ensembles consistently earned superior ratings at numerous \nState, regional, and international music festivals. Additionally, the \nBelmont High School Orchestra was selected to perform at the All-\nEastern MENC Conference in Boston in 1983.\n  In 1990, Walter was appointed coordinator of fine and performing arts \nfor the Lexington Public Schools. His primary responsibilities include \nadvocating for the arts and creating and implementing curricula in the \nareas of music, visual arts, and drama. Along with advocating for the \narts among a wide array of constituencies, he also supervises and \nevaluates the K-12 fine and performing arts faculty. Throughout his \ntenure in Lexington, the arts have maintained an integral place within \neach student's basic education. Coordinating an outstanding \nprofessional faculty with a supportive administration and community, \nWalter has continuously modeled his passion and belief that music is a \nlifelong endeavor that transcends, gender, age and ethnicity.\n  Throughout his professional life, Dr. Pavasaris has positively \nimpacted many young music educators while serving on the faculty of \nmany institutions within the greater Boston area, including the Boston \nConservatory of Music, New England Conservatory of Music, and Boston \nUniversity. As a member of the music education faculty at the Boston \nConservatory of Music since the late 1980s, Walter has taught a variety \nof methods classes as well as classes in string pedagogy and \nconducting. He also had an integral part in redefining, reshaping, and \nchanging the direction of the music education curriculum at TBC to \naddress the needs of the contemporary educator. For 11 years, Dr. \nPavasaris enthusiastically conducted the Boston University All-\nUniversity Orchestra. The orchestra, which was comprised of nonmusic \nmajors, played for the shear enjoyment of making good music. Whether \nteaching conducting, string pedagogy, or instrumental methods, Walter's \nstudents have experienced his enthusiasm and passion for the artistry \nof being a musician and educator.\n  As a conductor, Walter has had the distinct privilege of conducting \nfestival orchestras in all four Massachusetts districts as well as \nthroughout New England. In 1992 and from 1999 to 2001 Walter was the \nguest conductor of the U.S. Youth Ensemble String Orchestra during \ntheir European Tours. During the 2004 and 2005 seasons he served as \nmusic director of the Nashoba Youth Orchestras. Currently, he is the \nmusic director and conductor of the Arlington, MA, Philharmonic \nOrchestra, a post he has held since 1980; associate music director and \nassociate conductor of the Metrowest Orchestra; and conductor of the \nnorthshore Youth Symphony Senior Orchestra. In 1992, Dr. Pavasaris was \nthe recipient of the Paul Smith Memorial Conductor of the Year Award \npresented by the Massachusetts Instrumental and Choral Conductors' \nAssociation. In 1996, the Massachusetts Music Educators' Association \nnamed Dr. Pavasaris as a recipient of the Lowell Mason Award \nacknowledging his numerous contributions to music and music education.\n  Throughout his career, Walter has had the good fortune to be \nassociated with many wonderful colleagues and students.

BARBERO\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to publicly commend and \ncongratulate COL Michael P. Barbero, U.S. Army, upon his retirement \nafter 26 years of military service. I have come to know and respect \nColonel Barbero over the last 4 years, during which time he served as \nthe Chief of the Army Senate Liaison Division in the Office of the Army \nChief of Legislative Liaison. In that capacity, Colonel Barbero was \ninstrumental in improving the understanding of senators and staff \nconcerning a vast myriad of Army issues, in particular an understanding \nof the Army's role in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the effect \nof those wars on the Army and its soldiers and their families.\n  Colonel Barbero escorted over 50 congressional delegations, including \n13 to Iraq and 3 to Afghanistan. I myself was privileged to have \nColonel Barbero as an escort at my specific request on several of my \nown trips to both of those areas. He worked tirelessly to ensure my \nvisits were coordinated with all of the relevant agencies and \nindividuals so that I could visit the places, meet with the people, and \ndeal with the issues that were critical for me as the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I am extremely grateful for the \nservice he provided me and my staff during those trips.\n  Colonel Barbero's Senate assignment was the capstone to an \noutstanding career of service to our Nation. After graduating from the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1982, Colonel Barbero served as \nan armor officer in command and staff positions in a number of tank and \ncavalry units in the United States and Germany. These assignments \nculminated in a position as the operations officer for the 2nd Brigade \nof the famed 1st Cavalry Division.\n  Colonel Barbero also served in a number of high-level positions on \nboth the Army and Joint Staffs at the Pentagon, as an exercise planner, \nanalyst, and strategist. As an assistant professor at the U.S. Military \nAcademy, Colonel Barbero played an important role in the development of \nthe future officers and leaders of the Army.\n  Colonel Barbero holds a master of science degree in industrial \nengineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. His military \nawards include the Legion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Medal, \nMeritorious Service Medal, Ranger Tab, Parachutist Badge, and is a \nholder of the Army Armor Association's Order of St. George.\n  Colonel Barbero is married to the former Vicki Jo Drake of Storm \nLake, IA. They have two children, Mary--14--and Michael--10. I \ncongratulate them too on their husband's and father's retirement from \nthe Army. The demands of military life are such that military families \nalso sacrifice and serve the Nation along with their soldier.\n  Mr. President, the Army, the Senate, and the Nation are lucky to have \nhad the service of such a great soldier. He will be sorely \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2228-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING LANCE MACKEY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I congratulate Lance \nMackey, of Fairbanks, AK, on achieving the incredible feat of twice \nwinning the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the Yukon Quest Sled Dog \nRace--two 1,000-mile races--in the same year. Last year, Lance became \nthe first musher ever to win both races in the same calendar year. An \nachievement, which was previously labeled impossible, has for the \nsecond consecutive year been accomplished by Lance Mackey and his team.\n  For those who are unfamiliar with either the Iditarod or the Yukon \nQuest, these races are the world's two longest dogsled races. Both \nraces, which span over 1,000 miles of rigid mountains, frozen tundra, \nand dense forests, are true tests of determination and dedication. Not \nonly does the rugged terrain pose a huge challenge, but so does the \nweather, which frequently drops to 30 or 40 degrees below zero, and the \nwind, which can gust up to 100 miles per hour.\n  The annual Yukon Quest Sled Dog Race is a 1,000-mile international \ntrek from Fairbanks, AK, to Whitehorse, Canada. Lance Mackey and his \nteam of canine athletes crossed this great distance in 10 days, 12 \nhours, and 14 minutes, claiming victory for the fourth year in a row.\n  Only 11 days after his Yukon Quest victory, Lance and six of his dogs \nthat competed in the Yukon Quest joined seven of his other dogs and \nbegan the 1,100-mile Iditarod Sled Dog Race. This race, which starts in \nWillow, AK, and ends in Nome, AK, commemorates the 1925 diphtheria \nserum relay run where dogsled teams had to pass along a vaccine from \nAnchorage to Nome in order to save countless lives. The Iditarod race \nis no longer run as a relay but is a race completed by individual \ndogsled teams.\n  The 1,100-mile journey travels primarily through the great Alaskan \nwilderness. Throughout this year's Iditarod, Lance Mackey was \nchallenged by not only the weather and terrain but also by other \nextraordinary mushers such as the 2006 Iditarod winner, Jeff King, and \nother previous winners of this great race. On the morning of March 12, \n2008, thousands gathered at the famous burled wood arch on Front Street \nin Nome, AK, to cheer on Lance Mackey, as he sledded to back-to-back \nwins at the Iditarod, beating the odds as well as the extremely \ncompetitive international field. Lance Mackey and his team of canines \ncompleted the race in 9 days, 11 hours, and 46 minutes, beating four-\ntime Iditarod champion Jeff King by 1 hour and 19 minutes.\n  For the past few years, Lance has shown a mastery of working with and \ntraining canine athletes for the sport of dog mushing. As the Anchorage \nDaily News aptly stated:\n\n       A musher doesn't win four straight, 1,000 mile Yukon Quests \n     and two straight Iditarods by making dogs run. He wins by \n     making dogs want to run.\n\n  Lance Mackey continues to impress all of us with his remarkable \nachievements and record-setting performances. It is my honor to stand \nbefore this body today to congratulate Lance Mackey and his team of \namazing dogs. Lance is a world-class dog musher and a true Alaskan \nhero, and I wish him and his team all the success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2228-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO WILL ETTA ``WILLIE'' OATES\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of a woman \nreverend across the State of Arkansas as a humble public servant. Will \nEtta ``Willie'' Oates, affectionately known as the ``Hat Lady,'' passed \naway on March 4, 2008. She was loved for her active volunteerism and \nArkansas pride.\n  Although she was born in Kansas, she was an Arkansan through and \nthrough. Willie was born to Harry and Fern Long in Arkansas City, KS, \non January 14, 1918. She graduated from the University of Arkansas at \nFayetteville where she was a cheerleader and met her life-long husband, \nDr. Gordon Oates. It was at the university that she earned the nickname \nWillie.\n  After World War II, Willie began her career of volunteerism in Little \nRock. She was selected as Little Rock Woman of the Year in 1955. In \n1959, she became the first woman elected to the Arkansas Legislature in \nmore than 30 years.\n  Yet, it was her ``hat skits'' that captured people's attention. She \ntraveled across Arkansas and more than 40 States speaking, performing \nher hat skits, judging various competitions, and serving as a grand \nmarshall at many parades. In 1989, she was officially designated by \nproclamation of the State legislature as ``Arkansas's Hat Lady.''\n  During her lifetime, Willie belonged to over 50 national, State, and \nlocal organizations, served on over 25 boards, and was active in the \nFirst Presbyterian Church of Little Rock.\n  Willie Oates was my dear friend and an inspiration to all that knew \nher. I pay tribute to this public servant of Arkansas and express my \ngreatest condolences to her family. She will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2228-4", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2228-S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2229-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2229-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3361.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2009 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe military \npersonnel strengths for fiscal year 2009, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

As is the case with any bill \nthat is introduced by request, we introduce this bill for the purpose \nof placing the administration's proposals before Congress and the \npublic without expressing our own views on the substance of these \nproposals. As chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, we look forward to giving the administration's requested \nlegislation our most careful review and thoughtful consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2790. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of comprehensive cancer care planning under the \nMedicare program and to improve the care furnished to individuals \ndiagnosed with cancer by establishing a Medicare hospice care \ndemonstration program and grants programs for cancer palliative care \nand symptom management programs, provider education, and related \nresearch; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation, the Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act, that holds \nthe promise of empowering cancer survivors and improving the quality of \ncancer care. Each year, more than one million Americans join the ranks \nof cancer survivors. Overall, nearly 12 million Americans live as \ncancer survivors. The legislation I am introducing will provide these \ncancer survivors with vital tools to help them manage their cancer care \nduring active treatment and in the period of survivorship that follows \ntreatment.\n  Cancer survivors from the state of Louisiana and their physicians \nhave explained to me in compelling fashion the assistance that cancer \nsurvivors need to understand and participate in their treatment, \naddress the side effects of therapy, and transition to cancer \nsurvivorship. I am sure that many of my Senate colleagues have heard \nincredible stories of survivorship from their own constituents. \nManagement of treatment and its potentially serious side effects is a \ndaunting task. The legislation I am introducing seeks to assist cancer \nsurvivors in receiving quality care from diagnosis through \nsurvivorship.\n  A dear friend and citizen of Louisiana, Tucker Melancon, has educated \nme about the necessity that all elements of cancer care be coordinated \nand that cancer patients be given assistance in managing cancer as a \nchronic disease. Judge Melancon and I have been friends for more than \n20 years, and since 2001 he has demonstrated courage, strength, and \ngood humor as he has undergone treatment for breast cancer. He has \ninspired me and many others, and it is with pleasure and humility that \nI introduce a bill that may help cancer survivors like Tucker receive \ncancer care of the highest quality.\n  The core provision of the Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act \nis the establishment of Medicare payment for the development of cancer \ncare plans and survivorship plans for beneficiaries who are diagnosed \nwith cancer. The Institute of Medicine, IOM, in a series of reports \nissued between 1999 and 2006, has documented the benefits of written \nplans that explain to cancer survivors all of the elements of active \ncancer treatment, including the side effects of therapy, and that \ndetail the steps required to monitor the side effects of treatment \nduring survivorship.\n  What difference does a written plan of care make? Cancer survivors \nand their caregivers tell us that a written plan facilitates the \ncoordination of care. That means that care plans provide cancer \nsurvivors the tools to receive therapy of the highest quality, \naccompanied by appropriate management of the side effects of treatment \nand the symptoms of cancer. Most people treated for cancer experience a \nrange of side effects--including depression, pain, nausea, and \nvomiting--that can be debilitating and difficult to manage. Proper \nmanagement of those side effects and symptoms can improve cancer \nsurvivors' quality of life and optimize their ability to complete \ntreatment. The IOM has described patients who complete cancer treatment \nas ``lost in transition,'' uncertain how they will receive health care, \nincluding essential follow-up care, after active treatment. A written \nsurvivorship plan that details all elements of treatment received by a \ncancer survivor and that provides a roadmap to care after active \ntreatment eases the transition from cancer patient to cancer survivor.\n  For patients and health care providers, Hurricane Katrina caused \nsignificant interruptions in care. Cancer patients in the middle of \ntreatment were left to find their displaced physicians or to find new \ncancer care teams. In either case, they suffered from a lack of \ninformation about their ongoing treatment or about follow-up care \nplans. Enactment of the legislation I am introducing today would not \naddress all of the health care delivery problems created by a natural \ndisaster like Katrina, but it would at least put in the hands of \npatients critical information about their care. With that information, \ncancer survivors would be better able to continue their care without \nserious dislocation.\n  The U.S. Congress has provided its enthusiastic support to the \nNational Institutes of Health for research to improve the treatment of \ncancer. By introducing the Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act, I \ncall on my colleagues to join me in a parallel effort to improve the \nquality of care for Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer. It is \nin our power to improve the quality of cancer care for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. By improving Medicare, we set a standard of care for all \nAmericans diagnosed with cancer.\n  I am pleased to lead the Senate effort to advance the Comprehensive \nCancer Care Improvement Act. A companion measure has been introduced in \nthe House by Representatives Lois Capps and Tom Davis and already \nenjoys the support of more than 90 House cosponsors. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me today in supporting legislation that will provide \ncancer patients a helping hand in obtaining quality cancer care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Individuals with cancer often do not have access to a \n     cancer care system that provides comprehensive and \n     coordinated care of high quality.\n       (2) The cancer care system has not traditionally offered \n     individuals with cancer a prospective and comprehensive plan \n     for treatment and symptom management, strategies for updating \n     and evaluating such plan with the assistance of a health care \n     professional, and a follow-up plan for monitoring and \n     treating possible late effects of cancer and its treatment.\n       (3) Cancer survivors often experience the under-diagnosis \n     and under-treatment of the symptoms of cancer, a problem that \n     begins at the time of diagnosis and often becomes more severe \n     at the end of life. The failure to treat the symptoms, side \n     effects, and late effects of cancer and its treatment may \n     have a serious adverse impact on the health, well-being, and \n     quality of life of cancer survivors.\n       (4) Cancer survivors who are members of racial and ethnic \n     minority groups may face special obstacles in receiving \n     cancer care that is coordinated and includes appropriate \n     management of cancer symptoms and treatment side effects.\n       (5) Individuals with cancer are sometimes put in the \n     untenable position of choosing between potentially curative \n     therapies and palliative care instead of being assured access \n     to comprehensive care that includes appropriate treatment and \n     symptom management.\n       (6) Comprehensive cancer care should incorporate access to \n     psychosocial services and management of the symptoms of \n     cancer (and the symptoms of its treatment), including pain, \n     nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and depression.\n       (7) Comprehensive cancer care should include a means for \n     providing cancer survivors with a comprehensive care summary \n     and a plan for follow-up care after primary treatment to \n     ensure that cancer survivors have access to follow-up \n     monitoring and treatment of possible late effects of cancer \n     and cancer treatment.\n       (8) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Ensuring Quality \n     Cancer Care'', described the elements of quality care for an \n     individual with cancer to include--\n       (A) the development of initial treatment recommendations by \n     an experienced health care provider;\n       (B) the development of a plan for the course of treatment \n     of the individual and communication of the plan to the \n     individual;\n       (C) access to the resources necessary to implement the \n     course of treatment;\n       (D) access to high-quality clinical trials;\n       (E) a mechanism to coordinate services for the treatment of \n     the individual; and\n       (F) psychosocial support services and compassionate care \n     for the individual.\n       (9) In its report, ``From Cancer Patient to Cancer \n     Survivor: Lost in Transition'', the Institute of Medicine \n     recommended that individuals with cancer completing primary \n     treatment be provided a comprehensive summary of their care \n     along with a follow-up survivorship plan of treatment.\n       (10) Since more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur \n     among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, the problems of \n     providing cancer care are problems of the Medicare program.\n       (11) Shortcomings in providing cancer care, resulting in \n     inadequate management of cancer symptoms and insufficient \n     monitoring and treatment of late effects of cancer and its \n     treatment, are related to problems of Medicare payments for \n     such care, inadequate professional training, and insufficient \n     investment in research on symptom management.\n       (12) Changes in Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer \n     care, enhanced public and professional education regarding \n     symptom management, and more research related to symptom \n     management and palliative care will enhance patient decision-\n     making about treatment options and will contribute to \n     improved care for individuals with cancer from the time of \n     diagnosis of the individual through the end of the life of \n     the individual.\n\n     TITLE I--COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CARE UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 101.

Bush recognized AAADT and \n     Artistic Director Judith Jamison with the National Medal of \n     Arts in 2001, making AAADT the first dance company to be so \n     honored;\n       Whereas AAADT has performed for United States Presidents \n     and foreign leaders throughout the company's 50-year history, \n     including performances in 1968 for President Johnson, in 1977 \n     at the inaugural gala for President Carter, in 1993 at the \n     inaugural gala for President Clinton, and in 2003 at a state \n     dinner honoring President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya;\n       Whereas, over the years, AAADT has brought the culture of \n     the United States to audiences around the world with \n     performances at such historic events as the Rio de Janeiro \n     International Arts Festival in 1963, the first Negro Arts \n     Festival in Dakar, Senegal, in 1966, the fabled New Year's \n     Eve performance for the Crown Prince of Morocco in 1978, the \n     Paris Centennial performance at the Grand Palais Theatre in \n     1989, 2 unprecedented engagements in South Africa in 1997 and \n     1998, the 1996 and 2002 Olympic Games, the 2005 Stars of the \n     White Nights festival in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the 2006 \n     Les etes de la danse de Paris festival in Paris, France;\n       Whereas AAADT annually provides more than 100,000 young \n     people from diverse cultural, social, and economic \n     backgrounds with the opportunity to explore their creative \n     potential and build their self-esteem through its Arts in \n     Education and Community Programs, which includes 9 AileyCamps \n     in cities across the United States;\n       Whereas Ailey II, the junior company to AAADT, reaches more \n     than 69,000 people each year through its inspiring \n     performances and outreach activities while touring to smaller \n     communities in more than 50 North American cities; and\n       Whereas the Ailey School, accredited by the National \n     Association of Schools of Dance, provides the highest quality \n     training consistent with the professional standards of AAADT, \n     including a Certificate Program, a Fellowship Program, and a \n     Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program in conjunction with \n     Fordham University: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the Alvin Ailey American Dance \n     Theater (AAADT) for 50 years of service as a cultural \n     ambassador of the United States to the world, by bringing \n     world-class American modern dance to an estimated 21,000,000 \n     people around the globe;\n       (2) recognizes that AAADT has been a true pioneer in the \n     world of dance by establishing an extended cultural community \n     that provides dance performances, training, and community \n     programs to all people while using the beauty and humanity of \n     the African-American heritage and other cultures to unite \n     people of all ages, races, and backgrounds; and\n       (3) recognizes that Ailey II, the prestigious Ailey School, \n     and the extensive and innovative Arts in Education and \n     Community Programs of AAADT train future generations of \n     dancers and choreographers while continuing to expose young \n     people from communities large and small to the arts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2237-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 491--RECOGNIZING THE NEED AND IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING \n  ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY TO CARRY OUT \nHURRICANE, COASTAL, AND FLOOD PROTECTION AND HURRICANE AND FLOOD DAMAGE \n  REDUCTION ACTIVITIES AND RELATED FEATURES IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 491\n\n       Whereas the restoration of the infrastructure, hurricane, \n     flood protection, ecosystem, and habitat of the State of \n     Louisiana is critical to the United States economy because--\n       (1) Louisiana is the key to United States energy security, \n     providing nearly 30 percent of the energy required to power \n     the United States economy;\n       (2) Louisiana provides more than 25 percent of the seafood \n     consumed in the United States;\n       (3) Louisiana provides the largest port system in the world \n     (having 5 of 15 ports with the most total tonnage of all \n     ports in the United States); and\n       (4) more than 36 States depend on maritime commerce on \n     waterways in Louisiana to receive goods and services;\n       Whereas, in 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated \n     Louisiana, causing the death of more than 1,400, the loss of \n     217 square miles of coastal land and wetlands, and destroyed \n     the integrity and performance of the hurricane protection \n     system;\n       Whereas in Louisiana Hurricanes Katrina and Rita initially \n     caused the evacuation and displacement of 1,300,000 residents \n     of Louisiana, destroyed more than 200,000 homes, 40 schools, \n     and 10 hospitals, damaged 835 schools, flooded more than \n     16,000 businesses, caused the loss of 179,000 jobs, and \n     resulted in property losses of more than $100,000,000,000 in \n     the State;\n       Whereas Louisiana had a reduction in gross State product of \n     $7,400,000,000 during the period beginning on the date of \n     occurrence of Hurricane Katrina and ending on June 30, 2006;\n       Whereas Federal funds are needed, in addition to the fiscal \n     year 2009 budget request of the President, to reduce the risk \n     to the greater New Orleans, Louisiana, area from storm surges \n     to provide at least an updated 100-year protection standard \n     and address associated flood protection needs to meet the \n     President's commitment to complete the Corps of Engineers \n     work necessary for the updated 100-year protection standard \n     for the greater New Orleans area by the 2011 hurricane \n     season;\n       Whereas, in accordance with section 7012(c) of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2007 (121 Stat. 1279), the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House \n     of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works of the Senate may adopt a resolution to allow \n     for appropriation of additional Federal funds that exceed 25 \n     percent of the authorized level for the activities identified \n     in subsection (a) of that section;\n       Whereas, the historic cost share for current and future \n     work for the Southeast Louisiana Project is 75 percent \n     Federal and 25 percent non-Federal, in accordance with \n     section 533(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 \n     (110 Stat. 3775), as reconfirmed by Congress in subsequent \n     supplemental legislation related to the 2005 hurricanes; and\n       Whereas, the historic cost share for the Lake Pontchartrain \n     and Vicinity project is 70 percent Federal and 30 percent \n     non-Federal, in accordance with section 204 of the Flood \n     Control Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 1077), as reconfirmed by \n     Congress in subsequent supplemental legislation:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the urgency for Congress to approve \n     additional Federal funds required by the Corps of Engineers \n     by October 1, 2008, to complete hurricane, coastal, and flood \n     protection and hurricane and flood damage reduction \n     activities and related features to meet the President's \n     commitment to complete the Corps of Engineers work necessary \n     for the updated 100-year protection standard for the greater \n     New Orleans area by the 2011 hurricane season; and\n       (2) finds that, given the significance and consequences of \n     the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the additional Federal \n     funds to reduce the risk to the greater New Orleans, \n     Louisiana, area from storm surges and to provide at least an \n     updated 100-year protection standard and address associated \n     flood protection needs shall be carried out at full Federal \n     expense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2237-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 492--AMENDING THE MAJORITY PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP ON THE \n   SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 110TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution;

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID \n                   ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n     long-term care services to approximately 60,000,000 low-\n     income children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n     disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n     that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed \n     medical services.\n       (2) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and \n     other services for the elderly and individuals living with \n     disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term \n     care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other \n     supportive services that are typically not provided by \n     private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to \n     enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental \n     disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and \n     persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic \n     conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to \n     maintain independence.\n       (3) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for about \n     7,500,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n     beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums \n     and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of \n     nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid \n     program spends over $100,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare \n     services.\n       (4) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than one-\n     quarter of America's children and is the largest purchaser of \n     maternity care, paying for more than one-third of all the \n     births in the United States each year. Medicaid also provides \n     critical access to care for children with disabilities, \n     covering more than 70 percent of poor children with \n     disabilities.\n       (5) More than 21,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their \n     health care. Women comprise the majority of seniors (64 \n     percent) on Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent \n     mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through \n     Medicaid. Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women \n     diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State.\n       (6) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for \n     mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children \n     with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered \n     by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. \n     Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care \n     for children in foster care and for health services in \n     schools.\n       (7) Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all \n     Americans. Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue \n     for the Nation's safety net hospitals, health centers, and \n     nursing homes, and is critical to the ability of these \n     providers to adequately serve all Americans.\n       (8) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the \n     number of Americans without health insurance, approximately \n     47,000,000 in 2006, is not substantially higher. The system\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\n     of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures \n     that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in \n     response to unmet needs, enabling Medicaid to help buffer the \n     drop in private coverage during recessions.\n       (9) The Bush Administration has issued several regulations \n     that shift Medicaid cost burdens onto States and put at risk \n     the continued availability of much-needed services. The \n     regulations relate to Federal payments to public providers, \n     and for graduate medical education, rehabilitation services, \n     school-based administration, school-based transportation, \n     optional case management services.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that administrative regulations should not--\n       (1) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a \n     critical component of the health care system of the United \n     States;\n       (2) cap Federal Medicaid spending, or otherwise shift \n     Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their \n     taxpayers and health providers, forcing a reduction in access \n     to essential health services for low-income elderly \n     individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and \n     families; or\n       (3) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n     coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the \n     health care safety net of the United States, but the entire \n     health care system.\n\n     SEC. 308.

Res. 1, the Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, by the necessary two-\n     thirds majority (300-132);\n       (2) On June 6, 1996, the Senate fell three votes short of \n     the two-thirds majority vote needed to pass the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment; and\n       (3) Since the House of Representatives and Senate last \n     voted on the Balanced Budget Amendment, the debt held by the \n     public has grown from $3,700,000,000,000 to more than \n     $5,000,000,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States should be voted on at earliest opportunity.\n\n     SEC. 336. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED FOR \n                   COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION TO LEGALIZE THE \n                   IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM HIGHLY \n                   INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES WITH SAFE \n                   PHARMACEUTICAL INFRASTRUCTURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\n       (1) The United States is the world's largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals, yet consumers still pay the world's highest \n     prices.\n       (2) In 2000, Congress took action to legalize the \n     importation of prescription drugs from other countries by \n     United States wholesalers and pharmacists, and before such a \n     program can go into effect, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) must certify that the program would have no \n     adverse impact on safety and that it would reduce costs for \n     American consumers.\n       (3) Since 2000, no Secretary of HHS has made the \n     certification required to permit the implementation of a \n     program for importation of prescription drugs.\n       (4) In July 2006, the Senate approved by a vote of 68-32 an \n     amendment to the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act, 2007, that prohibits Customs and Border \n     Protection from preventing individuals not in the business of \n     importing prescription drugs from carrying them across the \n     border with Canada.\n       (5) In July 2007, the Senate adopted language similar to \n     the 2007 amendment in the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act, 2008.\n       (6) In October 2007, the Senate adopted language in the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008, \n     that prohibits anti-reimportation activities within HHS.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the leadership of the Senate should bring to the floor \n     for full debate in 2008 comprehensive legislation that \n     legalizes the importation of prescription drugs from highly \n     industrialized countries with safe pharmaceutical \n     infrastructures and creates a regulatory pathway to ensure \n     that such drugs are safe;\n       (2) such legislation should be given an up or down vote on \n     the floor of the Senate; and\n       (3) previous Senate approval of 3 amendments in support of \n     prescription drug importation shows the Senate's strong \n     support for passage of comprehensive importation legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/31/senate-section/article/S2250-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3221\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
