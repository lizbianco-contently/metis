Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, there will be a period of morning business for an \nhour, with the Republicans controlling the first half, the majority \ncontrolling the final half. Following morning business, we will resume \nthe motion to proceed to S. 2633, a bill that calls for the safe \nredeployment of the troops in Iraq. Today, the Senate will stand in \nrecess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n  Mr. President, another day in Iraq. As we see from the morning \npapers--the Washington Post is a good example--headline: ``Suicide \nBomber Hits Bus in Iraq's North.'' Among other things, the article goes \non to state:\n\n       A suicide bomber detonated his explosives belt outside a \n     bus in northern Iraq on Tuesday, killing at least eight \n     people and injuring many more.\n\n  In a different paragraph:\n\n       The Tall Afar bombing followed a bloody weekend of attacks \n     against Shiite pilgrims, the deadliest incident taking place \n     on Sunday when a suicide bomber killed at least 63 pilgrims \n     near the southern town of Iskandariyah. Even as overall \n     violence has fallen, the recent attacks underscore the \n     tenuous security environment and the resiliency of the \n     insurgency.\n       In volatile Diyala province, armed men set up a fake \n     checkpoint and kidnapped 21 people.\n       Near the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, gunmen attacked a \n     checkpoint manned by Sunni volunteers, killing the Sunni \n     volunteers.\n\n  Mr. President, this is 1 day and a half billion dollars. That is what \nis going on in Iraq.\n  What impact does that have? General Casey testified here yesterday. \nGeneral Casey said:\n\n       The cumulative effects of the last 6-plus years of war have \n     left the Army out of balance, consumed by the current fight, \n     unable to do the things we know we need to do.\n\n  And I failed to mention in my earlier comments that below the article \nabout the suicide bomber is the report of three more dead American \nsoldiers: CPT Nathan R. Raudenbush, LCpl Drew W. Weaver, and SPC Keisha \nM. Morgan.\n  So that is where we are on the Iraq debate today. I will sum up in a \nshort time, after I make a few other remarks, and I will ask consent so \nthat we have some idea today as to how we will proceed.\n  I would tell all Senators that we will have, sometime today, either \nafter the 30 hours or before a vote on the motion to proceed to the \nmatter that is now before the Senate--immediately after that, no matter \nwhat happens on that--we will have a cloture vote on the second matter, \nwhich is, as we all know, a piece of legislation that calls for \nperiodic reports by the President on the war on terror. Following that, \nwhen that is disposed of, we will go to the housing stimulus package. \nThat is what I would like to spend a few minutes on because we will get \nto that sometime this week. It is only a question of when we get to it.\n\n\n                                housing\n\n  Mr. President, the sights and signs of America's housing crisis are \nall around us. There is not a State in the Union that doesn't feel the \nhousing crisis. Neighborhood streets are dotted with one ``For Sale'' \nsign after another. And once we have one ``For Sale'' sign or, even \nworse, the bank has a foreclosure sign on it, it affects the whole \nneighborhood.\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\n  One of my boys lives in Las Vegas, in a nice neighborhood. The \nhousing prices there in the last 3 months have dropped 20 percent--20 \npercent. In Las Vegas, last month, there were more foreclosures than \nthere were sales of new homes. This is very unusual because Las Vegas \nhas been the fire that has burned upward for 20 years, creating such an \neconomic strong point that it has been known for 20 years as the most \nrapidly growing State in the Union.\n  In these struggles, construction workers are having trouble finding \njobs. Construction workers are having trouble making payments on their \nhomes. In desperation, hard-working people have been talked into bad \nmortgages and are now seeing their homes just slip away. Every day, new \nstatistics illuminate the depth of this growing crisis in the housing \nmarket.\n  The crisis is everyplace. Today, the Associated Press reported that \nthe number of homes facing foreclosure across our country grew by 57 \npercent in the month of January. That is compared to a year ago. We \nalso now know that sales prices have lost almost 10 percent in the \nfinal quarter of last year, and I am sure this quarter is going to be \neven worse. The last quarter marked the steepest drop in the 20-year \nhistory of the Standard & Poor's housing index.\n  In the crisis in Nevada, I have mentioned briefly last month that we \nsaw the rate of foreclosures rise 95 percent from the previous year; in \nReno and Sparks, 611 percent. Now, who suffers from these foreclosures? \nFamilies who own the homes? Of course they do, but they aren't the only \nones. It is the whole neighborhood, those who live near foreclosures, \nfamilies who have done nothing wrong, who have paid their bills on \ntime. Yet they are seeing the value of their property zapped.\n  The Center for Responsible Lending has estimated that 40 million \nneighboring homes will experience a loss in equity if the expected \nforeclosures materialize. That would likely lead to a total decline of \nmore than $200 billion in home equity, and some say that is very \nconservative. This could mean more than $3 billion in losses for Nevada \nalone.\n  If that is not bad enough for homeowners, it is very bad for local \ngovernments that have already been forced to cut services as a result \nof the shrinking tax base. One example: Washaw County--that is Reno--is \nfacing a $26 million cut to its local budget, and they say it is mainly \ndue to the housing crisis, and $26 million to Washaw County is a lot of \nmoney.\n  These numbers are staggering. We all know the housing crisis isn't \njust about statistics, it is about families. I have had, in the State \nof Nevada, six mobile resource centers where I bring in people. We do \nadvertising and let them know we are going to be there. We bring in \nexperts to talk, and we have people who service the loans there, we \nhave credit counselors, and we have representatives from FHA. We have a \nwide range of experts there to talk to these desperate people to see if \nanything can be done to help them, and there are some things that can \nbe done to help. These centers bring borrowers and mortgage services \ntogether to talk about how to help homeowners facing foreclosure.\n  The stories they tell are heartbreaking. I could tell lots of \nstories, but the one that stands out in my mind is a man by the name of \nElisario. What extraordinary challenges this man and his family face. \nHe is a marine veteran of the Iraq war. He has three children, three \nlittle girls. Like thousands of others of these heroes returning from \nIraq and Afghanistan, the war took its toll on him. He suffers from \npost-traumatic stress disorder and is recovering from many surgeries \nrelated to injuries he sustained in Iraq. As a result of the injuries \nhe suffered in service to our country, his family was forced, for a \ntime, to rely on the income from his wife's part-time job. Now, \nremember the three little girls. They fell behind in their mortgage \npayments. That doesn't surprise anyone. He called his lender but was \ntold it was his responsibility to pay the loan. They weren't willing to \nwork with them at all. He was told to sell the home and get an \napartment.\n  All across the country, people just like Elisario are looking to us \nfor help. In far too many cases, people like him saw their mortgage \npayments skyrocket after the interest rate on their loan was reset. The \nsudden loss of income combined with the dramatic increase in the \nmonthly payment is lethal for any homeowner. These are the families \nwhom the legislation we will get to--hopefully sooner rather than \nlater--this week will help.\n  This legislation we have is not for speculators. It is not for \nspeculators who lost a bet. Are we going to bail out lenders who \nunderwrote mortgages? No. They shouldn't have made those loans. That is \ntheir problem. We are not trying to bail out borrowers who should have \nknown better. We are trying to give families like Elisario's a chance \nto keep their homes and stabilize the Nation's economy in the process.\n  The administration deserves credit for taking some first steps. I \nappreciate Secretary Paulson and like him a lot. He has led the efforts \nto gather mortgage servicers, investors, and housing counselors to form \nthe Hope Now Alliance and Project Lifeline. These efforts should help, \nbut it is such a tiny bit of help, and they are all voluntary. They \nfall completely short. Some estimate that less than 3 percent of at-\nrisk families will be reached under his proposals--less than 3 percent. \nWe have to help the 97\\1/2\\ percent who won't be reached.\n  The legislation before us does that. It will keep families in their \nhomes by increasing preforeclosure counseling funds, expanding \nrefinancing opportunities, and amending the Bankruptcy Code to allow \nmore home loans on primary residences to be modified. This will help \ncommunities impacted by foreclosures by allowing parts of the country \nwith high foreclosure rates to access Federal funds to purchase \nforeclosed properties for rehabilitation, rent, or resale.\n  The bill will help struggling businesses by making it easier for them \nto utilize losses incurred in 2006, 2007, and 2008 to offset prior \nyears' income to recoup previously paid income taxes. This was the \nprovision that was in our previous stimulus package that our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle stopped us from moving forward on. It is \none the home builders liked very much.\n  The legislation that will be before the Senate shortly will help \nfamilies avoid foreclosure in the future by improving loan disclosures \nduring the original loan and refinancing process. And one of the \nprovisions that was also in our package that we had, that my good \nfriends on the other side of the aisle defeated, was one the President \ncalled for in his State of the Union Message--revenue bonds to help \npeople get into some of these homes that are being foreclosed upon.\n  Title IV of the legislation makes changes to the Bankruptcy Code. \nThese changes would allow a bankruptcy judge to modify the terms of a \nmortgage on a primary residence but only under very limited \ncircumstances, limited in scope and duration. Only families who can \npass a strict means test in bankruptcy and are currently struggling \nwith an adjustable rate mortgage and subprime loan that already exists \nare eligible. That is all.\n  There are limits to the modifications a judge can make to the \ninterest rate, term, the principal amount of the mortgage. We do not \naim to drive struggling families into bankruptcy with this proposal. No \none should abuse the Bankruptcy Code to get out of debts they owe.\n  The means test provided in this legislation should prevent that from \nhappening. Remember the reason this is necessary today. For example, in \nLas Vegas, if you own a home down on the oceanfront in Malibu, you buy \nthat and finances go bad, you can go to bankruptcy court. The \nbankruptcy court can readjust that loan on your vacation property, your \nsecond home, but cannot do that on your primary residence. That is not \nthe way it should be.\n  We are also mindful of concerns that this provision could make access \nto mortgages more difficult by increasing costs, it could inject more \nuncertainty into the market. All the experts say that is untrue. \nGeorgetown has completed a study.\n  In today's New York Times, there is an article: ``Getting Real About \nthe Rescue.'' That is what it is about. And they go on to state how \nimportant it is that we do this stimulus package but\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nespecially we do this bankruptcy provision. This editorial says, among \nother things:\n\n       If the bankruptcy provision becomes law, as it should, \n     lenders will have a powerful incentive, which they currently \n     do not have, to modify troubled loans voluntarily. If they \n     can't or won't come to new terms with borrowers, then they \n     would run the risk that a bankruptcy court would do the \n     modifying for them.\n\n  But most, or all, I repeat, independent experts agree that any \nincrease in costs would be nonexistent. Meanwhile, this modified \nbankruptcy language would help more than 200,000 families avoid \nforeclosure. It would stabilize the housing market, prevent future, \nperhaps deeper losses to families, investors--and that is so important, \nwe have to do that. That is why we have to act.\n  There may be no perfect solution to the growing housing crisis, but \nstanding back and doing nothing would be a real mistake. The \nlegislation that will shortly be before us will make a real difference \nto homeowners, neighborhoods, and our economy.\n  More than 700,000 families will benefit from the policies in this \nmeasure, 80,000 vacant foreclosed homes will be put back to productive \nuse, 30,000 jobs, and $10 billion in economic activity will be created.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us to support cloture on the motion to \nproceed to this matter so we can pass the legislation and bring the \nrelief to hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1219-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, at 3:16 in the afternoon, the \nSenate voted to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2633, \nwhich is a bill to provide for the safe redeployment of U.S. troops \nfrom Iraq.\n  After the cloture vote, I made a proposal that we would have \npostcloture debate for a period of time, a significant period of time, \nagree to the motion, and then go to the bill. But once we completed \naction on this, S. 2633, we would have a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to the next matter that I talked about earlier today. That \nconsent was rejected.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be yielded back, \nand the motion to proceed be agreed to; that upon disposition of S. \n2633, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2634; further, that if cloture is invoked, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate then proceed to vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3221, the \nhousing bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, the question of the \nIraq debate, once again at this particular juncture, was not the \ndecision of the minority. Nevertheless, having put the Iraq issue back \nbefore the Senate, there are a number of members of my conference, many \nof whom have been to Iraq recently, who were anxious to discuss the \nundeniable progress that has occurred in Iraq over the last 6 months.\n  We had a good discussion yesterday. I have more members who would \nlike to continue the discussion today. There is obviously an \nopportunity later in the morning or this afternoon to discuss further \nwith the majority leader the possibility of shortening the time.\n  But for the moment, there are a number of Senators on my side of the \naisle who are anxious to discuss the progress in Iraq, happy to have \nthe debate time. Therefore, for the time being, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say briefly, the matter before \nus, the Feingold withdrawal amendment is in basically the form it has \nbeen before us, has been voted on four times before. Each of the times \nit was voted on in the past, one could argue that things were going \nless well in Iraq than they are today. The highest number of votes the \nFeingold withdrawal proposal has received at any point in these 4 votes \nis 29 votes.\n  It will be, should it be voted on, defeated once again. It certainly \nshould be because now we have had 6 months or so of undeniable progress \non all fronts. The security situation is dramatically improved. Even on \nthe political side, where I think Members on both sides were frustrated \nwith the new Iraqi democracy, they finally have begun to take the kind \nof steps that are needed--the debaathification law was approved, local \nelections have been scheduled for later in the year.\n  They are finally making some progress on the Government side as well \nas the undeniable progress on the security side, at this point, not \nbrought about strictly by American troops but also the sons of Iraq. \nThese people who decided to defend their neighborhoods and defeat, help \nus defeat al-Qaida, have grown dramatically in terms of numbers and \ncommitment.\n  So there is, as I indicated, a lot of interest on our side in \ncontinuing to at least point out the progress that has been made in \nIraq, both in terms of security and on the political side. So we will \nhave that discussion later into the morning, and the majority leader \nand I will have an opportunity later in the day to discuss where we go \nfrom here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1219-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to speak for \na few minutes this morning.\n  While I would like to speak about health care and on some of the \ncomments made about the stimulus package that is going to be debated \napparently in upcoming days, I would first like to make mention of the \ntornado damage that has occurred in our State.\n  We have officially 32 deaths. That number may rise. Certainly, we \nhave had numbers of people in our State who have gone without housing. \nThey have lost their worldly possessions. They have lost family \nmembers. In this time of grief for many people, I think we have also \nseen something that has been very uplifting.\n  Certainly, after other disasters that have taken place in this \ncountry in recent times, there, in some cases, has been a sense of \nconcern about whether our Government is able to meet the needs of these \ndisasters we have seen in various parts of the country and in some \ncases the world.\n  In the State of Tennessee FEMA, under the leadership of Director \nPaulison, and TEMA, under the leadership of General Bassham, and then \nthe leadership of various local agencies that deal with disasters have \nresponded in incredible ways.\n  In our State, I think what we have seen is an unprecedented \ncooperation that has taken place, one that I think is going a long ways \ntoward causing people to see our Government responding in a way that is \nvery responsible.\n  We have also seen numbers of people who have given of themselves to \nhelp their neighbors. We have had Red Cross personnel on site, we have \nhad lots of volunteers from various organizations throughout our State \nhelping those in need.\n  It has caused me to feel great about our leadership, Federal, State \nand local, as it relates to responding to these people in times of \nneed. I know this will continue as 16 counties right now are under the \nFederal disaster designation; there may be more coming. But my hat is \noff to all those who have been involved in helping people in this time \nof need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1219-5", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1219-S1220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I do wish to refer briefly to the stimulus \npackage that was discussed by our majority leader. I have a great deal \nof respect for him. I was 1 of 16 Senators who voted against the last \nstimulus\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\npackage, which I thought was absolutely a waste of money, causing \npeople around America to think we were possibly doing something to \nhelp.\n  I noticed all the discussion around this crisis, if you will, we are \nhaving in our country, or a correction, as some people may call it, \nhave focused on credit issues. I found it most interesting that as you \nmight expect here in Washington, with help on the way, we would do \nsomething totally unrelated to the problem and instead sprinkle money \nall around America and ask people to spend it as quickly as they could \nwhen we have a credit problem.\n  I will say I had hoped we might focus on the stimulus, on the \nstimulus in an appropriate way, something that would create long-term \njobs and investment, not spending by individuals, which causes them, in \nsome cases, to even go further in debt.\n  But I have to say this housing package that is getting ready to be \nbefore us, in my opinion, is an unmitigated disaster. I cannot imagine \nus getting between judges and people who borrow money in such a manner \nas to alter the relationship that people who borrowed money have with \nthose who lend them the money.\n  This is one of those things that, to me, is unbelievable that we \nwould even discuss altering that relationship certainly on a voluntary \nbasis. This is something that might make some sense. Certainly, \ncompanies that can loan money excessively in ways that are \ninappropriate need to be dealt with. But to unilaterally decide that \njudges can alter the amount of money people owe, to me, is an \nunmitigated disaster. I hope this bill will never see the light of day. \nI hope others will join in making sure this does not happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1220-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1220-S1221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, let me mention the real reason I came down \nhere was to talk about health care. I have noticed all the Presidential \ncandidates who are out there today are talking about health care. I am \nglad to see that. I know a number of Republicans have gathered around \nthe notion of making sure every American has access to health care.\n  I myself have authored a bill with Senator Burr from North Carolina, \na number of others have joined in. I know Senator Wyden from Oregon has \njoined in with Bob Bennett of Utah, they have authored a bill.\n  But I think we have a tremendous opportunity during this year to help \nshape the debate on health care legislation, my sense is, in a very \nbipartisan way, that in this next Congress, in 2009, we are going to \nhave the opportunity to actually create health care legislation that \nfocuses on the private sector, that ensures people have choice in order \nto maintain the quality of health care they would like to see.\n  But my guess is we have a tremendous opportunity. I wish to say today \nI would like to join in with other Senators on both sides of the aisle, \nto ensure we do those things, create the mechanisms to allow people who \ncannot afford health care today to be able to afford it but to do so in \na manner that preserves choice, preserves quality, preserves the \ndoctor-patient relationship that now exists.\n  We have been able to do that in other ways dealing with seniors, we \nhave been able to do that certainly with those people throughout our \ncountry who cannot afford health care through programs such as \nMedicaid. Obviously, the focus of this effort needs to be on preserving \nthe private-sector means of delivering health care. But I wish to say \nto you I am uplifted by what I am seeing on both sides of the aisle.\n  I know Republicans and Democrats together want to make sure we solve \nthis problem. I know, Mr. President, you have been very involved \nyourself. I wish to say to you I think this is a tremendous opportunity \nfor us in this body to come together and do something the American \npeople want to see done but do so in a manner that at the same time \npreserves the best qualities of our health care system.\n  I wish to offer up my efforts to join in with others to make sure \nthis happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, could I be informed when 10 minutes is \nup.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so notify you.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wish to thank my colleague from Tennessee for his \ncomments on health care, for his leadership. He has been, on our side \nof the aisle, one of the principal actors in the effort to try to \ncombine the idea of, as some say, ``universal access,'' with two other \nwords, ``private sector.'' Four words that usually do not go together.\n  I agree with him. If there was one agenda item on the Republican side \nof the aisle we could all agree on this year as a goal that we would \nlike to start this year, it would be having every American insured.\n  We would like to make it possible for every American family to have \naccess to and to be able to afford health insurance. I would like to \nspeak to that.\n  First, I would like to comment on the majority leader's comments and \nthose of the Republican leader. We respect the majority leader's right \nto set the agenda on the Senate floor, and he decided to bring up the \nIraq debate this week. But if he brought it up, why doesn't he want to \ntalk about it? We were here yesterday. We are here today.\n  I came down last night and talked about the fact that even though I \nhave had differences with the President on Iraq, we are moving in the \nright direction. We should say that to our enemy, to our troops, and to \nthe world. Troops are coming out instead of going in; the mission is \nshifting province by province; we are identifying a long-term but \ndiminishing role in Iraq; and diplomatic efforts are stepped up. Those \nare basically the three recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, which \nI wish the President had embraced. He didn't embrace the report itself, \nbut he is headed in that direction. So we are glad to talk about it.\n  Although I agree it would have been better to talk about the economy \nand housing, we are ready to talk about that as well. But if we are \ngoing to talk about housing and the economy, we are ready to take \naction this year, and we have some pretty big differences of opinion \nacross the aisle.\n  We were able to agree on a stimulus package. First, we had to stop \n$40 billion in extra spending, but we were able to agree on allowing \nindividuals, largely, to keep their own money. Mr. President, 2.7 \nmillion Tennesseans will receive a so-called rebate this spring.\n  There were provisions I liked so well that I am going to introduce \nlegislation to make them permanent. These are the small business \nprovisions that in Tennessee counties, such as Cheatham County where \n400 different small businesses will be eligible for accelerated \ndepreciation and expensing. This allows those businesses to keep more \nmoney, create more jobs, and stimulate the economy. In Washington \nCounty, it is several thousand small businesses. These are good \nprovisions and a good start. I agree we should get on with the next \nsteps to make sure we have a strong, vibrant economy. This is the \neconomy that produces about a third of the money in the world for just \n5 percent of all the people in the world. We are in a slowdown right \nnow, but there are steps we can take to step it up.\n  We would say, on this side of the aisle, that would be a bigger, \nbolder, broader pro-growth economic plan including such things as lower \ntaxes. For example, making permanent the dividend, capital gains, and \nestate tax rate at 15 percent. Or lowering the corporate tax rate from \n35 to 25 percent, so our companies can be competitive with the world \nand keep their jobs here instead of going overseas. Or a simpler \nflatter tax giving taxpayers the option of filing a one-page return \nwith a 17-percent or so flat rate.\n  We would support doubling funding on the physical sciences to keep \nour brain power advantage and can continue to grow jobs here, so these \njobs would not go to India and China. That is part of a pro-growth \nRepublican economic plan that would also attract significant \nindependent and Democratic support. We would like to continue to in-\nsource brain power by giving green cards to foreign students who are \nlegally here and who want to stay here and work, creating jobs here \ninstead of going back to India, Ireland, or China and creating jobs \nthere. We would like to make the research and development tax credit \npermanent, so companies\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\ncan create more jobs here. We would like to reward outstanding teachers \nand outstanding school leaders. We can debate that. We would like to \ngive Pell grants to low-income kids so they can have more choices of \nschools. We would like to implement the America COMPETES Act which we \nagreed on in a bipartisan way. We would like to lower energy costs by \nmore conservation and nuclear power. We would like to lower the cost of \nGovernment by fewer rules and regulations. As Senator Corker was \ntalking about, we would like to lower health care costs.\n  The words that we could most easily agree on on this side of the \naisle--and there might not be so much objection over there either--are \n``every American insured.'' There is a step-by-step process to get to \nthat. We have over 800,000 Tennesseans without health insurance. We \nhave about 47 million Americans without health insurance.\n  We are at a time in our history where reports by distinguished \njournals of medicine, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, the \nInstitute of Medicine, and the Trust for America's Health say today's \nchildren are likely to be the first generation to live shorter, less \nhealthier lives than their parents. That is a health care crisis. At \nthe same time, the most rapidly growing part of the Federal budget is \nspending for Medicare and Medicaid. It is growing so rapidly we can't \nsustain it, so we need an overhaul of our health care system. We need \nto lower health care costs for the average family so each family can be \nable to afford at least a basic health insurance policy that doesn't go \naway when they lose their job.\n  On the way to lowering health care costs and giving every American \naccess to such a health care insurance policy are several pieces of \nlegislation, many of them bipartisan, which we could pass this year. \nFor example, the Kerry-Ensign e-prescribing bill would provide for \nelectronic transmittal of prescription information from the doctor to \nthe pharmacists. In addition, we could pass legislation to allow small \nbusiness health plans this year. Senator Enzi has been the leader on \nthis issue, and he has worked on legislation that basically would allow \nsmall businesses to pool their resources in order to offer health \ninsurance to their employees at an affordable rate--to let them do the \nsame thing big businesses can do. Senator Enzi estimates that could \nprovide insurance to more than 1 million Americans who are not now \ninsured.\n\n  Senator Martinez has introduced legislation to help get rid of fraud \nand abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. Tens of billions of dollars are \nwasted there, and it would lower health care costs to pass the Martinez \nlegislation.\n  Senator Gregg has offered legislation which isn't bipartisan but \ndeserves to be. I hope it can be. It would put limits on punitive \ndamages from lawsuits against doctors who serve pregnant women. Medical \nmalpractice insurance has gone sky high, over $100,000 a year because \nof lawsuits in some States. As a result, the doctors are leaving the \nrural areas, and pregnant women are having to drive 40, 50, 60 miles \nfor prenatal health care or to deliver their babies, because the \ndoctors aren't there anymore. In a few places such as Mississippi, \nTexas, and Kentucky, steps have been taken to say: As long as you are \ndamaged, you can collect, but there is a limit on the punitive damages \nin those States. Where the rules have been changed, doctors are moving \nback into those States and back into rural areas. That also lowers \nhealth care costs.\n  I am here today as a cosponsor of three different health insurance \nbills which I hope will move us toward the idea of every American \ninsured, and I would like to talk about two of them today. Senator \nCoburn, Senator Burr, and Senator Corker have one of those bills, and I \nam a cosponsor. Senator Wyden and Senator Bennett have another of those \nbills, and I am a cosponsor of that as well. It has six Republicans and \nsix Democrats. I don't agree with every part of the Wyden-Bennett bill, \nspecifically the mandates from the beginning, but I agree with the \nspirit of what they are trying to do. Most Americans like the fact that \nthey are working across the aisle to try to make real the idea that \nevery American can have access to health insurance, and they are \nwilling to include--and we would emphasize--the private sector in that \nsolution.\n  We have a whole year. This is a Presidential year. That doesn't mean \nwe should take a vacation. We got off to a pretty good start with the \nstimulus package. We got off to a very good start with the FISA bill. \nUnfortunately, the House took a vacation without acting on it. I \nsuggest that Republicans are ready to join with Democrats and take \nsteps this year toward the goal of every American insured.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nIraqi troop withdrawal bill that we are discussing, the bill as \nproposed by Senator Feingold. We have been here before, simply stated. \nThe Senate has voted to reject measures similar to this bill at least \nthree times over the past year. The only thing that has changed since \nwe have had those votes is that conditions on the ground in Iraq have \ncontinued to improve as a result of the President's new strategy. Even \nthe opponents of the surge have had to acknowledge that it is, in fact, \nworking. In the midst of this progress and of al-Qaida's continued \nretreat in Iraq, the Senator from Wisconsin would have us surrender to \nan enemy that is on the run.\n  I understand his concern for the welfare of our soldiers and for \nthose who have sacrificed in Iraq. But the way we pay tribute to those \nwho have sacrificed and to our brave men and women still fighting in \nIraq today is to finish what we started so that we honor them and bring \nthose who are still in Iraq home victorious and not defeated. If we are \ntrying to reverse the progress we have made in Iraq, embolden our \nenemies and the enemies of the Iraqi people, and ensure that our \nmission fails, I probably could not have crafted a better bill than \nthat of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  As a result of the U.S. troop surge, the Al Anbar awakening, \nsignificant al-Qaida in Iraq defeats, and the unilateral cease-fire \nlast August declared by Muqtada al-Sadr, the security in Iraq has \nsteadily improved. Violence has reached its lowest level since the \ninsurgency began, and there has been a large increase in Iraqi security \nforces trained and equipped. Today that stands at about 440,000 men. In \nthe last year ethnosectarian-related deaths have decreased 95 percent. \nSuicide attacks in Baghdad have gone from 12 a month in January of last \nyear to just 4 last month, a 66 percent decrease. Attacks have \ndecreased in 17 of the 18 provinces in Iraq, and IED detonations are \ndown by 45 percent in Baghdad itself. Security incidents countrywide \nand in the 10 Baghdad security districts have declined to their lowest \nlevel since February 2006 when the Samarra Golden Mosque was bombed.\n  As Sunnis in Al Anbar got frustrated with AQI, the troop surge \nprovided the opportunity for them to work with coalition forces to \ndisrupt AQI operations. Al Anbar now will be transferred to Iraqi \nsecurity control in the near future, bringing 10 of the 18 provinces in \nIraq under the sole control of Iraqis. AQI attempted to shift \noperations to Baghdad and its surrounding northern provinces, but the \nAl Anbar awakening movement prompted other awakening movements and \nconcerned local citizen groups began to spring up all over Iraq. As a \nresult, AQI has been disrupted. But as the DNI told the Senate \nIntelligence Committee in February, ``AQI remains capable of conducting \ndestabilizing operations and spectacular attacks, despite disruptions \nof its networks.''\n  These successes cannot blind us to AQI's abilities or to their \nresolve in attacking Americans. Kurdish areas in northern Iraq were the \nsafest in Iraq a year ago, but today AQI is taking advantage of this \nsafety by establishing around Mosul and launching attacks against the \npopulation. This is an area where U.S. troops are used sparingly. In my \nhumble opinion, that is no coincidence. U.S. operations forced AQI out \nof al-Anbar, restricted their operations in Baghdad, and they are now \nmoving to more rural areas with less U.S. military.\n\n  If this legislation passes and our troops must withdraw from Iraq, \nAQI\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\nwill have the freedom to terrorize the rest of Iraq and beyond. The \nDirector of National Intelligence stated that he is ``increasingly \nconcerned that as we inflict significant damage on al-Qa'ida in Iraq, \nit may shift resources to mounting more attacks outside of Iraq . . . \nAlthough the ongoing conflict in Iraq will likely absorb most of AQI's \nresources [over] the next year, AQI has leveraged its broad external \nnetworks--including some reaching into Europe--in support of external \noperations.'' Forcing our troops out of Iraq would result in a \nresurgent AQI which could mount attacks from Iraq against Americans and \nour allies.\n  Security is not the only aspect improving in Iraq. On the political \nfront, the Council of Representatives is taking steps to institute \nnecessary legislation to help reconcile Iraq.\n  Earlier this month, the Council of Representatives passed a \ndebaathification law which will help reintegrate former regime \nofficials into society. Two weeks ago, the Council of Representatives \npassed three key pieces of legislation: an amnesty law, a provincial \npowers law, and the 2008 fiscal budget. For the first time, Iraq's main \npolitical parties compromised in order to support passage of these \nbills. The provincial powers law requires the council to pass an \nelection law within 90 days and for provincial elections to occur no \nlater than October 1, 2008. These are encouraging steps. In spite of \nthe fact that the provincial powers law was vetoed yesterday, it is \nencouraging, and I am very hopeful we are going to see the differences \nreconciled in short order and that law become permanent.\n  By limiting our military actions to specific areas, this bill would \nensure that every one of these successes and improvements in security \nis reversed. In the midst of progress in Iraq, which no one denies, and \nwith a strategy that is working, it simply does not make sense to tie \nthe hands of the commanders on the ground and force them to implement a \nstrategy which will lead to failure--a strategy that in the best \njudgment of our military leaders, our intelligence agencies, and from \nthe perspective of countless outside observers have stated will lead to \nthe failure of our mission and the rapid deterioration of conditions in \nIraq and for the Iraqi people.\n  Hopefully, it is evident to people who are watching this debate and \nhave examined the Feingold bill that the strategy which inspires the \nprovisions and limitations in this bill is not a military strategy; it \nis a political strategy. The tactics being used by those who would \nenact conditions and limitations on our involvement in Iraq, such as \nthose contained in this bill, are not based on strategic thought or \nanalysis. Rather, they appeal to a political base that has always \nopposed the war, refuses to acknowledge the progress we are making, and \nwants to see our mission fail.\n  Political strategies for fighting wars such as the rhetoric some are \nnow imploring all have one thing in common: They all result in failure. \nThey are shortsighted, politically motivated, do not serve any national \nsecurity objective and, most importantly, are a disservice to the men \nand women who have been called into action and are on the ground in \nIraq.\n  We are making progress in Iraq. The strategy our President and our \nmilitary commanders have implemented is working. We are receiving \npositive updates from our leaders in the field. Our leaders are \nadjusting their strategy in accordance with those developments on the \nground as well as the realities back home. They are doing this wisely, \nnot hastily or in response to opinion polls, but according to good \njudgment and a realistic assessment of what will work, what will not \nwork, and what is appropriate at this point in time.\n  The Feingold bill will stop our leaders' ability to do this. It will \nkeep them from doing the jobs we sent them to do; and that is to lead, \nto decide, to make judgments, and to report back to us on their \neffectiveness. Most importantly, it will keep them from completing the \njob we have sent them to perform. This is unacceptable.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \npulling our troops out of Iraq based on political timetables conceived \nin the Senate.\n  I have voted against similar measures in the past. I intend to vote \nagainst them again this week. These bills do nothing more than tie the \nhands of our commanders on the ground while pandering to special \ninterests here in the United States--antiwar groups.\n  These are the same commanders who are risking their lives daily that \nour mission in Iraq can continue to succeed. And our mission is \nsucceeding. General Petraeus is succeeding. Violence in Iraq is at the \nlowest since the insurgency began. Suicide bombings are down 70 \npercent. IED attacks have been cut in half.\n  The surge is working. Since it began less than a year ago, we have \nsucceeded in putting al-Qaida on the run, while rooting out the \nterrorists neighborhood by neighborhood. In return, Iraqis have \npartnered with U.S. troops, forming their own security forces, and \nstabilizing their own neighborhoods. These efforts have served to unite \ntorn communities, such as Anbar Province, and pave the way \nfor political reconciliation.\n\n  The other side has said for months the surge has failed because it \nhas not created an environment for political progress in Iraq. Well, \nthey are wrong. The correlation between the surge and security is \nobvious. In the past few weeks, as we continue to see increased \nstability throughout Iraq, the Iraqi Government has made great \npolitical strides.\n  On February 13, the Iraqi Council of Representatives passed three key \npieces of legislation: An amnesty law, the 2008 budget, and a \nprovincial powers law. These political milestones are made possible by \nSunnis, Shiites, and Kurds reaching out to each other and working to \nfind solutions that represent all Iraqis.\n  This is General Petraeus's counterinsurgency at work. It worked when \nhe was commander of the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul, and now it is \nworking all across Iraq.\n  So I ask my colleagues across the aisle: Why, when you see our \nmission in Iraq is succeeding, and the Iraqi people are making real \npolitical progress, do you want to pull the rug out from underneath our \ncommanders and our troops?\n  Last July, the Senate overwhelmingly supported, by a vote of 94 to 3, \na sense-of-the-Senate amendment stating that it is in our national \nsecurity interests that Iraq not become a failed state and a safe haven \nfor terrorists.\n  Well, wake up. Cutting and running from Iraq will only benefit the \nterrorists, while jeopardizing our national security and that of the \nIraqi people.\n  Make no mistake, Iraq is the central battleground in our fight in the \nglobal war on terror. This is not just my opinion. Osama bin Laden has \ncalled Iraq the ``central front'' in his war against America. He knows \nthat the premature withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq will strengthen \nhis terrorist organization, enabling him to set up training camps in \nthat country.\n  Although it has been over 6 years since we have experienced a \nterrorist attack on U.S. soil, we must never forget that there are \nthose out there who wish to do us harm on a daily basis. And those who \nwish to do us harm will benefit if we pull out of Iraq and leave a \nfailed state behind.\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\n  Al-Qaida and its allies flourish and multiply in the chaos of failed \nStates with no rule of law or respect for human rights. Instead of \ndebating a cut-and-run strategy in Iraq that has already failed on the \nfloor of this Senate four times, we should be focusing on how to \nprovide the defenders of our freedom--our commanders and our troops--\nwith the necessary tools to complete their mission.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with the new commanding \ngeneral of the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, KY. Located on the \nsouthern border between Kentucky and Tennessee, the Fort Campbell \ncommunity has felt the effects of deployments and casualties.\n  Right around 200 soldiers from Fort Campbell have given their lives \nfor their country. Thousands of good men and women have spent tours of \n15 months away from their families--some four, some three, others two, \nand some one: tours of 15 or 12 months from the 101st Airborne in Iraq.\n  Speaking with the commanding general only reinforced my belief that \nwe have some of the finest patriots serving in our Nation's military. \nThe brave men and women who answer the call to defend our Nation, and \nthe families and communities who support them, are our most valuable \nnational asset. I do not want to see their unbelievable efforts in Iraq \nfail. We as a nation have invested too much to hand a big victory to \nal-Qaida in Iraq.\n  This political show needs to end.\n  In April, General Petraeus will report back to Congress on the state \nof our mission in Iraq. As Senators who voted in support of his \nconfirmation, we owe him this opportunity to present his report to us, \ninstead of cutting him off at the knees right before his report. We \nshould show him the respect of listening to his report. We owe an \nhonorable man, who has spent--I want you to remember this--who has \nspent most of the last 5 years away from his family in Iraq to see that \nfreedom in America is preserved.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in giving General Petraeus this \nopportunity and opposing these bills.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, first of all, I welcome this opportunity \nto talk about the current status of the involvement of the United \nStates in Iraq. I am glad we are having this discussion. I start by \nthanking the troops for their incredible service to our country and the \nincredible work they are doing, and I think this Congress, by words and \ndeeds, has shown its support for our troops. The budget we provided \nlast year provides the resources to take care of our veterans and the \nfunds to take care of our active military. That is what we should be \ndoing.\n  But we have now been in Iraq for many years. Several years ago I was \nin Iraq. I had a chance to visit our troops and take a look at what was \nhappening on the ground. I saw then that we didn't have the right \nequipment there; that the administration had sent our troops without \nhaving the right support. I was proud of the action the Congress took \nin providing the military support and the type of equipment our troops \nneeded.\n  But the discussion of what is best for our troops is whether we have \nthe right mission in Iraq. This campaign is now entering its sixth \nyear. We have been in Iraq longer than we were in World War II. We have \nnow spent a half trillion dollars directly on our war in Iraq. Almost \n4,000 Americans have been killed, almost 30,000 have been wounded, 67 \nMarylanders have given their lives, and over 800 have been injured. \nMany of these injuries are life changing.\n  I have had a chance to visit Andrews Air Force Base as our wounded \nsoldiers come home, and I have been able to see firsthand the type of \ninjuries they sustained. They will have to deal with them for the rest \nof their lives.\n  When we look at the strength of al-Qaida, our experts tell us they \nare stronger today than they have ever been. So we haven't accomplished \nour mission as far as dealing with the threat against the United \nStates.\n  Let's talk about the facts. The inescapable conclusion is that \nPresident Bush was wrong in sending our troops to Iraq in the first \nplace. I am proud I voted against that authorization when I was in the \nother body. Our troops are involved in trying to referee a civil war. \nThat is their primary focus. Yes, we are fighting terrorists, and we \nneed to continue to do that, but the primary need for American troops \nis to deal with the civil unrest that is currently taking place in \nIraq.\n  The costs, as I explained before, in lives has been our deepest loss, \nbut also the dollars--a half trillion dollars. Think about what we \ncould have done with that money. I think about schools in Baltimore \nthat should be replaced. We could have replaced every school with the \nmoney that has been spent so our children could get a proper education. \nWe could have dealt with the energy crisis in this country and built \nthe transit systems we need and become energy independent so we are not \ndependent on foreign oil in the Middle East. We could have done \nsomething about the health care system in this country.\n  A year ago, Diamonte Driver died in Prince George's County, MD, \nbecause he couldn't get dental care. We are suffering an economic \ndownturn right now because we have large debt, in part, and that debt \nis accumulating because we are not only spending a half trillion \ndollars, we are not paying for it. We are borrowing the money. It is \nmaking it even more dangerous for our economy.\n  So I know there has been a lot of debate on this floor about whether \nthe President's surge policy has worked. I must tell my colleagues, I \nthink our soldiers are performing, as I said earlier, in a great \nmanner. When you put American troops in a country, they are going to do \ntheir job and they are going to provide the type of help to that \ncountry and to its communities that American troops are trained to do. \nBut the problem is the mission is wrong. The surge has not worked in \naccomplishing the U.S. mission that is in the best interests of this \ncountry.\n  I remember when the President said: We are going to have the surge \nbecause we are going to provide stability in the country so the Iraqi \nGovernment can take control and we can bring our troops home. That was \nthe mission. That is what we are trying to accomplish, but we haven't \naccomplished that. Let's look at the facts. Look at the facts.\n  Violence in Iraq continues today. The majority leader mentioned the \nheadlines in today's paper. Violence continues. It is a dangerous \ncountry. Suicide bombers operate at will. The troop levels were \nsupposed to be reduced. In January of 2007 we had 130,000 American \ntroops in Iraq. Today we have in excess of 140,000. There is now a \npause in reducing our troop levels. We haven't been able to reduce the \ntroop levels. On governance, on the Iraqi Government representing the \npeople of Iraq, they set their own benchmarks. We didn't set them. Of \n18 benchmarks, only 3 have been accomplished. So, no, we haven't \naccomplished the mission the President established for why we needed \nour troops in Iraq.\n  But let's take a look at our military and foreign policy experts. \nThey tell us our military today is spread too thin, that we aren't \nlooking after the best interests of America's military interests. Talk \nto our people who run our National Guard and Reserve units.\n  I had a chance to meet with members of the Maryland National Guard. \nThey have, again, answered the call. People of the Maryland National \nGuard have been deployed regularly into Iraq and Afghanistan. But I am \ntold today we don't have the equipment in our National Guard to \ncontinue the proper training missions because the equipment was left in \nIraq. We haven't replaced that. Also, recruitment is going to be more \ndifficult, and we need to deal with the reintegration of the National \nGuard people who are coming back to Maryland in our community, and that \nis going to take a real effort. Now they have to be prepared for \nredeployment.\n  We have lost our focus, according to our experts on the war against \nterror. We should have taken care of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. We \nhaven't done that. Now Afghanistan looks as if it is moving in the \nwrong direction because we are not focusing on the threat, which is \nterrorism. Instead, we have our troops dealing with a civil\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\nwar in Iraq. There is no disagreement among the foreign policy experts \nthat America has lost its leadership internationally and is galvanizing \nthe international community to help us in the war against terror. We \nhave lost that focus. So our mission is wrong.\n  The question, though, is where do we go from here. Well, if we want \nto follow President Bush's policy, we will have a permanent presence of \nAmerican troops in Iraq. I think that is the wrong policy. I believe \nthe people of Maryland and of this Nation believe it is the wrong \npolicy. The President's policy is basically waiting out the burning out \nof the civil war. We know 4 million Iraqis are displaced, some in the \ncountry, some outside the country. That is not the right answer for the \npeople of Iraq, and it is certainly not the right answer for U.S. \npolicy.\n\n  So we have an alternative. Senator Feingold has brought to us a bill \nwhich I believe warrants our support. It is the right mission for our \ntroops and our Nation. Fighting terrorism, I am for that. That is what \nwe should be doing. Protecting our troops, that is what we should be \ndoing. Helping the Iraqis in the training of their own military, that \nis what we should be doing. It focuses our mission on what is in the \nbest interests of the United States. We need a political solution, not \na military solution, for the people of Iraq. The Feingold resolution \nacknowledges that.\n  We need to work with the international community. We work best when \nwe work with the international community. The international community \nis wondering what we are doing in Iraq.\n  The Feingold bill does not place a time limit on the withdrawal of \nU.S. troops. It is an honorable and orderly process for us to complete \na mission in Iraq. I believe it is in the best interests of the United \nStates. I believe it is the right policy for our soldiers, and I \nbelieve it deserves the support of this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cardin for his excellent \nremarks and for his leadership on this issue. It has been very helpful \nduring a very tough battle that we have to keep fighting.\n  We had an interesting debate yesterday on the two bills I have \noffered with the majority leader. I know some of my colleagues \nexpressed concern that we were spending too much time on this issue. \nWell I, for one, am pleased we are able to discuss one of the most \npressing problems facing this country. Maybe now that they have allowed \nus to have this debate, the Republicans will allow us to actually \nconsider and vote on these bills.\n  While I appreciate the chance to have this debate, I would like to \ntake this chance to respond to some of the statements that have been \nmade on the other side. I have actually been accused of ``legislating \ndefeat in Iraq'' or other variations on that theme, and somehow trying \nto micromanage the job of the commanders. Actually, we have already \naccomplished our military mission in Iraq: Removing Saddam Hussein. I \nam interested in achieving victory in the global effort to combat al-\nQaida. We have to make a choice. The Army Chief of Staff has been clear \nthat ``the numbers of forces we have committed in Iraq now increases \nour level of strategic risk.''\n  So what does that mean? It means we must choose between letting the \nIraqi people resolve their sectarian disputes on their own or, on the \nother hand, exhausting our troops in Iraq and losing ground in the \nglobal fight against al-Qaida.\n  Senator Inhofe said my bill demanding a strategy to defeat al-Qaida \nwasn't needed because we already have a plan to defeat al-Qaida. He \nfailed to explain why, though. If we already have a strategy to defeat \nal-Qaida, why is it that al-Qaida has regenerated and reconstituted \nitself and is planning more attacks on our homeland? Admiral Mullen has \nbeen quite clear that under our current strategy, Afghanistan is a \nsecond priority where we only ``do what we can''--do what we can. In \nother words, we are so bogged down in Iraq, we don't have the forces to \nrespond to the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. If this is a \nstrategy, it sure isn't working, which is why the majority leader and I \nwant to require the administration to develop a plan that prioritizes \nthe fight against al-Qaida and protecting ourselves at home over an \nendless war in Iraq.\n  Senators Inhofe and Lieberman have claimed that we do already have \npolitical reconciliation in Iraq and that we have seen benchmark \nlegislation in the Iraqi Parliament. Yes, a debaathification law has \npassed, an amnesty law has passed, and the provincial powers election \npower law passed. Yes, we have seen movement in the Iraqi Parliament \nafter waiting for more than 4 years. It is my great hope that the laws \nrecently passed will bring the Sunnis fully into the political process. \nBut as we well know, passing a law is one thing, but actually seeing it \nsuccessfully implemented is another, particularly given the country's \nweak national government.\n  I think national reconciliation still looks far off. The passage of \nwhat the administration is calling ``benchmark'' laws does not ensure \nsociety-wide sectarian reconciliation. There are still significant \nconcerns about how the local efforts we have supported to bring about \ndeclining violence will actually be integrated into the national \nframework. To illustrate this, the Sunni Awakening has taken tens of \nthousands of former insurgent Sunni militia fighters and provided them \nwith U.S. funding in exchange for helping combat al-Qaida and Iraq. But \nto what extent we can rely on the long-term loyalties of these fighters \nis a very open question. We do know, however, that this policy actually \nrisks increasing distrust between the local Sunnis and the national \ngovernment, which of course is led primarily by Shiites.\n  I would just like to ask, if Iraqis have agreed to political \nreconciliation, as Senator Inhofe suggested, well then doesn't that \nmean we have achieved the objectives of the surge and we can start \nbringing the troops home? When does the other side think we can bring \nthe troops home? They never talk about that. Five years? Ten years? \nTwenty years? One hundred years? What kind of success is that?\n  After more than 4 years of waiting for the Iraqi Government to make \nprogress, we have lost nearly 4,000 Americans, with no end in sight and \nno clear path for a reconciliation that incorporates all aspects and \nelements of Iraqi society.\n  Now, another argument we have heard is it has been suggested that \nIraq would collapse or that genocide would occur if U.S. troops leave. \nOf course, that assumes our military presence there is actually helping \nthe situation rather than simply postponing an inevitable day of \nreckoning. If we bring our troops out of this quagmire, Iraqis and \ntheir neighbors would have to confront the crisis head on. Now, I am \nnot calling for the United States to abandon Iraq, but there is simply \nno way we can fix the mess we have made without a legitimate political \nsettlement.\n  A U.S. redeployment would actually put new pressure on Iraqis and on \ncountries in the region to engage productively and to make the decision \nas to whether a full-fledged civil war is really in the interests of \nIraq or its neighboring countries. I suspect--I really do feel strongly \nabout this, having looked at this issue for many years in both the \nForeign Relations Committee and the Intelligence Committee--that if \nthese countries were faced with that decision, they would actually try \nharder to reconcile their differences peacefully rather than further \nignite tensions.\n  Some Members of this body seem to believe the war in Iraq is between \nU.S. troops on the one side and al-Qaida on the other. That is not what \nis going on. In fact, that is dangerous, wishful thinking. The recent \npatterns of violence in Iraq actually confirm what the intelligence \ncommunity has said all along: that the war in Iraq is sectarian and \nintrasectarian and far from the oversimplified ``us versus them'' that \nproponents of an endless military engagement in Iraq continue to \ndescribe. Moreover, in mixed areas such as Mosul, violence is actually \nincreasing. And in the south, the increased violence is among Shiites, \nand reduction in areas such as Anbar, which is almost entirely Sunni or \nin Baghdad, where sectarian cleansing has already occurred, do not \nrepresent a diminishment of the underlying tensions that could explode \nat any time.\n  Contrary to what we heard yesterday, Iraq simply is not the central\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\nfront on the war on terrorism. To the extent to which there is such a \nfront in this very global conflict, it is clearly Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. No rational reading of press reports, independent studies \nor our own intelligence could possibly conclude otherwise. While the \nadministration has focused on Iraq, al-Qaida has reconstituted itself \nalong the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. That sounds like a big mistake. \nThat sounds like a real strategic error in an international battle \nagainst terrorism. Yet far too many people in the administration and my \ncolleagues somehow believe Iraq is what it is all about. What a \nterrible strategic mistake.\n  Early this month, the DNI testified before Congress that the central \nleadership based in the border area of Pakistan is al-Qaida's most \ndangerous component. And a few months ago, the DNI again repeated the \nintelligence community's assessment that over the last 2 years ``Al \nQaeda's central leadership has been able to regenerate the core \noperational capabilities needed to conduct attacks in the Homeland''--\nin the homeland, our homeland, our country, the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The DNI also testified that al-Qaida ``is improving the last key \naspect of its ability to attack the U.S.: The identification, training, \nand positioning of operatives for an attack in the Homeland''--in this \ncountry.\n  Meanwhile, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas--or FATA region--\nin Pakistan is serving as a staging ground for al-Qaida in support of \nthe Taliban and providing it with a base similar to the one it used to \nhave across the border in Afghanistan.\n  Over the past year, as we all know, we have seen an unprecedented \nrise of suicide bombings in Pakistan. The Taliban is gaining ground in \nAfghanistan, and while we may be sending an additional 3,200 marines to \nAfghanistan in the near future, we have been fighting for far too long \nthere with too few soldiers and too few reconstruction funds. The price \nof that neglect is a dramatic resurgence of militants that must be \nurgently addressed.\n  Yesterday, a Washington Post article noted that:\n\n       More foreign soldiers and Afghan civilians died in Taliban-\n     related fighting last year than in any year since U.S. and \n     coalition forces ousted the extremist Islamic militia, which \n     ruled most of the country, in 2001. Military officials expect \n     the coming year to be just as deadly, if not more so, as the \n     Taliban becomes more adept militarily and more formidable in \n     its deployment of suicide bombers and roadside explosives.\n\n  With the Joint Chiefs saying: ``In Iraq we do what we must and in \nAfghanistan we do what we can,'' it is no wonder Afghanistan is \nteetering on the edge. It has been neglected, shoved to the back burner \nso the President can pursue an open-ended war in Iraq.\n  I remind my colleagues it was from Afghanistan, not Iraq, that the 9/\n11 attacks were planned, and it was under the Taliban regime, which is \nonce again gaining ground, that al-Qaida was able to flourish so \nfreely. This is the actual position, this is the actual situation in \nterms of this global fight against those who attacked us on 9/11. It is \nnot all about Iraq.\n  Al-Qaida affiliates from Africa to Southeast Asia pose a significant \nterrorist threat. While we have been so myopically fixated on Iraq, the \nthreat from an al-Qaida affiliate in North Africa has grown and now, \naccording again to the testimony of the Director of National \nIntelligence, ``represents a significant threat to the United States \nand European interests in the region.''\n  Since its merger with al-Qaida in September 2006, it has expanded its \ntargets to include the United States, United Nations, and other \ninterests, and it likely got a further boost when al-Qaida leadership \nannounced last November that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group united \nwith al-Qaida under AQIM's leadership. Its possible reach covers \nTunisia, Morocco, Nigeria, Mauritania, Libya, and other countries. \nMeanwhile, it is using deadly tactics that suggest it is acquiring \nknowledge and help from the war in Iraq, basically a training ground \nfor those who get exported to attack us.\n  Al-Qaida has affiliates around the world--in Saudi Arabia, United \nArab Emirates, Yemen, Lebanon, where al-Qaida poses a ``growing \nthreat,'' the Horn of Africa, and Southeast Asia. And a few weeks ago, \nthere were more arrests in Europe. None, not one of these developments \nhas been prevented by the war in Iraq.\n  We cannot ignore the rest of the world to focus solely on Iraq. Al-\nQaida is and will continue to be a global terrorist organization with \ndangerous affiliates around the world. The administration claims al-\nQaida in Iraq may be on the run, but al-Qaida has not abandoned its \nefforts to fight us globally. In fact, we are watching al-Qaida \nstrengthen and develop its affiliates around the world, while we remain \nbogged down in Iraq. How foolish can we be to allow them to \nreconstitute all over the world as they watch us unable to extricate \nourselves from a mistake which was, of course, going into Iraq the way \nwe did.\n  We need a robust military presence and effective reconstruction \nprogram in Afghanistan. We need to build strong partnerships where al-\nQaida and its affiliates are operating--across North Africa, in \nSoutheast Asia, and along the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and \nwe need to address the root causes of the terrorist threat, not just \nrely on military power to get the job done.\n  I would like to turn now briefly to the impact of the Iraq war on our \nmilitary and National Guard. There is nobody in the Senate who cares \nmore about this than the Presiding Officer. I will start by repeating \nwhat GEN George Casey, the Chief of Staff of the Army, said yesterday \nin congressional testimony:\n\n       The cumulative effects of the last six-plus years at war \n     have left our Army out of balance, consumed by the current \n     fight and unable to do the things we know we need to do to \n     properly sustain our all-volunteer force and restore our \n     flexibility for an uncertain future.\n\n  Many U.S. troops currently in Iraq, as we all know, are now in their \nthird or fourth tours of duty. Approximately 95 percent of the Army \nNational Guard's combat battalions and special operations units have \nbeen mobilized since 9/11.\n  Mr. President, 1.4 million Americans have served in Iraq and over \n420,000 have served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. As I said \nbefore, nearly 4,000 of our men and women have been killed in Iraq, and \nover 27,000 have been wounded.\n  The Army cannot maintain its current pace of operations in Iraq \nwithout seriously damaging the military. Young officers are leaving the \nservice at an alarming rate.\n  Readiness levels for the Army are at lows not seen since the Vietnam \nwar. Every active Army brigade currently not deployed is unprepared to \nperform its wartime mission.\n  More than two-thirds of Active Duty Army brigades are unready for \nmissions because of manpower and equipment shortages, most of which, of \ncourse, can be attributed to Iraq.\n  There are insufficient Reserves to respond to additional conflicts or \ncrises around the world.\n  This failure to prioritize correctly has left vital missions \nunattended. Natural disaster response, U.S. border security, and \ninternational efforts to combat al-Qaida are all suffering due to the \nstrain on military forces caused by poor strategy and failed leadership \nin Iraq.\n  In addition, thousands of our troops have, as we well know, returned \nhome with invisible wounds, such as PTSD and TBI, traumatic brain \ninjury, which will have a long-term impact on veterans and their \nfamilies. These invisible wounds are not counted in the casualty \nnumbers, but we will be struggling with them for generations.\n  I haven't even touched on the massive debt we are running up to pay \nfor this war. We are spending approximately $10 billion a month in \nIraq. Congress has appropriated over $525 billion for this war, and the \ndebt keeps mounting.\n  We heard eloquent floor statements yesterday on this side about how \nthese costs are affecting our ability to address other priorities. I \nwill not repeat all of what was said, but I do want to note that the \nwar in Iraq keeps us from adequately addressing critical gaps in our \nhomeland security and law enforcement. While we had 92,000 more troops \nto the Army and Marine Corps, the city of New York has 5,000 fewer \npolice officers on the beat than it did on September 11, 2001.\n  This year, we will spend a fifth of our $740 billion ``national \nsecurity budget'' on Iraq, twice what the Federal Government spends \ndefending our Nation.\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nMeanwhile, the administration wants to cut grants for first responders, \nand the Coast Guard is struggling with an inadequate force size.\n  It doesn't make sense. It simply doesn't make sense. The American \npeople know that, which is why they voted the way they did last \nNovember. More than 60 percent of Americans are in favor of a phased \nwithdrawal. They don't want to pass this problem off to the next \nPresident and another Congress, and they sure don't want another \nAmerican servicemember to die or lose a limb while elected \nrepresentatives put their own political comfort over the wishes of \ntheir constituents.\n  Polls continue to show voters strongly oppose the war in Iraq, and \nthat is one of the top issues on which they will be voting. A recent \nWashington Post/ABC poll found that 65 percent of Americans disapprove \nof the situation in Iraq and 56 percent disapprove strongly. The same \npoll also found this is the second most important issue to voters in \nNovember, behind the economy and jobs. And a recent Gallup poll showed \na majority of Americans, 56 percent, do not believe the surge is \nworking and want a timetable to get out of Iraq. Those Americans need \nto be heard, and that is what we are trying to do with this important \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today we are here to address the issue of \nthe Iraq war, and many are saying: Well, why should we address the Iraq \nwar again? Because, obviously, it is still going on; there is still no \ndirection in terms of political progress; the Shiites, the Sunnis, and \nthe Kurds still have their age-old enmities; the goals of the Iraqi \nGovernment set by this Government for them have not been met; but most \nof all, I think we are here to debate this issue, at least in my \njudgment, because we are at a turning point in terms of the debate in \nIraq. That turning point--the case against this war--has been building \nfor a long time. As we debate this bill on Iraq, we are at a turning \npoint in the argument against the war. We have always been aware of the \ncost in life, both American and Iraqi, and we have known how severe \nthat cost is. Despite the good works of our troops, we are continually \ntroubled by the tragic loss of life. The American people are baffled by \nthe lack of political progress and, most of all, the American people \nare beginning to comprehend the eye-popping figures of what this war is \ncosting our budget and our economy. It is becoming clear to all \nAmericans--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--that by continuing \nto spend huge amounts on Iraq, we are prevented from spending on \ndesired goals and needs here at home.\n  So the turning point is this: The lack of progress, particularly on \nthe political front, continues; the tragic loss of life continues; but \nthe cost of the war and the inability to use those funds to help us \nhere at home, the cost of the war and the inability to use those funds \nto properly go after the most dangerous nexus of terror, which is a \nthousand miles to the east--Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran--is now \nbecoming a clinching argument that we must quickly and soon change the \ncourse, the direction, of this war in Iraq.\n  I went to Iraq over New Year's. I spent time with our soldiers. They \nare wonderful. They are awe-inspiring. The troops are awe-inspiring, \nfrom the private I met from Queens, just out of high school, who had \nenlisted 8 months previously and was in Iraq 3 weeks, to the majors and \ncaptains who had served 10 years in the Army or the Marines and had \nmade the military their life's work--they see a greater good than just \nthemselves, and it is wonderful--all the way to the generals. I spent \ntime with General Petraeus at a New Year's Eve dinner. I spent time \nwith General Odierno. They are fine, intelligent, good people.\n  When I went to Iraq, I assured our soldiers, from the private to the \ngenerals, that one good thing that would come out of this war is the \nesteem that we hold for both the military and our soldiers would be \ngreater when the war finished than when it started--a far different cry \nthan the Vietnam War, which is one of the most disgraceful times in \nAmerica, when our soldiers were too often vilified for simply serving \nour country.\n  But after I left Iraq, I came to this conclusion, Mr. President, and \nthat is that even if we were to follow General Petraeus's game plan--\nwhich, of course, involves not just military success in security but \nwinning over the hearts and minds of the people--it would take a \nminimum of 5 years and have about a 50 percent chance of success of \nbringing stability--not democracy but at least stability--to large \nportions of Iraq. That is not the military's fault, and that is not \nAmerica's fault. That is because of the age-old enmities within Iraq--\nthe Sunnis, the Shiites, and the Kurds, and then within the groups \nthemselves. It would be very hard to create permanent stability without \na permanent and large structure of troops.\n  Now, I ask you, stability in Iraq--a worthy goal, but is it on your \ntop-five list for America? Is it on any American's top-five list? A \nfew, maybe, not the vast majority. We have many other higher goals that \ncost the same dollars and need the same attention and energy that is \nnow diverted to Iraq. Our education system is declining, our health \ncare system doesn't cover people, and we are paying $3.30 for gas \nbecause we don't have an energy policy. And even if your goals are just \nforeign policy, shouldn't we be taking the time and effort that is all \nnow focused on Iraq, as well as the dollars, and spending more focus on \nthe dangerous triangle composed of Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan? Of \ncourse. We must ask ourselves: Is it worth spending trillions of \ndollars needed elsewhere on such an uncertain and unpredictable \noutcome?\n  So the debate is changing. The costs of Iraq, the simple costs alone, \nare weighing too heavily on the American people, the American \nGovernment, and on our national purpose. While admirable as a goal, it \nis hardly the most important goal we have in this changing and \ndangerous and exciting world in which we live. The cost of the war has \nbecome the $800 billion gorilla in the room. The backbreaking cost of \nthis war to the American families, the Federal budget, and the entire \neconomy is becoming one of the first things, after loss of life, people \nthink about.\n  A report issued by the Joint Economic Committee, which I chair, \nestimated that the total costs of the war will double what the \nadministration has spent directly on the war alone--$1.3 trillion \nthrough 2008. And that is a conservative estimate. According to budget \nfigures on Iraq spending for 2000, the Bush administration wants to \nspend $430 million a day on Iraq. For 1 day of the war in Iraq, we \ncould enroll an additional 58,000 children in Head Start per year, we \ncould put an additional 88,900 police officers on our streets per year, \nwe could hire another 10,000 Border Patrol agents per year, we could \nmake college more affordable for 163,000 students per year, and we \ncould help nearly 260,000 American families keep their homes per year. \nIn the fiscal year of 2008, we put $159 billion into Iraq. That doubles \nour entire domestic transportation spending to fix roads and bridges, \nand it dwarfs all the funds we provide to the National Institutes of \nHealth to discover cures for diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Iraq\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nspending is seven times our spending to help young Americans get a \ncollege education. The costs are mountainous, and in this changing \nworld, where we have to fight to keep America No. 1, we cannot afford \nsuch costs, as I said, despite the great efforts our soldiers are \nputting into Iraq.\n\n  Now, tomorrow morning, Mr. President, we in the Joint Economic \nCommittee--and I see my colleague from Virginia here, and he is on that \ncommittee with me--we are going to hold our first congressional hearing \nof the year, and it will be appropriately devoted to the skyrocketing \ncost of the Iraq war. That will be the Joint Economic Committee. We are \ngoing to have Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr. Joseph Stiglitz talk \nfor a time about his new book, about to be published, and the title \nspeaks for itself: ``The $3 Trillion War.'' Dr. Stiglitz got \ninformation out of the Government and out of the Pentagon, after much \nlong work, and has new estimates that make our estimates on the Joint \nEconomic Committee seem small--$3 trillion. That is the title of his \nbook. He is going to talk about the cost of that war. We are going to \nhave national security experts, such as Bob Hormats and Ron Bier, \ndiscuss their views on how the out-of-control costs of the war have \nimpacted our economy, our reputation abroad, our military strength and \nreadiness, and the future of our children. Our JEC report estimated \n$1.3 trillion, but Dr. Stiglitz--and he has talked to the experts from \nthe Pentagon--has even more massive numbers.\n  So we desperately need a change of course in Iraq. That is what this \namendment calls for. It calls for limiting what our troops will do to \nforce protection, of course, to training the Iraqi army, to fighting \nal-Qaida and fighting terrorism, but not to be in the middle of a civil \nwar where we continually police the age-old enmities of the various \nfactions in Iraq.\n  History will look upon this Iraq war in two ways: It will admire the \nbravery of our soldiers, from the privates to the generals, and it will \nbe amazed at the mistakes made by this administration in starting and \ncontinuing this war, far too expensive in loss of life and in dollars.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Webb's \nspeech, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly oppose any \nSenate amendment that would require the immediate and arbitrary \nwithdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. This amendment is the latest \nattempt in a year-long effort to constrain the ability of our generals \nand our brave men and women in uniform to fight this war effectively.\n  During the past year, the Senate has voted over 40 times on bills to \nlimit the generals' war strategy. Not one has become law or even come \nclose. Since this assembly line of votes started in February 2007, the \nsituation in Iraq has changed considerably and it has changed for the \nbetter.\n  While some Senators were insisting that the war was lost, General \nPetraeus was in the process of implementing a strategic readjustment \nthat has produced remarkable progress on the battlefield. It has been \nsaid on this floor: We need to change the direction. We are changing \nthe direction. We are changing the strategy. We are going in the right \ndirection.\n  I got back from Iraq 2 days ago. I saw for myself the enormous \nmilitary gains we have achieved in that country. While in Baghdad, I \nput on a suit of body armor. I traveled in an MRAP vehicle with our \ntroops through the streets of Baghdad. I was able to go to a police \nstation where we have embedded troops there.\n  I met with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, and troops from \nReese Air Force Base, Ft. Hood, the Red River Army Depot, and others \nfrom the Texas National Guard. Because of the leadership of our \ncommanders and the courage of our service men and women, there is new \nreason for optimism in Iraq.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. The murder rate in Baghdad has \nplunged by 80 percent. Al-Qaida has been routed in every neighborhood. \nIraqi forces have formally taken control of security across much of the \ncountry. Violence is at the lowest level since 2003. Roadside bomb \nattacks have receded to a 3-year low. Discovery of weapons caches has \nmore than doubled in the last year. The Iraqi security forces have \ngrown to 440,000 trained and equipped.\n  At the police station where our Armed Forces are embedded with the \nIraqi police, I can see that the Iraqis are taking more responsibility \nfor their security. The Sons of Iraq are an example of that growth and \nresponsibility. The Sons of Iraq, which is now over 90,000 strong, \nessentially serve as neighborhood watches and manned checkpoints. By \nproviding forces for protecting key infrastructure and information \nabout al-Qaida, the Sons of Iraq has enabled coalition forces to target \nal-Qaida precisely. This ensures the right people are targeted, and it \nhelps avoid collateral damage, both of which are helping to strengthen \nconfidence in the Iraqi Government.\n  The transition in responsibility from the U.S. military to Iraqi \nauthority is a major step toward decreasing the presence of the United \nStates in Iraq.\n  There are other reasons to be hopeful about the future. Our military \ngains are beginning to contribute to the political gains. Recently the \nIraqi Parliament passed three laws that should begin to bring the \nSunnis more fully into the governing process and achieve national \nreconciliation.\n  First, Parliament passed a law that bolsters the power of the \nprovinces to provide roads and utilities to the residents. Second, it \nhas passed a partial amnesty for political prisoners, 80 percent of \nwhom are Sunnis, in an effort to reduce the conflict and promote peace \namong different sects. Finally, it approved a $48 billion national \nbudget that allocates Government revenue, 85 percent of which is from \noil, to the provinces, allowing more local control and less dependence \non the central government. Altogether the recent military and political \nnews out of Iraq provides further evidence that our strategies must be \ndetermined by events in theater, not timetables set by politicians \n6,000 miles away.\n  In the past year so much has changed in Iraq. Yet here on the Senate \nfloor, it seems nothing has changed at all. We are still voting on \nimprudent bills for premature withdrawal when, in fact, we should be \nproviding a vote of confidence in our troops. The mission of our troops \nis vital to our security. If we abandon Iraq prematurely, it will \nbecome a sanctuary for terrorists to launch attacks against the \nAmerican people.\n  There is also a real danger that Iraq could become a satellite of \nIran. The Iranian Government has a long record of sponsoring terrorism \nand arming the insurgents who are killing our brave soldiers in Iraq.\n  And what about the practical realities of such an irresponsible act \nof Congress? I am told it would take over a year to retrieve our arms, \nequipment, and technology. I ask those who are voting for this \nresolution: Would they leave our arms there for the terrorists to be \nable to use? What about our advanced technological equipment? What \nabout our surveillance equipment? What is the security threat to the \ntroops left behind if the reduction in strength leaves them without \nenough protection?\n  Those who are voting for this resolution, are they concerned about \nthis enemy, this enemy that has no rules of engagement, an enemy that \nis not in the armed forces of any country, an enemy that executes \nhostages in front of television screens? Are they concerned that this \nenemy would be emboldened by an adversary that would abandon its \ncommitment?\n  Are they concerned that they might attack harder, especially if they \ncould seize our weapons to use against us or make us leave faster so we \nwould leave the weapons and technology?\n  I ask the supporters of this resolution: What about the oil revenue? \nWhat if al-Qaida is able to get access to the millions that it is \nproducing for Iraq? If Iraq collapses and the terrorists take hold with \nthe oil revenue, how far could their heinous crimes go? How far could \nthey spread?\n  I have heard the arguments about the cost of the war. And the cost is \nhuge. What about the cost of another terrorist attack on the United \nStates of\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\nAmerica? What about the cost in life and treasure of another terrorist \nattack on this country? Have we forgotten already the cost of 9/11, \naround 3,000 lives in America, billions to our economy, and the damages \nto clean up New York City? Are we not thinking of the consequences of \nthis kind of action? This resolution may be an attempt to make a point. \nThis is the United States Senate. I truly believe we should be more \nresponsible. We are the leaders of our country. We should think of the \nconsequences, the worst that could happen, not just the best. If we are \nable to pick up and leave, even though it would not be the honorable \nthing for the greatest Nation on the Earth to do, maybe it would be \nflawless. But we need to think through these consequences and we need \nto know what is the worst case if we are the leaders of this country.\n\n  This resolution is not the act of a thoughtful, informed group of \nleaders. I urge my colleagues to stop voting on this kind of \nresolution. I urge the majority leader to stop scheduling the votes \nthat at best serve no legitimate purpose, and at worst demoralize our \ntroops and embolden our enemy.\n  We have so much that is going for the better in Iraq. Is it as fast \nas we would like? Of course not. I would love to have our troops \nwalking out right now. I met with hundreds of them this weekend. I know \nthey are committed. But I also have met with the parents and the \nspouses of those who have lost their lives, who have given the ultimate \nsacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have said to me: Do not leave \nwith the job undone, because then I will feel that my son or my \ndaughter or my husband has lost his life or her life in vain.\n  We cannot do that to those who have served so honorably and we cannot \nwalk away from our commitment. We are the Senate. We should be able to \ntake actions that are responsible, that are thoughtful, that will not \nput our troops in harm's way, that will not leave our equipment to be \ntaken over by the terrorists, that will not leave a country that could \nturn into a terrorist haven and take revenue and spread their terrorism \nand their heinous crimes to other places in the world and to our \ncountry.\n  We are here to protect our people. It is our job to act responsibly, \nand I hope we will do so by rejecting this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of the Senator from New Hampshire, the senior Senator from \nMontana be recognized on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this bill but in \nsupport of the concepts that have motivated it. I think the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin fully understands this. We have discussed this.\n  I wanted to add my comments with that perspective in mind, because I \ndo not agree with a lot of the comments coming from the other side of \nthe aisle with respect to why this amendment should be defeated.\n  I cannot support personally an amendment that involves an \nentrenchment on an appropriations measure. I do not believe the best \nway for us to address this situation is to cut off funds or to \nstipulate a series of conditions that might be overinclusive or \nunderinclusive, depending on the situation on the ground in Iraq.\n  But at the same time, I strongly disagree with the notion that a \nwithdrawal from Iraq at this time is premature. I believe that with the \nright national leadership, first, we never should have gone into Iraq, \nbut, secondly, that we could have begun a withdrawal with the right \nnational strategy more than 4 years ago.\n  What we have been engaged in since shortly after the invasion is an \noccupation, not a war. It has been a military holding action. In the \ncontext of history, a military holding action takes place in order to \nenable the political process and, unfortunately, we have not seen that \nsort of political leadership from this administration. That is a \ntotally different concept than the one that seems to make it into our \ndebates here.\n  I have written a lot of books in my life. I made my living before I \ncame to the Senate writing histories and novels. There were many times \nwhen I watched this debate that I would think about how this is going \nto look through the prism of history. How are people going to look back \nat this period of years in terms of how our national leaders were \nconducting themselves?\n  One thought that sticks in my mind is that we tend, when we debate \nIraq, to look at this issue almost as if Iraq was an island in the \nmiddle of an ocean, disconnected from the rest of the region or even \nthe rest of the world. That is ironically how we ended up in Iraq in \nthe first place, because once we started debating whether we would go \ninto Iraq, we changed from a debate about the dangers of international \nterrorism and started focusing more and more specifically simply on \nSaddam Hussein, on the conditions inside Iraq, which obviously was a \ncountry that was not even directly threatening us. Most of us sitting \non the outside who had years of experience in national security could \nsee that, even as the debate narrowed into Iraq rather than \ninternational terrorism.\n  We are doing it again. We are doing it again when we talk about the \nsuccess or failure of the surge or where we should go from here with \nrespect to this block or that block or this city or that city or this \nspecific unit of the military. We have fallen into what could be called \na double strategic mousetrap. On the one hand, we have the greatest \nmaneuver forces in the world bogged down, occupying cities in one \ncountry that was not even threatening us, while the people we are \nsupposed to be going after, the forces of international terrorism, know \nno international boundaries, work the seams of international law, and \nare able to maneuver at will. We are seeing that clearly.\n  Before I went to Iraq in November, I was getting briefings. The \ncomments and the briefings from the Pentagon were that terrorism \nactivity had been reduced inside Iraq. I mentioned I have been doing \nthis for 40 years, from the time I was a young marine. If I were the \nforces of international terrorism, I don't think I would be in Anbar \nProvince right now either. I think I would be heading to Afghanistan \nand Pakistan. That suggestion was basically dismissed in the briefings. \nWithin a few weeks, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated by al-Qaida, and we \nare seeing heightened activity in Afghanistan such as, less than a week \nago a suicide bombing at a dog fight near Kandahar, where more than 100 \npeople were killed by al-Qaida. That is what a strategic mousetrap is.\n  When you are going up against people who know what they are doing and \nwho are very dedicated to it, you get yourself bogged down in one spot \nwhere you can't get out, and then they have the maneuverability.\n  The second strategic mousetrap we can clearly see involves how we are \naddressing the rest of the world. In terms of our military posture, we \nhave burned out our military. We are not focusing properly on the \nstrategic issues facing us globally, particularly the situation that we \nface with an ever-evolving China, and the need to regrow our Navy. And \nour national economy is going into a tailspin.\n  When I look at this region, I see a region in chaos. We can talk \nabout whether you can go to the market in Baghdad. Wherever the U.S. \nmilitary has been sent, it has done its job historically. I had the \nhonor of serving in Vietnam. On the 20th anniversary of the fall of \nVietnam, the Communist government admitted that it lost 1.4 million \nsoldiers dead on the battlefield; this illusive guerilla force, 1.4 \nmillion soldiers dead. We did our job. That doesn't address the larger \nissues in which the military performs its job and doesn't address that \nissue in Iraq today either.\n  We are very proud of what our military has done. I am proud of my \nson. He served as an enlisted Infantry marine in Ramadi in some of the \nworst fighting. But this region is in turmoil from Lebanon to Pakistan. \nAnyone who has been involved in these issues intimately understands \nthat. People are betting against us, not in terms of our military \noperations but as a leading nation.\n  When we were preparing to go into Iraq, it cost $24 for a barrel of \noil. Yesterday the market closed above $101 for\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\na barrel of oil. When we were getting ready to go into Iraq, as I \nrecall, gold was less than $300 an ounce. It is up almost at $1,000 an \nounce today. The dollar is in jeopardy. Our budgets are in deficits. \nOur infrastructure is diminishing to the point that we have to worry \nabout whether we can be a leading nation in terms of technology, the \nsorts of things that have always made us great--roads, bridges. All of \nthese issues do tie together. Even when we start arguing about how this \nsurge has affected the conditions inside Iraq, if we are going to be \nhonest, if we are going to look at the situation as it really is rather \nthan simply as one political side or another wants to make it, we have \na lot going on in Iraq, a lot of moving pieces that don't exactly add \nup to the possibility of great success in the near term.\n  I have heard people from General Petraeus to people on the other side \ntalk about how the surge is responsible for the period of decreased \nactivity in Al Anbar, around Ramadi. That began before the surge was \nannounced. There were two reasons for that. One, al-Qaida overplayed \nits hand there. The Sunnis made a deal with our side. The Sunni \ninsurgency made a deal with our side and they hated al-Qaida more than \nthey hate us. We don't know how long this is going to last. They don't \nlike an occupying force.\n  The second is, al-Qaida is pretty smart. They are fluid. They are \nmobile while we are tied down. If you go up to the Kurdish areas, which \nhave been sort of the bulwark of our strength in terms of relations, we \nsee that the Turkish parliament has approved military activity by their \nmilitary inside Iraq. They have begun an incursion more than a week ago \nwhere they have been operating inside northern Iraq. Imagine what the \nother side would be saying right now if the Iranians were conducting \nmilitary activities inside Iraq. We have a region that has been filled \nwith chaos from refugees, external refugees, internal refugees, by some \naccounts more than 30 percent of pre-Iraq war population refugees, \neither outside the country, heavily burdening Syria--by the way, more \nthan a million refugees in Syria--but also inside. Eighty percent of \nthose internal refugees in Iraq right now are women and children.\n\n  We need to be able to address this honestly, and we need to be able \nto agree that the way out of this isn't simply through the performance \nof our military. It is that we need national leadership that will put a \nformula together so that we can remove our military. There is no true \nstrategy if you cannot articulate an end point. When you look at it, \none of the things I keep going back to is what General Dwight \nEisenhower said in the dark days of the Korean war when we were stuck \nin a stalemate, when he was thinking about running for President and \nthen running for President. One might compare this with comments we \nhear from the present administration. He said:\n\n       [The Korean War] was never inevitable, it was never \n     inescapable. . . . When the enemy struck, on that June day of \n     1950, what did America do? It did what it always has done in \n     all its times of peril. It appealed to the heroism of its \n     youth. . . . The answer to that appeal has been what any \n     American knew it would be. It has been sheer valor on all the \n     Korean mountainsides that, each day, bear fresh scars of new \n     graves. Now--in this anxious autumn--from these heroic men \n     there comes back an answering appeal. It is no whine, no \n     whimpering plea. It is a question that addresses itself to \n     simple reason. It asks: Where do we go from here? When comes \n     the end? Is there an end? These questions touch all of us. \n     They demand truthful answers. Neither glib promises nor glib \n     excuses will serve. They would be no better than the glib \n     prophecies that brought us to this pass. . . . The first task \n     of a new Administration will be to review and re-examine \n     every course of action open to us with one goal in view: To \n     bring the Korean War to an early and honorable end.\n\n  I suggest that is the prospect that faces all of us. On what do we \nneed to be focusing? I agree, by the way, that this is not something \nthat is going to get us very far in the next couple of days, other than \nto air our concerns. We need to be getting a GI bill for the people who \nhave been serving since 9/11. I would invite people from the other side \nof the aisle to support this. We keep calling these people the next \ngreatest generation. They deserve a GI bill at the same level of those \nwho served during World War II when they got all tuition paid for, \nbooks bought for them, and a monthly stipend. I introduced that bill my \nfirst day as a Senator last year. We have more than 30 cosponsors. \nLet's come together. Let's make that happen. Let's give these people \nthe first-class future they deserve.\n  We need to focus on the agreement that is now being negotiated \nbetween this administration and the Maliki government, where they are \nsaying they will consult with the Congress. This type of long-term \nagreement, going into security issues, is, in fact, a treaty, no matter \nwhat we call it. It is a treaty that they are negotiating, and we in \nthe Senate should advise and consent on that. We need to focus on the \nwartime contracting commission that just became law where we can root \nout fraud, waste, and abuse, the billions of dollars of no-bid and \ninstant contracts that were put into Iraq from 2003 forward. In other \nwords, let's create the environment where we can get the right kind of \ndiplomatic solution and remove our combat troops from Iraq. Let's focus \non the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                             Budget Issues\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I recognize that much of the debate the \npast 2 days has been about our status in Iraq and what we should be \ndoing in Iraq relative to the two proposals offered by Senator \nFeingold. Clearly, the issue of how we fight terrorism and how we \nconfront the threat of Islamic fundamentalism and its avowed purpose of \ndestroying Western culture and specifically targeting America and \nAmericans is probably the overriding issue we must address. But right \nbehind that issue is the question of what type of nation are we going \nto pass on to our children relative to the fiscal strength of our \nNation. We confront an issue there which is as significant for the \nprosperity of our children as the issue of terrorism is relative to the \nsecurity of our country.\n  We are faced with a situation where, as a result of the pending \nretirement of the baby boom generation, three specific programs--\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--will grow at such exponential \nrates that they will essentially bankrupt our Nation if we don't do \nsomething.\n  This chart reflects those three programs, the red line here, and \ntheir rate of growth. This black line reflects what has historically \nbeen the amount of money the Federal Government has spent. The Federal \nGovernment has historically spent about 20 percent of the gross \nnational product of America. These three programs alone, by the year \n2025, 2028--it varies depending on who you talk to--will cost 20 \npercent of the gross national product. Trying to put this in \nperspective, by the year 2030, when the baby boom generation is fully \nretired and is receiving its benefits, the cost of supporting that \ngeneration through Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will be so \nhigh that if you put it in the context of what we traditionally spend \nin this Government, we will have no money available to do anything else \nas a government. We will have no money for national defense, no money \nfor education, no money for laying out roads, no money for \nenvironmental protection.\n\n  It does not stop there, because the costs incurred continue to go up. \nThey continue to go up at such a rate that by about the year 2035, we \nwill essentially have a situation where approximately 28 percent or \nmore of the gross national product would have to be spent to support \nthese three programs.\n  Then, of course, you have the additional obligations of Government. \nWhat does that lead to? Well, if that were allowed to occur, it would \nlead to a situation where our children and our children's children \nwould be paying so much in taxes to support the costs of maintaining \nthese three programs for my generation--the baby boom generation--that \nour children would essentially have no opportunity to send their \nchildren to college, to buy their first home, to live the prosperous \nand fulfilling lifestyle we have today in America because all those \ndiscretionary dollars would be absorbed through taxes to support these \nprograms.\n  To put it in a different context, with numbers which are almost \nincomprehensible but which need to be pointed out, we are told by the \nComptroller\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\nGeneral's Office that the unfunded liability of Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security is $66 trillion. That means after you figure in all the \nmoney you pay for Social Security taxes, and all the money you pay for \nhealth insurance taxes, the HI tax, the Medicare taxes--after you \nfigure in all that money, there is still a responsibility, an \nobligation on the books that is not paid for. That amounts to $66 \ntrillion--trillion with a ``T.''\n  Now, $1 trillion is almost an incomprehensible term, so to try to \nmake it a little more comprehensible, if you took all the money paid in \ntaxes since our country was formed, since we began, that is $42 \ntrillion. That is all the money that has been paid in taxes. We have a \nliability on the books that exceeds all the money paid in taxes \nthroughout the history of our Nation.\n  To put it in another context, if you take all the assets of America--\neveryone's home, everybody's car, all your stocks, all your small \nbusinesses--and you add them up--everybody's net worth--that amounts to \n$59 trillion.\n  So we have a debt on the books that exceeds our net worth as a \nnation. That is called bankruptcy, and that is what we are headed \ntoward unless we address this issue.\n  This week, the administration, under a direction from the Congress, \nsent up a proposal to try to address the biggest part of this problem, \nwhich is the cost of Medicare.\n  When we passed the Part D drug benefit for seniors, there was \nlanguage put in that bill--remember that bill was passed with a strong \nbipartisan vote--that said if Medicare started to have its financial \nresources--its support, the dollars that paid for Medicare--come out of \nthe general fund at a rate that exceeded 45 percent of the overall cost \nof Medicare, then the trustees--if that was projected to occur for 2 \nyears over a 7-year period--the trustees were directed to direct the \nPresident to make a proposal to bring the cost of Medicare back under \ncontrol. It is called a trigger. That is what it is referred to.\n  Why did we put that in or why was that language put in? It was put in \nbecause Medicare was always conceived to be an insurance program, even \nthough it gets a fair amount of support out of the general fund, the \ngeneral fund being general taxes. Everybody pays their taxes: income \ntaxes, corporate taxes. Those taxes are used to operate the Government \ngenerally: to pay the defense budget, to pay the education budget, to \npay the environmental agency--to pay the different activities the \nGovernment undertakes. That is the general fund. Those funds were not \nsupposed to be the funds that supported health insurance for seniors.\n  Medicare was supposed to be an insurance program, as is Social \nSecurity, where the funds are collected from people, working under the \nHI tax, which you pay, which is withheld. Those funds are what are \nsupposed to support Medicare.\n  If you start taking money out of the general fund, it is generally \nacknowledged--not through too many ``generals,'' but it is generally \nacknowledged you are basically creating an income transfer event, a \nredistribution of wealth event, where you are taking money from \nbasically the general operation of the Government and you are putting \nit into the support of people on Medicare who are retired. That was \nnever the goal of Medicare.\n  So recognizing that, but also recognizing that a brandnew benefit was \nbeing put on the books that was fairly significant--the drug benefit--\nit was decided to put in place this law that said we want to keep \nMedicare primarily as an insurance event rather than an event which \nbasically is unsupported, a cost that is basically supported by the \ngeneral taxpayers of America who need to support the regular operations \nof the Government: defense, education, things such as that. So this \ntrigger was put in.\n  Well, we have now had the trustees evaluate the Medicare fund, and \nthey have concluded that in the 7-year window, under present projected \nspending patterns, Medicare's support--the dollars necessary to support \nMedicare--will require a call on the general fund that will exceed 45 \npercent of the general expenditures of Medicare.\n  That is a serious issue, and it goes to the larger serious issue of \nthis unfunded liability question, because Medicare makes up $34 \ntrillion of the unfunded liability. Do you remember the prior chart, \nwhere I pointed out there is $66 trillion of unfunded liability? Well, \nof that $66 trillion, the majority of it is the obligations under \nMedicare. So it is Medicare spending that is driving the problem which \nwe confront, which is pointed out in this chart, which is that we are \nheaded toward a government that our children cannot afford and which \nwill bankrupt our children unless we do something.\n  So this proposal that was put into the Part D drug law, in which the \ntrustees direct the President essentially to propose changes in \nMedicare spending, which will allow us to make the Medicare Program \naffordable and continue it to be an insurance program, is a step, and a \nfairly significant step, if followed correctly, down the road toward \nreducing this outyear threat of a fiscal meltdown.\n  It is critical we heed the law we passed and, specifically, the \nstatement and the execution of the statement that has been made by the \nMedicare trustees that the trigger must be exercised. And the \nadministration has the obligation to set up a way to accomplish these \nsavings.\n  Now, under the law, the administration sends up its proposal, which \nit has done, which proposal is required to bring the Medicare system \nback into balance, so it is not taking more than 45 percent of the \ngeneral fund. That bill is then required to be introduced by the \nmajority and the minority on the House side and Senate side. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee has introduced a bill, I believe last \nnight, with myself as ranking member of the Budget Committee as the \nprimary sponsor on our side. That does not mean it is agreed to. It \nmeans that under the law it has to be introduced.\n\n  I happen to think what the administration has sent up makes sense. \nBut what cannot be denied is that this problem is very real. I was \nextremely surprised, for example, to hear Senator Kennedy say: The \nproposal sent up by the administration is dead on arrival, and the \nadministration has trumped up a phony crisis in Medicare.\n  You tell me how $66 trillion of unfunded liability is a phony crisis \nin Medicare. The Medicare trustees, who have a fiduciary \nresponsibility, the highest standard we have under law to protect the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund, tell us the law is being violated \nand that changes must occur. You tell me that is a phony crisis.\n  What is unfortunate is this ``bury the head in the sand'' approach \nthat is being taken by the majority party, as reflected by Senator \nKennedy, in facing this issue. This issue must be faced. We need to \nact.\n  Now, what has the administration suggested we do? They have suggested \nthree basics in order to bring this in line.\n  First--and I cannot understand why anybody opposes this proposal--\nthey have suggested that under Part D, which is, again, the drug \nbenefit, people pay a portion of the premium of the cost of the drug \nbenefit. But high-income people pay a very small portion of the cost of \nthe drug benefit compared to what they can afford to pay. They pay \nabout 25 percent of the cost of the premium of the Part D drug benefit.\n  Somebody such as Warren Buffett, who qualifies for the Part D \nbenefit--I am not picking on him specifically, but he is a national \nfigure of some note, and he obviously has a fair amount of assets--his \npremium under Part D, in order to purchase drugs, is being subsidized \nby John and Mary Jones, who work in a restaurant in Nashua, NH, or by \nBill and Susan Parker, who work in a gas station in Epping, NH. Their \ntaxes are actually subsidizing Warren Buffett's drug insurance, his \nability to buy drugs, which is totally wrong.\n  What the administration has suggested is that people, individuals who \nhave incomes over $80,000, and joint taxpayers who have incomes over \n$160,000, or approximately that amount--fairly wealthy people by \nAmerican standards--should pay more than 25 percent of the cost of \ntheir drug premium. I think they have suggested they pay 50 percent or \nmaybe 60 percent but not the entire premium. They are still going to be \nsubsidized by John and Mary Jones who are probably making a lot less \nthan $160,000 working at a restaurant in Nashua, NH.\n  That is their first proposal.\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\n  The second proposal they put forward is that we should have an IT \nproposal, something that basically means using technology to \ncommunicate more effectively the costs of health care, to create a more \nintegrated system where you could get more effective information on \nwhat health care costs in order to drive better purchasing practices. \nWe all know that is going to significantly improve the delivery of \nMedicare and all health care, if we do this. It is something that \nshould be done and, therefore, is appropriate.\n  The third thing they have suggested is that we limit basically \nfrivolous lawsuits that are driving up the cost of health care and \nactually driving some doctors in the area of OB/GYN--baby doctors--out \nof the practice, that we essentially adopt what is known as the \nCalifornia Plan for medical liability insurance--again, a very rational \napproach.\n  None of the ideas the administration has put forward are radical. \nNone of them are even targeted in a way that would significantly affect \nvery many beneficiaries. In fact, as to the entire proposal they put on \nthe table, 94 percent of Medicare beneficiaries would not be affected \nby any of these proposals--94 percent. Only 6 percent; that is, the \nwealthiest 6 percent, those people with incomes over $80,000 \nindividually or $160,000 jointly. Those folks having to pay a portion \nof their Part D premium would be impacted, and they should be impacted.\n  So that proposal has been put forward.\n  Three ideas--all of them reasonable, all of them initiatives which we \nshould be able to accomplish, and which would, if undertaken, actually \nreduce this insolvency in Medicare dramatically. I think the estimates \nare that over the 75-year life, you might take as much as $8 billion \nout of this insolvency number if you did these proposals which the \nadministration is suggesting. That is a huge number over 75 years. It \nwould actually be a major step in the right direction. But, more \nimportantly, it would respond to what the law says we should do. So I \ncertainly hope we are not going to sit on our hands.\n  I see the chairman of the Finance Committee is in the Chamber. He \nsays he is going to act. I hope his colleagues will follow him, because \nthat is the type of leadership we need.\n  Now, the administration's three proposals aren't the beginning and \nthe end of the process. Anything can be on the table to try to get this \nresolved. But the fact is, we need to resolve it. The trigger has been \npulled. We are over the 45 percent or we are projected to be going over \nthe 45 percent. We need to act not only because of that but because of, \nmore importantly, this outyear problem. We have no right as \npolicymakers to pass our generation's problem on to our children, which \nis exactly what we are going to do if we don't act. Our generation is \nthe one that is creating the issue because of the demands we are going \nto put on the system because we are such a large generation. We are in \nthe position of making Government change, and we should address this. \nWe should take that action, and I certainly hope we can over the next \nfew weeks.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \nhis comments and for pointing out the budget expenditures and exposure \ndown the road. The only point I wish to make about his presentation is \nthat the increase in entitlements is not so much because of Social \nSecurity--that is not the big problem for the next 15 or 20 years. \nRather, it is the increases in Medicare and Medicaid that are going to \nbe very expensive for us to accommodate. The real question is, What is \nthe solution? We know what the problem is. The question is, What is the \nsolution?\n  It is interesting that Peter Orszag of the Congressional Budget \nOffice printed a report just about a month ago saying that the rise in \nthe number of baby boomers is part of the problem, but that is not the \nbig problem. The main reason that Medicare is going up at such a rapid \nrate and that Medicaid is also going up at a significant rate is \nbecause health care costs in this country are rising at such a rapid \nrate. So I think it is important to address not just the symptoms; that \nis, the wacky Medicare, but it is much more important to look at the \ndirect causes or what is causing these increases.\n  Our country today spends about $2 trillion on health care--about $2 \ntrillion. About half of that is in the public sector and half in the \nprivate sector. The projections of the Congressional Budget Office, a \nnonpartisan organization, are that private health care costs are going \nto increase very significantly over the next 20 years and Medicaid \ncosts are going to also increase significantly but, for Medicare, much \nmore. The rate of increase in the private sector will be a little less \nbecause the private sector tends to control costs a little better. For \nMedicaid, the rate of growth will be not quite as high as Medicare \ngrowth because States pay for part of the Medicaid costs and States are \ngoing to get a little more control of their State budgets.\n  The real problem is the increase in health care costs. We in America \nspend twice as much per capita on health care costs than the next most \nexpensive country, and I don't know that we are twice as healthy as the \nnext most expensive country. We have great health care in America. Our \ntechnology is the envy of the world. Our drugs are the envy of the \nworld. But we have a system which basically is unnecessarily expensive \nand is going to cause us to be anticompetitive in future years.\n  I was in Bangalore, India, not long ago. I brought about 15 or 20 \nMontanans. It was a trade trip partly to China and also to India. We \nwent to the John F. Welch Technology Center, which is one of General \nElectric's three technology centers in the world. Kind of ``gee whiz'' \nstuff, kind of interesting. During the tour, I walked up to the \nmanager. He was the only non-Indian there. He is a German, Argentine \nhis background.\n  I walked up to him, and I said: Why are you here in India? Why are \nyou here, right here? Why is your research facility here?\n  He said: Greatest talent pool.\n  I said: Well, what country has the next greatest talent pool?\n  China, he said.\n  I asked: Where are we as Americans?\n  He said: You are kind of down here.\n  What does it take, I asked, to get us up there?\n  He looked at me without skipping a beat, and he looked me straight in \nthe eye, and he said: Education and health care. He says: You have to \neducate your people a lot better than you are. Second, you have a \nhealth care system that is making you anticompetitive, you Americans.\n  It is true, our health care costs are so much higher than the costs \nof companies in other countries. About 18 percent of our total health \ncare costs are administrative; in other countries, it is about 4 or 5 \npercent. There are a lot of ways to get at this problem. The real \nquestion is, What is a solution? How do we get health care costs more \nunder control?\n  I daresay that whoever is elected President is going to be forced to \nand should be and will have an opportunity to make a major health care \nproposal to our country. We on the Finance Committee are starting to \nhold a lot of hearings on health care. There are a lot of provocative \nquestions. We need to not be flat-footed, and we need to work in tandem \nwith whoever is elected President so we can begin to address two main \npoints. One is coverage. We are the only industrialized country in the \nworld where people don't have health insurance that is not universal \ncoverage. We need to have that. Second is to address costs. We need to \nfigure out how we can get a handle on the excessive increase of health \ncare costs in our country.\n  I commend my friend from New Hampshire for raising the problem, but \nthe real question is, What is the solution? The President's letter is \nnot even a glancing blow to solutions; it kind of touches on some \npossible solutions. It is critical for us to address the underlying \nquestions. What are the underlying causes of increased health care \ncosts? I don't have the time here to go\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\ninto all of what I think we need to look at and will be focusing on in \nthe Finance Committee, but that is a major challenge we face as a \ncountry, and it is a great opportunity for all of us to dig deep and \nhelp to solve this problem so Americans can be proud of the country we \nhave, with universal coverage, and also get a handle on excessive \ncosts.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n462 are printed in today's Record under ``Submited Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to use about 10 minutes or \nso, if I may, to discuss what I think is an important topic for the \ncountry. The Senate has allowed itself to discuss progress in Iraq--or \nthe lack thereof, depending on how you view these things--and to \ndiscuss a measure proposed by my good friend, Senator Russ Feingold, \nthat would require us to withdraw troops, I think within a 120-day \nperiod, leaving troops behind in a very limited role and basically \ntelling the world and our enemies we are leaving Iraq, and the people \nleft behind would have a very limited function in terms of what they \ncould do--a complete change in strategy. It would be saying to the \nPetraeus strategy: It failed, it didn't work, and we are going to \nreplace the Petraeus strategy with the Feingold strategy.\n  Now, as much as I admire Senator Feingold--and that is a great deal, \nto be honest with my colleagues, because he takes his job very \nseriously, as do the rest of us, but he is willing to do and say things \nvery few people will do or say, and I think that makes the country a \nbetter place. Sometimes I disagree with him. This is an occasion where \nI find the Feingold strategy replacing the Petraeus strategy would be a \ndisaster for the country, the region, and our national security \ninterests, and I say that with all due respect.\n  Now, one of the central theses of Senator Feingold and others who \nsupport this measure is that Iraq is a side venture, not part of the \nwar on terror, and our presence there is making us less secure, not \nmore, and that we have taken our eye off the ball. I would argue that \nthe enemy doesn't see it that way. It is my belief and contention, and \nhas been for a very long time, that Iraq has become the central \nbattlefront in the war on terror. That happened when al-Qaida decided \nto go into Iraq after the fall of Baghdad and undermine this attempt at \nmoderation in Iraq, tried to drive us out, and a year ago this time, I \nwas worried that they were going to succeed.\n  For about 3, 3\\1/2\\ years, we got it wrong in Iraq. We didn't have \nenough troops. We had a training model that was not delivering quality \nin numbers in terms of the Iraqi Army. The insurgency was thriving. \nThere was a lawless period. You had the Abu Ghraib episode that allowed \nal-Qaida to go on a recruiting drive all throughout the Mideast.\n  Thank God we changed strategy this time last year. I wish to \ncompliment the President, and all of those--particularly Senator \nMcCain--who spoke loudly and clearly that we needed to change strategy. \nIt wasn't a debate about changing in Iraq. Everybody wanted a change. \nSome wanted to just leave and worry about the consequences later. \nSenator McCain and others said: No, we need not only to stay, we need \nto put more troops on the ground and come up with a way to suppress \nthis insurgency because without security there will never be \nreconciliation. I think the results are in, and they are overwhelming, \nand they exceed all expectations I had in terms of success for the \nsurge.\n  But to the central point: If you believe, as I do, that this is one \nbattle, the central battle in regard to a global struggle, not an \nisolated event, it is a battle you can't afford to lose. If Iraq fell \napart, broke into three parts, became a chaotic state, the national \nsecurity implications for our Nation are enormous.\n  They start with the following: Al-Qaida would be on every street \ncorner in the Mideast saying that we beat America and ran them out of \nIraq. What would that do in terms of a chilling effect on moderation in \nthe region? Who would be the next group of moderates to stand up and \nsay: Come help me fight against extremism, America, after our behavior \nof leaving Iraq, and those who helped us to try to make Iraq a better \nplace, a new place? They would surely get killed. If we left Iraq, \nwithdrew, gave the battle space in Anbar to al-Qaida totally, they \nwould have killed everybody who tried to help us, and it would have \ntaken decades to get over the consequences of that mistake. You cannot \nleave people behind to be slaughtered by terrorists and expect to ever \nwin this war.\n  Here is what bin Laden said in 2002 about Iraq:\n\n       I now address my speech to the whole of the Islamic Nation. \n     Listen and understand. The most important and serious issue \n     today for the whole world is the Third World War. It is \n     raging in the land of the two rivers. The world's millstone \n     and pillar is Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.\n\n  Bin Laden did not get the memo that Iraq is not about a global \nstruggle. Clearly, from his point of view, it is the defining battle in \nterms of his goals and ambition for the al-Qaida movement. The reason \nal-Qaida came into Iraq was to make sure we would lose, that moderation \nwould fail. Their worst nightmare is for a mother to have a say about \nher children, and if we can pull this off in Iraq, where the different \ngroups--the Sunnis, the Shias, and the Kurds--can live together under \nthe rule of law, have a central government and local governments that \nwork together and allow people to raise their children without fear and \nprosper together and a woman has a say about her children, that is an \nabsolute nightmare for al-Qaida. They see the outcome in Iraq as very \nimportant to their agenda. I hope we are smart enough to see the \noutcome in Iraq in terms of our own national security because I have \nsaid a thousand times, you cannot kill the terrorists and win this war. \nKilling terrorists is a part of this war. The war is an ideological \nstruggle. The high ground in this war is the moral high ground. That is \nwhy Abu Ghraib hurt so badly. That is why we have to, at every turn, \nshowcase our values as being different from our enemy's. When we \ncapture an al-Qaida operative, it becomes about us. The rules we employ \nin the capture of an al-Qaida member or any other terrorist showcases \nwho we are, and we cannot use as an excuse they do terrible things and \nthey don't believe the same things we do; therefore, we are going to \nthrow the rules out and be like them. That is the one way to lose this \nwar.\n  I am proud of my Nation standing by moderation in Iraq. I am sorry to \nthe American people and all those who have gone to Iraq many times that \nwe got it wrong so long. But wars are that way. The model we had after \nthe fall of Baghdad allowed the enemy to grow and become stronger, and \nit made it difficult to reconcile the country, which is in our national \ninterest.\n  A year ago about this time, a new general took over with a new \nstrategy: 30,000 troops were interjected into the battle space. But it \nis not about 30,000 troops. This general understood how to win. We took \nthe troops out from behind the walls, and they started living with the \nIraqi Army and police forces in neighborhoods. We took each \nneighborhood block by block, securing people in a way where they felt \ncomfortable enough to talk to us about their future, about their hopes, \nand about their dreams, and over time they helped us.\n  This infusion of military might into Anbar, where al-Qaida was \nroaming freely, allowed people who tasted the al-Qaida life to say: I \ndon't want to live this way. The Sunni awakening was an effort by a \nvery brave sheik, who is now dead, to break loose from the al-Qaida \nagenda and come to the American and coalition forces and say: I would \nlike to align with you because this is not the way I want to raise my \nkids, these are not the hopes and dreams I have for my people in Anbar.\n  They killed him, and if you go to Anbar, there are photos of this guy \neverywhere. They killed him, but they did not kill his idea. As a \nmatter of fact, at his funeral and thereafter, the people of Anbar have \nupheld this sheik as a model of the future, as a hero. Al-Qaida \noverplayed their hand. They tried to intimidate everybody around them. \nThey are trying to intimidate us: Do it my way or die. Do it my way or \nwatch your children die in front of you. Do it my way or we will burn \nyour children right in front of you. Live my way religiously or lose \neverything you have, including your life.\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\n  You know what, the good news from the surge, beyond all other news, \nis that a Muslim population had a chance to experience this al-Qaida \nlife and said no. That, to me, is the single most important event that \nhas happened in the last year, that Muslims would turn on al-Qaida and \nfight them and say: You are wrong; this is not what the Koran teaches, \nthis is not the way we are going to live our lives. And they have done \nsomething about it.\n  The sheik has given his life. Many others in Anbar have given their \nlives to make sure al-Qaida does not win. Al-Qaida lost in Anbar \nbecause we had enough military presence, along with a new attitude of \nthe people who live there, to beat these guys. They are not 10 feet \ntall. They are thugs, and history is full of people such as this who \nhave had ideas that certain groups are not worthy of living. The Nazis \nhad their view of who could live and who would die, and it was based on \nracial stereotyping, prejudice. There have been other episodes in \nhistory where religious bigotry determined who lived or died.\n  The way you beat these people is not for the good people to come home \nand leave the battlefield to the enemy; it is for the good people to \nrally around the values that make this place worth living and fight \nthese people. The way you win this war is you align yourself with \npeople willing to take on the terrorists and extremists and fight back \nagainst al-Qaida, and that is what General Petraeus did. When the \nawakening occurred in Anbar, we put tanks around every leader we could \nfind and told them: We are not leaving; we are here with you.\n  The Sons of Iraq is an organization that sprung up from the \npopulation, where almost 80,000 people now belong to this organization \nwhere they patrol the streets at night to make sure al-Qaida does not \ncome back. Anbar is a completely different place. Al-Qaida has been \ndiminished and defeated in Anbar, and they are moving to other places \nin Iraq. They are not defeated yet, but they are certainly on the run.\n  For America not to appreciate what has happened here, for this \nCongress not to celebrate what has happened in the last year I think is \nsad. We should be using this 30 hours to say to General Petraeus, thank \nyou; to Ambassador Crocker, thank you; to all those under your command, \nthank you for having the courage and the wisdom to turn this around, \nand we acknowledge that you are turning it around. We know you have a \nlong way to go yet, but thank God you have turned the corner, and we \nhave turned the corner. And the corner I wanted to see turned was when \nthe people of Iraq would stand up to the extremists and fight back with \nour help.\n  GEN David Petraeus said in May of 2007:\n\n       Iraq is, in fact, the central front in al Qaeda's global \n     campaign.\n\n  GEN Michael Hayden, Director of the CIA, said in January 2007:\n\n       I strongly believe [that U.S. failure in Iraq] would lead \n     to al Qaeda with what it is they said is their goal there, \n     which is the foundations of the caliphate, and in operational \n     terms for us, a safe haven from which to plan and conduct \n     attacks against the West.\n\n  It is clear to me Iraq is a central battlefront. It is clear to me \nabout 3 years we were losing. It is abundantly clear to me now that we \nare winning. The Iraqi people have stepped to the plate and produced \nresults that are astonishing, and it has come from a new strategy that \nhas produced better security.\n  The monthly attack levels have been decreased by 60 percent since \nJune of 2007. How did that happen? This new strategy of General \nPetraeus of getting military power out into neighborhoods, staying on \nthe insurgency, giving them no rest, emboldening the citizens to fight \nback has paid great dividends. It is still a dangerous place but what a \ndramatic change: a 75-percent drop in civilian deaths since the \nbeginning of 2006. From January to December, sectarian attacks and \ndeaths have decreased over 90 percent in the Baghdad security district. \nHow did that happen? We had a plan to secure the capital city by \ngetting out from behind walls, going into neighborhoods, providing \nfirepower and assistance, and the Iraqi people have done their part.\n  Coalition forces cleared approximately 6,956 weapon caches in 2007, \nover twice what we found in 2006. How? People are telling us where the \nweapons are because they want a new country. They see us as a solution \nto their problems, not the problem, and they are coming forward telling \nus things they did not tell us last year because they have sensed \nmomentum, they feel as if they are safer and they don't want to go back \nto the old ways and they are helping us help them.\n  Iraqi security forces in the last year are responsible for security \nin 10 of the 18 Iraqi provinces. One of the biggest stories in this \nyear has been the improvement of the Iraqi security forces, \nparticularly the army. The national police have been a real problem. \nEven they are beginning to turn around. There are 100,000 new members \nof the Iraqi security forces, many of them being able to operate \nindependently from us, for a total of a half a million people in \nuniform.\n  The Iraqi people have stepped to the plate. They are helping \nthemselves in a way I admire. The casualty rate among Iraqis is three \ntimes that of our American and coalition forces. Every American death \nwe mourn, but the reenlistment rates among American soldiers, military \nmembers who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, is through the roof. \nWhat do they see that we don't? Why do they go back so many times? I \nknow what I hear. I hear overwhelmingly: Senator Graham, I want to get \nthis right so my kids don't come. I hear from the soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines: If we win here, it makes us safer at home. It is \nhard, it is tough, it is difficult, and they keep going back because \nthey know the outcome in Iraq affects us at home. And God bless them \nfor doing it.\n  One brief statement: Well done. You have exceeded every expectation I \nhave had. You have done a marvelous job. You performed your mission \nbeyond any measure. You are involved in the most successful \ncounterinsurgency in military history. All those who have taken part \nwill go down in military history. We should be celebrating as a nation \nwhat I think is one of the biggest military achievements in the history \nof the world. But we cannot quite do that. I don't know why.\n  Al-Qaida is diminished but not defeated, but they are on their way to \nbeing defeated.\n  The big debate has been, what will make the Iraqi politicians get \ntheir act together. If we threaten to leave them there, they will start \ndoing business in a better way. I have always felt that if you threaten \nto leave Iraq, every moderate will be chilled and every extremist will \nbe emboldened. If you want to bring back life to a diminished enemy, \nlet them read some headline somewhere in the world: ``America begins to \nwithdraw,'' as this Feingold resolution would suggest or as Senators \nObama and Clinton would have suggested. You would literally breathe \nlife into a defeated, diminished enemy. It would be music to their \nears. For every moderate who has sacrificed, lost family members as \njudges, as lawyers, as policemen, as army members, it would be \nheartbreaking.\n  I cannot believe people do not understand the consequences to the \nworld if the American Congress said: We are going to leave Iraq in a \nset period of time. I cannot believe we do not understand how that \nwould resonate throughout the world. It would be music to an enemy that \nis really on the run. It would rip the heart out of those who brought \nthis about. And you want political progress in Iraq to go forward? Tell \nal-Qaida we are going to leave and see what kind of progress we get in \nIraq.\n  The politicians in Baghdad have been frustrating to deal with, sort \nof similar to here at home. But you know what. I am here to say \nsomething I did not think I would say last year: Well done. The \ndebaathification law has passed. What does that mean? It means the \nShias and the Kurds have welcomed people back from the Sunni Baathist \nParty that ran the Government under Saddam to their old jobs, made them \neligible for their old government jobs, and they are saying to their \nSunni Baathist neighbors: Let's build a new Iraq; let's not look \nbackward.\n  Can you imagine how hard, I say to Senator Lieberman, that must have \nbeen, to have grown up in Iraq, and the people who ran the Government \nunder Saddam Hussein made their life miserable and you have a chance to \nbe on top; you can fire them all and make them miserable, and then \nsuddenly,\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\nafter a lot of dying, you realize: Wait a minute, we have to go \nforward, not backward. The debaathification law is a huge step toward \nreconciliation.\n  A $48 billion budget was passed.\n  Politicians in the Congress can relate to one thing: money. We are \nalways fighting to get our fair share for our State and our districts. \nThe $48 billion budget that was passed has money allocated to every \nregion of Iraq, and reconstruction can now go forward. And the \nministries delivering the money are better than they have ever been but \nwith a long way to go.\n  The fact that Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds would share the wealth of the \ncountry with each other seems to me to suggest that they view Iraq as a \ncountry. And to give money to someone who may have been involved in \ntrying to kill your family just months ago is very difficult to do. But \nthey have overcome, I think in great measure, the biggest impediment \nthat every country eventually has to overcome--and that is forgiveness. \nThere is a long way to go in Iraq, but we are a lot closer to getting \nthere than we were last year. And the only way we are going to lose is \nfor Washington to screw it up.\n  The provincial powers law, it passed the Parliament and went to the \nCouncil of Presidents. It will allow local elections in every province \nbeginning in October. And I predict if that law becomes reality, Sunnis \nwill vote in large numbers, and they boycotted in 2005.\n  The central government run by the Shias came to the conclusion that \nwe are going to decentralize power; we are going to let each province \nelect their local leaders, instead of trying to micromanage everything \nfrom Baghdad. You know what that means? Democracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator is advised by the \nChair that there is a preceding order to recess at 12:30.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To be continued. I yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with the indulgence of the Chair, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business on another subject \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I have 2 minutes to finish my thoughts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The provincial election law was vetoed by Abdul Mahdi, a \nShia Vice President, over the issue of whether governors elected to the \nprovince can be replaced by a majority vote in the Parliament. That is \ngoing to their Supreme Court. It is a unique and novel issue, and, to \nme, it gives great hope because they are resorting to the law rather \nthan the gun. It is constitutional democracy playing out in front of \nus. It is something we should celebrate.\n  Amnesty: There are thousands of people in the jails of Iraq now, \nmostly Sunnis, who have been tied to the insurgency. The Parliament \npassed a law that will allow a community of Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds to \ngo through the files of the people in jail and say to some of those who \nhave taken up arms against the Government: Go home, my brother, and let \nus build a new Iraq. That is a stunning development.\n  Now, how did all this happen? Iraq is war weary. People are tired of \nliving in fear. We have given them better security; we put al-Qaida on \nthe run, which has been trying to stir up trouble ever since Baghdad \nfailed; and people have a sense of economic and political hope they \nhave never had before. Oil revenues are up, have doubled. Oil \nproduction is up 50 percent. The economy is moving forward at a very \nfast pace. All of this is due, in my opinion, to resolve, to the surge, \nto the bravery of the Iraqi people and the American military and \ncoalition forces who brought it about.\n  To my friends and colleagues in Congress: We are going to win in \nIraq. Finally, we have a model that will lead us to a stable and \nfunctioning government rejecting terrorism and aligning with us in the \nwar on terror. And the only way we will lose now is for Washington to \nlose its will and undercut this model. I hope we understand what this \ndebate is about. It is about winning and losing a battle that we can't \nafford to lose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Again, I thank the Presiding Officer for staying in \nthe chair for a period of 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1234-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1234-S1235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, JR.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this morning we learned of the death of \nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr. I wanted to come to the floor and reminisce a \nbit about Bill Buckley, whom I have been privileged to know for more \nthan 40 years, and to pay tribute to a devoted and patriotic American, \na remarkably creative and eloquent man of letters, a person with an \nextraordinary sense of humor and a kind of spirit to him that infused \nanyone around him.\n  He was a person who believed in the power of ideas and loved the \nexchange of ideas. He lived a remarkable life, with great effect for \nthis country that he loved, and a tremendous impact on people who read \nhis novels, his books, and his columns in the National Review, or \nwatched him for so many years on that wonderfully thoughtful, cerebral, \nprovocative TV program ``Firing Line,'' which was open not just to \nconservatives such as Bill Buckley, but to people with all shades of \nopinion who were willing to engage him--Bill Buckley, WFB--on the field \nof ideas. A remarkable man.\n  I was privileged to get to know him more than 40 years ago when I \nbecame the editor--at Yale, of course, editor wasn't a good enough \ntitle. I was called the chairman of the board of the Yale Daily News. \nAnd there was a gentleman at the Yale Daily News named Francis \nDonahue--Tackie Donahue--and he had been there forever as the permanent \nbusiness manager. I remember the day after I was chosen, he told me he \nhad informed Bill Buckley of this in one of his regular memos back and \nforth to Buckley. I was fascinated by this and began a communication \nwith Bill Buckley at that time, and he took a wonderfully warm, kind of \nbrotherly interest in those who were at the Yale Daily News, as he had \nbeen in the early 1950s. He invited me and a couple of our friends from \nthe news to come to his house in Stamford, CT, for a dinner or two, \nwhich were stimulating, thrilling evenings.\n  Our friendship went on, and I will come back to that, but Buckley's \nlife is an extraordinary life. He came out of Yale, became very well \nknown for a book he wrote about what he thought was the hostile \nenvironment at Yale toward people of faith, toward people who were \nconservative, et cetera, et cetera, ``God and Man at Yale.'' He went \nfrom that to starting the National Review in the mid-1950s. I believe \nit was 1955. I remember reading once that he had said in the founding \nissue that the publication would derive from original ideas of the \nmoral order.\n  Bill Buckley was a person who studied history, studied literature, \nlearned from it, and also was infused with a deep and profound \ncommitment to his Roman Catholic faith. That, I think, was the origin \nof the moral order which he gave expression to in all that he did in \nwriting for the National Review and speaking out and conducting himself \nas a provocative, loving American. He believed that ideas mattered, and \nthey did.\n  The National Review, in some sense, gave birth to the modern American \nconservative movement. But it wasn't always a Republican movement. His \nwas a matter of ideals and ideas and philosophy--conservatism. \nIncidentally, he rejected extremism. To his everlasting credit, he took \non the extremists of the John Birch Society, which wasn't popular for \nhim to do at the time he did it.\n\n  I am just remembering words of Buckley. He said he was a conservative \nideologically, not always favorable to Republican candidates. I \nremember reading about an editorial he wrote in the National Review \nendorsing General Eisenhower for President. While everyone else was \nechoing the slogan ``We Like Ike,'' Buckley's editorial said, ``We \nPrefer Ike.'' So it was a relative judgment that he made.\n  He was thrilled, of course, much more by the candidacy of a former \nMember of this body, a distinguished Member, Senator Barry Goldwater, \nand most of all by the candidacy of President Reagan. At one point, in \nthe mid-1960s, he ran for mayor of New York. And again as a kind of \njoyous, thought-\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\nprovoking, elegant, eloquent exercise in being involved in the \nmarketplace of public ideas, perhaps most famous, though perhaps not \nthe most substantive thing he said in that campaign, is when they asked \nwhat he would do when he was elected. Bill Buckley famously said: I \nwill demand a recount. And that is a good message for all of us when we \napproach campaigns.\n  Well, I continued to be involved with him in communication in many \nways. My wife and I had the privilege of spending wonderful evenings \nwith him and his late wife Patricia at their home in Stamford, CT. \nThese were classic evenings of great food, some drink, and good \nspirited conversations--cigar and brandy to follow--but always open to \nideas and always with a ready willingness to laugh. In fact, he passed \naway earlier today, apparently in his study in his magnificent home on \nWallace Point in Stamford, CT, probably working on a column or some \nother piece of writing.\n  I was particularly grateful to him for all that I learned from him, \nall the good times I had with him, and in some sense, you might say I \nwould not be a United States Senator were it not for Bill Buckley, \nalthough Buckley would not say that. When I ran for the Senate in 1988, \nlet's just say with the diplomacy that marks this Chamber that Bill \nBuckley was not a fan of the incumbent Republican Senator, and he \ncalled me up and said--I wish I could impersonate him--Joe, I'm \nthinking of endorsing you. Do you think that will help?\n  I said: Well, now, that's very good of you. Then he interrupted and \nsaid: Please understand this is the only time I am likely to endorse \nyour career. So I said that it probably would; what do you have in \nmind?\n  Well, he actually wrote a column, a very good column in the National \nReview, and I think in his syndicated column. He also, with the \npuckishness that was part of him, started something he called Buck PAC, \nwhich was, he said, a PAC open to anyone in Connecticut whose name was \nBuckley and who was committed to the defeat of the incumbent Senator at \nthat time. He printed bumper stickers and the like and helped out in \nthe campaign.\n  I said to him after I won that election--and I won it by very \nlittle--that I thought that in a close election--as the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate knows, there are so many reasons one is \nsuccessful--but I said: You have reason, Bill, to take part of the \ncredit. I won by less than 1 percent of the vote. And I said: You know, \nI would go so far as to say you played a rabbinical role for me in this \ncampaign.\n  Well, what do you mean by that? So I said: Your endorsement of me and \nthe columns you wrote said to Republicans in Connecticut who really \ndidn't like the incumbent Senator, it is kosher to vote for Lieberman. \nAnd he laughed. I remember that well.\n  There is so much I could say about his contribution to our country, \nto his openness to ideas, to his civility. One could disagree with Bill \nBuckley, as I did quite frequently, and never lose respect or \naffection, dare I say love, for a wonderful human being. We would all \nbenefit from that.\n  I perhaps would close this impromptu tribute to Bill Buckley, \nmourning his loss today, by offering condolences to his family: Chris \nBuckley, his son, who is a wonderful writer and confuses me as well as \nothers with the multisyllabic words that he uses just as his father \ndid; his sisters, Priscilla L. Buckley of Sharon, where the family has \nlonged lived; Patricia Buckley Bozzell of Washington; Carol Buckley of \nColumbia, SC; his brothers, Judge James Buckley of Sharon, CT, and F. \nReid Buckley of Camden, SC; and a granddaughter and grandson.\n  I pray that they will be strengthened by their faith and comforted by \ngood memories and pride and the extraordinary person in Bill Buckley.\n  I think most fitting of all, I will end with a quote from President \nReagan on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the National Review \nin 1985. Reagan says when he first picked up his first issue of \nNational Review, he received it in a plain brown wrapper and still \nanxiously awaited his biweekly edition but no longer in a plain brown \nwrapper.\n  But this is what Reagan said of Buckley:\n\n       You didn't just part the Red Sea--you rolled it back, dried \n     it up, and left exposed, for all the world to see, the naked \n     desert that is statism. And then, as if that weren't enough, \n     you gave the world something different, something in its \n     weariness it desperately needed, the sound of laughter and \n     the sight of the rich, green uplands of freedom.\n\n  I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to bid farewell in \nthis Senate Chamber to a great American and a dear friend, William F. \nBuckley, Jr. I pray with confidence and the faith that Bill Buckley had \nthat his soul will be taken up truly in the bonds of eternal life.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1235-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, another day in Iraq. Today American \ntaxpayers' dollars will be spent in Iraq, almost a half a billion \ndollars. More than $400 million will be spent today in Iraq.\n  Here is what we get from it as seen by--you pick about any \nnewspaper--the Washington Post, which was at my doorstep this morning: \n``Suicide Bomber Hits Bus in Iraq's North, Killing at Least Eight.''\n  A suicide bomber detonated his explosive belt outside a bus in \nNorthern Iraq on Tuesday, killing at least eight people, injuring at \nleast eight others.\n  You drop down, it tells about all of the violence.\n  The Tall Afar bombing followed a bloody weekend of attacks against \nShiite pilgrims, the deadly incident taking place Sunday when a suicide \nbomber killed at least 63.\n  As we learned yesterday, that one blast injured more than 100. You \ndrop down in this news article:\n  Even as overall violence has fallen, the recent attacks underscore \nthe tenuous security environment and the resiliency of the insurgency.\n  In volatile Diyala Province, it goes on to explain how 21 people were \nkidnaped yesterday. At the bottom of the page, it has the names of \nthree of our soldiers who were killed. And then, of course, we have \nGeneral Casey. General Casey, the Army Chief of Staff, said yesterday \nin testimony before the Armed Services Committee:\n  The cumulative effect of the last 6 years plus at war have left our \nArmy out of balance, consumed by the current fight and unable to do the \nthings we know we need to do.\n  We have had some good debate. My Republican colleagues think the war \nis going great. I think they are certainly entitled to their opinion. \nBut it has been a good debate. We, of course, have spent time on Iraq \non this side of the aisle, but also on how the war has done so much to \ndamage our security and our economy.\n  There is a book coming out tomorrow or the next day that talks \nabout--it is by Mr. Stiglitz, who is a Pulitzer Prize winner--maybe \nNobel; I think Nobel. It is called ``The $3 Trillion Mistake.''\n  The book is on the war. Now, in actual numbers that I understand, in \nabout a year they will be up to $1 trillion. Mr. Stiglitz, an \neconomist, far smarter than I am, says it is $3 trillion. That is what \nwe have talked about. This war that will soon be going into the sixth \nyear has been devastating to our country.\n  We had a meeting that just took place about the budget. The \nPresident's budget cuts virtually everything. One of the victims in his \nbudget is Public Broadcasting, cut by 70 percent. I talked to Senator \nConrad as we were leaving. I said: What did you do with Public \nBroadcasting?\n  We restored the money.\n  And even restoring it takes into consideration some of the cuts the \nPresident has made in that program over the 7 years he has been \nPresident.\n  We do not have money to do the basics this country needs to do \nbecause we have borrowed $1 trillion to take care of the war.\n  So we have had a good debate. Each side has spent a little over 3 \nhours discussing these issues. I believe there has\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nbeen sufficient debate on the motion to proceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be yielded back and \nthe motion to proceed be agreed to; that the Senate now vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2634, and that \nif cloture is invoked, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate \nimmediately proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 3221, the vehicle we will use for the housing \nmarket crisis.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will make \ntwo quick comments. Certainly I respect the majority leader's comments. \nHe talked about the fact that violence is down in Iraq. But, of course, \nthe suicide bombers continue to wreak havoc. We all deplore that.\n  I was in Israel last week at the border town in Gaza--Sderot is the \nname--and terrorism from Hamas continues to bedevil the people of that \ntown with rockets coming over every day. But they cannot leave and \nleave the terrorists to prevail there. I think the same thing is the \nsituation in Iraq.\n  The majority leader talks about the costs, and they are significant. \nBut the costs if we had to come back in and clean up after the \nterrorists take over, if we left prematurely, could be far greater than \nwhat we are expected to have to pay. In any event, it is very difficult \nto put a price on freedom and security.\n  I think we have had a good debate. We have speakers on our side \nactually for about another about 4\\1/2\\ hours or so. But as I told the \nmajority leader, we could yield back some time on our side to work with \nthe majority leader to develop a schedule that would be convenient for \nall of the Members.\n  At this time, because of the precise nature of the unanimous consent \nrequest, I object on behalf of the minority but would suggest it should \nbe possible this afternoon, early this afternoon, for the majority and \nminority leaders to sit down and work out a schedule that would meet \nthe needs of all of our Members and convenient for the entire body.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Iraq. \nFollowing the bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, our enemies \ntried to plunge Iraq into chaos, and in certain parts of Iraq they were \nsucceeding. Terrorists and extremists were pitting Iraqi against Iraqi, \nSunni against Shia, Shia against Sunni. In Baghdad, Iraqi families were \nbeing forced to leave their homes and to resettle in areas where other \nmembers of their religious community resided.\n  Iraqi police and army units were nowhere near capable of taking the \nlead during operations. On the political front, progress was very slow. \nWhen the going got tough, many called for U.S. withdrawal and \nabandonment of Iraq.\n  Thankfully, the President did not listen to the calls for defeat and \nretreat. The President reviewed our strategy and changed course. This \nchange was needed. I visited Iraq twice before this change of strategy. \nI can tell you it was a dangerous place. During one of my trips, we had \nto take a helicopter from the Green Zone to Baghdad International \nAirport because of an IED threat.\n  In January of 2007, the President and General Petraeus launched the \nsurge of American forces into Iraq. The Iraqi people quickly realized \nthat something dramatic had happened. Those who had worried that \nAmerica was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of \nAmerican forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving \ninto the neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind \nto ensure that the enemy did not return. They saw our troops, along \nwith provincial reconstruction teams, coming in to ensure that improved \nsecurity was followed by improvements in daily life.\n  The surge is now achieving its primary aims of improving population \nsecurity in Baghdad and reversing the cycle of sectarian violence that \nplagued Iraq. Although there is much more work to be done, security has \nimproved considerably since General Petraeus began implementing this \nnew strategy that became fully operational in mid-June.\n  According to the U.S. military, monthly attack levels have decreased \n60 percent since that time. Civilian deaths are down approximately 75 \npercent. Although al-Qaida in Iraq remains a dangerous threat, its \ncapabilities are severely diminished. Thousands of extremists in Iraq \nhave been captured or killed, including hundreds of key al-Qaida \nleaders and their operatives.\n  Iraqi forces now have assumed responsibility for security in 9 of 18 \nIraqi provinces and are now leading combat operations all over the \ncountry. Iraqi security forces and concerned local citizen groups \ncontinue to grow, develop capabilities, and provide more security for \ntheir country. The Government of Iraq is committed to one day assuming \nfiscal and overall responsibility for CLCs, which some now call the \nSons of Iraq, and has begun structuring vocational training programs \nfor these CLCs who want to rejoin the civilian workforce.\n  The President's strategy in Iraq has put us on a path to success. \nU.S. and Iraqi troops, working together, have achieved significant \nresults. Violence is down dramatically and political progress is being \nmade. The Government in Baghdad recently passed debaathification \nlegislation and a pension law, and is sharing oil revenues with the \ndifferent provinces.\n  Significant bottom-up political progress is occurring at the local \nlevel in Iraq, where provincial governments continue to spend national \nrevenue on reconstruction, and many people are engaging in local \npolitics.\n  On the economic front, the central Government of Iraq recently \nreached its 2007 target of $30.2 billion in budget revenue 1 month \nbefore the end of the year. The Government of Iraq recently completed \nearly repayment of its outstanding obligations to the International \nMonetary Fund. The Baghdad Chamber of Commerce recently hosted a \nbusiness expo which more than 8,000 executives, entrepreneurs, \nsalesmen, and investors attended.\n  Mr. President, approximately 2 weeks ago, I traveled again to Iraq \nand was briefed by General Petraeus, other commanders on the ground, \nand Iraqi security officials. Petraeus and his troops are obviously and \nundoubtedly doing a remarkable job at turning things around. This was a \ndifferent trip for me. There was a more secure feeling in the air. I \nfelt optimistic, more so than at any other time since the war started. \nYou can tell that things have remarkably changed for the better. I \nvisited a town south of Baghdad where 3 months ago al-Qaida had been in \ntotal control. I felt so safe that, along with two other Senators and \nour staffs, we walked through a local market without a helmet and spoke \nto dozens of residents, including children, through a translator. One \nof the Iraqi people's biggest fears is that America will surrender and \nleave prematurely. They fear for their lives, their children, and the \nfuture of the country if we surrender.\n  Great, almost unbelievable strides have obviously been made, and we \nare headed in the right direction. Despite this fact, some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to introduce \ndefeatist legislation, such as what we have before us today, S. 2633, \nthat call for tying our hands on this front line of the war on terror. \nSo as things get better and better, the Democrats continue to call for \nretreat. They continue to politicize the war in Iraq, persisting in \ncalls for troop withdrawal, when the surge is demonstrating real \nsuccess, both military and political.\n  Scaling back withdrawing when we are succeeding so brilliantly \nclearly equals defeat and makes absolutely no sense. The Democrats have \nconcluded that America has lost and refuse to listen to the judgment of \nour military leaders.\n  Responding to whether gains made in Iraq would be lost if we abruptly \nwithdrew our troops, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recently stated:\n\n       There haven't been gains. The gains have not produced the \n     desired effect, which is the reconciliation of Iraq. This is \n     a failure. This is a failure.\n\n  Such defeatist nonsense is not the way to boost the morale of our \ntroops on the ground or to show gratitude for their success. I call on \nthe Speaker to visit Iraq, to talk to our troops, to talk\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\nto the Iraqi people, and to see how successful the surge is working for \nher own eyes.\n  Further, I find it peculiar that the Democrats keep calling for \nwithdrawal over and over again when initially they criticized the \nadministration for not sending more troops to Iraq. When plans for the \nsurge were announced, they roundly attacked it, going so far as to say \nthe war was already lost. Then when the surge began to show great \nsuccess, Democrats again criticized it and said the only purpose of the \nsurge was to enable political reconciliation in Iraq. Now that both \nmilitary and political successes are being realized, the Democrats are \nonce again going to have to redefine what failure looks like.\n  When General Petraeus first took command, he said, ``Hard is not \nhopeless.'' Today, there is hope and optimism in Iraq. Amazing progress \nhas been made. I should not have to say this, but we must support our \ntroops, not just in word but in deed. The Democrats need to stop \nplaying games with the brave men and women who are sacrificing so much \nfor this country. They need to stop introducing legislation that ties \nstrings to money for our troops. They need to stop introducing \nlegislation that would prematurely bring our troops home and ruin all \nthe gains they have made over the last 5 years. Partisan politics need \nto be set aside. We need to come together as a Congress, as a country, \nand get behind the effort and the mission in Iraq. Let's finish what we \nstarted, not just for today but for the future. We are all Americans \nfirst. It is time we started acting like that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday one of our colleagues came before \nthis body and stated for all who cared to listen that he was weary, \nweary of this war.\n  I, too, am weary, but weariness does not lead me to embrace the \npolicy of surrender or succumb to the nihilistic business that is \ndefeatism.\n  History is replete with examples of leaders who fell victim to the \ntemptation of defeatism. Shall the Senate similarly repeat this folly?\n  No, sir.\n  In this country, commitment and dedication to noble pursuits have \ndefined our great Nation. We must not give way to weariness now.\n  The Senate is where great ideas and thoughts are to be put forth and \nconsidered, ideas and thoughts that are designed to lead to a better \nlife for the American people and secure a safer world where the \ninalienable rights of all are respected.\n  But I, too, am weary, weary of the policies of appeasement that have \nbecome the guiding principles of some in the majority party. Have they \nlearned nothing? Has history not taught us, through the pain and \nsuffering of millions, that the philosophy of appeasement only provides \na slight respite from the forces of evil before they unleash \nincalculable pain and suffering on the innocent?\n  What happens if we adopt the troop withdrawal legislation before us? \nDo they really think al-Qaida is just going to leave us alone? Make no \nmistake, the majority of the forces that oppose us in Iraq are \naffiliated with al-Qaida.\n  Do the supporters of this bill think al-Qaida will conclude: ``Well, \nwe have won in Iraq, now let's leave the Americans to live in peace?'' \nDoes anybody really believe that?\n  That is the question the American people have to ask themselves. What \nwill happen if we pick an arbitrary time to leave Iraq based on a \npolicy of appeasement rather than accomplishments of our new \ncounterinsurgency strategy?\n  I have been to Iraq twice. The first time, I admit to being a little \ndiscouraged. The second time was a year later. During this second \nvisit, we actually flew into Al Anbar really before it was completely \nas open as it is today. We walked the streets of Ramadi. We high-fived \nwith the kids who were on the street. The difference between my two \nvisits was striking. It was a complete change and that change is \nbecause of our current military leadership.\n  Again, the question the American people have to ask themselves: What \nwill happen if we pick an arbitrary time to leave Iraq based on a \npolicy of appeasement rather than the accomplishments of our new \ncounterinsurgency strategy?\n  Simply put, what happens the day after?\n  Will not al-Qaida use Iraq, with the world's third largest oil \nreserves, as a bank to fund their worldwide activities? Will they not \nuse Iraq as a base to launch attacks against all those who disagree \nwith their radical policies?\n  What are the answers offered to these questions by the proponents of \nthis legislation? From what I can discern from the Members who have \ntaken to the floor to defend it, the answer is simple: nothing. They \nsimply do not have a plan for the day after.\n  What of the nearly 4,000 servicemembers who volunteered to fight for \ntheir country and who have now paid the ultimate sacrifice? Does their \nmemorial in history read: Thank you for your service, but some Members \nof Congress grew weary, and therefore your sacrifice and the sacrifices \nof your family were in vain.\n  I know what those sacrifices are like. Our family lost my only living \nbrother in World War II on the Ploesti oil raid. That was the raid that \nattempted to knock out Hitler's oil reserves and it was one of the most \nimportant operations of World War II.\n  My brother's loss was hard on our family. But we were proud of my \nbrother. We were proud that he was willing to sacrifice his life for \nus, just as we are proud of our young men and women who are fighting in \nIraq and Afghanistan today.\n  What is General Petraeus's conclusion, if we begin a precipitous \nwithdrawal? Almost everybody has praised General Petraeus. You just \nhave to. My gosh, the man has completely transformed the situation in \nIraq. He has been right in his approach toward these problems over \nthere. He wrote the Army's manual on fighting insurgencies.\n  As recently as February 15, General Petraeus stated what we all know \nto be true if we were to begin a precipitous withdrawal:\n\n       You would see a resurgence of ethno-sectarian violence. You \n     would see al Qaeda regain its safe havens and sanctuaries. \n     There's no telling what would happen with displaced persons.\n\n  In other words, if we leave, the chaos that could result might make \nthe wholesale slaughter that occurred after the fall of Indochina look \nminuscule by comparison. I wonder what fanciful legislative fix our \ncolleagues will offer then.\n  So what is the alternative? Do opponents of this bill offer only \nempty rhetoric?\n  No, we support the comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy devised \nand implemented by General Petraeus. It is a strategy that is producing \nremarkable results, results that point to only one conclusion. In \nlittle over a year, the coalition has regained the initiative.\n  For example, General Petraeus stated in his December 30 briefing that \noverall attacks have decreased by 60 percent. Civilian deaths are also \ndown by 60 percent. The ethno-sectarian component of those fatalities \nhas decreased by 80 percent.\n  Those findings are supported by other commanders in Iraq, including \nMG Joseph Fil, the commanding officer of the 1st Cavalry Division and \nthe officer who until December was responsible for our operations in \nBaghdad. He stated in an interview late last year with the New York \nTimes that coalition forces have dramatically reduced, if not \neliminated, al-Qaida's presence in every neighborhood in Baghdad. The \ngeneral also pointed out that murders in Baghdad are down 80 percent.\n\n  In addition, during a recent briefing, LTG Raymond T. Odierno, who \njust returned from Iraq and has been nominated to become the Army's new \nVice Chief of Staff, stated that terrorist operations in Baghdad have \ndecreased by 59 percent. In the past year, suicide attacks in Baghdad \nhave been reduced 66 percent, from 12 to 4 a month. The number of \nimprovised explosive device attacks in Baghdad has also declined by 45 \npercent.\n  Baghdad is not the only area where we have seen success. During my \ntrip to Iraq last year, I was able to witness the dramatic changes that \nhave occurred in Al Anbar, where al-Qaida has been thrown out of vast \nareas of that province, including its major cities,\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\nRamadi and Fallujah, areas that were once deemed refuges for al-Qaida's \nvile perversion of a dignified and peaceful religion.\n  The success of Baghdad and Al Anbar is also being repeated throughout \nIraq. In the north, Operation Iron Harvest has been launched.\n  This operation has already achieved some important successes. For \nexample, during the month of December, the coalition and Iraqi security \nforces have killed or captured over 20 al-Qaida emirs in the north. \nThis included the capture of Haider al-Afri, who was the main security \nemir in Mosul and was responsible for organizing the flow of foreign \nfighters into the Mosul area. His replacement did not fare much better; \nhe was captured on February 18.\n  The number of attacks in Diyala has also decreased. No doubt that the \nrecent killing of the al-Qaida emir of Diyala helped this trend.\n  In addition, in the past two weeks, the coalition killed Abu Karrar, \nwho was a senior al-Qaida intelligence operative and an individual who \nhas the infamous distinction of organizing murders to be carried out by \nfemale suicide bombers.\n  Which leads me to the inevitable question: What do you think these \nsenior al-Qaida leaders would be doing with their time if we left Iraq? \nI wonder if they ever will grow weary as some in this body have?\n  How are all these successes possible? The answer is our generals over \nthere, led by General Petraeus. His strategy is based upon the classic \ncounterinsurgency tactic of providing security to the local population, \nthereby enabling the Government to provide services to its people, \nwhich in turn creates in the population a vested interest in the \nsuccess of Government institutions.\n  One of the ways this is accomplished is through the use of joint \nsecurity stations. Under this tactic, a portion of a city such as a \nneighborhood is cordoned off, then searched for insurgents. Previously, \nonce this was accomplished, our forces would return to large forward-\noperating bases, usually on the periphery of the city. The result was \neasy to predict. The insurgents would return once the sweep had \nconcluded.\n  Under General Petraeus's strategy, our forces remain in the \nneighborhoods and build joint security stations. These joint security \nstations then become home to a company-sized unit of American \nservicemembers as well as Iraqi Army and police units. These facilities \nnot only help secure the surrounding areas but simultaneously enable \nour forces to train and evaluate Iraqi forces. Much like the local \npolice officer in a major urban area, our forces use the joint security \nstations to learn about the locale to which they are assigned and can \nquickly adapt to meet the unique security needs of the individual \ncommunity.\n  The success of these joint security stations can be seen in their \ncreation throughout Iraq, with over 50 of them in Baghdad alone. \nHowever, under this legislation, our forces will no longer be able to \nconduct operations from joint security stations. In fact, they would be \nbanished to bases isolated from the Iraqi people and unable to \naccompany Iraqi forces on missions. Under this bill, the few remaining \nforces would only be able to conduct limited operations against al-\nQaida. The security provided to the Iraqi people, which is the \nfoundation of our recent success, would be entirely lost.\n  So let's review the policy advocated by this bill. No. 1, it \nguarantees defeat. No. 2, it provides al-Qaida with another base of \noperations, and, unlike Afghanistan, Iraq's oil wealth will provide \nsubstantial financial resources to purchase whatever the terrorists \nchoose. In the past, it has been publicly reported that al-Qaida has \nactively sought the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Neville Chamberlain would be proud.\n  So yes, I, like others, am weary, but I am weary of appeasement. I am \nweary of such defeatist legislation being debated on the floor of the \nSenate. This is a Chamber for great ideas and concepts that will ensure \nthe betterment of the American public and lead to the freedom of \noppressed people all over the world. This legislation falls far short \nof that August standard.\n  Just think about it, here we have this country, Iraq, with three \ndifferent factions who are working together, who are making headway, \nwho have enormous oil wealth that could be used for their people, who \nare tired of al-Qaida, who have been throwing them out of the various \nprovinces, who are cooperating with the United States of America, and \nwho are starting to cooperate with each other, who sit between two of \nthe most roguish nations in the world, Iran and Syria. All of this \nsuccess happening, and we have people who want to pull us out \nprematurely. I don't understand it personally.\n  I respect the sincerity of the sponsors and of those who will vote \nfor this. I think that if we are going to be weary, let's be weary of \nthe way to handle things.\n\n\n                        WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, JR.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the passing of William \nF. Buckley, Jr. I am aware of my limitations in speaking about Bill \nBuckley. Anything I might add to the eloquent words that have already \ncome from his friends at the National Review and from his friend, and \nmy friend, the Senator from Connecticut, Joe Lieberman, will seem small \nby comparison.\n  Still, as someone who knew Bill, as someone who admired Bill, and as \nsomeone who learned a great deal from Bill, I would be remiss if I did \nnot say a few words about this extraordinary man and his extraordinary \nlife.\n  The life of William F. Buckley, Jr., reads like something from one of \nhis many fiction novels. Growing up in Mexico, his first language was \nSpanish.\n  As a prep school student, he demonstrated that he was a real \nentrepreneur, typing his classmates' papers for $1 at a crack. And \nconsistent with the writer America got to know over the years, he would \ncharge an extra 25 cents to correct their grammar.\n  After graduating, he spent time at the University of Mexico, studying \nSpanish, and he served his country in the Army, making second \nlieutenant.\n  Only after serving in the Army did he go on to college, something \nwidespread in those days--when a hot war was followed by a long, cold \nwar--and largely unknown today with the exception of those in ROTC and \nbenefitting from the GI bill.\n  As a student at Yale, he distinguished himself. In addition to his \nstudies in political science, economics, and history, he cut his teeth \nas a debater and was elected chairman of the Yale Daily News.\n  Following college, a year in the CIA, and the publication of his book \n``God and Man at Yale,'' he began a career as a writer.\n  In 1955, his public life began as he founded the National Review. The \nNational Review never had a massive circulation. It continues to be \nsubsidized by the contributions of its readers. But its significance \nwas titanic. Simply put, there was no conservative movement before \nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr., and the magazine he founded and cultivated.\n  For decades, the progressive left had been triumphant. Herbert Croly, \nThe New Republic, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt--there was no \nreal answer to the arguments they made on behalf of higher taxes, a \ncomprehensive state, and a highly regulated economy. For sure, there \nwas a Republican Party, and Republicans continued to have electoral \nsuccess. But there was no real consistent conservative point of view. \nThe battlefield of ideas had been abandoned to the progressive left.\n  Bill Buckley, foot by foot, began retaking some of that ground, and \nestablishing a framework of conservative ideas--themes of limited \ngovernment, the protection of human liberty, economic entrepreneurship, \nand military strength in the face of a totalitarian threat bent on \nworld domination.\n  The development of these ideas was not always pretty. But through \nfits and starts a movement grew. We first heard its voice in the 1964 \nPresidential election, an election in which Republicans were trounced. \nBut by 1980, these conservative ideas had become a majority, one that \nhelped to put Ronald Reagan in the White House.\n  Bill was no doubt combative, but I think most would say he was always \nhaving fun. He was a real intellectual, but he was no dour academic. He \nloved to sail. He used to make his way around New York City on a \nmotorcycle. When he made his long-shot run for mayor of New York City \nand was asked what he would do if he won, he responded, ``Demand a \nrecount.''\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\n  He took up the harpsichord at the age of 50. He became a novelist. \nHis television show ``Firing Line'' ran from 1966 to 1999. I enjoyed \nbeing on ``Firing Line'' with him, basking in his wisdom, answering his \nquestions, and on occasion irritating him to death. But I loved the \nman.\n  Bill was a man who loved the written word, and it was fitting that he \npassed away at his desk and at his home. His son Christopher, also an \naccomplished writer, noted, ``he might have been working on a column.'' \nAnd I have no doubt we would have benefitted from it, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike.\n  As the authors of The Federalist Papers, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin \nRoosevelt, and Ronald Reagan understood, America remains an experiment. \nIt is an experiment in republican self-government. And that experiment \nis constantly being tested.\n  Bill lived through extraordinary and challenging times, times like \nour own that tested that experiment, and I have no doubt he was very \nimportant in helping us through them.\n  With wit and aplomb, he pushed the envelope. He argued and fought. He \nmade us a better country. He was a great American who led a great \nAmerican life, and America will miss him.\n  I have to say I knew Bill Buckley. I appreciated Bill Buckley. He had \nan enormous influence on me. As a former liberal Democrat, he helped me \nto see the merit in intelligent conservative approaches.\n  He appealed to so many of us, including some of my liberal \ncolleagues, who loved to debate him and loved to chat with him, because \nhe was at bottom a decent, honorable, funny, person who was open to \nbasically everybody.\n  No doubt the absence of Bill will be even more painful to the family \nhe has left behind. But consistent with the Catholic faith, one kept \ndeeply by Bill, I hope this is also a moment of happiness for them as \nthey know that Bill is now in Heaven with the love of his life, \nPatricia.\n  I offer my condolences to the Buckley family. All of you and Bill are \nin my prayers. His brother, James Buckley is in my thoughts in \nparticular. It was my honor to serve with Bill's brother in a variety \nof capacities. His brother is a true gentleman, a wonderful human \nbeing. Although he was only here for one term, he was a great Senator. \nThe examples of both Bill and Jim Buckley show how this unique American \nfamily has contributed so much to our public life.\n  I can assure you that the Congress, including members who differed \nwith Bill Buckley, will miss his humor and will miss him personally. I \nknow one thing: This Senator from Utah will miss him deeply.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan and yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about what is \ncurrently happening on the floor of the Senate and what I am hopeful \nwill happen.\n  Our leader, Senator Reid, has one more time brought us--and rightly \nso--to a point to debate and try to move forward on changing course in \nthe war in Iraq. There have been 5 years of war, with the largest \nexpenditure now of the Federal Government in terms of monthly \nexpenditures, and certainly in terms of loss of life. It goes on every \nday, day after day. All you have to do is look at the newspaper and see \nthat families continue to pay a huge price for this war.\n  I stood on the floor of this Senate 5 years ago and was one of 23 \nMembers who voted ``no'' on going into this war. But I have spent every \nother moment, every other vote, doing everything I can to support our \ntroops, to make sure I do everything I can to make sure we honor them \nthrough our efforts to equip them and make sure they have the \nresources, and that when they come home and put on the veteran's cap \nthat we are, in fact, providing the health care and the resources they \nneed. I am proud to be part of a caucus, a new majority that has placed \nveterans health insurance, health care as a top priority to make that \nhappen.\n  But I often think back to the discussions before my vote, and \ndiscussions with my husband, who is a 14-year veteran of the Air Force \nand the Air National Guard, and him reminding me that the best way to \nsupport American troops, the best way to support our troops is to give \nthem the right mission. The second thing is to make sure they have the \nresources they need. The third thing is to make sure there is a clear \nexit strategy for that mission.\n\n  I did not support that mission and believe there was not the evidence \nthat was needed to carry on that mission. I have supported those \nresources, however, that they need.\n  Now it is important, it is critical, that we as a body, as a \nCongress, come together to support the exit strategy, the effort to \nchange the mission that needs to occur in Iraq, to be able to bring our \npeople home, to be able to stop the multiple deployments, redeployments \nthat are going on, and that we refocus on those areas of the world and \nthose groups such as al-Qaida that truly are a threat to us. That means \nAfghanistan, that means other kinds of strategies to be able to truly \nkeep us safe. That is what we need to do.\n  The most important thing is to keep us safe as a country, to be smart \nabout our strategy. That is what we are debating, here: whether we are \ngoing to be smart about our strategy to keep us safe, whether we are \ngoing to pay attention to the daily loss of life in Iraq, and whether \nwe are going to pay attention to the almost $15 billion a month that is \nbeing spent on that war, which is now a civil war, that is not being \ninvested back home in America.\n  That is what I want to speak about for a moment, understanding that \nthe most important thing is the loss of life and what is happening to \nour troops and their families.\n  As I said, I am extremely proud of the fact that we made a very top \npriority for us in the new majority coming in the full funding of \nveterans health care. We have done that. We have tackled the problems \nwe have seen with Walter Reed and the inability for our troops, as they \nmove between systems, to get the effective care they need by passing \nthe Wounded Warriors legislation.\n  We have continued to bring forward other efforts to be able to \naddress what I consider to be the abuse of our troops by continual \nredeployment without enough dwell time, rest time, for them to be here \nat home, as the Army Manual would require.\n  But we also have another very important piece of this which goes to \nwhat is happening when we have almost $15 billion a month that is being \ndiverted from our economy, which from Michigan surely looks like a \nrecession. I cannot speak to every other part of the country, but from \nour economy and our families and our communities, it is being spent on \na war that a majority of Americans--not a majority of Democrats--a \nmajority of Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--people \nof all persuasions in all States are saying: We no longer want to go in \nthis direction. We want to change this mission. We want to bring our \npeople home.\n  But we are now getting ready to do a budget. The distinguished Acting \nPresident pro tempore today is on the Budget Committee. He has served \nwith distinction in the House and now in the Senate. Mr. President, you \nknow as well as I do that we are now grappling with very tough \ndecisions about how to address the needs here in America.\n  I think that on top of the issues of national policy and how to keep \nus safe, and the loss of life, and how to support our troops, we have \nto grapple with the fact that last year, for instance, when we passed, \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, an effort to extend \nhealth care, health insurance to 10 million children of working \nfamilies, the President vetoed it, saying it was too much money. Yet it \nwas about half of the cost of 1 month of what we are spending in Iraq \ntoday.\n  Investing in children, healthy children in our country, of working \nfamilies who unfortunately are working in jobs where they do not have \nhealth insurance and do not have enough of a wage to be able to afford \nthe $1,000 a month premium or more that they would have to pay--do we \nfocus on supporting those families and change this direction or do we \ncontinue down this road of saying no to our children?\n  We have the opportunity to create new jobs in the energy economy. In \nMichigan, we are moving full speed ahead on alternative energy, and not \nonly in our vehicles. But windmills and\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nsolar and biofuels and all of these things take partnerships and \ninvestments.\n  We have an energy tax provision--a measure for which we came one vote \nshort of being able to override one of the multitude of filibusters \nthat has gone on on this floor: a historic level of filibusters \nstopping us at every turn--we came one vote short. We are talking about \nhaving some resources to be able to put into tax incentives to be able \nto produce alternative energies and the infrastructures so the biofuels \ncan actually get to the pump so you not only can buy a E-85 car but get \nE-85 at the pump. It takes some investments to be able to do that.\n  We have been told no on being able to put dollars into that area. Yet \nthe amount of money we are talking about is less than 2 months of \nspending in Iraq.\n  Infrastructure, roads and bridges. We saw last year what happened in \nMinnesota in terms of a huge bridge collapse and what happened with \nhuman life and what happened to the community involved. We have roads \nand bridges across our country, water and sewer systems that are aging, \nthat need a facelift, and we need to be able to get some additional \ndollars so we can bring ourselves into the modern age for much of our \ninfrastructure. Yet we are told again: No, there are no resources to \nput money into our infrastructure. However, we are rebuilding roads in \nIraq, we are rebuilding schools in Iraq.\n  In fact, one of the original items I will never forget was to put \nwireless technology into schools. That was in the budget, but it wasn't \nthe American budget, it was the Iraqi reconstruction budget. I have \nbeen working for years to get technologies in our schools, new \ntechnology, because every single student is going to face, at a \nminimum, working with a computer, whether you work at a gas station or \nwhether you work at a high-tech company. Yet we can't do that in \nAmerica. We have been told by this administration and by those who had \nbeen in the majority for 6 years: No. But at the same time, it was in \nthe budget for Iraq.\n  We now find ourselves in a situation with a tremendous housing \ncrisis. In my State of Michigan, it has frankly masked a larger \neconomic crisis, where people have been losing their jobs, they are \nlosing their incomes, seeing all their costs go up, but they have had \nthat equity in their home that was keeping them going. All of a sudden, \nall of the values go down, and we are seeing a collapse in the housing \nmarket which has rippled out way beyond housing now into our capital \nmarkets, into our entire economy. Yet when we come to the floor--and we \nare going to be asking shortly, after we vote to end this filibuster \nthat is going on, on the change in the Iraq mission--we are going to be \nasking to come together around a housing proposal that, frankly, I \nthink is pretty modest. It is important, it is good, it is the right \nthing to do, but it certainly is something within the realm of \nreasonableness. Yet I know it is going to be difficult to be able to \nget this passed. The cost of it, again, is about 2 weeks in Iraq, to be \nable to focus on one of the most devastating crises going on in America \ntoday.\n  Most middle-class families save through equity in their home. That is \nhow most people are able to get into the middle class. We are talking \nabout people who have worked hard, played by the rules, done all the \nright things, got a job, saved up the downpayment, were able to get a \nhome, and then find themselves in a situation where they are looking \naround saying: Wait a minute. What is going on here? What about me? \nWhat is happening in our economy? I need some help. We are trying to do \nthat. I hope we are going to be able to come together and do that. But \nif we hear one more time: No, we can't do that, we can't afford it--we \nare talking about less than 2 weeks of what is being spent in Iraq.\n  How many times have we heard all the comments about Leave No Child \nBehind, about the fact that we are not keeping our promises as it \nrelates to education. We passed new high standards. We all support the \nhigh standards. What we promised was that with that would come \nresources to help children, help schools succeed. We have seen dramatic \nunderfunding. Again, in this President's budget, he eliminates 48 \ndifferent education programs, including efforts that focus on \nvocational education and other things that are important for the \nfuture--48 different programs. We will be told that if we try to invest \nin education, that it is too much. It is too much. We can't afford to \nkeep the promise of Leave No Child Behind.\n  We passed, on a bipartisan basis, something called the America \nCompetes Act. I wish to congratulate my colleagues. This was a great \nbipartisan effort. I know the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, \nwas a real champion of that. It focuses on math and science and \ntechnology and investments in the future. I wish we had seen those \ninvestments fully authorized, fully funded in the President's budget--\nhealth research to save lives, science research, the National Science \nFoundation, those things that will make us competitive for the future. \nEvery other country is racing to invest in science. We see China is \nracing, along with Japan and South Korea and other countries around the \nworld, to get to that next technology, whether it is advanced battery \ntechnology research, whether it is biotechnology, whether it is new \ncures in health care. Yet we, the greatest country in the world, are \nseeing those things cut, but $15 billion a month is being spent in Iraq \nwhich is, by the way, not paid for and goes right on to the deficit for \nour children to pay for in the future. These priorities don't make \nsense. They make no sense when we look to the future.\n  I would like to ask the President: How about just 1 month for \nAmerica? How about just 1 month? We will take 1 month of $15 billion \ninvested to help us with jobs, keeping American jobs here, opportunity \nthrough education and innovation, helping our own families with health \ncare, and people being able to keep their homes. How about just 1 month \nfor America?\n  This debate we are having on the floor about Iraq is incredibly \nimportant on so many different levels, and that is why I appreciate \nSenator Reid bringing us to this point. There are other pieces of this \nthat we are committed to addressing such as a modern GI bill. My father \nwent to school on the GI bill after World War II. We ought to be doing \nthe same thing for our returning veterans. It will cost some dollars. \nAre we going to hear once again: Well, we can't afford it. We can't \nafford to invest in our veterans. I hope not.\n  The reality is there is a great connection between what is happening \nnow in terms of filibustering our effort to move forward, to change \ndirection in Iraq--one more time, one more filibuster--and what we want \nto do next, which is focus on the incredibly serious housing crisis in \nAmerica. There is a connection because we are saying that not only are \nwe not doing the smartest thing to keep us safe from a strategic, from \na national security standpoint, we are also using dollars--precious \ndollars, taxpayer dollars--in a way that is actually making us less \nsafe at home by undercutting our ability to have a strong economy, \nstrong families, to support those who are in the middle class, who are \ntrying to work hard to get into the middle class, struggling to stay in \nthe middle class. The majority of Americans find themselves in great \njeopardy right now on a number of fronts. This is the time they look to \ntheir Government to play a role to help create opportunity, to be able \nto make strategic investments here at home that will make sure we can \ncontinue to have the American way of life of which we are so proud.\n  So this matters. This matters. I am looking forward to the time when \nwe are going to change that direction in Iraq, and I hope it comes \nsoon. I hope we are able to say to our men and women who are on their \nthird or fourth redeployment now: Job well done. Thank you for your \nservice. You can come home now. Hopefully, they will come home to a \nveterans system that works for them, that they will come home to a GI \nbill of rights that creates a way for them to have opportunity, that \nthey will come home to an economy that works for them and their \nfamilies. That is our goal. We are going to keep focusing on this issue \nuntil we create that change.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yesterday, I inserted into the Record a \ncouple of items. I wish to speak to them briefly now.\n  The primary item was a letter that had been sent to the chairman of \nthe House Intelligence Committee by Attorney General Mukasey and \nAdmiral McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence. It was a \nletter that tried to explain the problems we are having in gathering \nintelligence on terrorists as a result of the lapse of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act provisions, the so-called Protect America \nAct.\n  What we are debating right now is a resolution that focuses on when \nand how we should leave Iraq. Presumably, the next resolution we will \nbe debating focuses on developing a strategy to fight al-Qaida. Most of \nus appreciate the fact that the best way to deal with terrorists, the \nvery first thing we should do is to have in place a good intelligence-\ngathering capability, primarily in understanding the communications \nthat terrorists are having with one another abroad.\n  The reason that is the No. 1 part of a strategy in dealing with \nterrorists is that unlike a war in which we are fighting an enemy with \nuniforms representing another country, these terrorists are shadowy \ncharacters who live anywhere in the world, who travel all around, who \nget together in cells every now and then and plan some kind of activity \nwhich is designed to terrorize, whether in London or Spain or Malaysia \nor the United States or wherever.\n  In order to fight the terrorists, we first want to understand what \nthey are up to and then prevent it from occurring.\n  If we are having to react to a terrorist attack after it has \noccurred, we are in a very bad situation.\n  We created the Department of Homeland Security, and we have a lot of \ndifferent plans and procedures for dealing with an attack after it has \noccurred. But in many respects, then it is too late.\n  So in this war against these radical Islamists, these terrorists who \nwould kill anywhere they can and target innocent people, the very first \nthing we want to do is to be able to have good intelligence on that \nactivity.\n  We collect intelligence in a variety of ways, but in modern times, \none of the best ways to collect intelligence is by intercepting \ncommunications. There are a variety of means by which that is done. One \nof the things the Congress did was to develop a law that provides \nprotection to American citizens and others to ensure that this \nintelligence collection does not impinge on our civil rights. We do not \nwant to have the Government eavesdropping on us, and that is \nappropriate for us to ensure.\n  The problem is, because technology has outpaced the law back when it \nwas written in the 1970s and technology now enables us to do electronic \nintercepts against foreign targets through some very sophisticated and \nnew means, the law that set up the process for getting approval to do \nthat takes far too long, it is far too complicated and, in fact, the \nbottom line is it just plain does not work. It is ``paperwork in an \nelectronic era'' kind of comparison.\n  So the President came to the Congress and said: You have to get a new \nway of doing this activity that enables us to utilize this new \ntechnology we have to intercept these communications. And last August, \nwe passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the FISA law--it \nhas another acronym, Protect America Act--which enables us to utilize \nthis new technology and also, importantly, to provide that the \ntelecommunications companies that work with us do not have to worry \nabout somebody suing them because they are helping the U.S. Government \ncollect intelligence.\n  The law we passed had two problems. No. 1, it expired after 6 months \nbecause some in the Congress felt they wanted to take another look at \nit; and, secondly, it did not have liability protection for these \ntelecommunications companies for the previous work they had done for \nus. It was only for the work going forward. The telecommunications \ncompanies essentially said to the U.S. Government: We are not going to \ncontinue to do this work for you unless you can ensure we are not going \nto get sued and that the lawsuits that are currently pending go away.\n  I am oversimplifying. The lawsuit said: You shouldn't have done what \nyou did because the U.S. Government shouldn't have been engaged in this \nkind of surveillance.\n  That is not the fault of the telecommunications companies. They were \nsimply doing what the Government asked them to do. They were a \nvolunteer to provide their services, their very essential services, to \nhelp us collect this intelligence. As with any other volunteer, you \nshould not get sued just because you stopped to help somebody along the \nside of the road who got hurt in an accident. The same thing is here. \nThe Government asked them to volunteer their services to help collect \nthis intelligence, and they should not be sued. But lawyers being what \nthey are filed some lawsuits, and those lawsuits need to go away.\n  The President said: When you revise the law and pass it in February \nof 2008, make sure you have liability protection not only going forward \nbut also for the suits that have already been filed. Sure enough, the \nIntelligence Committee in the Senate, by a bipartisan vote of 13 to 2 \nor 12 to 2--but a very strong bipartisan vote--agreed to extend the law \nfor another 6 years and add the retroactive liability protection, \nprecisely what is needed.\n  However, when the bill was sent over to the House of Representatives, \nthe House Democratic leadership said: No, we are not going to take this \nup and promptly went on the recess that we just got back from, a 12-day \nperiod in which Congress was not in session. During that period of \ntime, the law lapsed and General Mukasey and Admiral McConnell in this \nletter made it clear that during that period of time, we lost \nintelligence that could be very meaningful to us. We don't know whether \nit is or not because we lost it. We could not collect it. But the kind \nof intelligence that we have been collecting under this program has \nbeen very helpful for us to know what these terrorists are up to so \nthat we can prevent attacks.\n  We are now in a situation where we are not able to commence certain \nintelligence gathering. In addition, and perhaps more important in the \nlong run, we have not done anything to solve the problem of these \nlawsuits, the retroactive liability, with the result that, as they \nwrite in this letter, the telecommunications companies are becoming \nincreasingly concerned about their ability to continue to help us. They \nare all responsible to their shareholders, and their shareholders do \nnot like to see their company is getting sued. It reduces the value of \nthe company. It creates problems and costs. When they try to do \nbusiness with other companies, the other companies say: Wait a minute, \nare you involved in these lawsuits? If so, we don't want to enter into \na new contract with you.\n\n  They work with companies all over the world. A lot of these companies \nare concerned that American telecommunications companies are going to \nhave this kind of exposure, and they don't want to get involved in it.\n  It can hurt business substantially, as a result of which some of \nthese companies have conveyed to our intelligence community their \ndistress, anxiety, and concern about continuing to participate in this \nprogram.\n  Fortunately, through negotiations, according to this letter, \ncompanies are still working with us. They are still participating, but \nwithout them we have no program. This is not something the U.S. \nGovernment can do on its own. This is something that only works if all \nof the companies that provide our telecommunications services are \nworking with us.\n  So we have to act pretty soon or we could well be in a situation \nwhere the very companies that are critical to the operational success \nof this program decide that discretion is the better part of valor on \ntheir part and they are just not going to be able to continue to help \nus. At that point, we have lost one of the most important intelligence-\ngathering operations in this war against terrorists.\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\n  I want to go back to the days following September 11, 2001. There was \na lot of finger-pointing. A commission was established to try to figure \nout what went wrong. There were a lot of areas identified where we \nshould have known better, and had we done things differently, at least \npotentially 9/11 could have been prevented.\n  We found that the FBI and CIA were not talking to each other, and the \nJustice Department had constructed a sort of wall between the two, even \nwithin the FBI itself which prevented one hand from communicating to \nthe other very important information. In fact, there is information \nrelating to a couple of terrorists that, had they been able to talk to \neach other, might well have resulted in these terrorists being picked \nup in the United States, people who were directly involved in the 9/11 \nattack and, at least theoretically, could have been prevented had they \nbeen able to communicate with each other.\n  The bottom line is, retroactive, after 9/11, we could have been doing \nmore but did not. That report was very critical of the Congress, of the \nadministration, of the intelligence community, of the FBI, CIA, and \nothers for not doing everything that could have been done to prevent 9/\n11.\n  If there were to be, God forbid, another terrorist attack on the \nUnited States and the commission that is inevitably going to study what \nhappened would look at the days prior to that event in the Congress, \nwhat they would find is a House of Representatives that is sitting on \nits hands, that is unwilling to take up the Senate-passed bill. That \nbill passed with 68 Senators voting yes, obviously Democrats and \nRepublicans voting yes, a very strong bipartisan bill. The President \nsays he will sign it. He said we need it. The intelligence community \nsays we need it.\n  Now it has been 2 weeks, and we don't have a law that enables us to \nengage in this intelligence collection.\n  What happens if before we get that law there is an attack or even an \nattack after that based upon communications of terrorists that we could \nhave intercepted but didn't because we didn't have the means to do it?\n  There is going to be a lot of finger-pointing, and rightfully so. The \nSenate said we are going to do our part, we are going to pass this law \nso there are no gaps in our intelligence collection.\n  The House of Representatives continues to sit on its hands. What will \nit take to get the House leadership to take up the Senate-passed bill \nand send it to the President for his signature? I hope it doesn't take \nanother terrorist event.\n  This debate we are having about our policy in defeating al-Qaida and \nhow Iraq fits into that is part of an overall debate about our approach \nto the war against militant Islam, the terrorists who strike innocent \npeople. As I said in the beginning, the most important thing that we \ncan do in starting our effort in the war is to have good intelligence. \nIn this case, the best offense is not going to war in some foreign \ncountry, not bombing somebody, but finding out what these bad actors \nare up to and preventing them from putting their plans into effect.\n  Partially because it has been quite a long time since 9/11, and \npartially because it is not possible to talk about some of these events \nbecause they are highly classified, the American public probably is not \nas aware as it should be of the kind of activities that go on every \nday. What happens every day is that there are all over the world \nthousands of would-be terrorists meeting, planning, communicating, \ntraining, and, in some cases, carrying out their intentions engaging in \nterrorist activity. And because we have had good intelligence \ncollection, much of which is done through this electronic interception \nof communications, we have been able to stop specific terrorist \nattacks. Some of these are chronicled by the communications from the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. Some are \nlaid out in reports from the CIA and other unclassified reports--just \nto mention one: an effort to blow up elements of the Los Angeles \nAirport, LAX. There are others. I have kind of forgotten which ones are \nclassified and which aren't, so I am not going to describe any more. \nBut the reality is, it is going on all the time, and only by good \nintelligence can we find out in advance and then either infiltrate the \ncell, work with our counterparts in another country to round up the bad \nguys, or perhaps, if the plans haven't gotten to the execution stage, \nuse our knowledge to gain additional information to track other \nterrorists. In any event, at some point, when it looks as if the plan \nmay be about to be executed, either we or our allies have to come in \nand arrest the individuals so that the attack doesn't occur. But we \ncan't do that if we don't know what they are up to.\n\n  It is unfortunate that a lot of the information about how we collect \nintelligence has gotten out, but it is fortunate that we have companies \nin the United States that are willing to cooperate with their \nGovernment because they are in a position to help the Government \nintercept these communications. It just happens to be because of the \nway the modern telecommunications technology now works.\n  We should be doing everything we can to protect these volunteers, in \neffect. They have relied, in good faith, on the representations of the \nGovernment that the President had the authority to engage in these \noperations and requested their services. This is not my conclusion, \nthis is the conclusion of the Senate Intelligence Committee in its \nreport on the legislation we passed. It pointed out that it had \nexamined the record and found these communications companies had, in \nfact, acted in good faith. So there is no reason for them to be \nsubjected to lawsuits. Unless those lawsuits go away, it is quite \npossible that one by one the companies that are assisting us are going \nto conclude that it is not in their financial best interests to do so \nand that, as much as they would like to, they are simply not in a \nposition to continue to be able to do so. That would be disastrous for \nour intelligence gathering.\n  So, as I said, the fix is the legislation that passed the Senate. It \nis a good bill. It reauthorizes this program for 6 more years and adds \nthe one important additional element, and that is the protection from \nliability.\n  It also adds some additional civil liberties protections, by the way, \nfor Americans abroad. One of our colleagues, Senator Wyden, had \ninserted the provision that adds an extra layer of protection for an \nAmerican who might happen to be abroad and find himself or herself a \ntarget of some of this interception because of a call made to the \nindividual or that individual making a call to somebody else who is \nunder surveillance and so on. It is a rather rare occurrence, but we \nhave provided protections so that a warrant would have to be obtained \nin that circumstance, and Americans' civil liberties would be \nprotected.\n  So no one should be under the assumption here that somehow or other \nreauthorizing this law lets the Government loose to begin spying on \npeople. Believe me, there is so much information out there which we \ndon't even have the time or the ability to check out that we are not \ngoing to go out of our way to spy on people on whom we have no reason \nto spy. This is simply a matter of trying to identify those instances \nin which known terrorists, or people who affiliate with these \nterrorists abroad, are communicating with each other.\n  By the way, importantly, if that communication comes into the United \nStates, we want to know whom they are communicating with here because \nthat could be the late stages of an operation. That could be an \nindication that there is an element embedded in the United States--a \nterrorist cell, perhaps, that is ready or at least is in the process of \nplanning to engage in some kind of attack.\n  So these are the kinds of things we need to know about and which have \nprotected the American public since 2001. It is no accident that \nAmerica has not had an attack on our soil since 2001. It is also no \naccident that, frankly, the number of attacks in other places around \nthe world is far less than would have been the case had we and these \nother countries not had in place good intelligence-gathering operations \nand good cooperation, I might add, among our intelligence services once \nwe find out something that needs to be acted upon.\n  So as we debate these resolutions that focus on getting at al-Qaida--\nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle are insistent that we \nshould be focusing our efforts not on extraneous aspects of this war \nagainst terrorists but\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\non al-Qaida--I simply say to all of you that focusing on al-Qaida means \nfirst and foremost getting good intelligence on what they are up to. In \ntoday's modern world, that cannot be done without a reauthorization of \nthis law that enables us to collect this telecommunications \nintelligence. That is not going to happen unless the bill passes and is \nsent to the President. Every day that goes by that the House leadership \nsits on the legislation we here in the Senate passed and doesn't send \nthat to the President is another day of vulnerability. It is a day in \nwhich we will never get back the intelligence we might have collected.\n\n  This is not something where we can catch up. It is not something \nwhere it is not doing us any harm. As General Mukasey and Admiral \nMcConnell pointed out, it is lost information forever. That telephone \ncall we might have communicated is not going to happen again. Now, \nmaybe a subsequent call will, but we will never have the benefit of the \ncommunication that occurred yesterday or the day before or later on \ntoday because we don't have the ability to engage in that collection.\n  I can't think of anything more important to our national security \nthan getting this legislation adopted. It is one of the reasons we \nagreed with the majority leader's cloture petition to debate this \nquestion of how we should be focusing our effort on al-Qaida, because \nwe wanted to ensure that the American people understood what is at \nstake here and understood what is at risk by the House of \nRepresentatives not taking up and passing the Senate legislation on \nintelligence collections abroad.\n  Madam President, I hope the House leadership will take this up \nquickly, will get the bill to the President so that he can sign it into \nlaw and Americans will once again be protected by the most advanced \ntechniques and technologies we have.\n  I see my colleague from Tennessee is here, our distinguished \nconference chairman, and I will relinquish the floor so that he may \nspeak. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona, and \nI appreciate his remarks. I agree with his sentiments.\n  I might start with that. I thought the Congress got off to a pretty \ngood start this year. The President and the House of Representatives \nagreed on an economic stimulus package. All of us had different ideas \nabout it, but the President and the House agreed on something, sent it \nover here, and we had what I would call a principled debate about it--a \ndisagreement over whether to spend $40 billion more on it than the \nHouse-passed legislation, and the Senate objected to that. That was \ndropped. Then we passed it, sent it to the President, and he signed it. \nThat spirit of having a principled argument, resolving it, and helping \nthe American people got us off to a good start. We did the same thing \non the FISA legislation Senator Kyl, the Senator from Arizona, just \ndescribed. He was a major force in that. That was a principled debate \nas well.\n  Samuel Huntington, the distinguished Harvard professor who is the \nformer president of the American Political Science Association, says \nthat most of our conflicts in our democracy are conflicts between or \namong principles, with which most of us agree--for example, liberty and \nsecurity. Each American has a right to liberty, each American values \nsecurity, and we debated that here for nearly 6 months, from August \nthrough today: If we are going to intercept communications from \nterrorists overseas calling into this country, under what conditions \nmay we do that and still respect our traditions of liberty? Security \nversus liberty. Differences of opinion.\n  The Judiciary Committee got in the middle of it. The Intelligence \nCommittee was in the middle of it. In the end, the members of the \nIntelligence Committee produced a piece of legislation by a vote of 13 \nto 2, a bipartisan piece of work they believed respected liberty and \nsecurity--and after a good debate here on the floor of the Senate, \nnearly 70 Senators agreed. That is about as well as you can do in the \nSenate when you have a major difference of opinion. And off that went \nto the House of Representatives.\n  Well, if what happened here was an example of what Americans like to \nsee from their legislators, what happened in the House of \nRepresentatives is not what Americans like to see.\n  What I think most Americans want to see in Washington is not that we \nalways agree. I mean, this is a debating society. It is the Senate. The \nissues are here because we don't agree, in many cases. So we have these \ndebates on liberty versus security, for example, and then we resolve \nthem. We show that in the end we resolve them. That is what people \nlike.\n  Then it goes over to the House of Representatives. And let me put it \nin the words of some Tennessee folks last week. I was in Tennessee last \nweek when the Senate was out of session, and the most frequently asked \nquestion, the most frequently made comment went something like this--\nand I will paraphrase, but just a little bit:\n  Senator Alexander--someone in the back of the room at Ashland City \nmight rise and say--I have a question for you. How is it that the House \nof Representatives has time to investigate baseball, has time to play \npolitics with the White House staff members, has time to take a 10-day \nvacation, but doesn't have time to deal with an intelligence bill?\n  And I had to say to them: I am disappointed with what happened in the \nHouse of Representatives because it did so well with the economic \nstimulus package that I thought we were off to the kind of start the \nAmerican people would have agreed with.\n  So I believe most Americans understand that the failure to deal with \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation means this: It \nmeans fewer surveillances. It means fewer companies and individuals \nwilling to cooperate with our Government in overhearing conversations \nbetween those who would destroy us when they call in to our country to \ntalk about it. And it means we are less safe as a result of that.\n  My hope would be that we can deal with this Intelligence bill quickly \nand promptly. The House of Representatives is certainly capable of \nthat. There are good men and women there. We recognized that when we \nbasically adopted the House's economic stimulus package, with minor \nadjustments. Some Senators said: Well, the Senate ought to have a lot \nto say about that. Well, we--most of us in the Senate--are rarely \nguilty of an unexpressed thought, that is true, but it is not a bad \nidea for us also to recognize wisdom and good ideas when they come from \nthe other part of the Capitol. We saw in the economic stimulus package \nsome wise decision making and, for the most part, adopted it, with some \namendments.\n  My hope would be that the House of Representatives would do the same \nwith the Senate's 68-vote decision on the Intelligence bill. My \nunderstanding is that there is a majority of Democrats and Republicans \nin the House of Representatives today who agree with the Senate bill \nand who would vote for it if it were brought up. If they will do that, \nthat would be very helpful.\n  I see the Senator from Oklahoma is here. Would he like to make some \nremarks between now and 4 o'clock?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I would.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to take 4 or 5 minutes to say a word \nabout William Buckley and then turn the floor over to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield? I would like to know what the \nregular order is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \nSenator from Oklahoma be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to William F. Buckley, Jr.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the news came today that William F. \nBuckley died. For most Americans, that brings back a lot of memories. \nSince the early 1950s, he has been synonomous with public television. \n``God and Man at Yale'' was an important book, even though he was a \nvery young man when he wrote it. And William F. Buckley's style, his \nchoice of words, his manner of speaking, and his unfailing courtesy \nhave set an example for debaters of important issues in this country \nfor more than half a century.\n  In 1984, a couple of years after I had been a guest on ``Firing \nLine,'' which\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\nwas William Buckley's television show, I sat next to him at a dinner. \nIt was a Howard Baker fundraising roast in Washington, DC. William \nBuckley was the master of ceremonies.\n  I wrote about that visit in a little book I put out after I was \nGovernor called ``Steps Along the Way.''\n\n       ``When do you write?'' I asked him.\n       ``Anytime,'' he replied. ``Books are about the only thing I \n     write in a methodical way. I do them in Switzerland, after I \n     ski, between about 5:30 and 7 p.m.''\n       I told him that when our family had visited Chartwell, \n     Winston Churchill's former secretary said that Churchill \n     sometimes dictated 5,000 words in a night.\n       Buckley was surprised. ``I can do 1,100 or so in a couple \n     of hours,'' he said, ``Sometimes more, maybe up to 2,800 \n     words at a time, but 5,000 would be a very productive night. \n     With the advent of computer technology I can know exactly \n     what I do each time I write. For example, my last book took \n     112 hours.''\n       ``When do you make corrections?'' I asked him.\n       ``I do that in about thirty minutes the next morning, \n     before I go skiing.''\n       ``You mean that you finish off the last day's work so you \n     can be ready to start when you return from skiing?''\n       ``That's right. Then I send the transcript to five friends. \n     When the transcripts come back, I put the five edited \n     versions side by side and decide what changes to make.''\n       ``What about your columns?'' I asked him.\n       ``How long do they take to write?''\n       ``You mean after I get them in mind?'' He said.\n       ``Yes.''\n       ``About twenty to thirty minutes. Westbrook Pegler once \n     told me it took him eleven hours to do a column.''\n       ``Do you make changes?'' I asked him.\n       ``No.'' Said William Buckley.\n       ``I've been doing it for nineteen, no, twenty-two years. I \n     know the rhythm, the internal consistency of the column. I \n     have it down. I don't change it. That would be like asking a \n     jazz pianist to change his improvisation.''\n\n  That was William Buckley in 1984. He was a pianist. He really \npreferred the harpsichord, the clavichord. He told me he played Bach \nbecause you played what you loved the most. He loved music. He loved \ntalking. He loved people. He loved his family. He was, of course, a \nwonderful conservative leader. He changed the way many Americans \nthought about our Government and our society. And he always seemed to \nhave the right thing to say.\n  In 1996, after I had competed for the Presidency, I was at some \ndinner. He walked all of the way across the room. You never know what \nto say to someone who has lost an election. It is kind of like what do \nyou say to someone at a funeral? But he walked all the way across his \nroom and put his hand on my shoulder and said: That was a noble thing \nthat you did. That has always struck me as the one of the nicest things \nanybody has said to me after having lost an election.\n  So I will miss William Buckley. So will our country. So will the \nconservative movement. My family and I send our condolences to the \nBuckley family. We know they are proud of his life. They will miss him. \nI am glad to have these few minutes on the Senate floor to remember \nWilliam F. Buckley's contribution to our public life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand I have 15 minutes. I might wish to take a \nlittle bit longer than that. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as long as 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I was supposed to be \nrecognized next on our side. I was not going to speak long. I had \nrearranged an appointment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. You go ahead. I want to hear everything you have to say. \nLet me suggest that after the Senator from New Mexico, at the \nconclusion of his remarks, I be recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, might I say to the Senator from \nOklahoma, I greatly appreciate what you have done. I thank you very \nmuch.\n  I have always been in complete support of our troops who risk their \nlives every day to defend the United States of America. I voted for \nevery dollar requested to fully fund our troops and against every \neffort to dictate the tactics of war from the Halls of Congress.\n  However, last year I began to express my concerns about the \ndeteriorating conditions in Iraq and called on the Iraqi Government to \ndo more and to do more quickly. I pointed to benchmarks laid out by the \nPresident and Congress that had a great deal of resonancy to them and \nthat were rather unanimous in terms of support.\n  These were benchmarks on the ways that the Iraqi Government could and \nshould move its country forward. I am glad to say that since General \nPetraeus took charge in Iraq, conditions have improved and the \nbenchmarks have been met. I am glad to say that since General Petraeus \ntook charge in Iraq, conditions have improved.\n  Iraq's different sects are working together. There has been a renewed \nspirit of reconciliation among Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. A \ndebaathification law has been passed. Iraqis are taking an interest in \ntheir own safety and security, forming neighborhood watch groups and \nlooking out for each other.\n  There is no question, I know there are some who would not like to \nadmit the facts, but the facts are the facts. Things have changed since \nlast year in Iraq and they have changed for the better. I have briefly \noutlined how it happened and who made it happen.\n  There can be no doubt that the military hero of this war is General \nPetraeus. There can be no doubt he carries a heavy burden on his \nshoulders now to see if things can be wrapped up in a way that is good \nfor the Iraqis, good for the entire Middle East and obviously in many \nways would vindicate America's activities and what we have done there.\n  Iraqis are taking an interest in their own safety and security. They \nare forming neighborhood watch groups and are looking out for each \nother. One thing, and this kind of disturbs me, is that much of the \ninformation which I have to get, because I am not able to go to Iraq, \nis to talk to our own Senators who have been there. Because even though \nthings have changed, Baghdad is safe, we just are not getting the \ncoverage from the press of the United States or the press of the world \nthat the change deserves. Because everybody in America should know what \nI am saying in this speech.\n  The very simple fundamental things that have happened have happened \nsince General Petraeus set about with his approach that he told the \ncountry about. He named it. He told the President about it, and he did \nnot ask for too much in order to exhibit and exercise his leadership.\n  Moreover, an Iraqi Army brigade recently deployed itself for \noperations against al-Qaida. Partially because of these efforts, there \nis less violence in Iraq now than when the insurgency began.\n  The Iraqi Government has passed an amnesty law for the country's \nSunnis. Many said it would never be done. It was. The Government has \nfurther passed a budget--maybe we will not even pass ours this year, \nbut they passed theirs for $50 billion for 2008. That is a compromise \nbetween the Sunnis, the Shiites, and the Kurds. They were able to sit \ndown and solve their problems, their budget problems, and to pass a \nbudget.\n  That is truly significant and truly different and obviously indicates \nthat things have changed for the better. Oil revenues are going to \nIraq's provinces to fund reconstruction efforts. That is another one \neverybody said would never happen, they will never be able to reach \nagreement on that. They have.\n  Even the New York Times has noted progress in Iraq, reporting that \nthe newly passed legislation in Iraq:\n\n       Has the potential to spur reconciliation between Sunnis and \n     Shiites and set the country on a road to a more \n     representative government, starting with new provincial \n     elections.\n\n  That is something when the New York Times would choose to say that. \nThey have not covered it very well, but at least the words I read are \nwords found in the New York Times, which would clearly indicate that \neven they, they of little faith and they of quick judgment on the war \nin Iraq, had to say what I have quoted.\n  Now, I am proud to be here today to note this progress, the progress \nof the Iraqi Government, because it is the progress of the Iraqi \npeople, the people whom we went there to help.\n  It is their progress, their victory, their win. Yet we are proud it \nwas led by an American who has apparently an exceptional capacity in \nthese areas, the areas that festered and caused these people to remain \nfar apart until the last 18 months.\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\n  They have made significant, notable progress in the past 6 months and \nare on the right path to a stable and secure Iraq. General Petraeus and \nour soldiers deserve our thanks, our thanks and support for their \nefforts in Iraq and in the larger global war on terror.\n  I yield the floor and thank my friend once again for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I understand my friend is here wishing to speak. I have a \nquick unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 tonight, all postcloture debate \ntime be yielded back and the motion to proceed be withdrawn; the Senate \nthen proceed to the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 2634; \nfurther that the time until 6:30 p.m. be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with the final 20 minutes \nequally divided between the leaders, with the first half under the \ncontrol of the Republican leader and the final 10 minutes under the \ncontrol of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for all Members, we will have a vote at \n6:30 tonight on the second Feingold piece of legislation. Following \nthat, if cloture is invoked, of course, there is 30 hours on the motion \nto proceed. I have had a number of conversations today with the \ndistinguished Republican leader. He and I will discuss later this \nevening and tomorrow how we are going to work through the rest of this \nweek. My goal, as has been indicated a number of times over the last 24 \nhours on the Senate floor, is to make sure that sometime this week we \nare on the housing stimulus package, and we will do that. We will see \nif we can do it with an agreement rather than running out all the time.\n  As I indicated earlier today, I think the debate on this Iraq \nlegislation has been good. My friends on the minority side think the \nwar is going great. We have some concerns on this side.\n  Just in passing, I had a meeting in my office about an hour ago. We \nhave a wonderful facility being built in Las Vegas, a performing arts \ncenter. It will be wonderful. It will be like the Kennedy Center. They \nhave raised all but $50 million of this $475 million project. I told \nthose who were assembled: This is about the same amount of money being \nspent in 1 day in Iraq, the $420 million, the money they have raised.\n  It has been a good debate, a good discussion. I think it is good that \nthe body spend some time on this very important issue. One thing that \nhas been quite good, and I commend Senators on both sides, is it has \nbeen a very civil debate. We have a significant disagreement on the \nsituation in Iraq, but we have had a good debate. The American people \nshould feel good about the discussion. It has been very tempered and \ndictated by actual feelings on both sides.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me echo in part the majority \nleader's comments with regard to the process. As he has indicated, we \nwill have a vote at or around 6:30, and then he and I tomorrow will \ndiscuss how we move forward on the housing issue. It would be our \nintent to either get to a vote or get on, based upon a consent \nagreement, that subject matter no later than sometime at a civilized \nhour tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time at \n5:55 today--Senator McConnell and I have from 6:10 to 6:30. Senator \nFeingold has asked that he be recognized at 5:55 until we speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would like to take a little longer \nview of what is going on right now in the war for the liberation of \nIraq, the good things that are happening, the surge, and kind of go \nback to give a better perspective as to how we got here in the first \nplace.\n  There was this euphoria that was going around back in the early \n1990s: The Cold War is over, we don't need a military any longer. They \ntalked about such things as the peace dividend at that time, and this \nis what precipitated 9/11. The Clinton administration came in, and this \nis the amount of the actual DOD budget at that time. This was the \nbaseline. This is a very simple chart that tells us a lot. If we were \nto merely have maintained the level of defense spending as it took \nplace in the last year of the Bush 1 administration and then had \nnothing except the inflation rate, which wasn't all that great, it \nwould be this black line taking us up to fiscal year 2001. This was \nwhat would have happened if we didn't do anything else. But down here \nthe red line indicates where President Clinton made his budget request. \nThat was his annual DOD request. If you forget about the middle line, \nthe difference between his request and if we just maintained the same \nposition that we were in in fiscal year 1993, it would have been $412 \nbillion less; in other words, in that short timeframe, we would have \ncut defense real spending in constant dollars by $412 billion.\n  The Congress didn't let that happen. This middle line, the green \nline, is what actually was budgeted. So what we did was to say to the \nWhite House: You are not taking good enough care of our military needs. \nAnd so we raised it by about $99 billion over that period. That means \nthe real shortfall was $313 billion in that timeframe.\n  I show this chart because there was an attitude in this country at \nthat time that there weren't any real serious problems. People kept \nsaying we were the world's greatest superpower, and we appropriated \nmore money than anyone else. I wanted it to continue that way, but \nthere were some things that were going on that I would like to remind \nus of. That was called an acquisition holiday or a peace dividend. I \nthink it was more of a holiday in leadership at that time. \nInternational terrorism took to the forefront as bin Laden began his \nwar against freedom. Afghanistan was used as a training ground for \nterrorists, and the Taliban regime allowed al-Qaida unfettered \nmobility. We were on holiday. We were not fighting back. They took \nadvantage of this in some major attacks.\n  Somehow I think the memory of the American people isn't very long \nbecause they forgot about these attacks that were taking place. \nRemember the first attack on the World Trade Center was in 1993, \nFebruary 26. It was a car bomb that was planted in an underground \nparking garage below the World Trade Center, and that was way back in \n1993. In 1996, the Khobar Towers, we remember that well. They were \nbombed by Hezbollah with the intelligence pointing toward al-Qaida, \nstill al-Qaida. At the same time this was going on, in northern Africa \ntheir presence was visible at that time. Further on down in southern \nAfrica we had the Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. That was in \n1998. That was in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. It went unanswered at that \ntime. So we had all of this going up through 1998.\n  Then there is the year 2000, when suicide bombers used a boat to \nattack the USS Cole while it was moored in Yemen.\n  Yemen is right at the horn of Africa on the other side. And now we \nknow that as the squeeze has taken place, that has become a very \nprominent place for al-Qaida and for the terrorists. So you had \nDjibouti, we were starting to put troops in there, but we had that \nsuicide bombing. That was a major thing. It let us know, it reminded us \nthat we could have a ship, the USS Cole at that time, and have nothing \nbut just a little outrigger going out there and blowing it up and \ncausing the deaths and the damage that took place.\n  The response--this was back in the first of the Clinton years--was \npretty benign. It was restrained and at best inconsistent. Operation \nInfinite Reach included cruise missile attacks against Afghanistan and \nSudan. There was no real change. The administration was distracted at \nthat time. This inadequate response has been cited as a factor \nemboldening al-Qaida to undertake further plans. Yet we continued on \nour holiday at that time. In Operation Restore Hope, we became \nembroiled in Somalia, and we remember what happened in the streets of \nMogadishu when finally the people woke up when they saw the naked \nbodies dragged through the streets. President Clinton directed U.S. \nforces to stop all actions except those required in self-defense, and \nwe withdrew from the country shortly thereafter.\n  It is kind of hard for America to get in the habit of withdrawing. We \nstake out our position, and we have historically stood strong and \ncarried it out. In\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n1999, as a NATO member, the United States became involved in a bombing \ncampaign against Yugoslavia and a subsequent U.N. peacekeeping force. \nThe holiday that we were on at that time ignored the rising threats \nagainst our national security, mortgaged our military, leaving a bold \nchallenge for the next administration.\n  The first Rumsfeld confirmation was rather enlightening because what \nwe did at that time was to try to determine what our needs were going \nto be for the future. We had to rethink where we were before. And at \nthat time we were trying to reevaluate where we were. We were recalling \nsome of the bad things that had happened. We remember so well the 1991 \nPersian Gulf war. There was a group that went over, a bipartisan group. \nI remember Tony Coelho at the time. He had been the Democratic lead in \nthe House. I was in the House at the time. We had the first freedom \nfight, and we sent a group over to Kuwait. It was the day that the war \nwas officially over. The problem was the Iraqis didn't know that the \nwar was over at that time, and so we had the first freedom fight. We \nwent over there.\n  Al Haig, I ran into him the other day. We kind of relived that \nexperience we had over there. We had with us a very special guest. He \nwas the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States. He had his daughter. \nThey were a family of nobility. They had a palace on the Persian Gulf. \nBut, of course, they hadn't been there because that was a war zone, \nthat was Kuwait. So we went over there, this group of nine of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans, and I remember when the wind shifted, the \noil fields were still burning. It was a mess over there. But they \nwanted to go back, the Ambassador wanted to go back and see what their \nhouse looked like, if it had been damaged in the war.\n  When we got there, we found that his house had been used for one of \nSaddam Hussein's headquarters. His daughter, she was either 7, 8, or 9 \nyears old. I remember so well because she wanted to go up and see her \nbedroom and the dolls and all of that. We went up into this mansion on \nthe Persian Gulf, a beautiful place, only to find out that her bedroom \nhad been used as a torture chamber. There were body parts stuck to the \nwalls. I saw a little boy who had his ear cut off, maybe 6 or 7 years \nold, because they found him carrying a tiny American flag. That was \nback at the time when unconscionable murders were taking place where \nSaddam Hussein, after that was over, started killing anyone who was \nsuspect and torturing them to death. There are stories documented that \npeople would beg to be dropped, lowered into vats of acid head first so \nthey would die quicker.\n  Being put through grinding machines, like you are shredding \ndocuments; the open graves; the documentation of weddings that were for \na while taking place--many of them outdoors; that is the way they did \nit over in that area--and Saddam's sons, at that time they were alive \nand the regime was in there, they would go through and bust up weddings \nand rape all the girls and take them and bury them alive. I actually \nlooked down into those open graves, and people were so quick to forget \nwhat a monster he was.\n  I have often said, even if that had not happened, even if we did not \nhave the problems with the terrorist activity in Iraq and the fact that \nthey were training people in Iraq to be involved in terrorist \nactivity--al-Qaida was very prominent--that even if that had not been \nthe case, how could we as a country allow the hundreds of thousands of \npeople to be tortured to death in such a cruel way? I do not think we \ncould. Certainly, we could not if people had a chance to see it.\n  So the time went by, and they started talking about, of course, going \ninto this liberation movement in Iraq.\n  Now, there has been a lot of discussion over the years about weapons \nof mass destruction. Those of us who were over there--I would say to \nyou, Madam President, that while I have not been this many times to \nIraq, I have actually been in the area 27 different trips--27 different \ntimes. Sometimes it was at CENTCOM, sometimes the Horn of Africa and \nother areas. But, see, the terrorist activity and the war was not just \nin Iraq. It was in the whole surrounding area. So in all those times I \nwas there, I had a chance to, on a firsthand basis, see what was \ninvolved.\n  We know we had to go in there. We know we had to go in there and \nfinish what had been started in Iraq.\n  Now, there are three things that were started. No. 1, we had to \nliberate Iraq from a tyrannical leader--we have already talked about \nhim--No. 2, eliminate a safe haven for terrorists and their training \ncamps; and then, No. 3, to help the Iraqi people create a free and \ndemocratic country strategically located right in the Middle East where \nwe have the greatest needs.\n  Well, No. 1, the liberation of Iraq: After the first Persian Gulf \nwar, I told you, we had what we called the first freedom flight into \nKuwait. But that liberation was necessary to put an end to Saddam \nHussein's regime of torture.\n  Now, when they talked about weapons of mass destruction, yes, weapons \nof mass destruction were not found. We know they were there. They were \nused on the Kurds in the north. Saddam Hussein used weapons of mass \ndestruction to painfully murder thousands of his own people using gas \nthat burned them alive. That was happening. But, nonetheless, for those \nof us who were aware, that was not the real reason.\n  If you look at the second reason, that Iraq was a major terrorist \ntraining area--a lot of us are familiar with Samarra and Ramadi, but \nsome have forgotten or may have never even known about some of the \nother areas.\n  Sargat was an international terrorist training camp in northeastern \nIraq near the Iranian border, run by Ansar al-Islam, a known terrorist \norganization. Based on information from the U.S. Army Special Forces, \noperators who led the attack on Sargat said: It is indeed more than \nplausible that al-Qaida members trained in that particular training \ncamp.\n  Now, one of the interesting places where this was taking place was a \nplace called Salman Pak. In Salman Pak they had--and I think it is \nstill there to this day--on the ground an old fuselage of a 707, and \nthat was used to train people on how to hijack airplanes. I have often \nwondered if that could have been where the perpetrators of 9/11 got \ntheir training. I have no way of knowing. We never will know. But we do \nknow this: That location, along with the problems in Sargat, had major \ntraining areas for the terrorists. So we were able to shut those down. \nI would say this: That alone would be enough motivation for us to go \nand liberate the people of Iraq.\n  But the third one is to help the Iraqi people create a free and \ndemocratic country. Iraq is trying to do what we tried to do 230 years \nago. They are risking their lives, as we risked our lives some 230 \nyears ago. They are seeking a constitution, a parliament, freedom, and \ndemocracy. These are things they are trying to accomplish.\n  I think of that first election that took place out in Fallujah, when \nthe Iraqi security forces were going to vote. I was there. I was in \nFallujah actually for all three elections, I believe. But I remember \nthe Iraqi security forces in that first election. Everybody remembers \nthe purple fingers so they could identify who was voting in those \nelections. And these guys--the security forces--went out and voted the \nday before the elections. They did not wait for the elections. They \nwere doing it the day before so they would be there on election day to \nprovide the security.\n  People were risking their lives to go out and vote. We know the cases \nof people being attacked by the terrorists to keep them from voting. \nThey were easy to identify because of the purple fingers. But these \nguys were gladly going in there at that time, going to vote, and then \nreturning the next day to protect our people who were there.\n  Our men and women serving in Iraq are providing the Iraqis the same \ninspiration our forefathers provided us. Iraq is becoming an example to \nthe world of how to reject terror and confront those who practice it. \nThe world sees now the Iraqi citizens are realizing their potential, \nsigning up as Concerned Citizens, sons of Iraq--72,000.\n  It is a pretty amazing thing when you look and see that instead of \nthe mass graves and all these things, you are seeing a mass \nparticipation in Iraq. They are returning to normalcy now. A lot of \npeople are asking: Is the surge really working? I do not believe anyone \nis out there who can conscientiously deny that the surge has worked.\n  It was about a year ago that General Petraeus went in. What happened? \nThree things happened. One was that\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\nPetraeus--by far, the greatest guy for the job out there; and I do not \nthink anyone except moveon.org disagrees with that now--that Petraeus \ntook over. Secondly, the surge, in certain strategic areas, increased \nin numbers. But the third thing that happened was there have been so \nmany resolutions like the one that is before us right now that I refer \nto as ``resolutions of surrender'' that got the attention of a lot of \nthe religious leaders.\n  I often draw a distinction from my own personal experience. I have \nmet with the political leaders, of course, like all the other Members \nwho have gone over there. I have done it more because I have been there \nmore times. But the religious leaders are the ones who have the \ngreatest impact on what is going on in Iraq. Up until--and this is a \nstatement no one has refuted--up until about a year ago, our defense \nintelligence people would attend and monitor the Friday night mosque \nmeetings that took place throughout Iraq. These are with the clerics \nand the imams, the religious leaders. Prior to that time, 85 percent of \nthe messages that were preached, I guess you would say, in the mosques \nwere anti-American. To my knowledge, there has not been an anti-\nAmerican message given from a mosque in Iraq since last April because \nthey realize if we leave, then the terrorists will move in.\n\n  So that is why we are getting--it has been talked about by many \npeople on the Senate floor--the attitudinal change. The neighborhood \nwatch programs--in my hometown of Tulsa, OK, we have a neighborhood \nwatch program. We have them in Washington. They have them over there, \nwith private citizens who have the courage to go out without any arms \nand confront terrorists; where they can, through their own intelligence \nand sheer numbers, determine where there are RPGs and IEDs that are not \ndetonated, and then they identify them by little orange paint cans, \nwhere they draw a circle around there, and then we can go in there and \ndetonate these and save many lives.\n  Well, we are today experiencing all that help. I can remember when \nour troops who were working out of Baghdad would come back to the Green \nZone every night. They do not do that anymore. They go out and they \nactually bed down and live with the Iraqi security forces and their \nfamilies, develop intimate relationships with them. It is a totally \ndifferent thing there altogether.\n  I can remember there was not a way in the world you could walk \nthrough the markets in Baghdad. The last time I was there, I walked \nthrough, and I intentionally did not take anybody with me except an \ninterpreter because I did not want to give that image that you have to \nhave armed guards and all that, and I remember stopping and talking to \npeople. I like to single out people who are holding babies. They have \nthis love for us that they did not have before.\n  So we now see these changes that are taking place. We see that basic \neconomics is taking root and Iraqis are spending money on Iraqi \nprojects. Iraqis are taking back control of their country. We are \nhelping the Iraqi people create a free and democratic country where \nrepresentation and the rule of law are replacing coercion and terror.\n  The Iraqi Parliament has passed legislation that reforms \ndebaathification. They have enacted pension reform that allows former \nBaathists to collect their pension. They have enacted laws defining \nprovincial and central government roles and responsibilities to \ndelineate what each person is supposed to do--the distinction between \nthe police and the security forces, what their functions are, what \ntheir missions are.\n  They passed a 2008 budget. They did it sooner than we did it in this \ncountry. They enacted an amnesty law that could lead to the release of \nthousands of detainees, removing a stumbling block standing in the way \nof reconciliation.\n  More than any previous legislation, these new initiatives have the \npotential to spur reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites and set the \ncountry on the road to a more representative government, starting with \nnew provincial elections.\n  Now, in the future, where do we go from here? Our Nation has paid, \nand continues to pay, a heavy price. People in this Chamber have talked \nabout the heavy price. They are right. It is not cheap. It is very \nexpensive. We have paid a heavy price in dollars and lives, with our \nsons and daughters and brothers and sisters. We are doing a difficult \nthing. But just as Americans have always tried to do the right thing, \nwe are doing the right thing in Iraq.\n  Iraq is at a decisive turning point in their journey toward \ndemocracy. The fight in Iraq is not about today or tomorrow but about \nmany tomorrows to come and about the future. It is about our \ngrandchildren's grandchildren and the world they will live in.\n  It is not just Iraq. Right now, a lot of concern is taking place as \nto Iran and Ahmadinejad and some of the political leaders and the \nthings they are promoting. One of the greatest obstacles they have in \nIran is they are right next door to Iraq, and there are so many people \nwho share family members, and they are looking over wistfully and \nseeing that people are getting married without the disruptions, that \ngirls are actually getting an education. This is not the Iraq they knew \nbefore. So these things are happening.\n  Secretary Gates said:\n\n       If we were to withdraw, leaving Iraq in chaos, al Qaeda \n     almost certainly would use Anbar province . . . as another \n     base from which to plan operations not only inside Iraq, but \n     first of all in the neighborhood and then potentially against \n     the United States.\n\n  Al-Qaida is not the only threat to America and our ideals. I \nmentioned a minute ago Ahmadinejad. He said, on August 28, 2007--just a \nshort while ago--\n\n       Soon, we will see a huge power vacuum in the region.\n\n  Now, what he was talking about is the type of resolution we are \nconsidering right now. He is saying a cut-and-run resolution would \ncreate a huge power vacuum. What else did he say? He said that \nexpecting this defeatism, expecting that we would vote for this--which \nwe are not. We are not going to vote for this resolution. We know that. \nWe have had the same resolution voted down 71 to 24 the last time we \nhad a vote on it. But, nonetheless, he said: ``Of course, we are \nprepared to fill the gap. . . .''\n  So you have Iran filling the gap that would be there if we were to \nget up and leave in the victorious moments we are having now.\n  Iran's nuclear work continues, including recent doubling of their \nenrichment of uranium, which could easily be used as part of a nuclear \nweapons program, a decision in the hands of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n  In the last 2 years Iran has continued to develop ballistic missile \ntechnology, launching missiles over 2,000 kilometers.\n  Coalition forces have intercepted Iranian arms shipments in Iraq, \nincluding materials that are used to make explosively formed \npenetrators, the EFPs, the most deadly of the IEDs, which are being \nused against American troops. This is what Iran is doing today.\n  Coalition forces have also detained Iranian agents in Iraq. A lack of \na secure and stable Iraq means instability in the Middle East and a \nclear avenue for terror and oppression to spread. Instability in the \nMiddle East will continue to spread, as it already has, into Africa, \nAsia, and Europe, and ultimately find its way to our shores.\n  We know what is happening right now in Africa. I know probably more \nthan some of the others do, because I have seen firsthand. I have sat \ndown and talked with such Presidents as President Museveni in Uganda. I \nhave talked to Prime Minister Meles in Somalia--in Ethiopia, and many \nof the others, including John Kufuor in Ghana, all about the threat \nthey face of terrorism all throughout Africa. In our infinite wisdom \nhere, it was our decision a few years ago to go in and help the \nAfricans build five African brigades, so that as this moves into their \narea, they are able to fight off terrorism without using our troops. We \nhave such programs as the 1206, 1207, and 1208, where we are arming and \nequipping, training and equipping programs for these countries. These \nare things we are helping them do so we can avoid having to be on the \nfront lines of the battle against the terrorists. They can do that too.\n  Patrick Henry said:\n\n       We shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God \n     who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will \n     raise up friends to fight our battles with us.\n\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\n\n  That is what is happening over there at this time.\n  So the coalition forces have been doing a great job, and right now we \nare observing the successes of the surge. They watch with great \ninterest as defeatist legislation is repeatedly brought up on the \nfloor, hoping that Congress will do what they cannot: give them victory \nin Iraq and the Middle East. So we must not try to micromanage our \nmilitary. One of the two bills that is on the floor right now would \nactually micromanage it. It is as if we in our infinite wisdom in the \nSenate are smarter than General Petraeus, General Odierno, and all of \nthe professionals. Yes, I was in the U.S. Army many years ago, so I \nhave some hands-on experience in this type of thing, certainly not that \nof the professionals. The worst thing we can do is try to micromanage \nour military and place restrictions on them, telling them how many \ntroops they should withdraw and what our troop strength should be over \nthere, and at the same time anything we do over here, the enemy knows \nwe are doing it also. Our professional warriors want to and can succeed \nwith our support.\n  That is what this is all about. I have no doubt in my mind we will \ndefeat these things. In a way, I am glad Senator Feingold brought these \nbills to the floor, because this gives us a forum to talk to the \nAmerican people about things they may not be getting in the media. It \nis interesting that it used to be when I went over to Iraq, the first \nthing the kids over there would ask me is why doesn't the media like \nme. They don't talk that way anymore. Even people who were anti this \nadministration, people such as Katie Couric, went over and observed \nwhat is going on. Once you go and observe, you can see we are winning, \nthis is working, and this liberation is taking place.\n  I know my 30 minutes has expired, but we are here to continue what we \nhave started. The worst thing we could do right now is to take success \nout of the hands of the military who are successfully winning the \nliberation of Iraq and start to micromanage this politically from the \nSenate floor. This isn't going to happen. We are winning over there \nnow. It is so refreshing, after all these years. Yes, it has been a \nlong time. People keep reminding us this is longer than World War II. I \nknow that, because each year I have had an opportunity to spend time \nover there, quality time, and see the changes that are taking place via \nthe plan of this genius named David Petraeus, it is working. So we \ndon't want to get in their way, and we won't get in their way, and we \nwill go ahead and defeat these bills and let the military run the \nliberation as they see fit, and we are going to join them in our \nvictory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I know we are on a 30-hour postcloture \nperiod dealing with a piece of legislation related to Iraq. I want to \nspeak about something else today, but let me at least begin by \ndescribing a somewhat different view.\n  The fact is, Saddam Hussein was hung until he was dead, hung by his \nneck, and this brutal tyrant is dead. I suppose most of us wish that \nOsama bin Laden had been brought to justice, but it is Saddam Hussein \nwho has been brought to justice in the country of Iraq. He is dead. The \nIraqis have their own Constitution because they voted for it. The \nIraqis have their own Government because they voted for it. The \nAmerican taxpayer has spent $16 billion training 350,000 police and \nsoldiers in Iraq for security purposes. Now the question is: Do the \nIraqis who have been trained for police protection and security--both \nin the police force and as soldiers--do they have the will to provide \nfor their own security? If they do not, this country cannot do it for \nany great length of time.\n  We have been in Iraq for almost 5 years. Some day we are going to \nleave Iraq. The question is not whether; the question is when and how. \nThe American people are not going to have us in Iraq for 10 and 15 and \n20 years. That is not the case. We are spending massive amounts of \nmoney, about $16 billion a month. Last year the President asked for \nmore than $190 billion in emergency funding for the war. That is $16 \nbillion a month, $4 billion a week.\n  It is time we begin to understand we have needs here at home, to \nbegin taking care of things here at home. We are spending money on \nhundreds of water projects in Iraq. We are spending money on road-\nbuilding in Iraq. We are spending money on health clinics in Iraq. Yet \nwe get a President's budget sent to us saying we don't have enough \nmoney for those things in our country. We will dramatically cut water \nprojects in the United States. We will cut back on all of these \ninvestments in the United States, even as we are making those \nsubstantial investments in the country of Iraq.\n\n  My point is that at some point we are going to have to bring American \ntroops home. We can't keep doing as the President suggests, and that is \nspending emergency money by sending soldiers to Iraq and putting this \non top of the debt so that when those soldiers come back from Iraq, \nthey can help pay the debt. That is not the right way to approach what \nis happening in the country of Iraq.\n  All of us want the same thing for our country. We want our country to \nsucceed. We want our country to confront and defeat terrorists. Yes, we \nwant Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden is the person who heads al-Qaida. \nWe are told by the Director of National Intelligence that he is safe \nand secure in northern Pakistan. There ought not be one square inch on \nthe face of this Earth that is safe or secure for those who murdered \nAmericans on 9/11. Yet more than 6 years later, this administration has \nnot brought the leader and the leadership of the terrorist organization \nthat attacked our country to justice. That is a failure, in my \njudgment, and it is a failure that results from taking our eye off the \nball and having too few troops in Afghanistan and allowing Osama bin \nLaden to escape through Tora Bora, and then invading Iraq and \ncommitting ourselves to that over a lengthy period of time. The result \nis the greatest terrorist threat--according to the National \nIntelligence Estimate, the greatest terrorist threat against our \ncountry at this point is the leadership of al-Qaida. They are in a safe \nand secure haven in northern Pakistan. It seems to me that 7 years \nafter 9/11, that has to be considered a failure. My hope would be all \nof us would engage in ways that begin to devote our attention to the \ngreatest terrorist threat facing our country, and that is, as the \nNational Intelligence Estimate says, the leadership of al-Qaida. They \nare recruiting and building new training camps and strengthening \nthemselves even as we are tied down in the country of Iraq spending $16 \nbillion a month.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business \nfor 15 minutes on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Medal of Honor for Woodrow Wilson Keeble\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a picture of a man named Woodrow \nWilson Keeble, a Sioux Indian. Woodrow Wilson Keeble died 26 years ago. \nIf you take a look at this soldier's medals, you will see two Bronze \nStars, a Silver Star, the Distinguished Service Cross, the second \nhighest medal given in our country, and Purple Hearts.\n  I want to tell my colleagues about Woody Keeble, a big man, well over \n6 foot, and well over 200 pounds. On Monday of next week at 2:30 in the \nafternoon, at the White House, President Bush will present the Medal of \nHonor to Woody Keeble. As I said, he has been dead for 26 years. His \nwife Blossom Keeble died last summer. We had hoped this would be done \nbefore his wife died, but that was not to be the case.\n  I want to tell my colleagues about him because it is so unusual that \na Medal of Honor will be presented posthumously to a soldier who \ndemonstrated great acts of courage and heroism in both the Second World \nWar and the Korean war.\n  He was a Lakota Sioux born in Waubay, SD, and grew up in Wahpeton, \nND, and lived most of his life there. He was wounded at least twice in \nWorld War II and three times in the Korean War. Let me describe what he \ndid so that my colleagues will know why he is being given the Medal of \nHonor all of these years later.\n  In World War II Woody Keeble served with the famed 164th Infantry \nRegiment of the North Dakota National Guard. Shortly after joining in \n1942, he found himself on Guadalcanal, in some\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\nof the most aggressive and dangerous hand-to-hand combat in the Second \nWorld War. He was in combat in the South Pacific until the war ended. \nHe saw a great deal of combat. One of his fellow soldiers said the \nsafest place to be was next to Woody. Woody earned a Bronze Star and \nPurple Heart in the Second World War. Woody was an unbelievable \nsoldier.\n  Then the Korean War came along and at age 34 this Lakota Sioux Indian \nsigned up again. He said: Somebody has to teach the kids how to fight. \nSo he went to Korea. He was attached to George Company, 2nd Battalion, \n19th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Division. They were near the Kumsong \nRiver in North Korea in October of 1951. He was the acting platoon \nleader of the 1st platoon of ``G'' Company. Casualties were very heavy. \nBecause the company's officers were killed, he ended up in charge of \nthe 1st Platoon, the 2nd Platoon, and the 3rd Platoon. It was brutally \ncold in North Korea at the time, and the enemy, the Chinese, were \nentrenched on a hill with a rugged cliff, and the side of that mountain \nwas a very difficult thing that the U.S. troops had to take.\n  So Woody Keeble, in charge of these three platoons, made three \nattempts to take that hill from the Chinese. The Chinese had three \nmachine gun nests on top of the hill and soldiers in trenches defending \nthat hill. Three times these platoons, with Woody leading them, went up \nthe hill, and three times they were repulsed and rejected, with heavy \ncasualties.\n  After three attempts to take that hill, Woody Keeble decided he would \ntry it by himself. With grenades and a Browning Automatic Rifle he \ncrawled back up the hill to the Chinese positions. Witnesses said he \ncrawled through very heavy machine gun fire and through a blizzard of \ngrenades. Woody Keeble scaled the hill, went around the pillboxes and \nknocked out all three machine guns by himself and then cleared out the \ntrenches between them. When he returned they extracted 83 pieces of \nshrapnel from his body--83 pieces of shrapnel. But he wouldn't leave \nthe battlefield until all of his men were on top of the hill and in a \ndefensive position and only then would he allow himself to be \nevacuated.\n  Right after the engagement all of the surviving members of G Company \nsigned a letter putting him in for the Medal of Honor. It got lost and \nnever got from the battlefield to the Pentagon. They did it a second \ntime a month later and it too never got from the battlefield to the \nPentagon.\n  But in this photo, my colleagues can see the medals he did get: \nmultiple Purple Hearts, wounded five times; two Bronze Stars, a Silver \nStar; the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest medal. He was \na well-decorated soldier. He went to Korea to help teach those kids how \nto fight and it turns out he is the one who climbed the hill and saved \nhis soldiers, knocked out three machine gun nests by himself.\n  Many years later the question was asked: Why was he not given the \nMedal of Honor? Those with whom he served began piecing together the \naction that day, all of those who were eyewitnesses and a part of the \naction on that hill in North Korea.\n  A woman named Merry Helm especially took it upon herself over the \nyears to try to reconstruct Woody's story. It took a lot of time to do \nso. Then it was sent to the U.S. Secretary of the Army with a request \nthat he review the original request that had never been received at the \nPentagon that Woody Keeble be awarded the Medal of Honor.\n  The Secretary of the Army looked into the case and decided that Woody \nKeeble had indeed earned the Medal of Honor. The Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs agreed.\n  But then all the people involved were informed that there is a 3-year \nstatute of limitations on the request for a Medal of Honor. The \nSecretary of defense could only consider Woody's case if that statute \nof limitations was waived.\n  At the request of those who had worked on it, I and my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad, and our colleagues from South Dakota, \nSenator Johnson and Senator Thune, introduced legislation on an \nappropriations bill that waived the 3-year statute so the Secretary of \nthe Defense could look at this case and decide.\n  The Secretary of the Defense began evaluating what happened on that \nhill in North Korea on a cold day when Woody Keeble was a real hero. He \neventually decided, having looked at all the information, that, indeed, \nthis Lakota Sioux Indian who served this country in two wars, was \nwounded five times, deserved the Medal of Honor. He sent it to the \nWhite House with the recommendation that the President approve the \nMedal of Honor.\n  This coming Monday, at 2:30 in the afternoon, I will be at the White \nHouse witnessing a ceremony at the invitation of the President in which \nthe President Bush will present a Medal of Honor posthumously to a \nreally remarkable, courageous American soldier named Woodrow Wilson \nKeeble, the only Sioux Indian ever to have received the Medal of Honor, \nsomeone who served this country with unbelievable courage and \ndistinction and valor.\n  After the Korean war, he came back to Wahpeton, ND, and worked at the \nWahpeton Indian School much of his life. He suffered multiple strokes, \nsuffered significant health problems, and died 26 years later.\n  The moment won't pass without some notice because the President is \nmaking a presentation on Monday. However, I wanted to say something \nhere on the floor of the Senate so those who read the Record of the \nSenate will understand this was an extraordinary American.\n  We are hearing a lot of discussion these days about the bill on the \nfloor of the Senate dealing with Iraq and about who stands up for \nsoldiers, who cares about American soldiers. The fact is, every single \nperson in this Chamber cares about American soldiers and wants to \nsupport them, understands that they get up in the morning in some parts \nof this world--in Iraq especially--and they strap on body armor before \nthey go out because they know there is a chance they can be killed or \nharmed. All of us understand what soldiers are doing for this country. \nI believe the one thing that unites this Chamber is we want to do right \nby American soldiers. The story of Woody Keeble is a story that ought \nto inspire all of us about what soldiers do for our country.\n  I have told my colleagues previously about another soldier, another \nAmerican Indian. His name was Edmund Young Eagle. He was from the \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe of North Dakota. He went to war. He was in \nnorthern Africa, he was in Normandy, he was in Europe. He came back and \nlived with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He never had very much. He \nhad kind of a tough life.\n  At the end of his life, he was lying in a hospital bed at the VA \nhospital in Fargo, ND. His sister asked if I would get the medals he \nearned in the Second World War and never received. I did, and I took \nthem to the VA hospital on a Sunday morning in Fargo, ND. The doctors \nand nurses crowded into his room, and Edmund Young Eagle--who at the \ntime I didn't know was going to die 7 days later of lung cancer. Edmund \nYoung Eagle was a sick man but very proud that morning. We cranked his \nbed up to a seated position, and then I pinned on his pajama top a row \nof medals this American Indian had earned serving his country in the \nSecond World War. As sick as he was, he said quietly to me: This is one \nof the proudest days of my life--seated on his hospital bed wearing his \npajama tops with his military medals.\n  There are so many whose names we will not talk about on the floor of \nthe Senate today, but I do say Woody Keeble and Edmund Young Eagle are \njust two of thousands--millions of American soldiers over the years who \nhave refreshed this democracy by being willing to risk their lives.\n  I wanted to call to the attention of the Senate Woodrow Wilson \nKeeble. I am enormously proud of him and his family and his memory, and \nI am anxious to be at the White House on Monday when he receives \nposthumously the Medal of Honor.\n\n\n                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wish to make a couple of additional \ncomments on another subject.\n  The price of oil is bouncing around at $100 a barrel, the price of \ngas is up to $3.00, $3.50, or more per gallon. There are people who kid \nabout having to take out a loan at the bank to fill their gas tank. The \nquestion is, What is happening with oil?\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n  Let me tell you something. In the Energy & Natural Resources \nCommittee this year, we have had witnesses testify that there is not a \nbit of justification for the price of a barrel of oil to be over $50 or \n$65 a barrel right now. So why is it $100 a barrel? Two reasons. One is \nthat we have unbelievable speculation, a carnival of greed, with hedge \nfunds and speculators neck deep in the futures markets speculating on \noil. We have investment banks for the first time that are actually \nbuying oil storage tanks so they can buy the oil and keep it off the \nmarket in order to sell it later when the price is higher. There is \nunbelievable speculation in the futures market pushing up oil which has \nnothing to do with the fundamentals of supply and demand, and there \nought to be a full and complete investigation. I am asking the GAO to \ndo that.\n  The other issue is one that I find preposterous, and I am going to do \neverything I can in the coming days and weeks to stop it. Do you know \nthat even as the price of oil is bouncing up at $100 a barrel of oil, \nthis Government, this Department of Energy is putting oil underground \nfor storage? We are awarding royalty-in-kind contracts to companies to \ntake oil out of the Gulf of Mexico and instead of them selling the oil \nand putting it into the supply to put downward pressure on price, we \nare putting 60,000 barrels every single day underground in the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. Having the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is \nfine. Save it for a rainy day, save for our security, put some away--I \nunderstand that. But why would you do that when oil prices are $100 per \nbarrel? The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 97 percent full, and we are \ntaking 60,000 barrels per day and sticking it underground? That is \npreposterous. Toward the second half of this year, the Department of \nEnergy will be putting approximately 125,000 barrels per day \nunderground. There ought not be one additional barrel go underground at \nthat point. It ought to go into the supply.\n\n  I used to teach a little economics. I understand supply and demand. \nIf you decrease supply, you increase price. It is just a fact. So this \nadministration, by taking this royalty-in-kind oil from the Gulf of \nMexico and sticking it underground into the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, is pushing up the price of oil and gas.\n  In fact, we had a witness in the Energy & Natural Resources Committee \nwho testified that the Department of Energy is taking light, sweet \ncrude off the market to put into the SPR. That is a subset of oil, a \nmuch more valuable kind of oil. One witness said just that amount--\nsticking it underground by this administration could have increased the \nprice of oil by as much as $10 per barrel. What is our Government doing \nincreasing the price of oil by 10 per barrel? What do they think? Does \nsomebody have their wires crossed someplace, and could they please see \nif they can figure out maybe with some common sense what they ought to \ndo when oil is $100 a barrel, and that is stop putting oil underground \nand put it into the marketplace so we put some downward pressure on gas \nprices?\n  I introduced legislation that puts an end to this practice. I am \nchairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Energy \nDepartment's programs, including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I say \nto the Secretary and to those who made this decision: One way or \nanother, I am going to win on this issue. We are not going to allow you \nto continue to stick oil underground when the price of oil is $100 a \nbarrel and the price of gas is ranging up between $3.50 and $4 a \ngallon. We are just not going to allow you to continue to do that. This \nCongress is going to use some common sense and say stop it.\n  Mr. President, that was therapeutic to say. My hope would be that at \nsome point soon I will have a chance to offer that amendment, and we \nare all going to have a chance to vote on it. I will insist we vote on \nit. I believe this Congress is going to tell this administration to \nstop it, use a reservoir of common sense; don't stick oil underground \nwhen it's $100 per barrel. Put it into the supply, and put downward \npressure on the price of oil. How about standing up for the American \npeople and American drivers? Let's do that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, is there any prearranged agreement on \nthe speaking order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order that the Senator from \nWisconsin will be recognized at 5 minutes to 6. There is no other \nsequence.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I see my colleague from California. I would like to \nspeak for a few minutes. We are shortly coming to the hour. I don't \nknow if we have been alternating back and forth.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I only need to speak for less than 10 \nminutes, if I may, because I have been sitting here for a very long \ntime.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, the time of the agreement says at 5 \no'clock the Senator from Wisconsin gets the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, at 5:55.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. At 5:55. I thought the Presiding Officer said 5 \no'clock. I will be happy to yield. I ask unanimous consent that after \nthe Senator from California speaks, I be allowed to speak and then my \ncolleague from South Carolina be allowed to follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague. I will \nbe brief because the message I have is a pretty straightforward \nmessage; that is, it is time for a change in Iraq. It has been a long \ntime coming. We have been there 5 years, longer than we were in World \nWar II, and it is time for a change in Iraq. It is time for a good \nchange. What does that mean? It means that it is time for the Iraqis to \nstand up and fight for themselves.\n  We know the violence there continues. We know that 15 percent of that \nviolence is being perpetrated by foreign fighters, al-Qaida, and the \nrest--85 percent--is Iraqi-on-Iraqi ethnic violence. If the Iraqis are \nnot ready to stop hurting each other and blowing each other up, if they \nare not ready to give that up, then we need to be ready to start \npulling our troops out. It is pretty clear to me after 5 years that all \nour presence is doing at this point is acting as a recruiting tool for \nal-Qaida. Because we have this open-ended commitment--some on the other \nside are talking about 50 to 100 years--there really is not anything on \nour side to exert that leverage on the Iraqis. They are not fulfilling \nthe benchmarks in the Government that this administration said they had \nto do.\n  Here we have a situation where we have now lost 3,972 fighters on our \nside. Twenty-one percent of those were either born in California or \nwere based in California. 29,275 Americans have been wounded, some of \nthem grievously wounded, many more have traumatic brain injury and \npost-traumatic stress. The suicide rate is off the charts.\n  There is no way out. There is no plan. There never has been a plan. \nIt seems to me this open-ended commitment has to stop, and the Feingold \nbill essentially says we are going to have a very responsible \nwithdrawal. There is no end date, but we are going to start it within \n120 days of enactment of the bill, and we are going to shift the \nmission so that it continues training Iraqis.\n  By the way, I don't know if I mentioned this, the taxpayers of our \ncountry have paid to train 440,000 Iraqis.\n  We are spending $10 billion a month. That leads me to my final point \nof why I wanted this time this afternoon.\n  We have to start looking at what this is costing us. I say it is time \nfor America. We are shortchanging our children. We need to provide \nhealth insurance to many of our children. To provide health insurance \nto 10 million uninsured children for 5 years would cost us what it \ncosts for 5\\1/2\\ months in Iraq. To enroll all eligible 3- to 4-year-\nolds in Head Start for 1 year would cost us 3 months in Iraq. To enroll \n2.5 million kids in afterschool programs--and, boy, do I have a feeling \nfor that one because I worked with Senator Ensign to set up the first \nafterschool program, and it has been shorted. For 7 days in Iraq, we \ncan enroll 2.5 million kids in afterschool programs for 1 year.\n  What else can I tell you about the funding? We are shortchanging \nAmerica's workers. We can immediately replace structurally deficient \nbridges in the United States and create more than 3 million good-paying \njobs for 6\\1/2\\ months of the cost in Iraq. Don't you think our workers \ndeserve it? I do.\n  We could extend 13 additional weeks of unemployment insurance to the\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\nchronically unemployed workers in high-unemployment States. One month \nin Iraq.\n  We could help an additional 1 million families keep their heat on \nthis winter through the LIHEAP program. One day in Iraq, Madam \nPresident.\n  My colleagues come here and they have no end in sight for Iraq. Open \ncheckbook for Iraq. Iraq in the morning, Iraq in the afternoon, Iraq at \nnight, Iraq for 20 years, 50 years, maybe 100 years, as one Senator \nsaid. We can't afford it anymore.\n  OK, let's look at what else we could do. For those people like myself \nwho care about homeland defense, for 6 weeks in Iraq we could ensure \nfull interoperability of all our communication systems. Our firemen \ncould talk to our policemen, who could talk to our sheriffs, who could \ntalk to our hospitals, who could talk to our Red Cross. Six weeks in \nIraq. We could provide first responders with 3 million communications \ndevices for 1 month in Iraq. We could provide firefighters with 12 \nmillion breathing devices for 1 month in Iraq.\n  Finally, if you care about America's environment, as I do, and many \nof the people I represent do, we could extend renewable energy \nproduction tax credits for 4 years. We could do those tax cuts for \ninvestments in renewables for 3 weeks in Iraq. For less than 3 days we \ncould erase the Superfund backlog. And for less than 1 day we could \ntriple the Energy bill authorization to train green-collar workers.\n  The American people have got to connect the dots here. We can't take \ncare of our own. We can't take care of our kids. We can't do what we \nhave to do for our workers. We can't do what we have to do for our \nbusinesses. We can't do what we have to do for our environment. And the \nreason is, our priority right now in this government, because of this \nadministration and their friends in Congress, is Iraq in the morning, \nIraq at 10 o'clock in the morning, Iraq at noon, Iraq at 5, Iraq at \nnight, and we ignore the needs of our people.\n  There is a time and a place to say to a country that is independent, \nafter all we have done for it: Enough is enough. We trained 440,000. We \nput our American lives on the line. Our brave soldiers have done \neverything asked of them and more. They allowed three elections to be \nheld. They got Saddam Hussein, they got Saddam's family, and they found \nthere were no weapons of mass destruction. They did everything we asked \nthem to do. And the Iraqi Government takes tiny little steps, baby \nsteps forward, while we continue having our soldiers die and get \nwounded and our taxpayers have an open checkbook.\n  My people come and say to me: Why can't we do more for our kids? Why \ncan't we do more to protect our environment? Why can't we do more for \nour workers and our businesses? Why can't we do more to protect our \npeople by investing in homeland security? I am now telling them the \ntruth: Because the money is floating out of here straight to Iraq.\n  And by the way, a lot of it is not accounted for--$9 billion missing \nin cash that was sent. The administration shrugs its shoulders: Oh, \nwell, we don't know much about it. Scandals in contracting, embassies \nthat are larger than the U.N. complex. Some of the Iraqi people call it \nGW's palace. I was in Saddam's palace, and I will tell you something. \nThat was not a happy feeling because that is not something that we want \nto replicate, huge buildings like that, fancy. How much does it cost? \nAlmost $800 million. It was supposed to cost $592 million. It doesn't \nmatter, it is in Iraq. Open the checkbook and write the checks, says \nthe President, the Vice President, and their friends in Congress, who \nare coming here and saying: No, no, no, every time we want to finally \nbegin to bring this war to a close.\n  Well, I have to tell you, I am ready for change, my constituents are \nready for a change, and right now the Feingold legislation is \nresponsible because it says we will keep troops there to protect our \nforces. We will slowly start bringing them home. We will redeploy them \nand have all the money we need to responsibly do that. And we will go \nafter al-Qaida.\n  I voted to go to war against Osama bin Laden. What happened to Osama \nbin Laden dead or alive? Oh, no, this administration turned around, \nwent into Iraq, and as a result, we are not safe. Al-Qaida has \nreconstituted itself, and we are shortchanging the American people.\n  I thank Senator Brownback for allowing me to go first, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California \nfor her comments. I respect her thoughts and her opinions and her \nconsistency of position. I disagree, and I will articulate why on that.\n  Mr. President, we have been arguing and debating on Iraq for some \nperiod of time, since we have gone to war, which we did on a bipartisan \nbasis, and aggressively decided that this was an important strategy to \npursue together. We did that 5 years ago. We have invested a lot of \ntime and energy and life and blood and limb from this country.\n  I was with a young man from Wichita, KS, yesterday who has a \nprosthesis on the bottom right of his foot. He was pleased to serve in \nIraq. He doesn't like it that he has lost his foot, but he wants us to \nwin and he wants us to see it on through.\n  So here we are, 5 years later, a lot of investment, particularly of \npeople and lives, and it would seem as if a fair number of people now \nin this body would say: OK, we have done it long enough, let's quit. \nLet's pull on out and let's hope it all works out.\n  I don't think that is a responsible strategy. If I am hearing the \npeople who have served there right, they want to see it through. They \nwant to see us win, and they want to see us get it done right. They \nwant to see us be able to bring a democracy that can stand on its own--\ncertainly not perfect, but one that can stand on its own in that region \nof the world. And they don't want to see us lose the investment we have \nmade to date. And we have made a heavy investment. They don't want to \nsee us walk away from it and say: OK, we didn't get it quite the way we \nwanted to. They do not want to see us walk away at such a point that \nthe soldiers or the foreign fighters follow us back here and we see \nanother 9/11.\n\n  The bottom line is the safety and security of the young people we \nhave talked about so much. We want to keep this place safe and secure. \nAnd one of the best ways to do that is to keep on the offensive.\n  Mr. President, over the last few years, and particularly this last \nyear, we have debated a lot of Iraqi resolutions, and they have all \nfailed except one. One resolution has passed. It is the one I want to \ntalk about. It is the one I did with Joe Biden, the Biden-Brownback \nresolution on devolving power and authority in Iraq. We voted and voted \nand voted last year. Nothing passed but this one. And because of it, \nwhat we were talking about is the model of devolving power and \nauthority, a federal system, in Iraq.\n  I have met with Iraqis since that period of time, and a number of \nthem have challenged and questioned: OK, is this really the right way \nto go? We don't want to see the country broken up in three parts.\n  I say: We are not talking about breaking the country up in three \nparts. We have 50 States, and we are one country. We are talking about \nthree or five states or regions there but one country. You devolve \npower and authority from the center so it is not just one group, a \nShiite-dominated central government that is dictating to a Kurdish, \nSunni, Shiite country. Let's devolve that power and authority out. That \npassed. That passed.\n  Now, what has happened since that has passed on the ground? Well, we \nare seeing nice progress actually taking place, political progress at \nthe local and provincial levels is happening. We saw recently the Iraqi \nParliament pass a legislative package--three bills together. They did \nsomething we do here often. You can't get one bill through, you can't \nget two, but three you can somehow get a coalition enough to pass it \nthrough. That is what they did, establishing the 2008 budget, \nclarifying provincial powers, and then offering amnesty for Sunni \npolitical prisoners, all three very important.\n  That middle one, clarifying provincial powers, is a key one. I talked \nwith one of the respected scholars on this, Michael O'Hanlin, on the \nphone today. He is one of the authors of the federalism approach in \nIraq. We have a\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\nmilitary strategy that we are taking advantage of today that is \nproviding political space, and he believes we need to devolve authority \nand power to the regions. You are seeing that now taking place \nlegislatively by the central body in Iraq, clarifying provincial \npowers.\n  As I was talking with Mr. O'Hanlin, and also in my own thinking, we \nrecently mostly talked about regions, and he is saying: Well, whether \nit is a region or a province, it is devolving of power and authority, \nand it is happening. And it is a good thing to get that out of the \ncentralized area. What is allowing that to take place is more local \ngovernance. It is allowing people, whether they be Sunni or Kurd, or \nShiite, or in a mixed area, to be able to solve more of their own \nproblems rather than being dependent upon the central government that \nmay have a bit of ideology or edge that you don't agree with, as \nhappens around this country at times where people don't agree with what \nhappens at the Federal Government, but they are wanting that decision \nto be made at the State level. That is starting to happen in Iraq. And \nit is diffusing some of the powder keg.\n  Now, we are far from solving this, but the political space that has \nbeen granted by the military surge in the area is allowing this \ndevolution of power and authority to happen. So we now have clarifying \nprovincial powers taking place. The laws, as I mentioned, are not \nperfect, but they are giving this power and authority out to the \nregions. We are now seeing political progress at the local and \nprovincial levels, and that is driving some of the politics at the \nnational level. None of that could happen without security at the \nnational level in Iraq, without U.S. troops there on the ground. Iraqis \ncan gain stability by continuing to decentralize and move more power \ncloser to individual Iraqis.\n  I believe provincial elections later this year will accelerate the \nimportance of local politics in Iraq, and that is what we want to take \nplace because what we were seeing coming together was Shiite against \nSunni, and the Kurds sitting in the north refereeing from time to time \nbut other times staying off to their own and saying: Look, we are just \ngoing to sit up here and hope someday we will be able to have a nation \nand let those two guys fight. But now, instead, you are seeing this \ngoing down to Sunni councils and Shiite councils, and in some cases \nmixed neighborhoods.\n  You do continue to see an ethnic move in neighborhoods, particularly \nin Baghdad, and some going more Sunni and others going more Shiite in \nsome regions or some mixed ethnic or other religious communities that \nexist there and some Christian populations that are there. But you are \nseeing it start to work because we continue to provide the security \numbrella.\n  Now, let's take the security umbrella off. Let's have the Feingold \namendment pass and send the signal to the Iraqis that we are moving \nout; that we are going to take care of our own areas, you take care of \nyour own areas. What do we think at this most critical moment would \nhappen if you pull that security piece out, the U.S. security piece \nout? Well, I think you would stop this move toward local and \nprovincial. You invite more Iranian-financed problems into the region, \nin the hopes that the Shiite can take over and then dominate and \npossess all of Iraq--Sunni areas and possibly Kurdish areas as well, \nalthough they are pretty well fortified amongst themselves. You invite \nSadr back in with his militia, where he just recently, for another 6 \nmonths, asked his militias to stand down.\n  I think you invite back into the picture at this key political moment \nfor Iraq a bunch of forces that are going to hurt the long-term future. \nAnd so it seems to me this is a bad idea at a particularly bad time for \nus to pull troops out of Iraq.\n  Now, I had trouble with the surge at the outset. I really questioned \nwhether it was going to work. But the surge has worked, and this is \ncoming from somebody who was a cynic as to whether this was going to \nwork in that region.\n  But that, along with the Sunnis deciding, okay, we are going to build \nup our region here, and these awakening councils that have taken place, \nalong with evolving this political power and authority, and our better \ncounterterrorism strategy. It is working. So why on Earth would we \nchange something we have invested so much in now that is starting to \nproduce the results we want? Why on Earth would we change that at this \npoint in time? That does not seem to make much sense, of why you would \ndo that at this point in time.\n  I am a strong proponent of continuing to devolve this power and \nauthority in Iraq. I think it is the way forward for them, as it was \nthe way forward for our country when we had 13 original colonies that \ndid not necessarily agree with each other but said, okay, let us have \none Federal Government, but each one of us is going to maintain our own \npower and authority in a number of regions. Then over a period of \nyears, we kind of worked things out. Over 50 years we have divided \npower and authority to State and local, Federal Governments, and this \nis going to take time for the Iraqis, but they need the political space \nour military provides. To pull out now, or to send a signal even of \npulling out now, I think would be very harmful to the long-term \ninvestment we have made. I think it would send a signal to the region \nthat we are going to allow the Iranian influence to spread. It would \nalso invite much more aggressive actions, even toward us, and the \npursuit of us here and other places around the world.\n  That piece is speculation. We do not know what is going to happen in \nthe future. But it does seem as though we are on a sort of track now \nthat we can look to the future with some bit of optimism, whereas the \nother route of pulling out would certainly lead to a great deal of \npessimism by the Iraqis and toward me about what we are going to be \ndoing in providing the long-term security for the United States when we \nknow that the terrorist objective is to attack and come after us, that \nyou are likely to see a devolution to a terrorist state, or an Iranian-\ntype of satellite state in Iraq if we pull out precipitously, either of \nwhich are options that I think would be completely wrong for us to do \nas a nation and something I cannot support.\n  For those reasons, I certainly would be voting against the Feingold \namendment. I urge my colleagues to do that. I say, let us stick with \nsomething that is starting to work. It is not perfect. Let us stick \nwith something on a political strategy that is starting to work. It is \nnot perfect, but we have a model for it ourselves in the United States \nin our own history. It seems this would be a particularly unwise time \nto move off of that one bit of resolution that we have agreed upon, on \npolitical authority being devolved and to change a strategy on the \nmilitary at this point in time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I want to thank you and all my Democratic colleagues for \nallowing me some time on the floor to discuss the progress in the war. \nThis allows us as Republicans to contrast our position versus the \nposition of retreating and announcing that we are giving up on Iraq.\n  We have heard a lot of talk here today, and apparently there is too \nhigh a pricetag for freedom. Certainly you can make an argument that it \nis expensive to be in Iraq, just as other wars have been expensive and \ndeadly to our country.\n  World War II, the importance of that war can never be underestimated, \nand the price on it could not be estimated. The fact that we need to \nfight wars to show our strength as a nation has been proven time and \ntime again. I am worried that the Senate is not united in the need to \nshow strength against the war on terror.\n  Last year at this time, my Democratic colleagues had said that the \nwar in Iraq was lost, and implicitly the war against terror, since the \nfront line today on the battle against terror is in Iraq. It was \nannounced here on the Senate floor that the war was lost, that we were \nin a hopeless civil war in Iraq. Since then we have had about 40 votes, \nor different variations of votes to cut funding, to withdraw, to \nretreat, sending a terrible signal to our troops and our enemies that \nwe lack the resolve that is necessary to win this war. Whether we call \nit running and retreating or giving up or saying America cannot win, \nall of those words and ideas emanated from the Senate floor from the \nmajority side in the past year.\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\n  Many even voted against the funds to surge the troops that has proven \nto be such a success over the last several months. Some of the funding \nas late as the end of last year was held hostage to gross earmarks that \nwere unnecessary in a time of war. How can we talk about the war on \nterror being so expensive when we held those funds hostage to other \nthings that were certainly not a high priority?\n  I am afraid my Democratic colleagues, at least many of them--I know \nthis is not true for all of them, but too many clearly do not \nunderstand the threat of terrorism in our world today and what that \nmeans to our country and our freedom. Too many have forgotten the \nimportance of a strong military and how that results in peace around \nthe world when nations respect the power of the United States of \nAmerica. But who can respect America any longer, after stating our \nresolve to stand Iraq up as a free and stable democracy, if in the \nmiddle of that challenge we decide to retreat and withdraw?\n  The very fact that we have talked about it so many times has sent a \nsignal of weakness that has empowered our enemies and likely put more \nof our forces at risk. I hope this is the last time we do it this year.\n  Everyone has a right to dislike the war, to say it is too expensive. \nBut our responsibility here in the Senate is much different than the \naverage citizen. When we send a signal that we are not supporting the \nkey mission of our military, we do much to demoralize our troops, and \nto strengthen the resolve of our enemies.\n  Again, I hope this is the last time we will do it. My Democratic \ncolleagues cannot have it both ways. They continue to try to say they \nsupport the troops, but everything they actually do undermines them, \npulls the rug right out from under what they are trying to do. It's a \nlot of empty rhetoric. But in the last week we have seen from the \nDemocrats on the House side, a key essential part of our intelligence \nsystem is being threatened because we will not give the administration \nthe tools to use our technology to intercept messages from terrorists \nwho might be planning to attack us or our interests around the world.\n  I returned from Iraq a couple of weeks ago. This is my third trip. I \nsaw a marked difference from anything I had ever seen before. The \nstatistics have been talked about here on the floor of the Senate: The \nmonthly attacks have decreased 60 percent since June of last year; \ncivilian deaths are down over 75 percent in the last year; al-Qaida in \nIraq remains a threat but their power and ability to do damage has been \ngreatly diminished.\n\n  I wish to talk a little bit about the trip. I joined Senator Ensign \nand Senator Tom Coburn on this trip. Once we landed in Baghdad, we took \na helicopter to a small community about 30 miles south of Baghdad. This \nwas a community that was controlled and terrorized by al-Qaida up until \nabout 3 months ago. You would not even go down Main Street in an \narmored vehicle, we were told by our troops there.\n  Yet we landed at an American outpost there, American soldiers were \nliving in that community a couple of blocks from the Iraqi Army outpost \nwhere they were living in the community, and we walked out of our \noutpost on the main street and talked to the citizens who had opened \ntheir markets, talked to the Iraqi soldiers, and talked to the citizens \nwho were helping to patrol the area. In this picture here I am talking \nwith one of the local sheiks, Sheik Ali, who told us that al-Qaida only \na few months before had dragged his father in front of him and shot him \nand killed him.\n  Next to him is an Iraqi soldier whom we helped to train. They are as \nsharp as any soldier you would expect to see. This community is well \nprotected. Colonel Ferrell, who is in charge of the outpost, who took \nus down the main street, was giving us briefings and we were talking to \nthe sheik as well as the Iraqi soldiers. They were proud to tell us \nwhat was happening there.\n  The sheiks and the local tribes are the key to working with the \nAmerican surge and have freed much of Iraq in the last 6 months. These \nlocal leaders have turned against al-Qaida, because al-Qaida has done \nsuch damage and such brutality to their families and their communities \nthat they are now talking with us and helping us to defeat al-Qaida in \nthat area there.\n  I have another photo here. I know it is difficult to see. But we were \nwalking down a street that was empty except for bodies a few months \nago. These little markets have opened. As we walked down the street, in \nthis case it was mostly American soldiers walking with us, except for \nthis group--these young men in the green jackets which they called in \nthis community the ``Sons of Iraq.'' Our military pays them to help \npatrol every day. When I asked the colonel, when all of these citizens \ncame running out to us, why were they not worried about them blowing \nthemselves up and killing all of the soldiers and us who were walking \ndown the street, the colonel responded: Because we know everyone who is \nhere.\n  A lot of these folks from the markets came out and hugged our \nsoldiers. I tell you, I couldn't have felt better to see our soldiers \nso appreciated in that area, to see these young men with walkie-\ntalkies. Their job is to patrol, to make sure if any stranger comes to \nthe community, that they notify the Iraqi Army and the American Army so \nthat these people can be checked out.\n  We saw a number of trucks with mattresses and furniture piled high, \nof people moving back to this little community--who had moved out \nmonths and years before because al-Qaida had run them out. We walked \ndown several blocks. Probably 80 to 100 markets have reopened, and the \npeople were glad to see us. They were cheerful. They feel as if they \nhave their community back.\n  We have not won this war yet, but we can see everywhere we go that \nIraqis are standing up and taking back their country for themselves. \nAnd our troops, along with the Iraqi troops whom we helped to train, \nand the Sons of Iraq are guarding and protecting their community.\n  I want to talk about one Marine here. This is Major Alston Middleton, \nwho actually went to Porter-Gaud High School in Charleston. He is a \nMarine working in the base where we are training Iraqi soldiers. Every \n3 weeks we are producing 2,500 new Iraqi soldiers who go straight from \nthat camp to the battlefield. They are being trained with the same \nequipment and arms they will be using when they get there.\n  He is proud of what he is doing. Everywhere we went, our troops \nwanted to prove to us that what we were doing was necessary, it was \nright, it was working, and we could win it. It was important to them \nthat we know it.\n  When I asked them what do they need that they do not have, the answer \nI got--more than any other answer--was: Do not forget us. Some of the \nrhetoric on this floor has sent the signal to our troops that we are \nforgetting them and do not appreciate what they are doing.\n  This Marine, away from his family, like all of the other Marines, \nsailors, soldiers, and airmen we see there, many of them away from \ntheir children and spouses for over a year, we know what sacrifices \nthey are making. But I am afraid these Marines are not respected in \nsome parts of this country. I am afraid the Democrats on the Berkeley \nCity Council in California--and some here may say that is an isolated \nsituation, but it is not, because they are taking their signals from \nwhat they hear right here on the Senate floor. They called our Marine \nrecruiters unwelcome intruders. They called them thugs. They called \nthem Bush's murderers. When you see the video and what they called our \nMarines, while our Marines are sweating and bleeding and dying for us \nand our freedoms.\n  What the Berkeley city council did was not freedom of speech. The \nprotesters had their freedom of speech for months, but that wasn't good \nenough for them. They wanted the power of government behind them to \nsupport their point of view at the expense of the Marines and all \nAmericans who appreciate our Marines and love what they do. We need to \nrecognize that some of the things that have been said right here are \nsending a signal to people like the Berkeley city council to show \ndisrespect for people like Major Alston Middleton, who is willing to \nput his life on the line for us.\n  I have introduced a bill we call the Semper Fi Act, named after the \nMarine motto, which means ``always faithful.'' It is just to rattle the \ncages a little bit\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nof the city council in Berkeley, to tell them: OK, if you want to take \nexception to our Federal mission there in Berkeley, certainly you don't \ndeserve these secret earmarks we have sent to Berkeley in the last \nseveral months. But the Marines are always faithful and always have \nbeen. They are faithful to our country, to each other. We need to be \nfaithful to them and all those who are fighting for us.\n  This discussion on the floor is again trying to have it both ways, \nthat we support our troops, but then we don't. We don't support them \nwhen we don't support the very mission we have asked them to give their \nlives for. We can't have it both ways. We can't keep having this \ndiscussion which questions, before the whole world, the very mission we \nhave asked of our soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, and Coast \nGuardsmen and all the civilian support staff we have in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and throughout the world who are fighting the war on \nterror. We are going to win the war on terror because of the resolve we \nhave to be free and peaceful as a nation.\n  I hope we will get the message here that our troops have in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and around the world, that sometimes you have to fight for \nthe freedom we have here in this country. Now is the time we have to \nfight. The fact that we have shown resolve in the last year has \nresulted in clear successes in Iraq that are undeniable. We know we can \nwin this battle, but this battle will not be the last one. The \nterrorists are going to be here for a generation or more. If they are \nnot in Iraq, they are going to be in Afghanistan or they will be in \nAfrica. They are going to be somewhere, if they are not here, doing \ntheir terrorist deeds against the peaceful people of the world. We have \nto show resolve. Our enemies must know that we will never stop until we \nroot them out and do away with them.\n  I also want to make one last comment because the folks from South \nCarolina are in so many ways very involved with the effort in Iraq. In \nfact, over the last several years the airmen at Charleston Air Force \nBase flying C-17s carry more of the cargo, supplies, and arms into Iraq \nthan any other base in our country. This picture is one of the crews \nthat flew us out of Afghanistan back to Kuwait on our way home. But we \nactually had three teams out of Charleston that moved us from Kuwait to \nBaghdad, out of Baghdad and to Afghanistan and back. They are proud of \nwhat they do. They wanted us to know, and me to tell you, that they \nbelieve this mission is important and that we can win it. Every day \nthey save lives and deliver freedom.\n  All they need is our support, not our empty rhetoric, our real \nsupport and our belief in them and what they are doing. I came back \nwith that belief and that resolve, that what we are doing is right. If \nwe continue what we are doing, we will win, and we will continue to set \nthe terrorists back on their heels and keep our country safe.\n  I thank the men and women at Charleston Air Force Base who are making \nall Americans proud as they serve all over the world on their missions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what time remains for our side of the \naisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and one-half minutes on the Democratic \nside.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about Iraq and Senator \nFeingold's legislation to start bringing our troops home from Iraq. But \nas I stand here on this floor, I listen to one of our colleagues speak \nof a group out West who may have said something disrespectful and \noffensive about our troops and that this group may have learned it here \non this floor and I feel I must respond. That is an insult to all of us \nwho are part of this body. It is outrageous to say this group learned \nthat here. No one here disrespects our troops. No one here wants \nanything but the best for them. We ought not to start off that way, as \nwe discuss the Feingold legislation.\n  I wish to begin my remarks with President Bush's now infamous \ndeclaration almost 5 years ago when he announced ``mission \naccomplished.'' We sadly remember that day, when the President landed \non the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln like a conquering hero, standing \nbefore a huge banner, which we see here portrayed. We remember watching \nas President Bush declared that day to be the end. It turned out to be \na stunningly casual statement, not unlike another remark the President \nmade when he said, talking about the enemy, ``bring them on.'' I served \nin Europe during World War II, and I never heard a commander invite \nmore of the enemy to come to fight.\n  When the President stood there that day, the insinuation was that it \nwas the end of major combat operations, the end of America's \ncasualties, the end of America's role as the major player in Iraq's \nfuture. But many of us remember fearing that it was not the end.\n  Today, as we look at the terrible costs to our troops, to their \nfamilies, to our priorities here at home, to the war against the \nterrorists who attacked us, and to America's standing, we realize that \nday in 2003 was only a beginning. When the President stood on the deck \nof that carrier, America had lost 139 of our troops in Iraq. As we \nstand here today, we have lost almost 4,000. To be exact, 3,968 \nAmericans have died in Iraq; 102 of those troops had ties to my home \nState of New Jersey; 95 percent of the mothers, fathers, sons and \ndaughters we have lost were killed in action after President Bush said \n``mission accomplished.''\n\n  That mission was not accomplished. President Bush's war has left \nchildren growing up without parents and parents to grow old with no \nchildren. His war has caused nearly 29,000 troops to leave the combat \ntheater with their wounds. Nearly 700 of them lost limbs, and many more \nhave left with wounds to their minds. Our troops are returning home \nfrom the Iraqi desert with traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic \nstress disorder, making it so difficult for them to return to their \nfamilies, their jobs, and their lives.\n  Instead of spending $3 billion each week to wage war on education or \nchildhood disease in America, the President is spending $3 billion a \nweek to wage war in Iraq. Amazingly, I found someone who doesn't know \nthat sad fact--the President's own Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget, Mr. Nussle. I recently asked him how much we were spending \neach week in Iraq, in a budget hearing. Director Nussle said he didn't \nknow. Almost everybody in America besides him knows very well--$3 \nbillion each and every week. It is unacceptable. It is an insult to the \nAmerican people who are funding this war and an insult to our troops \nwho are still fighting it.\n  The President will claim we are making military progress in Iraq and \nthat the surge is working. But let's tell the American people the \ntruth. America lost 901 mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers in \nthe year 2007 alone; 2007 was the deadliest year for America since the \nstart of the Iraq war.\n  More than 3,300 members of New Jersey's Army Reserves and National \nGuard are scheduled to deploy to Iraq this year. Just a couple of weeks \nago, I went to Fort Dix, a major military base in New Jersey. I talked \nto people who already served there on extended tours, and they were \nweary. They were willing to do their duty. They respected their \nobligation. But their families were not happy. The people I saw, the \nspouses, the children were not happy about their wife or husband, or \nmother or father going away again. Some of them are going to get hurt, \nand some of them may never come home. As they do their duty with honor \nand bravery, they count on us to do ours.\n  Their deployment is a reminder that the President's surge is \nfundamentally flawed. His solution is built on military strength, when \na political and diplomatic solution is what is needed in Iraq. Iraq, \nnot America, needs to accomplish these goals, and we want them to do \nit. We want them to make it possible for us to start bringing our \ntroops home as soon as possible. They have to do it. It is their \nresponsibility. It is their country, and we want to end our presence \nthere.\n  The surge is also a distraction from the war President Bush started \nin response to 9/11 but never finished. That was the war on terror.\n  When the President spoke to our country after September 11, he said:\n\n       I will never forget this wound to our country or those who \n     inflicted it.\n\n  But it appears that he has forgotten. He has forgotten about Osama \nbin\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nLaden, the man who inflicted those terrible wounds on the victims, \ntheir families, and this country. He has forgotten that the war against \nal-Qaida and the hunt for Osama bin Laden began and continues outside \nIraq. And because we have lost our focus, Afghanistan is now spinning \nback toward violence and chaos.\n  After the U.S.-led invasion of 2001, the Taliban was down and \nwounded. Now it seems the Taliban is growing stronger. Over the past 2 \nyears, southern Afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the \nTaliban was dismantled. Last year was the deadliest year for troops in \nAfghanistan since 2001. Today, al-Qaida has also found sanctuary in \nremote areas of Pakistan, and the Afghani-Pakistani border is so porous \nthat terrorists flow through it like wind.\n  If all of this were not bad enough, just look at what the President's \nwar has done to America's standing and prestige in the world. There \nused to be a time when people saw America as the moral leader, and \nAmericans were proud of this country's standing in the world. In World \nWar II, for example, we had strength because most of the free world was \nwith us. Now is not one of those times. Now much of the world is \nagainst us. More than 70 percent of Iraqis disapprove of American \npresence in their country, and 67 percent of citizens across the globe \nbelieve American forces should leave Iraq within a year. Countries that \nwere our allies when we first invaded Iraq, such as Italy, Poland, \nSpain, and Denmark, have left us in the desert. And Great Britain, one \nof America's greatest historical allies, sent its troops from Iraq into \nAfghanistan.\n\n  President Bush, why are we not so wise?\n  To date, the President has spent more than $526 billion on the war in \nIraq. That is more than half a trillion dollars on a war that continues \nto take American youth, empower our rivals, turn our friends against \nus, and let our enemies remain on the loose.\n  If that cost were not unbelievable enough, the President had the \naudacity to ask the American people to spend even more. He has a \npending request of $105 billion for the rest of 2008, and Defense \nSecretary Robert Gates has estimated that Iraq will cost another $170 \nbillion for 2009. Every dime we spend on Iraq is a dime we cannot spend \non our home--on homeland security for our cities, police for our \nstreets, education for our children, and health care for our families. \nIn fact, the President has requested just now a cut of $800 million \nfrom a critical homeland security grant program, leaving Americans more \nexposed to dangers at home.\n  It is time for us to realize it is never going to be enough money. \nFormer Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld used to say we would stand \ndown when the Iraqis stood up. No one says that anymore.\n  So let me stand up and make it clear: It is time for the troops to \nstart coming home. They have earned the right to get back to their \nloved ones, their kids, their spouses, and their country. I hope we \nwill see that day in the not too distant future.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate once again is debating a bill by \nSenator Feingold, Senator Reid, myself, and others to change course in \nIraq. And once again, I urge the Senate to act.\n  This is a war started under false pretenses, waged with incompetent \npolitical policymaking that disserved the bravery and sacrifice of our \nfighting men and women. This is a war that now slogs on--week after \nweek, year after year--with nothing but a ``pause'' on the horizon, and \nstill no end in sight. The toll of American casualties rolls on, and so \ndoes the drain on the Nation's resources, heading inexorably past the \nhundreds of billions of dollars toward an unfathomable trillion \ndollars.\n  The war has sapped our credibility, strained our alliances, and \ncomplicated our security challenges.\n  Meanwhile, Osama bin Laden remains at large and al-Qaida has been \ngiven the opportunity to regenerate. The northwestern frontier between \nPakistan and Afghanistan is a lawless extremist haven.\n  A redeployment of American forces along the lines of the Feingold-\nReid measure would force the Iraqis to realize that our presence is \nfinite. If they want to step away from the abyss, it will take real \nreconciliation and the will to get it done.\n  The Bush administration's failed policy in Iraq has stretched our \nmilitary to the breaking point, diluted and diverted our efforts to \ncounter al-Qaida and its affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and \nroiled the Middle East with instability. The sooner we change course \nthe sooner we can implement a sound, sensible, and sustainable policy \nthat truly advances our security interests.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased we have had a chance to \ndebate S. 2633, the Feingold-Reid bill requiring the safe redeployment \nof our troops from Iraq. I am very grateful to the majority leader for \nallowing this debate and for cosponsoring this legislation. He is a \nstrong opponent of the war, and he understands how it is distracting us \nfrom our top national security priority: defeating the global threat \npresented by al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  While the debate on Iraq is refreshing, the Republicans still will \nnot allow us to actually vote on the bill. In fact, if you listened to \nthe other side during this debate, it was apparent they believe leaving \nlarge numbers of U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely for an open-ended \nmilitary mission is somehow in our country's interest.\n  The American people must be scratching their heads and thinking: What \nis it going to take to get those folks in Washington to listen to us? I \ncan assure them--and I can assure my colleagues--we will have more \ndebate and votes on Iraq. Members will have still more opportunities to \nlisten to their constituents, and to listen to the warnings about the \nglobal threat from al-Qaida and the intolerable strain on our military. \nAnd they will again have to decide whether to keep ignoring those \nwarnings and give the President the green light to continue a war \nwithout end in Iraq.\n  In a few minutes, the Senate will vote in relation to another \nFeingold-Reid bill, S. 2634, addressing al-Qaida. Before I discuss that \nbill, I wish to respond to some of the criticisms that have been \nleveled against the Feingold-Reid Iraq redeployment bill.\n  I am glad some of my colleagues have apparently taken the time to \nread the Iraq bill, but I wish some of them had read it a little more \ncarefully, or thought a little harder, before voicing some of their \nconcerns.\n  Of course, some of the criticisms come from Members who have no \ninterest in stopping or slowing down the war. But I have even heard a \nfew complaints from Members on our side who oppose the war. In fact, \nsome Democrats seem to be trying a lot harder to come up with arguments \nagainst this bill, and against Congress acting, than they are trying to \nend the war. One or two senior Democrats are actually lobbying hard \nbehind the scenes against the Feingold-Reid bill. That is \ndisappointing, to say the least, and it shows us all what we continue \nto be up against as we try to bring this war to a close.\n  Let me start by pointing out that the Feingold-Reid bill does not--\ndoes not--restrict the Government's ability to go after al-Qaida and \nits affiliates around the globe. In fact, one of the main purposes of \nthe bill is to ensure we have the full capability to do just that. When \nit comes to our troops in Iraq, however, we cannot allow this President \nto use the narrow exceptions in this bill to continue his misguided \npolicies. The language in the bill has been crafted to try to ensure \nthe administration does not--and cannot--continue to maintain a heavy \nmilitary footprint in Iraq.\n  Specifically, the first exception in the Feingold-Reid bill allows \nfunding to continue for ``targeted operations, limited in duration and \nscope, against members of AQ and affiliated international terrorist \norganizations.''\n  This provision allows operations against AQ in Iraq because fighting \nal-Qaida is central to our national security. But it does not allow the \nPresident to continue the current opened-ended mission because it is \nnot in our national security interest to leave our troops on the front \nlines in the middle of an Iraqi civil war.\n  The ``limited in duration and scope'' language prohibits operations \nwithout a clearly defined counterterrorism objective, such as the \ncurrent open-ended\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\nmission. And, of course, this provision, like the rest of the bill, \nonly applies to Iraq. It does not affect any other U.S. operations \naround the world. But if my colleagues are particularly troubled by \nthis ``duration and scope'' language, I am open to discussing with them \nany reasonable modifications that do not open new loopholes. And this \nis no reason to completely block the Senate from even considering the \nbill. My colleagues are free to try to amend it, if they will only let \nus take it up.\n  If my colleagues think we should have U.S. troops conducting \noperations in Iraq against other organizations that are not affiliated \nwith AQ, then we do, in fact, have a difference of opinion. We need to \nbe clear about our priorities. Our top national security priority is \nthe threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates. Pitting our brave men \nand women in uniform against groups or entities in Iraq that do not \npose a direct threat to the United States is a misuse of our resources, \nand it is exactly that mistake I am trying to fix with this \nlegislation.\n  Obviously, at all times, U.S. troops in Iraq will be able to defend \nthemselves against any perceived threat, regardless of who it comes \nfrom. But when we are talking about planning and conducting operations, \nthose operations would need to be targeted against members of al-Qaida \nor affiliates. If we cannot figure out who we are launching operations \nagainst, and if we cannot figure out how to distinguish between al-\nQaida in Iraq and the many other unsavory actors in Iraq who do not \ndirectly threaten our interests, then we have a serious intelligence \nproblem which underscores the degree to which this war is distracting \nus from our top priority.\n  The Feingold-Reid bill also allows U.S. troops to remain in Iraq to \nprovide ``security for personnel and infrastructure of the United \nStates Government.'' A question has been raised about whether U.S. \ntroops could also provide security for non-U.S. coalition forces under \nthis provision. Of course, the vast majority of foreign troops in Iraq \nare U.S. troops. We are the ones holding the bag there, and that is a \ndirect result of this administration's decision to rush to war without \nbuilding a strong, sustainable coalition. So raising concerns about \nnon-Iraqi coalition forces is largely a red herring. However, I respect \nthe contributions of those coalition troops, and I would be open, \nagain, to discussing ways in which we can ensure they are protected \nwithout opening up a big loophole to keep a lot more U.S. troops there. \nAgain, technical concerns such as this are no reason to block us from \neven considering the bill. Frankly, it sounds like an excuse not to \ndeal with the real issue, which is our need to get out of this \nsituation.\n  The Feingold-Reid bill also permits U.S. troops to be stationed in \nIraq to provide ``training to members of the Iraqi Security Forces who \nhave not been involved in sectarian violence or in attacks upon the \nU.S. Armed Forces. . . .''\n  This does not require any kind of guarantee that ISF troops receiving \ntraining have not been involved in sectarian violence or attacks upon \nthe U.S., as some have suggested. It just requires some good-faith \neffort to make sure we are not assisting some of the very people \nresponsible for destabilizing Iraq and killing Americans. That seems \npretty reasonable, doesn't it? Just kind of a good-faith effort to make \nsure we are not helping people who have already killed Americans. One \nwould think that was reasonable.\n  This should not be controversial. We have a policy as a government of \nnot supporting militaries around the world that commit undisciplined \nacts of violence, and this administration ostensibly vets foreign \nmilitaries thoroughly under what is known as the ``Leahy Law.'' I do \nnot see why we should make an exception for Iraq, particularly when the \nGAO and General Jones have issued reports showing that the ISF is \ncompromised by militias. If we continue to arm and train the ISF, we \nmay simply be contributing to ongoing instability in Iraq. At a \nminimum, then, we need to be careful to ensure we are not giving some \nof the worst actors in Iraq the tools to perpetuate further violence \nand bloodshed.\n  Oh, and by the way, we have already trained over 439,000 ISF \npersonnel. This certainly raises questions about how much more training \nthey need. We need to make sure the President cannot keep tens of \nthousands of troops in Iraq policing the civil war under the guise of \n``training.''\n  Indeed, the ``training'' U.S. military personnel in Iraq are \nproviding is not what is traditionally thought of as training, such as \nboot camp. Our training is all field training, and there is no bright \nline between training and joint operations.\n  Now, some folks here think that is fine. They want U.S. troops to \ncontinue being embedded with Iraqi troops, conducting joint operations. \nThe Feingold-Reid bill would not foreclose all joint operations or the \nequipping of ISF. U.S. troops could continue to conduct joint \ncounterterrorism operations with ISF so long as the operations target \nal-Qaida or affiliated international terrorist organizations. But U.S. \ntroops could not be embedded with Iraqi Security Forces for \n``training'' purposes. And the U.S. may continue to equip ISF but may \nnot deploy U.S. troops to Iraq solely for this purpose.\n  Some on our side want U.S. troops to continue providing ``logistical \nsupport'' to Iraqi forces indefinitely. This, again, is a backdoor way \nto keep substantial numbers of U.S. troops on the front lines, \nperforming basic combat support functions, such as providing air \nsupport. Even seemingly run-of-the-mill logistical operations can be \nextremely dangerous in the chaotic environment in Iraq. That is not in \nour national security interest, and it is not something we should \npermit. We need a full redeployment, not a halfhearted half measure.\n  I hope my colleagues will rethink their opposition to the Feingold-\nReid bill. If they do have these kinds of concerns about it, \nparticularly some of the more technical concerns I have addressed, \nwell, let's actually allow the bill to come to the floor and let's have \namendments and votes. That is our responsibility as legislators, and we \nowe it to our constituents and our men and women in uniform to have \nthis debate in the open and on the record.\n\n\n                                S. 2634\n\n  Mr. President, while we may be done debating Iraq for now, the Senate \nhas another opportunity to support a bill that would help get our \nnational security strategy straight. That bill is S. 2634, which I also \nintroduced with Leader Reid, along with Senators Boxer, Brown, Byrd, \nCasey, Clinton, Dodd, Harkin, Lautenberg, Leahy, Menendez, Obama, \nSchumer, and Whitehouse.\n  Frankly, it is a pretty modest bill. It simply requires the \nadministration to provide Congress with a report outlining a \ncomprehensive, global strategy to defeat al-Qaida and its affiliates, \none that ensures we are bringing all of our assets to the table: \nmilitary, diplomatic, intelligence, and other. The strategy must ensure \nthat U.S. resources and assets are targeted appropriately to meet the \nregional and country-specific threats that we face and that troop \ndeployments do not overstretch our military. This seems pretty \nstraightforward. Don't we want to make sure we are correctly \nprioritizing the geographic threats posed by al-Qaida and its \naffiliates around the world? And don't we need to make sure all of our \nassets, including military intelligence and diplomatic ones, are \nproperly focused on addressing those threats? Shouldn't we make sure we \naren't imposing an impossible burden on our military in the process? It \nappears, however, that the administration is afraid of what such a \nstrategy would say; namely, that while it is focusing its attention and \nresources on Iraq, the threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates in \nPakistan and many places around the world is growing.\n\n  The DNI--the Director of National Intelligence--warned this month \nthat al-Qaida:\n\n     has retained or regenerated key elements of its capability, \n     including its top leadership, operational lieutenants, and a \n     de facto safe haven in the Pakistani border area with \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  Yes, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, \ntestified recently that:\n\n       The most likely near-term attack on the United States will \n     come from al-Qaida via its safe havens in Pakistan.\n\n  In a recent report led by former NATO Commander GEN James Jones, he \ncalled Afghanistan a ``strategic\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\nstalemate'' and warned that ``Afghanistan remains a failing State. It \ncould become a failed State.''\n  So while our military and intelligence experts are saying this, the \nPresident's Iraq policies have stretched our military to the breaking \npoint. Yesterday, the Senate heard testimony from top Army officials \nthat the Army is under serious strain and must reduce the length of \ncombat tours as soon as possible. Listen to what GEN George Casey, \nChief of Staff of the Army, had to say:\n\n       The cumulative effects of the last 6 plus years at war have \n     left our Army out of balance, consumed by the current fight, \n     and unable to do the things we know we need to do to properly \n     sustain our all-volunteer force and restore our flexibility \n     for an uncertain future.\n\n  These are the words of GEN George Casey: out of balance, unable to do \nthe things we need to do.\n  We need to heed these dire warnings and recognize that the \nPresident's Iraq policies are unsustainable. The Feingold-Reid bill, S. \n2634, would force the administration to confront that reality and to \nconfront the dangerous threat posed by al-Qaida while our troops are \nbogged down in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has its head stuck in the sands of \nIraq. It actually threatened yesterday to veto this commonsense bill. I \nguess the President doesn't want the American people to know how off \ntrack we are. Well, believe me, they actually know. They have been \nwatching over the past few years as this administration has confused \nthe war in Iraq with the fight against al-Qaida. They want a change, \nand they don't want to wait another year for another President and \nanother Congress to finally act on their concerns.\n  I hope my colleagues listen to them and listen to our intelligence \nexperts when they warn us about the serious threat posed by al-Qaida in \nPakistan, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. If they do, this bill will pass \n100 to nothing, and the American people will breathe a sigh of relief \nthat finally their voices are being heard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, in a few minutes we will have a \nprocedural vote on another proposal by the junior Senator from \nWisconsin, a bill that would direct the administration to produce in 60 \ndays a new global strategy for defeating al-Qaida. But first, a word \nabout the first Feingold bill which dictates withdrawal.\n  Last year's bold decision to launch a counterinsurgency plan under \nGeneral Petraeus has renewed our hopes for a unified Iraq to govern, \ndefend, and sustain itself as an ally in the war on terror. Our men and \nwomen in uniform have protected the Iraqi people, scattered al-Qaida, \ndeterred militias, and helped to create an environment that has led to \nprogress not only at the tactical level but in government and in \nreconciliation as well. We owe them all a great debt.\n  In September, General Petraeus outlined his plan for bringing these \nmen and women back after a job well done and for transitioning our \nmission to one of partnership and overwatch. I might say \nparenthetically, I was just with General Petraeus's wife a few moments \nago, who is at a reception here in the Capitol complex for people from \nthe Fort Campbell area. Earlier in General Petraeus's career, he was \nthe commander of the 101st Division of the storied Screaming Eagles who \nhave been at the tip of the spear in both Afghanistan and Iraq over the \nlast 4 years. General Petraeus has had three different assignments in \nIraq. We are all thoroughly familiar with his current assignment, but \nhis wife is a good soldier indeed as well, and I had an opportunity a \nfew moments ago to thank her again not only for his contribution but \nfor her sacrifice as well.\n  This reduction in forces that General Petraeus's mission has made \npossible has already begun, and the Iraqi people are prepared for \nprovincial elections in October. Due to the success of the Petraeus \nplan, Sunnis now serving as Sons of Iraq and defending their own Nation \nwill now have a real stake in those elections. When General Petraeus \nand Ambassador Crocker return this April, we should listen to their \nrecommendations to ensure that the hard-earned gains of the surge are \nmaintained.\n  But one thing is already clear from the successes we have recently \nseen. Congress needs to stop considering this war in fits and starts \nand through piecemeal debates. We need to understand that our interests \nin the Persian Gulf and Iraq are long-standing and will not vanish \nbecause we have a Presidential election in November. We can't wish the \ndangers away.\n  This leads me to the second Feingold measure calling for a new \nstrategy in defeating al-Qaida. We deal with global strategies and \nlong-range plans through the national security strategy, the national \nmilitary strategy, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and through the \nannual defense legislation. If the Senator from Wisconsin wanted to \nknow how our global strategy to combat al-Qaida fits into the context \nof these reports and reviews, he might have asked the administration to \nproduce such a document in the annual Defense Authorization Act. Also, \nI might suggest that one sure way of strengthening our fight against \nal-Qaida and other terrorists would be for the Democratic leadership \nover in the House of Representatives to stop blocking a vote on the \nbipartisan, Senate-passed FISA bill. We know there is a bipartisan \nmajority in the House of Representatives to pass the same bill that \npassed the Senate by a large bipartisan majority. A good way to \nstrengthen our efforts against al-Qaida would be to take up and pass \nthat bill.\n  It would be irresponsible to cut off funds for troops in the field. \nWe will not pass a bill that does so. But we welcome debate on the al-\nQaida report because we are ready to provide all of the resources \nrequired to defeat al-Qaida, to include quick passage of the Defense \nappropriations supplemental, full funding of the 2009 Defense \nAppropriations Act, and passage of a FISA bill that will allow our \nintelligence community to continue to hunt terrorists.\n  We must also consider the full cost of our Nation's global \ncommitments and our need to modernize our ground, air, and naval \nforces. We should also give the administration ample time to complete \nthis study which should serve as a sound guidance for the incoming \nadministration.\n  So we welcome a debate on how to best hunt al-Qaida and defend the \nNation, and if we are to get on this bill, we will be debating \namendments that make this report more meaningful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, some parts of the Iraq war are open for \ndebate, but there is a lot we know for sure. These are the facts: \nNearly 4,000 American soldiers have been killed, 30,000 wounded, and \nthe wounds of a third of them are very serious. We have thousands and \nthousands of amputees, more than 3,000 double amputees, blind, hearing \nloss, head trauma that will affect them the rest of their lives. I \ntalked this morning about a returning Iraqi soldier who has post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. He cannot work. He is losing his home. These \nare the facts. We still have 150,000 more troops in Iraq. News from the \nPentagon is that there will be 8,000 more troops in Iraq in July than \nbefore the surge started.\n  GEN Colin Powell told us last year the Army is ``about broken.'' \nGeneral Casey, Chief of Staff of the Army, confirmed what General \nPowell said. Yesterday, he said:\n\n       The demand for our forces exceeds the sustainable supply.\n\n  General Casey basically confirms what General Powell said: The Army \nis broken.\n  The day before yesterday, on public broadcasting, there was a good \nreport that dealt with ADM Tim Keating, commander of the Pacific \nCommand, a huge command, and basically the whole report is how \nhamstrung he is in trying to do his job. He cannot do it anymore \nbecause, as indicated in the report, there are not enough resources \nanymore because they are all being shipped to Iraq and now some to \nAfghanistan. Those are the facts.\n  I had visiting me today some people who were so excited--Don \nSchneider,\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nwho used to be president of a bank in Las Vegas and is now chairman of \na board of trustees of an organization that is building a performing \narts center in Las Vegas. One foundation gave as a start $150 million \nto the organization. They have raised $420 million. They need $50 \nmillion more for this organization. I said to him: $420 million is how \nmuch we spend in Iraq in 1 day--1 day. That is what this beautiful \nperforming arts center in Las Vegas costs.\n  Madam President, $400 million a day, 7 days a week. There are not \nweekends off. These are taxpayers' dollars we are borrowing. There are \nno holidays. New Year's, Christmas, Easter--it doesn't matter, we work \nright through, and another $400 million of taxpayers' money is \nborrowed. And the number is going up, not down. The world should \nunderstand that America has done its share.\n  I personally dispute the wisdom of going into Iraq. I said, and I \nhave said many times, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history \nof this country is the invasion of Iraq. But we are there. When is \nenough going to be enough? How many more days spending $400 million are \nwe going to need in Iraq? When is enough enough? Is 4,000 soldiers \nenough killed? Is 30,000 wounded? How many blind soldiers do we need?\n  No one disputes the heroic efforts of our troops, but as I indicated \nyesterday, my friend--I named my son after him, and he named his son \nafter me. He used to be a model. He joined the military. He is a \nhelicopter pilot. He served a tour of duty in Afghanistan, and he sent \nme e-mails about what he was doing over there. He came home, and I had \ndinner with him in Las Vegas. He was being shipped to Iraq. I don't get \ne-mails from him anymore. I asked his dad why. He said he wants to come \nhome. All of them should come home is what he said. So he is not \nsending me e-mails anymore. He thinks I might be disappointed in him. I \nam not disappointed in him. He is a valiant soldier.\n  How much more do we need to do? When is enough enough? Five years of \nwar, I guess, according to the Republicans, is not enough. We are going \nto start in a few days the sixth year of this war. When is enough \nenough?\n  Back here a number of years ago--it has been 5 years ago now--I met \nthe Iraqi Governing Council. I can remember that meeting as well as if \nit was yesterday. We were in Senator Frist's office. The head of the \ndelegation from Iraq said: I know people think we have the second \nlargest supply of oil in the world, but that is wrong. We have the \nlargest supply of oil. We have more oil than Saudi Arabia.\n  Iraq is a wealthy Nation. When is there enough American blood and \ntreasure for Iraq? Can't this wealthy nation take care of itself?\n  The matter on which we are going to be voting in just a few minutes \nis not very complicated. This bill is to require a report setting forth \nthe global strategy of the United States to combat and defeat al-Qaida \nand its affiliates.\n\n       Section 1. Report on United States Global Strategy to \n     Combat al-Qaeda and Its Affiliates.\n       (a) Report Required--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, \n     in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff and the Director of National Intelligence, shall \n     join and submit to Congress a report setting forth the \n     global strategy of the United States to combat and defeat \n     al Qaeda its affiliates.\n\n  That is pretty simple and direct. That is what we are voting on. That \nis what the legislation is all about. Why would anybody be opposed to \nthis legislation? It is straightforward legislation.\n  It is clear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not \nserious about any of this Iraq legislation. They had an opportunity to \ntalk on it. As I said earlier today, it has been a good debate. They \nbelieve there still is not enough of American blood and treasure in \nIraq. I do. The American people do. Twenty-five percent of Republicans \nbelieve we should be coming home from Iraq. This is not some Democratic \nidea; it is an idea of the American people.\n  How can they object to this matter on which we are going to vote in a \nfew minutes? How can they not vote overwhelmingly for this legislation? \nIf they had an honest reason to disagree with a report on the fight \nagainst terrorism, that would be one thing. That is not what is going \non here. This is a stall that has been going on so that we will not \nhave the opportunity to start the debate on a stimulus package dealing \nwith housing.\n  Of course, we brought up these matters, and if they were allowing us \nto go forward with these pieces of legislation dealing with Iraq and \nhave amendments like, of course, what has happened--but, no, motions to \nproceed, 30 hours. We broke the record last year in 1 year of a 2-year \nfilibuster plan. They broke all records, and they are at it again.\n  Keith Olbermann, an MSNBC anchor, says at the end of every one of his \ntelecasts:\n\n       This is the 1,764th day since President Bush declared \n     ``mission accomplished'' aboard an aircraft carrier. We all \n     know the mission has not been accomplished. We all know we're \n     not safer today than we were when we began this misguided war \n     now five years ago. It's time to turn the page and begin to \n     rebuild a moral authority to address the growing challenges \n     we face throughout the world.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my majority leader, Senator \nReid, not only for his statement but also for bringing this matter to \nthe floor. I especially thank Senator Feingold. I have been happy to \ncosponsor this measure.\n  I believe, as do many of us today, that the decision to invade Iraq \nwas, in fact, the worst foreign policy decision of our time, maybe \nbeyond that. We will pay a heavy price for it, but we will not pay a \nprice as a nation as great as the price paid by the families who have \nlost in combat a son or daughter or husband or wife they dearly loved. \nThose men and women are true heroes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I thought the vote was at 6:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time is under the control of the \nminority.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield back the remaining time on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.

The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I was scheduled to speak at 6:30. We had a \nvote at 6:30. It is my understanding that I now have the floor to speak \non the bill on which we just voted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I rise to discuss the war in Iraq and specifically the \nlegislation at hand which directs the President to transition the \nmission of U.S. forces in Iraq.\n  The Senate has voted on this same issue on four separate occasions in \nthis session alone. Not one of those times did the measure receive even \none-third of the Senate's support. Nonetheless, here we are again \ndebating the policies of the war.\n  Let me be clear. There is certainly nothing wrong with openly \ndebating those policies. It is our responsibility as Members of this \nbody to discuss thoroughly what is arguably the most important and \ndefining issue of our day. In fact, I find it highly curious there was \nan attempt to castigate those who voted for this debate and who wanted \nthe full 30 hours to talk about this vital issue. Some in this body \nseem to have perhaps been a little too clever and tried to summon as \nmuch outrage against debating this matter as they were prepared to use \nin support of debate.\n  I do question exactly what those in support of this bill hoped to \nrealistically accomplish with this debate and this legislation before \nus given the gains that have been made through the surge strategy. Last \nMay when the surge was being implemented, only 29 Senators voted for \nsimilar legislation. Undoubtedly, much has changed for the better since \nthat point. Violence in Iraq is down 60 percent since the start of the \nsurge and 80 percent in and around Iraq. There has been a 30-percent \nincrease since June in insurgent weapon caches discovered. Economic \nimprovements continue. Oil production is constantly increasing, up 50 \npercent from this time last year. And oil revenues are nearly double \nwhat they were last year. In Baghdad alone, 21 new health clinics \nopened this year, 1,885 new schools have been built, and another 1,604 \nhave been refurbished throughout Iraq.\n  Because of reconstruction and rebuilding, electricity demand is up 25 \npercent. A year ago, it would have been laughable to suggest that Anbar \nProvince be transferred to Iraqi control. But that will happen in May. \nWhen this occurs, Anbar will be 10 out of 18 provinces under full Iraqi \ncontrol.\n  The city of Ramadi in Anbar was once one of the most dangerous cities \nin Iraq. It is now one of its safest following the surge. The number of \nU.S. combat battalions operating in Ramadi has decreased from five to \ntwo in less than a year.\n  An Army combat brigade that has been stationed in Ramadi for over a \nyear is scheduled to leave the area in March and is not scheduled to be \nreplaced. The United States is on pace to transfer control of all Iraqi \nprovinces by the end of the year.\n  The surge strategy is brilliant in its simplicity: Exert our military \nforces to quell insurgent violence in order to create an environment \nsuitable for fostering and sustaining a legitimate government capable \nof governing its citizens. Real political progress will only be reached \nwhen Iraqis feel secure, and the results of the surge are proving this \nto be exactly the case.\n  Thus far the surge is producing its intended results by eliminating \nterrorists, interrupting communications between insurgents in many \nareas in Iraq, and ensuring safety for the people which, in turn, \nallows far broader, far greater cooperation and association with the \nUnited States.\n  Only with these security improvements do Iraqis have a reasonable \nchance of finding a political solution. This strategy is convincing \nmany Iraqis to abandon terrorist methods and turn against groups such \nas al-Qaida.\n  Our efforts are reuniting torn communities and enabling political \nprocess. Obviously, this Nation would have been better served had the \nsurge strategy been implemented earlier. But the ability to criticize \nstrategy is not the same as the ability to strategize.\n  So I applaud those who did finally implement the surge strategy and \ncongratulate them on their vision. As we know, Iraq must stand up \nbefore we can stand down. Again, David Petraeus has stated there cannot \nbe solely a military solution to violence without political action. And \nhe is absolutely correct in his assertion.\n  In recent weeks, Iraqis have made tremendous political strides under \nwhat are still difficult and onerous conditions and as a result \nincreased security in their nation. February 13 saw the Council of \nRepresentatives pass three key pieces of legislation: amnesty for Sunni \nsecurity detainees, a provincial powers law, and a budget.\n  Debaathification reform was enacted last month as well.\n  Let's talk about those political accomplishments. The general amnesty \nlaw passed by the Shiite-majority Parliament sets the guidelines in \nproviding amnesty for thousands of detainees held in Iraq detention \nfacilities. This helps to remove one of the greatest stumbling blocks \nto reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites.\n  The Iraqi Parliament has also passed the provincial powers law which \noutlines the balance of authorities between the central and local \ngovernments while also specifying that provincial elections be held on \nOctober 1 of this year. The Iraqi Parliament approved a $48 billion \nbudget, representing a step toward Iraq using its own resources to \nprovide for security and infrastructure reconstruction. This Sunni-Shia \ncompromise budget allows the Kurds a larger share of the budget, which \nis 17 percent. Iraqi oil revenues have soared with the rise of global \nprices, and Iraqi production has increased due to gains in security. \nThe money is now going to the provinces on a regular basis where it \nwill fund urgently needed reconstruction and humanitarian relief. The \nIraqi Government is now providing the kind of services that give the \nIraqi people a stake in their own success.\n  Finally, the President's council approved the law of accountability \nand justice on February 3, 2008. This law could allow thousands of \nformer Ba'ath party officials to return to Government jobs and receive \npensions, helping the reconciliation process and stimulating the \neconomy. In addition, even more groundbreaking legislation is slated \nfor consideration in the very near future. These initiatives include a \nhydrocarbons law to determine the level of control allocated to the \ncentral Government as well as an election law that is being drafted \ncurrently by the Prime Minister's office. While the job is far\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nfrom over and much work is still required, these recent accomplishments \non the political and economic fronts continue to gather momentum and \nshow important signs of progress and create reasons for optimism. There \nis much criticism of flaws in the Iraqi Government's processes and \noutcomes, but any Member of this body who considers throwing stones in \nthat direction should first glance at any newspaper, news show, citizen \nrally, or public opinion poll, and reflect on who among us is producing \nperfect and flawless legislation.\n  Even the media, which has often been one-sided on the war, has for \nseveral months now been forced to report that the surge and coalition \nefforts have been succeeding. Let's look at some of the headlines:\n  The Washington Post, February 23, 2007, ``Sadr Extends Truce in \nIraq''; the Los Angeles Times, February 22, 2008, ``U.S. Micro-Loan \nEffort Yields Big Results in Iraqi Province''; the Colorado Springs \nGazette, February 18, 2008, ``Baghdad Neighborhood is a Model of \nProgress''; Reuters, February 16 of this year, ``Attacks in Baghdad \nFall 80 Percent''; Reuters, a February 13 article, ``Iraq Lawmakers \nPass Key Budget and Amnesty Laws''; Reuters on January 17 of 2008, \n``Iraqi Forces Could Control All Provinces This Year''; even the New \nYork Times, February 14, 2008, ``Making (Some) Progress in Iraq''; the \nWashington Post on February 10, 2008, ``Diary of an Insurgent in \nRetreat: Al-Qaeda in Iraq Figure Lists Woes''; the AP, February 2, \n2008, ``Lynch: US Surge Tipped Scales in Iraq''; an AP article on \nJanuary 21, 2008, ``U.N. Envoy Applauds Cut in Iraqi Violence''; the \nWinston-Salem Journal, February 12, 2008, ``Iraq is Much Changed Since \nSurge Started One Year Ago''; Tacoma News Tribune, February 14, 2008, \n``Iraq Reaches Benchmark for Healing.''\n  Coalition success is being seen all over Iraq. It is being reported. \nThe only people who seem to refuse to see it or admit we are winning in \nIraq are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who continue time \nand again to bring this issue to the floor claiming that the surge has \nnot worked and urging immediate troop withdrawal. Certain Members of \nCongress continue to deny that any progress has been made. Earlier this \nmonth the Speaker of the House described the surge as a failure. \nOpponents long criticized the administration for not sending more \ntroops to Iraq. But when this strategy was installed, it was also \nattacked as opponents declared that this effort was essentially too \nlittle, too late. When the surge began to show great military success, \nit faded from the floor of this body.\n  That is why we welcome the chance to spend 30 hours on this topic. It \nis a shame that now, when both military and political success is being \nrealized, we are only debating whether to retreat. If that is the \nground the majority wishes to stand on, so be it.\n  For a moment let's consider the severity of the issue at hand. We are \ndebating whether to deploy our forces which would essentially concede \nthe country to whatever group eventually gains control that would \nlikely plunge the country into further unrest and chaos. It seems we \nare acting under the assumption that if we get all of our forces out, \nwe can slam the door behind us and all will be fine. This policy fails \nto lend any consideration to what would certainly be dire consequences \nthat would ensue as a result of our Nation abandoning Iraq at this \ncritical juncture. To do this would simply be irresponsible and \nshortsighted. Iraq is the pivotal front in our global war on terror. To \nintentionally abandon our progress and lose the battle would surely \ncause irrevocable harm to our efforts to secure our Nation. Osama bin \nLaden had referred to Iraq as the central front in the war against \nAmerica and the West. Al-Qaida in Iraq shares this view of the \nsituation. Leaving prematurely would only strengthen al-Qaida and \nenable terrorists to set up training camps in Iraq and plot further \nattacks on the United States.\n  The National Intelligence Council stated:\n\n       If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge \n     that al Qaeda in Iraq would attempt to use parts of the \n     country--particularly al-Anbar province--to plan increased \n     attacks in and outside Iraq.\n\n  By passing this legislation, we would be running away from a war from \nthe floor of the Senate. When has it ever been sound policy for \nlegislators to micromanage a war from Washington? I don't ever recall \nin our history this tactic being successful in achieving our strategic \ngoals. In fact, let me remind our colleagues, we have seen terrible \nresults from political motives being placed above military necessity. \nInstalling an artificial deadline is not what we need. It is not what \nis good for the Nation. It is not good for the future of Iraq and the \nlong-term stability of that region. We have heard from our military \nintelligence professionals who have warned about the possible \nconsequences of hasty withdrawal and the potentially catastrophic \nresults that may ensue. We should also listen to our folks on the \nground. I have heard time and time again from our service men and women \nfrom all branches of the military who have returned from Iraq that \nprogress is being made, and they are proud of the contributions they \nare making to this Nation and to the long-term stability of Iraq and \nthe Middle East.\n  In my lifetime I have witnessed few events that compare to the joy \nand jubilation that accompany the homecoming of a military unit. When I \nhave seen a brigade return home to Fort Carson or a wing to Peterson \nAir Force base, there are no words to describe the sheer emotion of \nseeing families returned to loved ones and friends. However, \nredeploying our forces at this point is not the proper course of action \nand not in the best interests of our Nation. Our military does not \nexist just to come marching home, and our military understands this. \nThey exist to fight our enemies and secure our vital national \ninterests. Removing Saddam Hussein from power was in our national \ninterest. Stability in the Middle East is in our national interest. \nSecuring Iraq from terrorist control is in our national interest. \nPandering speeches about bringing the troops home that strive for mere \npolitical points and fail to acknowledge strategic realities are not in \nour national interest.\n\n  We still have a job that needs to be completed. We still have work to \ndo. When the time is right, we will redeploy responsibly. The Iraqi \nGovernment is making progress. We are beginning to be able to stand \ndown to a greater extent than we have in the past. General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker will return to Washington and report on the progress \nin Iraq in April. We owe to it our men and women in harm's way to \nlisten to the experts and make our decisions off of their findings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has voted \noverwhelmingly to allow some debate of the Feingold-Reid al-Qaida bill, \nbut it is pretty clear to everyone that this body still doesn't fully \nunderstand and is not ready to address head on the threat posed by al-\nQaida. As was made clear during debate on the Iraq redeployment \nlegislation, too many Members confuse the war in Iraq with the fight \nagainst al-Qaida. That is true of the administration too. While it is \nfocused on Iraq, al-Qaida has reconstituted itself along the \nAfghanistan-Pakistan border. Don't take my word for it. Listen to our \nintelligence community.\n  Early this month, the Director of National Intelligence testified \nbefore Congress that the central leadership based in the border area of \nPakistan is al-Qaida's most dangerous component. A few months ago, the \nDNI again repeated the intelligence community's assessment that over \nthe last few years ``Al Qaeda's central leadership has been able to \nregenerate the core operational capabilities needed to conduct attacks \nin the Homeland''--our homeland, Mr. President, the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The DNI also testified that al-Qaida ``is improving the last key \naspect of its ability to attack the U.S.: the identification, training, \nand positioning of operatives for an attack in the Homeland.''\n  Meanwhile, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan is \nserving as a staging ground for al-Qaida in support of the Taliban and \nproviding it with a base similar to the one it used to have across the \nborder in Afghanistan. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM \nMike Mullen, testified\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nrecently that ``the most likely near term attack on the United States \nwill come from Al Qaeda via'' its safe havens in Pakistan--not in Iraq, \nin Pakistan. Over the past year, we have seen an unprecedented rise in \nsuicide bombings in Pakistan. The Taliban is gaining ground in \nAfghanistan. While we may be sending an additional 3,200 marines to \nAfghanistan in the near future, we have been fighting for far too long \nthere with too few soldiers and too few reconstruction funds.\n  With the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying in ``Iraq we do what we must \nand in Afghanistan we do what we can,'' it is no wonder that \nAfghanistan is teetering on the edge. Let me remind my colleagues that \nit was from Afghanistan--Afghanistan, not Iraq--that the 9/11 attacks \nwere planned. And it was under the Taliban regime, which is once again \ngaining ground, that al-Qaida was able to flourish so freely.\n  Al-Qaida affiliates from Africa to Southeast Asia pose a significant \nterrorist threat. While we have been so myopically fixated on Iraq, the \nthreat from an al-Qaida affiliate in north Africa has grown and now, \naccording to the DNI's testimony, ``represents a significant threat to \nthe United States and European interests in the region.'' Since its \nmerger with al-Qaida in September 2006, it has expanded its targets to \ninclude the United States, the United Nations, and other interests. And \nit likely got a further boost when al-Qaida leadership announced last \nNovember that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group united with al-Qaida \nunder AQIM's leadership. Its possible reach covers Tunisia, Morocco, \nNigeria, Mauritania, Libya, and other countries. Meanwhile, it is using \ndeadly tactics that suggest it is acquiring knowledge from the war in \nIraq. That is right. The war in Iraq may be being used as a training \nground by forces that wish to do us harm. Another way of saying it is, \nour troops are being used as a way to train people to give them the \nskills to launch attacks in other places.\n  Al-Qaida has affiliates around the world--in Saudi Arabia, the United \nArab Emirates, Yemen, Lebanon, where al-Qaida poses a growing threat, \nthe Horn of Africa, and Southeast Asia. We cannot ignore the rest of \nthe world to focus solely on Iraq. Al-Qaida is and will continue to be \na global terrorist organization with dangerous affiliates around the \nworld. We are watching al-Qaida strengthen and develop its affiliates \naround the world while we remain bogged down in Iraq.\n\n  We need a robust military presence and an effective reconstruction \nprogram in Afghanistan. We need to build strong partnerships where al-\nQaida and its affiliates are operating--across north Africa, in \nSoutheast Asia, and along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, \nand we need to address the root causes of the terrorist threat, not \njust rely on military power to get the job done.\n  We can start doing that by passing S. 2634. This bill requires the \nadministration to provide Congress with a report outlining a \ncomprehensive global strategy to defeat al-Qaida and its affiliates. \nThe strategy must ensure U.S. resources and assets are targeted \nappropriately to meet the regional and country-specific threats we \nface, and that troop deployments do not overstretch our military.\n  Who could oppose a commonsense bill such as this? Well, as I noted \nearlier, the administration actually issued a veto threat for this \nbill. That threat makes the baffling argument that preparing a report \non the threat of al-Qaida may somehow ``inhibit the President's \nconstitutional authority as Commander in Chief.'' That is not all. The \nadministration also argues that preparing a plan that prioritizes \noperations against al-Qaida would tie the hands of commanders.\n  This is just plain double-talk. We are trying to help our commanders \nand the rest of our Government to properly dedicate their resources to \nour most pressing national security concern. This bill does not tell \nour commanders how to carry out any operations; it merely requires a \nreport. The Congress has a constitutional responsibility, in \ncollaboration with the President, to determine what are our national \nsecurity priorities. That is what we should be doing. That is what this \nbill would do. Unless the President has completely abandoned the idea \nof civilian control of the military, and of the shared responsibilities \nbetween the legislative and executive branches, then he should have no \nobjection to my bill.\n  The administration does say that it ``supports the bill's goals and \nintent, with regard to updating and informing Congress and the American \npeople on the strategy to combat terrorism.'' I guess that is good \nnews. But then it cites two documents it has already prepared on this \ntopic. One is the September 2006 National Strategy for Combating \nTerrorism, which sets broad goals but does not include the detail \ncalled for in our bill about how limited resources will be allocated to \nachieve this strategic vision. That 2006 document also does not \nprioritize the geographic--country and region-specific--threats we face \nfrom AQ and its affiliates, which is essential because how else--how \nelse, Mr. President--will we know where to focus our resources?\n  The other document cited by the administration is the National \nImplementation Plan. I am a member of both the Senate Intelligence and \nForeign Relations Committees, and I am not even allowed to see that \ndocument. The administration will not even share it with the full \nIntelligence Committee. So the idea this document is an acceptable \nsubstitute for what is called for in the Feingold-Reid bill is absurd.\n  The administration suggests our bill limits the President's authority \nto withhold information. Now, I agree we need to protect classified \ninformation, and there is nothing in my bill--nothing--that would \nprevent the addition of a classified annex. Much of our strategic \nplanning, however, is not classified, consistent with our country's \nbelief in open government and accountability.\n  The American people deserve to be told, to the extent possible \nwithout divulging classified information, what their government is \ndoing to protect them. The President's veto threat is further evidence \nof his unwillingness to be straight with the American people about the \nfact that the war in Iraq is actually undermining our national \nsecurity. The President's current strategy is to prioritize operations \nin Iraq, even to the detriment of operations in Afghanistan against \nthose who attacked us on 9/11.\n  Now, that does not make sense. It has to change, and we have to \nchange it today by passing this Feingold-Reid bill, refocusing our \nattention and resources on al-Qaida.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, one of the most pressing issues in America \ntoday is: What will Congress do to address health care? The American \npeople deserve a 21st century health care system--not just a delivery \nsystem of doctors and hospitals but a system that is integrated, one \nthat recognizes society has changed.\n  This body, several years ago, extended a new benefit to Medicare, \nwhere we covered prescription drugs in a health care delivery system \nthat was created in the 1960s, when drugs were not a common treatment \nfor disease. It took us until the 21st century to recognize that if we \nwould enhance the benefit so we could match the disease with some of \nthe breakthroughs, that the outcome was different, that Americans \nactually got better, that the cost actually went down because we \neliminated the number of incidents.\n  America's health is at risk. When I say America's health is at risk, \nI am talking about the physical health and the economic health of this \ncountry. It is impossible to believe that unless you transform health \ncare so it works for everybody in this country that American business \ncan be competitive in a global marketplace that is not coming, that we \nare part of today.\n  Now, Republicans want to propose to this body and to America one main \ngoal. That goal is that we are committed--Republicans are committed--to \nproviding every American with genuine access to quality, affordable \nhealth care that protects the sacred doctor-patient relationship. This \nis what everybody thinks of when they think of a health care plan: \nhealth care coverage that recognizes them as an individual and coverage \nthey need to provide security for their family.\n\n  Let me restate it. We are committed to providing every American with \ngenuine access to quality, affordable health care that protects the \nsacred\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\ndoctor-patient relationship. Nothing else should get between that. It \nshould not be determined based upon an arbitrary third-party reimburser \nor the Federal Government. The reality is, when we provide every \nAmerican with this opportunity, we have a system that functions like \nthe marketplace is designed.\n  How do we get there? No. 1: access and choice. All Americans have a \nright to choose their doctor, to choose their hospital, and, I believe, \nto choose the health care plan they want, and, more importantly, they \ndeserve. No Washington, DC, bureaucrat should deny that right.\n  Americans like choice. We know that. Americans do not like to have \none choice. They like multiple choices. As a matter of fact, when you \nhave one, you really do not have a choice. Some politicians want to \ngive America one choice. It is the debate potentially of this next \nelection cycle.\n  Let me teach America a new word. It is called ``universal control.'' \nUniversal control: when one entity is in charge of the only choice, and \nnow they control how they provide that; they control what it looks \nlike; they control where you get it; they control what the cost is. All \nof a sudden, this innovative, creative health care system we have had \nin America--that has not worked for everybody because our target has \nnot been to make sure every American is covered--all of a sudden it \ntotally breaks down.\n  Well, one health care package, one set of doctors, one set of \ntreatments, one set of prescriptions is not what America is looking \nfor. America is looking for choice. North Carolinians do not want one \nchoice, and they certainly do not want bureaucrats in Washington, DC, \ndefining what their choices are going to be.\n  A majority of Americans are willing to pay a little bit more to have \nmore choices. I strongly believe doctors and patients--not lawyers and \nbureaucrats--should have the power to make health care decisions.\n  The challenge is that Americans believe that is the most important \nthing. Clearly, access to health care is directly dependent upon cost. \nAmericans must have access and choice, but they also have to have \naffordable coverage. Republicans believe the best health care in the \nworld is worthless if Americans cannot afford it, and I think we would \nall agree.\n  It would drive down costs by giving Americans control over their own \nhealth care choices, making sure patients have the information they \nneed to make good decisions, guaranteeing vigorous competition that \nbenefits patients, and holding the entire health care system \naccountable to the patients' needs.\n  You see, in many cases we have used Government as the accountability \nmeasure. We miss the boat. The accountability measure is making sure \npatients hold the system, patients hold the doctors, patients hold the \nhospitals accountable; more importantly, patients hold the insurers \naccountable.\n  This belief that a patient cannot negotiate with an insurer--well, \nquite frankly, these days are over. We need to drive down costs. We \nneed to give Americans control over their own health care choices. We \nneed to make sure patients have the information they need to make good \nchoices--the right choices for them, for their family, for their age, \nfor their illness or their health conditions, and, more importantly, \nfor their income, guaranteeing vigorous competition that benefits \npatients. The focus here is on patients, holding the entire health care \nsystem accountable to patients' needs.\n  I would suggest if health care could be more like a television--with \na television, you have real competition. You have a choice of over the \nair, you have a choice of basic, you have a choice of cable, you have a \nchoice of cable with premiums, and you have a choice of DirectTV. In \nfact, with television, you know exactly what comes with each option. \nYou know exactly how much it costs, and you know you get what you pay \nfor. That can be the only reason that on-demand sports has become so \npopular. It is because when you want to watch a sporting event, and you \nsee exactly what the cost is, you can make a calculation as an \nindividual as to whether that is worth it to you. Americans should have \nall the competition, the choice, the control, and the information they \nneed when it comes to health care decisions. So affordable coverage.\n  Let me tell you a story. My oldest son is now 23. Shortly before he \nbecame 22, I was notified by the Office of Personnel Management in \nWashington that in the Federal Government, regardless of where you were \nin the Federal Government, your children, when they turned the age of \n22, even if they were in school--which mine were--had to be dropped \nfrom your health insurance.\n  Now, forget the fact--I can see the Presiding Officer is struggling \nwith this. That does not save any money. You are exactly right. You are \ntaking the healthiest of America, and you are taking them out of the \nrisk pool that helps hold down the risk for us older guys who are more \nsusceptible to disease. But somewhere the Federal Government got this \nidea that they are going to save money by dropping people when they \nbecome 22 years old--the healthiest of the American population.\n  So I went through the realization that this is actually going to \nhappen. There is no way you can change it. So I called OPM to say: \nSurely, you have negotiated coverage for our children. I would like \nsomething that resembles the plan I had with Blue Cross Blue Shield. \nThey quoted me the exact same plan: $5,400 a year. Twenty-two years \nold, healthy as a bull, still in college, and all of a sudden, as a \nparent, I was strapped with the decision that for him to have coverage \nit was going to cost $5,400. If it was his decision alone, he would \nhave said: No way. Affordability was not met from the standpoint of \nwhat he was getting in coverage for what it was costing.\n  I did not stop there. I picked up the phone. I called the university \nhe was at and found out a local insurer, insurance agent, had \nnegotiated with Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage for kids who fell into \nthis situation where they did not have insurance. I described to him \nthe plan. He quoted me the exact same plan that as a Member of the \nSenate I had, which, before, my son was covered under, with the same \ndeductible, the same copay, the same limits--the exact same plan. But \nthis was negotiated by an independent insurance agent in Chapel Hill, \nNC, against the same Blue Cross Blue Shield that the Federal \nGovernment, representing 1.3 million employees, negotiated with; and on \nbehalf of my son, he negotiated a cost of $1,500 per year--$1,500 \nversus $5,400, a fairly significant savings.\n  We sit here and wonder: What can the American people do with the \nright information relative to the decisions they have to make as it \nrelates to health care coverage? If it is that difficult to figure out \nhow to have the coverage you need at the cost you can afford, envision \nhow difficult it is for a patient without information to decide what \ntype of chemotherapy they are going to take, when all of a sudden the \ndoctor walks in and says: You have cancer and you are going to die \nwithout treatment. This is a difficult thing without the ability to go \nout and search for the information.\n\n  The third item is quality care and prevention. Here is a unique word \nin health care, ``prevention.'' It is something that probably for \ndecades we should have incorporated into the coverage each of us has. \nWe believe in strengthening health care by providing consistent, \ndependable quality and promoting the principles of prevention. What is \nprevention? Let's change our habits. Let's educate ourselves. Let's do \nthe things that keep us healthy. And let's actually pay annually to let \nsomebody go in and see the doctor and make sure there is not a health \ncondition they have that could be prevented, early, without the \nincidence of an inpatient stay in the hospital.\n  We will harness the powerful promise of advanced research and modern \ntechnology to create innovative new treatments and breakthrough cures, \npromote wellness, and empower consumers with accurate, comprehensive \ninformation on quality health care that is available for them.\n  Choice, information: I believe strengthening health care by providing \nconsistent, dependable quality and promoting prevention is absolutely \nessential.\n  Creating innovative new treatments and breakthrough cures: Let me ask \nmy colleagues, if innovation didn't take place, what would the \ndiabetics do\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\ntoday, those who currently have a diabetic pump that is implanted in \ntheir side, that automatically reads their blood sugar 24 hours a day, \nadministers the insulin when they need it. No longer do they go through \na finger prick. No longer do they get an inconsistent reading. No \nlonger do they inject themselves later than they need to keep a \nbalance. Why is that important? Because for somebody with diabetes who \ncan constantly maintain their blood sugar at the right level, it means \nnone of the horrors we heard about and saw and that many families lived \nwith before when the management was not as precise. The result was, \neventually they began to go blind, eventually began to have a toe, two \ntoes, all their toes, a foot, a leg amputated because of the effects of \ndiabetes. Forget the number of times the person might have been \nadmitted to the hospital to get their blood sugar in balance so they \ncould at least delay the deterioration. Now technology allows a \ndiabetic to insert a pump and to keep a constant read and a constant \nregulation of their blood sugar. The net result is the system saves a \ntremendous amount of money. The individual saves a tremendous amount of \nmoney. The individual's quality of life is that much better.\n  For a student who had diabetes, the likelihood was that they would \nnever play organized sports because the demands on an athlete mean they \nhave a blood sugar spike that is incredible, and without the ability to \nregulate that, it was impossible. Now kids are playing soccer at every \nage and running around with a pump that is automatically reading their \nblood sugar.\n  How about for some of us who are a little bit older and we probably \nare susceptible--because we haven't done everything we should do \nregarding healthy habits, we are susceptible to high cholesterol. Where \nwould we be without the pharmaceuticals' breakthrough of cholesterol \ndrugs? I will tell my colleagues where we would be. We would be funding \n$8,000-plus bypass surgeries at an alarming rate that would bankrupt \nthe system, both public and private. But today we have this little pill \nwe can take. It doesn't take the place of exercise, it doesn't take the \nplace of diet, but it certainly enhances our chances that we are not \ngoing to be selected to have bypass surgery, open-heart surgery; that \nwe are not going to have the recovery time, the loss of productivity at \nwork because innovation allowed us now to inject in that quality arena \na different outcome based upon innovation.\n  We want to promote wellness. We want to empower consumers with \naccurate, comprehensive information. The United States has the best \nhealth care system in the world. I will tell my colleagues, North \nCarolina is a big reason as to why health care is so good. We need to \nmake sure quality stays high while improving the access. Congress needs \nto foster--not hinder--research and development of treatments and \ncures.\n  I just mentioned prevention and wellness. Those words need to be the \nfirst thing Americans think about when they think ``health care'' or \nwhen they think ``doctors.'' Prevention and wellness. Doctors should be \npaid to help people stay healthy instead of just paying them to treat \nindividuals who are sick.\n  My final thought for this section: Patients should have as much \ninformation prior to using doctors and hospitals as they do prior to \nbuying cars. What a novel idea. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices is starting to provide quality, Web-based information about \nnursing homes and hospitals. The initiative needs to keep growing so \nall patients have the ability to research all aspects of health care. \nThat happens in real time at the tips of our fingers. Access and \nchoice, affordable coverage, quality care and prevention.\n  The fourth piece--and we shouldn't be shocked because this is \nAmerica--personal ownership and security. But this is something our \nsystem has never incorporated. We believe Americans should own and \ncontrol their health care coverage and should have the freedom and the \nflexibility to take it with them when they change jobs, just like a \n401(k).\n  Hard-working Americans deserve the peace of mind to know the care \nthey need will be the care they receive and that their financial \nsecurity will be protected from catastrophic events.\n  Americans will achieve this security and will receive better care if \nthe health care system is highly personalized and guarantees patient \ncontrol. What does that mean? With the right information, with the \nright resources, any American should have the ability to construct a \nhealth care plan that meets their age, their health, their income, and \nhave the financial security of knowing they are covered. Some might \ncall this ala carte, the ability to construct something that meets--for \nthose of us who are over a certain age, we have probably already been \ninstructed by our spouses that we have had all the children we are \ngoing to have. That is a little tough in this body because we have had \nsome Members who had them at quite a late stage in life. But I fall \ninto that category. I can't buy health insurance coverage that doesn't \ncome with maternity coverage. I pay for it knowing I am never going to \nuse it.\n  Now, maybe I am helping to subsidize somebody else. But while we are \nhere talking about every American being insured, the reason we are here \nis because that subsidy is going on today. It goes on in every company. \nIn goes on with everybody who pays out of pocket. It is something that \nhappens to each of us who have health insurance, and it is triggered by \nsomebody who receives a service in health care and either won't or \ncan't pay. So to recover the cost of the delivery of that benefit, \nhospitals, doctors, every delivery point in health care does what they \ncall cost-shift. They charge that cost of delivering that service over \nto the people who have coverage or who can pay.\n\n  When all of a sudden you have a goal and a commitment that every \nAmerican is insured, the cost-shift goes away. What is the score on \nthat? It is $200 billion a year. So that is $200 billion that today \ndoes not go to the delivery of one ounce of care. It is shifted to \npeople who can pay or who are covered. All of a sudden now we know the \nanswer to why health care increases at double-digit rates of inflation \non an annual basis. It is because as the pool of uninsured continues to \ngrow, the amount of cost-shift continues to grow, and the cost-shift is \ndirectly dumped on those companies that provide coverage for their \nemployees, for us as individuals if we go to the marketplace and we buy \ncoverage or to us who pay out of pocket when we access health care \nbecause it is shifted evenly across the system.\n  Forget the fact that if we adopt this, if we achieve it, that, one, \nwe have a more manageable system--a system, quite honestly, that \nincorporates access and choice, affordability, quality and prevention \nand wellness, personal ownership, and the security of knowing you have \ncoverage. We drive the costs down for every American.\n  The goal is to continue to have the best health care system in the \nworld, to continue to drive innovation and medical breakthroughs, and \nto do it in a way that brings the overall cost of health care down. If \nwe can begin to see the trend line on inflation and health care begin \nto go south, it is amazing what type of an incentive it will be to \nindividuals who now engage in the prevention and wellness section and \nbegin to look at ways that they can control the cost of their health \ncare because it is now theirs, they own it, they have constructed it, \nthey can change it as they need to, and--oh, yes, by the way, to \naccomplish this, we have to have 50 States that have high-risk pools \nthat take those individuals with preexisting conditions, and we \ncollectively buy their cost of insurance down to an equal amount for \nthose of us who are healthy. A lot of States around the country \ncurrently do it. Mine just happened to pass it last year. We are late \ncoming to the game. But the reality is that all 50 States should and \nwill and have to do it if we want the system to work.\n  There is a way to maintain the highest level of care in the world, \nthe highest commitment to innovation and breakthroughs, to look down \nthe road and know we are going to cure things tomorrow, that today \nthere is only one outcome and it is to live. If we don't change and \ntransform our health care system and begin to promote prevention and \nwellness and to drive the costs down, the first thing that will leave \nis innovation, the innovation that treats\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nmany of us today in a totally different way, with a multitude of \noptions we never had. If, in fact, we don't begin to change this, the \nsystem will reflect one choice, one doctor, one hospital, one delivery \nport.\n  I challenge my colleagues today that is universal control, control \nwhere one entity--the Federal Government--dictates where we go, who we \nsee, what they are reimbursed for delivering the service, and the \noutcome will be the lack of innovation, the lack of breakthroughs, and \nno reason for the American people to make healthy choices and to engage \nin prevention and wellness.\n  That is where we are. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill engage and encourage our leadership to have a healthy debate on \nhealth care. I haven't locked in to any prescribed legislation tonight. \nIt is the principles of the Republican Conference that I am here to \npresent and will continue to come back to the Senate floor to present. \nI encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: let's come to the \nfloor. Bring your legislation. Let's examine it, let's debate it, let's \nlet America see it. Let them be the judge. At the end of the day, it is \nthe American people who will influence where this debate goes, and that \nis exactly who should influence it. They are the patients of the future \nhealth care system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 5th \nanniversary of Nevada State College, the newest institution in the \nNevada System of Higher Education\n  Nevada State College was born out of a dire need. In recent years, \nsouthern Nevada has been growing at a breakneck pace. In 1990, Clark \nCounty's population was just over 740,000 people; today, it is over 2 \nmillion. With such tremendous growth came considerable growing pains. \nEnrollment in Nevada's two universities and four community colleges \nswelled 16 percent from 1994 to 2000. Clark County was facing both \nteacher and nursing shortages. Nevada needed another place to train the \nnext generation of nurses, teachers, and business professionals. That \nplace is Nevada State College.\n  In many ways, Nevada State College is representative of our State. In \n2002, Nevada State opened its doors with 177 students; 5 years later, \nNSC's enrollment has swelled to over 1,900. In true pioneer fashion, \nNevada State's students tend to focus on professions that are needed \nmost in the community. NSC's two largest majors, nursing and teaching, \nare two areas of critical need in Nevada. But Nevada State is more than \nsimply a nursing and teaching college.\n  Nevada State students also practice civic responsibility. Before they \ngraduate, NSC students are required to take a course called Community \nBased Learning, CBL, 400. In this course, students work with different \norganizations to improve their community. For example, Nevada State \ngraduates have worked at their local libraries, volunteered at \nnonprofits, and tutored public school students in the areas of math, \nscience, and engineering. This service-oriented program has been such a \nsuccess, it was named to the Presidential Higher Education Community \nService Honor Roll for 2007.\n  Nevada State College has experienced rapid growth in its first 5 \nyears, and I am sure it will continue to grow in both students and \nstature. Soon, NSC will begin expanding into its 500-acre parcel \nsituated in the beautiful foothills of Henderson. I look forward to the \ncompletion of the new campus. Nevada State College is only 5 years old, \nbut it has already made its mark as one of Nevada's shining academic \ngems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1264-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF JOHNNIE ALBERTSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the life and \naccomplishments of Ms. Johnnie Albertson. Johnnie, a valued employee of \nthe Small Business Administration for 32 years, succumbed to illnesses \nresulting from pneumonia. A native North Carolinian, Ms. Albertson was \nable, through her own perseverance, to overcome poverty and the loss of \nher parents to establish herself as a champion of equal rights.\n  Ms. Albertson will be remembered for her dedication to her work with \nthe Small Business Administration. Johnnie was a modern pioneer who \novercame gender and class restrictions and went on to hold numerous \nsenior positions at the SBA. She served as the first Associate \nAdministrator for the Small Business Development Center Program and was \nthe first woman to achieve the rank of senior executive within the \nSBA--the highest rank possible without a congressional appointment.\n  Through the many programs she initiated at the SBA, Johnnie was \ninstrumental in guaranteeing the rights of minority and female small \nbusiness owners across the country. Thousands of business owners owe \ntheir success, in part, to Ms. Albertson's resolve to ensure equal \nopportunities for all entrepreneurial Americans.\n  For her achievements, Ms. Albertson was awarded the SBA's Silver \nMedal for Meritorious Service and the inaugural SBA Lifetime \nAchievement Award. She was also the first female to sell advertising \nspace for the Washington Post, New York Times, and the New York \nTribune. These awards, coupled with her work in the private sector, \nforged a path for others to follow.\n  Johnnie Albertson will be remembered by those closest to her for her \nenthusiasm for reading, her wonderful sense of humor, and her love of \njazz music. Those who benefited personally by knowing Ms. Albertson, \nalong with those who profited by her good works, will forever be \nindebted to her generosity, devotion, and diligence in promoting equal \nopportunities for all. Mr. President, I extend my deepest sympathies to \nthe friends and family of Ms. Albertson and express my gratitude for \nthe passion with which she served our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1264-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1264-S1265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I welcome the Senate passage of the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act. The bill is a long overdue response to a \nhealth crisis for our country's American Indians and would at last \nstrengthen and expand health services to those who need it most and \nthose to whom promises were made but far too few promises have been \nkept. The last comprehensive reauthorization of IHCIA took place in \n1992--and since then, progress has been ground to a halt in the Senate \nwhile health disparities for American Indians have dramatically \nwidened.\n  The situation is dire. Today, American Indians suffer from \ndisproportionately higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, suicide, \nand several types of cancer than all other groups in the United States: \n2.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes; 630 percent more \nlikely to die from alcoholism; and a life expectancy nearly 6 years \nshorter than the rest of the U.S. population. The gap between the needs \nof this community and the resources dedicated to addressing them is \nstark: fewer mental health professionals available to treat Indians \nthan the rest of the U.S. population; health care expenditures for \nIndians less than half of what America spends for Federal prisoners.\n  It goes without saying that we should invest the necessary funds in \nimproving health coverage and care for American Indians, which is why \nit is so important that the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nmodernizes Indian health care services and helps ensure at least that \nmoney is no longer the biggest impediment to quality health care in \nIndian Country.\n  In my home State, the status of Indian health care is particularly \ndaunting: inadequate health facilities, mental health services and \nassisted living care for the elderly; the percentage\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nof American Indians with poor emotional health is on average 2.1 times \nhigher than the adult Massachusetts population; an obesity rate twice \nas high as the rate for Massachusetts adults in general. Moreover, the \npercentage of Mashpee Wampanoag adults with diabetes is nearly two \ntimes higher than the rest of the adult population in our State. During \nthe 5 years between 1999 and 2004, American Indian mothers were over \nthree times more likely to smoke during pregnancy than all mothers \ngiving birth in Massachusetts. American Indian students have much \nhigher percentages of smoking, drinking alcohol before age 13, and \nlifetime cocaine use than all other students in Massachusetts. Also, 1 \nin 4 American Indian high school students have reported attempting \nsuicide compared to 1 out of 10 for all other students. The Indian \nhealth bill is an important step we must take to begin reversing these \ntroubling statistics in Massachusetts and across the Nation.\n  This bill can mark a new day of at last addressing the health care \nneeds of Indian Country programs to increase the outreach and \nenrollment of Indians in Medicaid and CHIP and improve the ability for \ntribes to participate in managed care health plans. The Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act brings greater access to health care services, \nimproved medical insurance coverage, and education of disease \nprevention and healthy lifestyles.\n  The Senate came together across partisan lines to take a step forward \nwith Indian Country, and I look forward to the quick passage of the \nbill and ultimately to seeing it signed into law by President Bush. \nThis must be the beginning, not the end, of a new compact with Indian \nCountry--and a renewed commitment to making sure that no American's \nhealth suffers because they are born on a farm, in a city, or on a \nreservation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1265-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RED CROSS MONTH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Red Cross and its \ncampaign to encourage citizen preparedness for disasters.\n  For 65 years, since the first proclamation by Franklin D. Roosevelt, \nPresidents of the United States have designated March as Red Cross \nMonth.\n  I am proud to support this year's proclamation in recognizing this \ngreat organization, whose activities include lifesaving courses, blood \ndrives, sheltering families displaced by fire or flood, and responding \nto major disasters. This January, for example, Red Cross work in my \nhome State of Maine included an urgent blood drive amid ice and snow \nthat had reduced some hospitals' blood supply to a single day. Other \nMaine Red Cross workers were taking care of a seven-member family in \nthe town of Skowhegan who had lost their home and possessions in a \nfire.\n  I know the good works of the Red Cross both as a Maine resident and \nas a Senator. As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity, I have worked closely with emergency management agencies and \nnonprofit organizations for years. I know the Red Cross has not only \nsaved many lives and comforted millions but has taken steps to improve \nits structure and capabilities for disaster response.\n  The record of recent years for terrorism, fires, earthquakes, floods, \nand other disasters underscores the need for preparedness not only at \nall levels of government but among individual citizens and families.\n  I therefore commend the Red Cross for focusing their public-\ncommunication efforts this year on the theme of ``Be Red Cross Ready.'' \nIt is a well-chosen theme: Red Cross survey work finds that up to 60 \npercent of Americans are entirely unprepared for disaster. They have no \nemergency supplies, no firstaid or CPR training, no rendezvous or \ncommunication plans or other precautions.\n  The catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina reminded us that government and \nother first responders, no matter how efficient and heroic, cannot \nappear instantly at every point affected by a disaster. Every citizen \nshould be prepared to serve as a first responder for family and \nneighbors if official or volunteer responders cannot offer immediate \nassistance.\n  Encouraging individual responsibility and preparedness to augment \ngovernment and private organization efforts can reinforce our national \nresponse framework to provide truly comprehensive and all-hazards \nprotection.\n  For promoting readiness, and for all its good works, the American Red \nCross deserves the thanks of all Americans and the recognition of Red \nCross Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1265-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1265-S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a part of National Peace Corps \nWeek, I wish to join many of my colleagues in celebrating the 47th \nanniversary of the Peace Corps and honoring the important work of Peace \nCorps volunteers.\n  During this week, Peace Corps volunteers from around the world who \nhave served over the years will share their overseas experiences with \nschools and community groups around the United States.\n  By giving presentations during Peace Corps Week, former Peace Corps \nvolunteers will help Americans better understand the people and \ncultures they have experienced, and the many benefits of Peace Corps \nservice.\n  By making presentations in classrooms, former volunteers will help \ncreate greater global awareness among students.\n  The Peace Corps is one of our most effective and successful foreign \naid programs.\n  Since the establishment of the Peace Corps by President John F. \nKennedy in 1961, more than 190,000 U.S. citizens, including 25,000 from \nmy home State of California, have served their country in the cause of \npeace by living and working in 139 developing countries.\n  The world has changed since 1961--and the Peace Corps has succeeded \nin keeping up with these changes.\n  While education and agriculture are still an important part of what a \nPeace Corp volunteer does, today's volunteers also work on HIV/AIDS \nawareness, information technology, and business development.\n  Many volunteers work in orphanages with HIV-positive children, \nimplement programs for at-risk youth, and create support groups for \nHIV-positive people.\n  Business volunteers conduct seminars on subjects like marketing, \nstrategic planning, and tourism development. They work with women and \nminority groups to strengthen their participation in the economic \nsystem.\n  Agriculture volunteers may find themselves working with farmers to \nimplement techniques to improve soil quality and conserve water--or on \nthe business end conducting production cost-and-price analyses.\n  The Peace Corps also assists countries in need by supplying Crisis \nCorps volunteers--former volunteers who return to the field on a short-\nterm basis. In 2005, for the first time in its history, Peace Corps \ndeployed 272 Crisis Corps volunteers domestically to assist in \nHurricane Katrina relief efforts along the gulf coast.\n  Also in 2005, Crisis Corps volunteers were deployed to Sri Lanka and \nThailand to assist with rebuilding tsunami devastated areas, and to \nGuatemala following Hurricane Stan. As part of PEPFAR, Crisis Corps has \ndeployed volunteers to Uganda, Kenya, Namibia and Zambia. Finally, \nCrisis Corps is working with Peace Corps posts in Central America and \nthe Caribbean to address disaster preparedness in the region.\n  Today's Peace Corps is more vital than ever, working in emerging and \nessential areas such as information technology and business \ndevelopment. They have made significant and lasting contributions \naround the world in agriculture, education, health, HIV/AIDS, and the \nenvironment.\n  Peace Corps volunteers continue to help countless individuals who \nwant to build a better life for themselves, their children, and their \ncommunities.\n  At a time when the United States is seeking to reclaim the respect \nand admiration of the world and once again be seen as a champion and a \nleader of democracy, justice, and human rights, Peace Corps volunteers \nrevitalize faith in this country.\n  They are leaders and diplomats, and they serve as an inspiration not \nonly to their fellow American citizens but to citizens all across the \nworld.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Peace Corps and celebrate \nNational Peace Corps Week.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National Peace\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\nCorps Week and to recognize the 47th anniversary of this distinguished \norganization. Since 1961, the Peace Corps has dispatched over 190,000 \nvolunteers to promote a greater understanding between the United States \nand the rest of the world.\n  As part of National Peace Corps Week, returning volunteers will be \nvisiting Washington for several days of events. Many of them will use \nthis opportunity to share their experiences in local classrooms. I \nheartily applaud these fine men and women for their initiative in \nseeking to make the world a better place to live and for the positive \nimpact they have had beyond our borders.\n  Now more than ever, the work of Peace Corps volunteers is an \nimportant asset within the diplomatic toolbox of the United States. \nTheir efforts augment official diplomatic acts of our Government and \nadd a personal dimension which could not be duplicated in any other \nway. When a volunteer travels abroad, they provide others with a \nglimpse of what it means to be an American and the values we cherish \nhere at home. I encourage all Americans to make the kind of selfless \ncontributions these volunteers provide to the international community. \nThe Peace Corps has proven that individual citizens working together \ncan promote and strengthen the image of the United States.\n  Peace Corps volunteers inspire us all, and I am proud to say that 213 \nvolunteers from the State of Oregon are currently serving in over 50 \ndeveloping countries. These Oregonians complement the thousands of \nothers who have served in the Peace Corps, and they brighten our hopes \nfor a better tomorrow. Peace Corps volunteers have shown a level of \ndedication and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary. I invite all \nOregonians, and all Americans, to join me this week in commending their \nefforts.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Peace Corps \nvolunteers during National Peace Corps Week.\n  Currently, 25 active U.S. Peace Corps volunteers are from Wyoming. \nThey have joined a unique organization of people who have taken the \ninitiative and make the personal commitment to assist those around the \nworld who are less fortunate.\n  Peace Corps volunteers are the face of America in many countries. \nThey are often on the frontline in the most primitive of environments, \nworking tirelessly with local leaders to build a better future. Their \noptimism is often contagious as they assist communities in building \ninfrastructure, developing resources, and improving basic health care, \neducation, and business opportunities.\n  I commend all the men and women of the Peace Corps for their personal \nsacrifices. It is not easy to leave behind friends and family and the \ncomforts of home. Yet I often hear that the rewards of bringing aid to \nthose suffering from political unrest, natural disasters, disease, and \na lack of economic opportunities are well worth it.\n  The Peace Corps volunteers' reputation as ambassadors of good will \ndemonstrates the ability of individuals to make a difference in the \nworld. Their firsthand knowledge of the challenges people face on a \nday-to-day basis give those of us in the United States a better \nunderstanding of our world. I applaud their efforts and dedication.\n  I would like to recognize the men and women from Wyoming who are \ncurrently serving as U.S. Peace Corps volunteers: Pamela J. Anderson, \nJason N. Arnold, Alexandria L. Blute, Katie E. Boysen, Bria M. \nChimenti, Joanne A. Cook, Jenna M. Dillon, Heather Dixon, Jeannie M. \nFreeman, Annie B. Gierhart, Alexis L. Grieve, Daniel J.

Schiche, Brian M. Steen, Dayna C. Wolter, \nAngela E. Zivkovich, and Aaron R. Zueck.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I stand before you today to congratulate \nthe Peace Corps on 47 years of service. The Peace Corps was founded on \nMarch 1, 1961, when President John F. Kennedy signed an Executive order \nestablishing the Peace Corps as a new Government agency. Over the \nyears, 190,000 volunteers, including nearly 2,700 Georgians, have \nserved in more than 139 countries around the world. Throughout its \nhistory, Peace Corps volunteers have responded to the issues of this \nworld with energy, purpose, and compassion.\n  From February 25 to March 3, 2008, thousands of former Peace Corps \nvolunteers will share their experiences with schools and community \ngroups across the United States during Peace Corps Week. Through these \nactivities, former Peace Corps volunteers will help our citizens better \nunderstand the advantages of becoming a Peace Corps volunteer. They \nwill also have the opportunity to educate about the people and cultures \nthey have encountered during their service. Additionally, by making \npresentations in classrooms, former volunteers will help create greater \nglobal awareness among students.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late U.S. \nSenator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, who was my good friend and colleague \nfor many years. As the corps' first post-Cold War director, Paul \nsteered the Peace Corps into a new era. I was pleased the President \nhonored Paul posthumously in 2001 by renaming the Peace Corps \nheadquarters in Washington, DC, as the Paul D. Coverdell Peace Corps \nHeadquarters as well as renaming the Peace Corps World Wise Schools \nprogram as the Paul D. Coverdell World Wise Schools program. I am proud \nto support an organization that such a distinguished Georgian was so \ninstrumental in shaping.\n  I am pleased that the President announced the reopening of a Peace \nCorps mission in Rwanda during his visit to the country last week. I \nbelieve the Peace Corps will make an important contribution to the \nrecovery of that country.\n  Today, there are 8,079 Peace Corps volunteers and trainees in 68 \nposts serving 74 countries. Of those volunteers, 160 are from my home \nState of Georgia. I want to take this opportunity to thank those \nGeorgians and all Americans who have served in the Peace Corps. The \nPeace Corps is a critical piece of our diplomatic and humanitarian \nefforts worldwide. I look forward to supporting the Peace Corps as a \nMember of the Senate.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the past 47 years of \nservice of over 190,000 Peace Corps volunteers who have served our \nNation and aided developing nations worldwide. This week our Nation \ncelebrates their contributions toward the elimination of global poverty \nand disease that continues to deprive millions of people the \nopportunity to fulfill their goals and dreams.\n  Henry David Thoreau noted that ``One is not born into the world to do \neverything, but to do something.'' To do something is the foundation of \nthe Peace Corps' mission. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy \nestablished the Peace Corps to promote peace and friendship and \nchallenged Americans, young and old, to help their Nation and the world \nby sharing their talents with those in developing countries. Many \nAmericans have heeded his call to service. Currently, approximately \n8,000 volunteers serve in 74 countries to help train and provide skills \nto those in need and act as American cultural ambassadors to those \nnations. However, their work does not end there.\n  I am very proud that 261 Peace Corps volunteers from Pennsylvania are \ncurrently serving abroad. These men and women will join the ranks of \nformer Pennsylvanian volunteers who continue to leave their mark on the \nworld such as Christina Luongo from Stroudsburg, PA, who served as a \nnutrition education volunteer in Bolivia from 2002 to 2005; Abigail \nCalkins, from Philadelphia, PA, who served as a community development \nvolunteer in Cameroon from 1987 to 1990 and is now working at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania researching breast and endometrial cancer; \nand Betrice Grabish, from North Wales, PA, who served as an English \nteacher in Uzbekistan from 1992 to 1994.\n  As we celebrate National Peace Corps Week, I would also like to \nhighlight the vital contributions that a predecessor of mine, Senator \nHarris Wofford, made toward launching the Peace Corps in 1961. As \nspecial assistant to President John F. Kennedy, Senator Wofford helped \nplan and launch the Peace Corps and later moved with his family to \nEthiopia, where he served as the Peace Corps' special representative to \nAfrica and director of its Ethiopia program. Ever since, Senator \nWofford\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\nhas been a leading voice advocating for more Americans to become \ninvolved in national service. Committing to serve one's nation is an \nhonor, and I join Senator Wofford in calling on more Americans to make \nthis commitment.\n  As our world becomes interconnected, more Americans will need to \ninteract with those who live outside our borders. Peace Corps \nvolunteers learn more than 250 languages, which provides them the \nskills to compete globally as well as assist the U.S. Government in \nnational security areas where critical language skills are essential. \nMany Peace Corps volunteers go on to serve in Congress, the executive \nbranch, and the Foreign Service. I salute the Peace Corps for its \ntremendous work and the dedication of its volunteers who have not \nhesitated to help improve our world. On this week marking the 47th \nanniversary of the founding of the Peace Corps, I call on everyone to \njoin me in celebrating its historic achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1267-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PRENATALLY AND POSTNATALLY DIAGNOSED CONDITIONS AWARENESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am excited and encouraged that the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension today voted \nunanimously to pass the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions \nAwareness Act. This legislation will help parents receiving the news \nthat their unborn child may be born with a disability by supplying them \nwith current and reliable information about the many services and \nsupport networks available. This information will also be made \navailable to parents whose children were diagnosed at birth or up until \n12 months of age.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now \nrecommends that the screening procedure used to detect Downsyndrome be \noffered to all pregnant women, not just those over the age of 35, as \nwas recommended in the past. According to the American Journal of \nMedical Genetics, 80-90 percent of patients who are told that the child \nthey are carrying has Downsyndrome choose to have abortions. The \npercentage is similarly high for children with other prenatally \ndiagnosable conditions. A recent study by Prenatal Diagnosis actually \nputs the figure at between 91 to 93 percent.\n  I believe that one of the main reasons for these disturbingly high \nfigures is that many people in society still believe the outdated \nstereotypes and misconceptions that continue to exist about people with \ndisabilities. In a study done by Louis Harris and Associates, the vast \nmajority of adults with even the most severe disabilities reported \nbeing ``very satisfied'' or ``somewhat satisfied'' with their lives. \nThe same study shows that there is virtually no difference between the \nproportion of Americans with disabilities and those without who are \nmarried and who have children. Many people with even the most severe \ndisabilities live independently, have jobs, get married, have children, \nand pay taxes.\n  Parent support groups and disability advocacy groups have tried to \nreach out to parents who have received prenatal diagnoses of various \nconditions, but they often have difficulty getting practical \ninformation about raising a child with a disability and information \nabout available services and resources to new and expecting parents. \nThis bill will help to remediate this situation in five concrete ways.\n  First, the bill establishes a toll-free resource telephone hotline \nparents can call after they have been given a prenatal or postnatal \ndiagnosis for their child. The bill also calls for the expansion of the \nleading information clearinghouse on disability, so that it can more \neffectively provide parents with accurate, up-to-date information on \ntheir child's condition along with available resources and services. \nThe bill also provides for the expansion and development of national \nand local parent support programs and disability advocacy groups, so \nthat they can more effectively reach out to new parents. A national \nregistry of parents willing to adopt children with these disabilities \nwould also be established under this bill. Finally, this bill will help \ncreate awareness and education programs for health care providers who \ngive parents the results of these tests.\n  It is difficult, sometimes overwhelming, for new and expecting \nparents to receive the news that their new baby or their unborn child \nwill have a disability. I hope that this bill will provide these \nparents with the information and support they so desperately need \nduring this critical time. I hope this information will encourage \nparents that their child can live a meaningful and fulfilling life and \nthat this bill will heighten society's awareness of the capabilities \nvalue and worth of people with disabilities.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and all other \nmembers of the HELP Committee who have worked so diligently with my \noffice to get this important legislation past the HELP Committee. I am \nhopeful that this bill will soon receive consideration by the full \nSenate. The quicker my colleagues and I move to pass this bill, the \nmore people we can help with these critical services and information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1267-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1267-S1268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              GREEN CHEMISTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to join my friend Senator \nSnowe and our colleagues Senator Pryor, Senator Collins, and Senator \nKerry in introducing the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act. \nThis legislation is a bipartisan effort to promote the efforts of some \nof the most brilliant minds in academia, government, and industry to \nboth reduce the environmental impacts of common chemical processes and \nto foster the development of a new generation of environmentally \nresponsible chemical products.\n  My fellow cosponsors and I seek to help the chemical industry reduce \nits use and production of hazardous substances and the overall effect \non the environment of the business of chemistry. As it was in the past \nwhen Senator Snowe and I previously introduced legislation to promote \n``Green Chemistry,'' this legislation is supported by the chemical, \npharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries and academic institutions \nbecause it is designed to hasten the attainment of a goal we all share: \nmaking the production of the chemical products we need in ways not \ndetrimental to the environment using engineering processes that save \nboth money and the planet. The products and engineering processes we \nbelieve will be developed will produce benefits across the entire \neconomy.\n  What we call ``green chemistry'' is nothing more than what every \nindustry in the United States should strive to be. Chemical companies \nemploying green chemistry techniques will challenge their best \nscientists, engineers, and product developers to make new products that \nare better suited to the task for which they are created than the \nproducts they will replace using state-of-the-art manufacturing that \nminimizes or completely eliminates both the use of environmentally \nunsustainable substances as inputs or results in environmentally \nunsustainable substances as byproducts. Our purpose in introducing this \nlegislation is to make certain that the nascent green technology \nrevolution does not bypass the chemical industry by providing \nsignificant and ongoing support for green chemistry research, \ndevelopment, demonstration, education, and technology transfer.\n  When enacted, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act will \ncreate a Federal Interagency Working Group--made up of representatives \nfrom the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, the Department of Energy, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency--to fund and oversee research through \nmerit-based grants to universities, industry, and nonprofit \norganizations to promote the development and adoption of green \nchemistry processes and products. Further, the Interagency Working \nGroup will help expand education, training in, and the flow of \ninformation about sustainable chemical engineering, including \ndevelopment of green chemistry curricula for undergraduate and graduate \nstudents. Finally, Federal resources in funding and technical expertise \nwill seek to identify barriers to the commercialization of the products \nof a rejuvenated, more environmentally responsible domestic chemical \nindustry.\n  These are challenging times for the domestic chemical industry. High\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\nprices for necessary feedstocks and transportation to customers, along \nwith all the other hurdles that must be overcome in the global economy, \nhave put this industry, which began here and which supplied vital \nproducts to customers the world over, at risk of being another industry \nthe United States could lose to our foreign trading competitors. \nHowever, this industry meets challenges every day. This legislation \nwill allow American chemical companies to once again demonstrate a \npassion for excellence, safety, and innovation that will be a source of \nenvy around the world and create a generation's worth of good-paying \njobs that States like West Virginia can build an economy around.\n  Mr. President, I call on my colleagues to take up and pass the Green \nChemistry Research and Development Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1268-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n      Special Warfare Operator Chief Petty Officer Nathan H. Hardy\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a heartfelt tribute to \nspecial warfare operator CPO, SEAL, Nathan H. Hardy of Durham, NH. \nSadly on February 4, 2008 while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nthis brave 29-year old patriot gave his life for his team and for our \nNation during combat operations in Iraq. Chief Hardy was a member of \nNaval Special Warfare Tactical Development and Evaluation Squadron \nTHREE, Dam Neck, VA, and was serving our country in his fourth \ndeployment to Iraq.\n  Nathan, or Nate to family and friends, was a 1997 graduate of Oyster \nRiver High School, Durham, NH, where he excelled in soccer and \nlacrosse. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy on November 4, 1997, received \nbasic training in Great Lakes, IL, Undersea Demolition/SEAL training in \nCoronado, CA, and attended the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, \nCA. During his Navy career he served entirely with east coast-based \nSEAL teams.\n  Friends say from his youth Nate dreamed of becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL, \none of the most challenging, rigorous, and elite fighting organizations \nin the history of the world. He applied his fierce competitiveness and \nteam spirit to achieve success and served our Nation with deep pride \nand great courage. He loved what he did, and that was obvious.\n  The awards and decorations Nate received serve as testimony to his \nstrong character and extraordinary performance. They include two Bronze \nStar Medals, Purple Heart, two Navy Marine Corps Achievement Medals, \nCombat Action Ribbon--approval pending--three Good Conduct Medals, two \nNational Defense Service Medals, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Kosovo Campaign Medal, \nGlobal War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, three Sea Service Deployment Medals, NATO Medal, Expert \nRifle Medal and the Sharpshooter Pistol Medal.\n  During our country's difficult Revolutionary War, Thomas Paine wrote \n``These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the \nsunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their \ncountry; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man \nand woman.'' In these turbulent times Chief Hardy stood with the \ncountry he loved, served it with distinction and valor, and earned and \ndeserves our love and thanks. Because of his efforts, the liberty of \nthis country is made more secure.\n  My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Nate's wife Mindi, \nson Parker, parents Steve and Donna, brother Ben, and to his other \nfamily members and many friends who have suffered this most grievous \nloss. All will sorely miss Nate Hardy--devoted husband, caring father, \ndedicated son, loyal brother, good friend, outstanding SEAL. Laid to \nrest at Arlington National Cemetery, Chief Hardy joins his fellow \nheroes in eternal peace at our military's most sacred place. His \nsacrifice will live on forever among the many dedicated heroes this \nNation has sent abroad to defend freedom. In the words of another son \nof New Hampshire, Daniel Webster--may his remembrance be as longlasting \nas the land he honored. God bless Nathan Hardy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1268-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JANEZ DRNOVSEK\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to pay tribute to \na good friend, Janez Drnovsek, who passed away on Saturday. Dr. \nDrnovsek served as the second Prime Minister of Slovenia from 1992 to \n2002, and as President from 2002 to 2007. In these and other \ncapacities, he played a truly historic role in giving birth to a free \nand independent Slovenia, while avoiding the bloodshed and warfare that \nengulfed other nations as they seceded from the former Yugoslavia.\n  Dr. Drnovsek was born on May 17, 1950, in Celje. He graduated from \nthe University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Economics. In 1986, he \nfinished his doctoral studies in economic science at the University of \nMaribor. In 1994, he received an honorary doctorate from Boston \nUniversity. In 2004 he was named Protector and Honorary Senator of the \nEuropean Academy of Sciences and Arts in Salzburg.\n  But Dr. Drnovsek will be best remembered as a statesman of enormous \nability, vision, and courage. A brilliant economist, he unleashed the \nentrepreneurial spirit of the Slovenian people and played a historic \nrole in establishing his new nation as a robust democracy with one of \nthe most successful economies in Central and Eastern Europe. Today, \nthanks in large measure to Dr. Drnovsek's leadership, Slovenia is a \nfull member of the European Union and NATO, and a force for stability \nand democratic reform across the Balkans.\n  The world looks at Slovenia's success in the nearly 17 years since \nshe declared independence, and it wonders: How could a nation of just 2 \nmillion people accomplish so much in so short period of time? As an \nAmerican, I know the answer. Bear in mind that, when Jefferson wrote \nthe Declaration of Independence, America was also a nation of just 2 \nmillion people. Like Slovenians in 1991, Americans in 1776 dared to \nbreak away from a much larger and more powerful mother country. Like \nSlovenians, Americans demanded a democratic course for their new \ncountry.\n  But the most important parallel between our two countries is this: \nHistorians of the American Revolution have marveled that a tiny nation \nof just 2 million people was blessed with such an extraordinary \ncollection of thinkers and leaders, including Washington, Jefferson, \nand Franklin. At this crucial crossroads in Slovenia's history, it, \ntoo, has been blessed with extraordinary leaders. And Dr. Drnovsek will \nbe remembered as one of the most talented of these Founding Fathers.\n  On a personal note, I was very fortunate to spend time with President \nDrnovsek during my trip to Slovenia in August 2005. Clearly, he was an \nindependent thinker and a free spirit. One obituary in the Washington \nPost on Sunday noted that in his youth and early adulthood, he was a \nmember of the Communist Party, which was the only political force in \nthe former Yugoslavia. But he was never a Communist at heart, and he \nmade a point of going off to ski whenever the party held a congress.\n  Mr. President, with the passing of Dr. Janez Drnovsek, the world has \nlost an important leader and a wonderfully decent human being. He was \ninstrumental in founding and nurturing a free, democratic, successful \nSlovenia. History will not forget him, nor will the citizens of his \ngrateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1268-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1268-S1269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO J. SHANE CREAMER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to express my \nthanks to Shane Creamer, on his extraordinary volunteer service to the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania as the State president for the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, the AARP. I also express deep regret \nthat Mr. Creamer will no longer serve on the Executive Council as the \nPennsylvania State president for the AARP as he will be stepping down \nFebruary 22, 2008. He currently holds the highest volunteer position \nwithin the AARP and has since 2002.\n  In 1951, Shane Creamer graduated from Villanova University and in \n1953 graduated from Temple University School of Law. During his time at \neach institution he served as student body president. Immediately after \nearning\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nhis law degree, Shane spent 2 years in the U.S. Army assigned to the \nStaff Judge Advocate. Before entering private practice, Creamer spent \n11 years with the U.S. Justice Department in Philadelphia, including 8 \nyears as the first assistant U.S. attorney and in 1968 served as the \nfirst director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission. In 1968 he \npublished the first edition of his first book ``The Law of Arrest, \nSearch and Seizure,'' which was used as a training manual for the U.S. \nSecret Service for a number of years in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1971, \nhe published his second book, ``A Citizens Guide to Legal Rights.''\n  From 1971 to 1973 Shane served as the attorney general of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, which was followed by a successful career \nas a trial lawyer specializing in civil and criminal cases with the law \nfirms Carroll, Creamer and Duffy; Sprague, Creamer and Sprague; \nMontgomery McCracken; and Dilworth, Paxson, LLP. In 1980 he returned to \nVillanova University as a professor at the law school for 5 years. \nShane has also served as chairman of the board of trustees of the \nPhiladelphia Prison System and as a member of the board of Goodwill \nIndustries. He continues his dedication to service as a member of both \nthe board of the Pennsylvania Prison Society and Joint State Government \nCommission's Advisory Committee on Wrongful Convictions.\n  As president of AARP Pennsylvania, Shane championed the interests of \nPennsylvania's 1,905,000 seniors. Older Pennsylvanians have certainly \nbenefited from Shane's passion and tireless dedication. During his \ntenure, AARP fought for Medicare Part D drug coverage and won approval \nof a new State law that ends discrimination against older workers \nreceiving Social Security. The AARP has recently helped strengthen the \nPharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly, PACE, and the PACE \nNeeds Enhancement Tier in Pennsylvania, expanded the property tax and \nrent rebate program, and improved the State's long-term care system.\n  Shane Creamer is an outstanding advocate in the fight to protect the \ninterests of older Pennsylvanians and truly a great supporter for the \nelderly. He will be missed in his capacity as Pennsylvania's AARP \npresident as he goes forward in his future endeavors. I congratulate \nhim on a brilliant tenure and applaud Shane's outstanding service to \nthe people of Pennsylvania. I wish him, his wife Mary-Ellen, and all \nhis family the very best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1269-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ALLEN SHARP\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a remarkable \nHoosier, Judge Allen Sharp, as he assumes Senior Status after 34 years \nas a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nIndiana. As he enters this next phase of his career, I know that Judge \nSharp will continue to serve the people of our State and Nation.\n  Upon graduating from the Indiana University School of Law in 1957, \nJudge Sharp entered private practice in Williamsport, IN, successfully \narguing Hopkins v. Cohen before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968. In 1969 \nSharp became a Judge of the Appellate Court of Indiana, serving the \npeople of Indiana in that capacity until he was confirmed as a U.S. \nDistrict Judge in 1973.\n  Over the course of nearly three and a half decades on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Indiana, including 15 years \nas chief judge, Judge Sharp has served with distinction. In the \nperformance of his duties, he has presided over civil and criminal jury \ntrials in four different U.S. District Courts and sat by special \ndesignation on four U.S. Appeals Courts.\n  In addition to his exemplary service to our Nation as a member of the \nFederal judiciary, Judge Sharp also served with the U.S. Air Force \nReserve, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n  Outside of the courtroom, Judge Sharp has also distinguished himself \nas a scholar, teaching at Butler University, Indiana University South \nBend, and Milligan College. He has also authored both books and \nscholarly articles, several of which focus on historical aspects of the \nlaw and government.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues in congratulating Judge Sharp \nand his family as we celebrate his remarkable service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1269-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING LIVING NUTZ\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize a small business \nfrom my home State of Maine that has revolutionized the health snack \nfood market. Living Nutz, a company that sells all-natural, organic \nnuts and seeds in a variety of delicious flavors, provides its \ncustomers with delicious treats that are exceedingly nutritious without \nsacrificing an ounce of taste.\n  Seth Leaf Pruzansky and Davy Pruzansky, brothers who founded Living \nNutz in 2002 in the basement of their house in Bowdoinham, ME, \nrepresent the hard work and passionate drive that go into small \nbusinesses in Maine and across the Nation. It takes Living Nutz's core \ngroup of seven employees about a week to clean, season, and prepare \nnuts for distribution to retail stores throughout the United States and \nCanada, as well as for sales through Living Nutz's website. From \nalmonds to walnuts and raisins to pumpkin seeds, Living Nutz offers 19 \nvarieties, including sweet ones like Banana Bread and Cina-Pecan-Bun, \nand spicy ones like Lemon Tahini Twist and Spicy Onion Garlic. The \ncompany is also certified by the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners \nAssociation, ensuring both the quality and authenticity of its snacks.\n  Living Nutz employs a time-intensive process to produce several \nthousand pounds of nuts each week. First, the nuts are soaked overnight \nin water. Then, the next morning, employees place the nuts in large \nbowls and add all-natural flavoring. The nuts are finally placed into \ndehydrators for 5 days before being packaged and shipped. The Pruzansky \nbrothers believe that the soaking method delivers a more desirous \nproduct, and one that is easier to digest. They say that these ``living \nnuts'' are significantly richer in enzymes and nutrients than nuts that \nare cooked. In the end, this lengthy procedure yields healthy and \ntaste-filled nuts, as well as repeat customers and devoted fans of the \ncompany.\n  Living Nutz recently played a cameo role in the 2008 Screen Actors \nGuild awards, as the Guild selected the company to contribute 1,500 \nbags of its mixed nuts for the actors' and attendees' gift bags. What \nmakes this occasion so unique is that the Screen Actors Guild actually \napproached the Pruzansky brothers with the opportunity, instead of vice \nversa. As a result of this exposure, the brothers hope to take on new \ncustomers and even celebrity clientele, and are seeking to expand by \nadding new facilities, equipment, and employees.\n  The Pruzansky brothers and Living Nutz are symbols of Maine's great \nsmall business achievements.

A bill to provide incentives to physicians to practice in \nrural and medically underserved communities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Conrad State 30 \nImprovement Act to extend and expand this program's success in bringing \ndoctors to communities that would otherwise not have access to health \ncare services.\n  The Conrad State 30 program, which I helped create in 1994, has \nbrought thousands of physicians to underserved communities in all 50 \nstates, across our great country. These doctors are foreign born, but \nhave all received training in the United States. Under the Conrad 30 \nprogram, foreign doctors already in the country for medical training \nare granted a waiver from a visa requirement to return to their home \ncountry for 2 years. In exchange for this waiver, the doctors must \ncommit to providing health care to underserved populations in the \nUnited States for 3 years.\n  By 2020, some projections show that the United States may have \n200,000 fewer doctors than it needs; that is a staggering statistic, \nand one that cannot be taken lightly. If this shortfall is allowed to \nmaterialize, rural areas, like my State of North Dakota, will \nundoubtedly be among the hardest hit.\n  Given the looming deficit of doctors and an increasingly competitive \nglobal marketplace, it is vital that we maintain the incentives for \nqualified foreign physicians to serve patients in this country. The \nimmigration benefits historically provided by the Conrad program, and \nenhanced in this bill, provide crucial incentives to foreign doctors. \nAnd when they do come to our country, it is vital that we make sure \nthat they end up in the places that need them most.\n  This bill makes the Conrad 30 program permanent, something that I \nbelieve is long overdue. It also invites a new group of foreign doctors \nto take part in the program, a change that could dramatically expand \nthe pool of doctors practicing in rural and underserved areas. Further, \nthe bill creates a mechanism by which the current cap of 30 doctors per \nstate can significantly expand, while protecting the interests of those \nstates that have had difficulty recruiting doctors under the program. \nThe bill also creates an important new incentive for doctors to \nparticipate in the program by granting them a green card cap exemption \nwhen they have completed their service. Finally, the bill gives \nincreased flexibility to State health authorities to determine the \nneeds of their State in utilizing Conrad waivers.\n  I strongly believe the Conrad State 30 Improvement Act can be of \ngreat benefit to every state in the country and help combat the growing \nshortage of\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\nhealth care providers in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1273-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 462--DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL 2008 AS \n                  ``NATIONAL ASBESTOS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Tester, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 462\n\n       Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot \n     be smelled or tasted;\n       Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbestos fibers can \n     cause significant damage;\n       Whereas these fibers can cause mesothelioma, asbestosis, \n     and other health problems;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases can take 10 to 50 years \n     to present themselves;\n       Whereas the expected survival time for those diagnosed with \n     mesothelioma is between 6 and 24 months;\n       Whereas generally little is known about late stage \n     treatment and there is no cure for asbestos-related diseases;\n       Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases may \n     give some patients increased treatment options and might \n     improve their prognosis;\n       Whereas the United States has substantially reduced its \n     consumption of asbestos yet continues to consume almost 2,000 \n     metric tons of the fibrous mineral for use in certain \n     products throughout the Nation;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases have killed thousands of \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas asbestos exposures continue and safety and \n     prevention will reduce and has reduced significantly asbestos \n     exposure and asbestos-related diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos has been a cause of occupational cancer;\n       Whereas thousands of workers in the United States face \n     significant asbestos exposure;\n       Whereas thousands of people in the United States die from \n     asbestos-related diseases every year;\n       Whereas a significant percentage of all asbestos-related \n     disease victims were exposed to asbestos on naval ships and \n     in shipyards;\n       Whereas asbestos was used in the construction of a \n     significant number of office buildings and public facilities \n     built before 1975;\n       Whereas people in the small community of Libby, Montana \n     have asbestos-related diseases at a significantly higher rate \n     than the national average and suffer from mesothelioma at a \n     significantly higher rate than the national average; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``National Asbestos \n     Awareness Week'' would raise public awareness about the \n     prevalence of asbestos-related diseases and the dangers of \n     asbestos exposure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the first week of April 2008 as ``National \n     Asbestos Awareness Week'';\n       (2) urges the Surgeon General, as a public health issue, to \n     warn and educate people that asbestos exposure may be \n     hazardous to their health; and\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Surgeon General.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an important \nresolution I am submitting. It is the asbestos awareness week \nresolution. This resolution has passed the Senate for 3 years, and I am \npleased to submit it again this year.\n  This is a very deeply personal issue for me. About 8 years ago, I was \nin Libby, MT, in the living room of Les Skramstad, and there were \nseveral people in the room who were suffering from asbestos-related \ndiseases. This was in Libby. Since then, about 200 people have died of \nasbestos-related diseases.\n  Les Skramstad, whom I met that day about 8 or 9 years ago, was dying \nfrom mesothelioma. He looked at me and said: As a U.S. Senator, I \nexpect you do something to help us in Libby.\n  I said: You bet.\n  He looked me straight in the eye, and because he has been around a \nlittle bit, he said: Senator, I am going to be watching you to make \nsure that is not just an idle promise. I will be watching you.\n  Boy, I got the message loudly and clearly. I decided right then at \nthat moment that I need to do all I can to help make sure that people \nin Libby, MT, get justice. As I said, over 200 people died since then.\n  He was an employee of a W.R. Grace mine. W.R. Grace clearly knew it \nwas poisoning people in Libby, MT, in its mine there. It did not admit \nit. There is a criminal case going on right now against the officers of \nW.R. Grace claiming that they did know what they were doing.\n  Asbestos from this mine is called tremolite. It is not the ordinary \ncrystal asbestos. This is tremolite asbestos, which is much more \npernicious. It gets more deeply embedded in your lungs, more angles to \nthe dust that gets into your lungs. It is harder to detect. Sometimes \nthe latency period can be from 20 to 30 years.\n  Les would come home all dusty from the mine, and he would go home and \nembrace his wife, and his kids would jump into his lap. Guess what. Les \nis now dead. He died last month from mesothelioma. Les's wife is dying \nfrom asbestos-related diseases. Three of his four children are now \ndying.\n  It is the dust, the asbestos dust that is in Libby, MT. This stuff \nwas used on playgrounds. It was used on golf courses. It was used for \ninsulation in attics in homes. People have died and are dying. We are \ndoing all we can to address this, and we are trying to get them proper \nmedical care.\n  There is a clinic called the CARD Clinic in Libby which is doing a \nreally good job in screening people, trying to find out who has it and \nwho doesn't. Again, it is very hard to find. You need special \ntechniques. We had to change the disability laws in America because--\nnot change but point out to the Social Security Administration that \nthis is a different kind of asbestos, it is not ordinary asbestos, and \nthen decide whether to grant disability payments. They were looking at \nordinary asbestos. They didn't know about this asbestos. They didn't \nknow about tremolite asbestos. Finally, people in Montana are getting \ndisability benefits because of the asbestos diseases they have.\n  So I am very proud to submit this resolution. As I said, I have been \ndoing this for several years, and we are making this National Asbestos \nRecognition Week in April, the first week in April. I believe it is so \nimportant to highlight this dread disease so we can stamp out the \nscourge and, in my view, finally banish asbestos. If we can accomplish \nthat, then in some small way we have vindicated the people of Libby, \nMT.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1273-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES OF UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited the \n     land of the present-day United States since time immemorial \n     and for thousands of years before the arrival of people of \n     European descent;\n       (2) for millennia, Native Peoples have honored, protected, \n     and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       (3) Native Peoples are spiritual people with a deep and \n     abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia Native \n     Peoples have maintained a powerful spiritual connection to \n     this land, as evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       (4) the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new \n     chapter in the history of Native Peoples;\n       (5) while establishment of permanent European settlements \n     in North America did stir conflict with nearby Indian tribes, \n     peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took \n     place;\n       (6) the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of Native Peoples in \n     the vicinities of the settlements;\n       (7) in the infancy of the United States, the founders of \n     the Republic expressed their desire for a just relationship \n     with the Indian tribes, as evidenced by the Northwest \n     Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins with the \n     phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed \n     toward the Indians'';\n       (8) Indian tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened and grew, including \n     invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on \n     their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific \n     Coast;\n       (9) Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts in which unfortunately, both took \n     innocent lives, including those of women and children;\n       (10) the Federal Government violated many of the treaties \n     ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements with \n     Indian tribes;\n       (11) the United States forced Indian tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. \n     411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal \n     Act'');\n       (12) many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (A) during the execution of the official Federal Government \n     policy of forced removal, including the infamous Trail of \n     Tears and Long Walk;\n       (B) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (C) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       (13) the Federal Government condemned the traditions, \n     beliefs, and customs of Native Peoples and endeavored to \n     assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of \n     land under the Act of February 8, 1887 (25 U.S.C. 331; 24 \n     Stat. 388, chapter 119) (commonly known as the ``General \n     Allotment Act''), and the forcible removal of Native children \n     from their families to faraway boarding schools where their \n     Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       (14) officials of the Federal Government and private United \n     States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the unlawful \n     acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft of tribal \n     resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       (15) the policies of the Federal Government toward Indian \n     tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian tribes have \n     contributed to the severe social ills and economic troubles \n     in many Native communities today;\n       (16) despite the wrongs committed against Native Peoples by \n     the United States, Native\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\n     Peoples have remained committed to the protection of this \n     great land, as evidenced by the fact that, on a per capita \n     basis, more Native Peoples have served in the United States \n     Armed Forces and placed themselves in harm's way in defense \n     of the United States in every major military conflict than \n     any other ethnic group;\n       (17) Indian tribes have actively influenced the public life \n     of the United States by continued cooperation with Congress \n     and the Department of the Interior, through the involvement \n     of Native individuals in official Federal Government \n     positions, and by leadership of their own sovereign Indian \n     tribes;\n       (18) Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       (19) the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       (20) Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       (b) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors Native Peoples for the thousands of \n     years that they have stewarded and protected this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (c) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/27/senate-section/article/S1317-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1317-S1319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TO AMEND THE FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 580, S. 2450.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2450) to amend the Federal Rules of Evidence to \n     address the waiver of the attorney-client privilege in the \n     work product doctrine.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I hope we pass a bipartisan bill that \nwill go a long way in reducing the costs of litigating disputes in our \ncivil justice system. This bill creates a new Federal Rule of Evidence \nregarding electronic disclosure of privileged material that would limit \nthe consequences of inadvertent disclosure. The new rule would provide \npredictability and uniformity in a discovery process that has been made \nincreasingly difficult with the growing use of e-mail and other \nelectronic media. This legislation contains the full text of Judicial \nConference recommendations and is supported by all sectors of the legal \ncommunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Judicial \nConference's Committee Note to illuminate the purpose of the new \nFederal Rule of Evidence and how it should be applied.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Explanatory Note on Evidence Rule 502\n\n       This new rule has two major purposes:\n       (1) It resolves some longstanding disputes in the courts \n     about the effect of certain disclosures of communications or \n     information protected by the attorney-client privilege or as \n     work product--specifically those disputes involving \n     inadvertent disclosure and subject matter waiver.\n       (2) It responds to the widespread complaint that litigation \n     costs necessary to protect against waiver of attorney-client \n     privilege or work product have become prohibitive due to the \n     concern that any disclosure (however innocent or minimal) \n     will operate as a subject matter waiver of all protected \n     communications or information. This concern is especially \n     troubling in cases involving electronic discovery. See, e.g., \n     Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232 F.R.D. 228, 244 (D.Md. 2005) \n     (electronic discovery may encompass ``millions of documents'' \n     and to insist upon ``record-by-record pre-production \n     privilege review, on pain of subject matter waiver, would \n     impose upon parties costs of production that bear no \n     proportionality to what is at stake in the litigation'').\n       The rule seeks to provide a predictable, uniform set of \n     standards under which parties can determine the consequences \n     of a disclosure of a communication or information covered by \n     the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection. \n     Parties to litigation need to know, for example, that if they \n     exchange privileged information pursuant to a confidentiality \n     order, the court's order will be enforceable. Moreover, if a \n     federal court's confidentiality order is not enforceable in a \n     state court then the burdensome costs of privilege review and \n     retention are unlikely to be reduced.\n       The rule makes no attempt to alter federal or state law on \n     whether a communication or information is protected under the \n     attorney-client privilege or work-product immunity as an \n     initial matter. Moreover, while establishing some exceptions \n     to waiver, the rule does not purport to supplant applicable \n     waiver doctrine generally.\n       The rule governs only certain waivers by disclosure. Other \n     common-law waiver doctrines may result in a finding of waiver \n     even where there is no disclosure of privileged information \n     or work product. See, e.g., Nguyen v. Excel Corp., 197 F.3d \n     200 (5th Cir. 1999) (reliance on an advice of counsel defense \n     waives the privilege with respect to attorney-client \n     communications pertinent to that defense); Ryers v. Burleson, \n     100 F.R.D. 436 (D.D.C. 1983) (allegation of lawyer \n     malpractice constituted a waiver of confidential \n     communications under the circumstances). The rule is not \n     intended to displace or modify federal common law concerning \n     waiver of privilege or work product where no disclosure has \n     been made.\n       Subdivision (a). The rule provides that a voluntary \n     disclosure in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or \n     agency, if a waiver, generally results in a waiver only of \n     the communication or information disclosed; a subject matter \n     waiver (of either privilege or work product) is reserved for \n     those unusual situations in which fairness requires a further \n     disclosure of related, protected information, in order to \n     prevent a selective and misleading presentation of evidence \n     to the disadvantage of the adversary. See, e.g., In re United \n     Mine Workers of America Employee Benefit Plans Litig., 159 \n     F.R.D. 307, 312 (D.D.C. 1994) (waiver of work product limited \n     to materials actually disclosed, because the party did not \n     deliberately disclose documents in an attempt to gain a \n     tactical advantage). Thus, subject matter waiver is limited \n     to situations in which a party intentionally puts protected \n     information into the litigation in a selective, misleading \n     and unfair manner. It follows that an inadvertent disclosure \n     of protected information can never result in a subject matter \n     waiver. See Rule 502(b). The rule rejects the result in In re \n     Sealed Case, 877 F.2d 976 (D.C.Cir. 1989), which held that \n     inadvertent disclosure of documents during discovery \n     automatically constituted a subject matter waiver.\n       The language concerning subject matter waiver--``ought in \n     fairness''--is taken from Rule 106, because the animating \n     principle is the same. Under both Rules, a party that makes a \n     selective, misleading presentation that is unfair to the \n     adversary opens itself to a more complete and accurate \n     presentation.\n       To assure protection and predictability, the rule provides \n     that if a disclosure is made at the federal level, the \n     federal rule on subject matter waiver governs subsequent \n     state court determinations on the scope of the waiver by that \n     disclosure.\n       Subdivision (b). Courts are in conflict over whether an \n     inadvertent disclosure of a communication or information \n     protected as privileged or work product constitutes a waiver. \n     A few courts find that a disclosure must be intentional to be \n     a waiver. Most courts find a waiver only if the disclosing \n     party acted carelessly in disclosing the communication or \n     information and failed to request its return in a timely \n     manner. And a few courts hold that any inadvertent disclosure \n     of a communication or information protected under the \n     attorney-client privilege or as work product constitutes a \n     waiver without regard to the protections taken to avoid such \n     a disclosure. See generally Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232 \n     F.R.D. 228 (D.Md. 2005), for a discussion of this case law.\n       The rule opts for the middle ground: inadvertent disclosure \n     of protected communications or information in connection with \n     a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency does \n     not constitute a waiver if the holder took reasonable steps \n     to prevent disclosure and also promptly took reasonable steps \n     to rectify the error. This position is in accord with the \n     majority view on whether inadvertent disclosure is a waiver.\n       Cases such as Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss \n     & Co., 104 F.R.D. 103, 105\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1275, February 27, 2008, the Record shows the printing \nof S. 1200.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to show the printing of S. \n1200, as amended.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1985) and Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Garvey, 109 F.R.D. 323, \n332 (N.D.Cal. 1985), set out a multi-factor test for determining \nwhether inadvertent disclosure is a waiver. The stated factors (none of \nwhich is dispositive) are the reasonableness of precautions taken, the \n     time taken to rectify the error, the scope of discovery, \n     the extent of disclosure and the overriding issue of \n     fairness. The rule does not explicitly codify that test, \n     because it is really a set of non-determinative guidelines \n     that vary from case to case. The rule is flexible enough \n     to accommodate any of those listed factors. Other \n     considerations bearing on the reasonableness of a \n     producing party's efforts include the number of documents \n     to be reviewed and the time constraints for production. \n     Depending on the circumstances, a party that uses advanced \n     analytical software applications and linguistic tools in \n     screening for privilege and work product may be found to \n     have taken ``reasonable steps'' to prevent inadvertent \n     disclosure. The implementation of an efficient system of \n     records management before litigation may also be relevant.\n       The rule does not require the producing party to engage in \n     a post-production review to determine whether any protected \n     communication or information has been produced by mistake. \n     But the rule does require the producing party to follow up on \n     any obvious indications that a protected communication or \n     information has been produced inadvertently.\n       The rule applies to inadvertent disclosures made to a \n     federal office or agency, including but not limited to an \n     office or agency that is acting in the course of its \n     regulatory, investigative or enforcement authority. The \n     consequences of waiver, and the concomitant costs of pre-\n     production privilege review, can be as great with respect to \n     disclosures to offices and agencies as they are in \n     litigation.\n       Subdivision (c). Difficult questions can arise when 1) a \n     disclosure of a communication or information protected by the \n     attorney-client privilege or as work product is made in a \n     state proceeding, 2) the communication or information is \n     offered in a subsequent federal proceeding on the ground that \n     the disclosure waived the privilege or protection, and 3) the \n     state and federal laws are in conflict on the question of \n     waiver. The Committee determined that the proper solution for \n     the federal court is to apply the law that is most protective \n     of privilege and work product. If the state law is more \n     protective (such as where the state law is that an \n     inadvertent disclosure can never be a waiver), the holder of \n     the privilege or protection may well have relied on that law \n     when making the disclosure in the state proceeding. Moreover, \n     applying a more restrictive federal law of waiver could \n     impair the state objective of preserving the privilege or \n     work-product protection for disclosures made in state \n     proceedings. On the other hand, if the federal law is more \n     protective, applying the state law of waiver to determine \n     admissibility in federal court is likely to undermine the \n     federal objective of limiting the costs of production.\n       The rule does not address the enforceability of a state \n     court confidentiality order in a federal proceeding, as that \n     question is covered both by statutory law and principles of \n     federalism and comity. See 28 U.S.C. 1738 (providing that \n     state judicial proceedings ``shall have the same full faith \n     and credit in every court within the United States . . . as \n     they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . \n     from which they are taken''). See also Tucker v. Ohtsu Tire & \n     Rubber Co., 191 F.R.D. 495, 499 (D.Md. 2000) (noting that a \n     federal court considering the enforceability of a state \n     confidentiality order is ``constrained by principles of \n     comity, courtesy, and . . . federalism''). Thus, a state \n     court order finding no waiver in connection with a \n     disclosure made in a state court proceeding is enforceable \n     under existing law in subsequent federal proceedings.\n       Subdivision (d). Confidentiality orders are becoming \n     increasingly important in limiting the costs of privilege \n     review and retention, especially in cases involving \n     electronic discovery. But the utility of a confidentiality \n     order in reducing discovery costs is substantially diminished \n     if it provides no protection outside the particular \n     litigation in which the order is entered. Parties are \n     unlikely to be able to reduce the costs of pre-production \n     review for privilege and work product if the consequence of \n     disclosure is that the communications or information could be \n     used by non-parties to the litigation.\n       There is some dispute on whether a confidentiality order \n     entered in one case is enforceable in other proceedings. See \n     generally Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232 F.R.D. 228 (D.Md. \n     2005), for a discussion of this case law. The rule provides \n     that when a confidentiality order governing the consequences \n     of disclosure in that case is entered in a federal \n     proceeding, its terms are enforceable against non-parties in \n     any federal or state proceeding. For example, the court order \n     may provide for return of documents without waiver \n     irrespective of the care taken by the disclosing party; the \n     rule contemplates enforcement of ``claw-back'' and ``quick \n     peek'' arrangements as a way to avoid the excessive costs of \n     pre-production review for privilege and work product. See \n     Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 216 F.R.D. 280, 290 (S.D.N.Y. \n     2003) (noting that parties may enter into ``so-called `claw-\n     back' agreements that allow the parties to forego privilege \n     review altogether in favor of an agreement to return \n     inadvertently produced privilege documents''). The rule \n     provides a party with a predictable protection from a court \n     order--predictability that is needed to allow the party to \n     plan in advance to limit the prohibitive costs of privilege \n     and work product review and retention.\n       Under the rule, a confidentiality order is enforceable \n     whether or not it memorializes an agreement among the parties \n     to the litigation. Party agreement should not be a condition \n     of enforceability of a federal court's order.\n       Under subdivision (d), a federal court may order that \n     disclosure of privileged or protected information ``in \n     connection with'' a federal proceeding does not result in \n     waiver. But subdivision (d) does not allow the federal court \n     to enter an order determining the waiver effects of a \n     separate disclosure of the same information in other \n     proceedings, state or federal. If a disclosure has been made \n     in a state proceeding (and is not the subject of a state-\n     court order on waiver), then subdivision (d) is inapplicable. \n     Subdivision (c) would govern the federal court's \n     determination whether the state-court disclosure waived the \n     privilege or protection in the federal proceeding.\n       Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) codifies the well-\n     established proposition that parties can enter an agreement \n     to limit the effect of waiver by disclosure between or among \n     them. Of course such an agreement can bind only the parties \n     to the agreement. The rule makes clear that if parties want \n     protection against non-parties from a finding of waiver by \n     disclosure, the agreement must be made part of a court order.\n       Subdivision (f). The protections against waiver provided by \n     Rule 502 must be applicable when protected communications or \n     information disclosed in federal proceedings are subsequently \n     offered in state proceedings. Otherwise the holders of \n     protected communications and information, and their lawyers, \n     could not rely on the protections provided by the Rule, and \n     the goal of limiting costs in discovery would be \n     substantially undermined. Rule 502(f) is intended to resolve \n     any potential tension between the provisions of Rule 502 that \n     apply to state proceedings and the possible limitations on \n     the applicability of the Federal Rules of Evidence otherwise \n     provided by Rules 101 and 1101.\n       The rule is intended to apply in all federal court \n     proceedings, including court-annexed and court-ordered \n     arbitrations, without regard to any possible limitations of \n     Rules 101 and 1101. This provision is not intended to raise \n     an inference about the applicability of any other rule of \n     evidence in arbitration proceedings more generally.\n       The costs of discovery can be equally high for state and \n     federal causes of action, and the rule seeks to limit those \n     costs in all federal proceedings, regardless of whether the \n     claim arises under state or federal law. Accordingly, the \n     rule applies to state law causes of action brought in federal \n     court.\n       Subdivision (g). The rule's coverage is limited to \n     attorney-client privilege and work product. The operation of \n     waiver by disclosure, as applied to other evidentiary \n     privileges, remains a question of federal common law. Nor \n     does the rule purport to apply to the Fifth Amendment \n     privilege against compelled self-incrimination.\n       The definition of work product ``materials'' is intended to \n     include both tangible and intangible information. See In re \n     Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., 343 F.3d 658, 662 (3d Cir. 2003) \n     (``work product protection extends to both tangible and \n     intangible work product'').\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Specter for joining me in \nintroducing this bill last December, as the first session of this \nCongress drew to a close. The Judiciary Committee took up and \nunanimously approved the bill during our first business meeting after \nreturning from the holiday recess. I urge all Senators to join Senator \nSpecter and me to pass this proposal and take a positive step toward \nmodernizing and improving the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  Mr. SALAZAR.
