Mr. President, today the national average for a gallon \nof regular unleaded gasoline hit another all-time high of $4.06. For \ntruckers it's even worse, with the average cost of diesel now at $4.79 \na gallon.\n  Every American is suffering the effects of high gas prices. But low- \nand middle-income families are hurting the most. Many now spend a \nsignificant portion of their income just getting to and from work. A \ngood number of people in eastern Kentucky are spending 15 percent of \ntheir income just on gas.\n  Some people are taking second jobs just to cover the cost of getting \nto and from their primary jobs.\n  Prices are so high Democrats are starting to talk about gas prices \nbeing a serious problem. A number of them spoke yesterday about the \neffect that gas prices have on the wider economy.\n  The junior Senator from Colorado told us about a farmer in Kit Carson \nCounty who is worried he won't be able to afford the diesel fuel he \nneeds to harvest his wheat crop at the end of the summer.\n  The junior Senator from Montana said manufacturers in his State are \nat risk of shutting down, that truckers are struggling to make ends \nmeet, and farmers are struggling to pay for fertilizer. The junior \nSenator from Minnesota said the people of her State are lining up \naround the block at the\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\nCostco in Minneapolis just to save some money.\n  Even the senior Senator from New York got in on the act, though \nmostly as an excuse to go after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. I am not \nsure how this was relevant to gas prices. Maybe he thought people would \nfeel better if they realized they'd be even worse off if we hadn't cut \ntheir taxes.\n  But to all our friends on the other side who have spoken about the \ncrushing effects of high gas prices, I would simply add that they are \nright on target. High gas prices do affect everything. High gas prices \ndo hurt. And I would also add this: Democrats in Congress have no plan \nto lower them.\n  In a month when gas prices have hit record highs, Democrats have \nproposed three things: a massive carbon tax, a tax on energy companies, \nand allowing trial lawyers to sue our trading partners. This isn't an \nenergy plan. It is a caricature. It is a caricature of a party that \nseems incapable of conceiving any solution to any problem that doesn't \ninvolve taxation or litigation.\n  With gas prices causing unprecedented pain at the pump for working \nAmericans, Democrats have responded by trying to raise taxes that we \nknow will be passed onto consumers. Ignoring the iron laws of supply \nand demand, they insist that high gas prices must be the result of some \ncorporate plot instead. But the current crisis is a supply and demand \nproblem--not a supply and demand and litigation problem, not a supply \nand demand and taxation problem, a supply and demand problem.\n  It is fairly straightforward: at the moment, there's greater demand \nthan supply. And last year, Republicans joined Democrats in addressing \ndemand by passing the first increase in national fuel efficiency \nstandards in more than 30 years. We have also tried to address the \nsupply problem by increasing production of American energy. At every \nturn, we have been blocked.\n  Since 1991, the Senate has voted a dozen times on allowing limited \nexploration in a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nA Democrat President has vetoed it or Democrats have blocked it every \nsingle time. When he did it, incidentally, gas at the pump was $1.06 a \ngallon.\n  Last year, the Senate voted on proposals to expand refinery capacity, \ninvest in coal-to-liquid technology, and open up more domestic \nreserves. Democrats blocked each one.\n  Last year, Republicans proposed allowing Virginia to go forward with \ndeep sea exploration off its coast--something that Virginia, under a \nDemocratic Governor, wants. Democrats in Congress said no.\n  Republicans have tried to allow the use of oil shale from Western \nStates as an alternative to foreign oil. Democrats imposed an oil-shale \nban in last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  Last month, Republicans tried to increase production of American \nenergy again, along with an increase in support for clean energy \ntechnology and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Democrats said no.\n  And just last week, I offered an amendment to ensure that if the \nBoxer climate tax bill caused gas prices to go up, we would suspend its \nprovisions. Democrats blocked that too.\n  For years, Democrats have blocked every effort to increase the \nproduction of American energy and help bring gas prices down. They have \nsaid no to States that want to allow for deep sea exploration off their \nshores. They have blocked the use of oil shale. They have blocked a \ndozen efforts to open a small portion of ANWR for environmentally \nsensitive exploration, which--if it had not been vetoed 13 years ago--\nwould be providing a million barrels of oil a day to American consumers \nright now.\n  That's twice as much as the senior Senator from New York wants us to \nbeg from the Saudis. And now, they want to raise gas prices even more \nthrough higher taxes.\n  It should be abundantly clear by now to anyone who is paying \nattention that our friends on the other side have no serious plan for \nlowering gas prices. As the record suggests, their primary concern is \nblocking increased production, which has inexorably led to record gas \nprices.\n  If people are being forced to change their lifestyles, if the price \nof goods is skyrocketing, that is apparently all right, according to \nour friends on the other side. Their Presidential nominee even admits \nit. He says the high price of gas isn't the problem. The problem, he \nsays, is that prices went up too quickly. If he had his way, he would \nhave raised prices much more slowly.\n  He would have preferred that gas prices go up more slowly than the $1 \nincrease we have seen under the new Democrat Congress over the last \nyear.\n  He would have preferred they go up more slowly than the astonishing \n$1.73 increase per gallon of gasoline we have seen just in the 17 \nmonths since Democrats took over Congress in January 2007.\n  As the Democrat nominee put it in an interview earlier this week, he \nwould have preferred a ``gradual readjustment'' in gas prices, \npresumably so Americans wouldn't notice the shock of it.\n  We used to think $4 a gallon gasoline was unthinkable. Our friends on \nthe other side were apparently thinking about it all along. ``I think I \nwould have preferred a gradual readjustment.''\n  Those are the words of their nominee.\n  While Americans are reeling over high gas prices, increasingly \ndemanding that we increase our production of American energy, Democrats \nhaven't let us turn over a single shovel for exploration here at home. \nAnd now they have got what they wanted.\n  We all agree that the key to our energy future is clean energy \ntechnologies and alternative fuels that move us away from oil. What the \nother side refuses to acknowledge is that it will take some time to get \nthere. We are moving in that direction as quickly as we can. We have \nworked in a bipartisan fashion in both the 2005 and 2007 energy bills \nto accelerate the process of moving to clean energy technologies and \nalternative sources of fuel.\n  But the facts are clear: in the short term, America will depend on \nfossil fuels to drive our economy. For the foreseeable future, our \nchoice is the same as it's always been: either import our energy from \npeople like Hugo Chavez and from Saudi Arabia or use more of our own. \nBut our friends on the other side have removed the option of increased \nAmerican energy created by increasing American jobs. They have made \nsure we have only one option. They have put domestic energy off limits. \nAnd now we're paying the price.\n  Republicans have been willing to work with Democrats to address both \nsides of this problem. Republicans enthusiastically support \nconservation.\n  Last year, we supported the first increase in automobile efficiency \nstandards in more than three decades. We have supported investments in \nalternative energy. We know this problem requires action on both the \nsupply and the demand side. And we have shown it. But we're still \nwaiting for our friends on the other side to show the same commitment \nto actually address the problem.\n  For the sake of all the American people, who will today make hard \nchoices at the gas pump, we need to work together to lower prices now, \nand that means that as the third largest oil producer in the world, \nAmerica needs to increase its own domestic supplies in an \nenvironmentally responsible way so we are less reliant on Middle East \noil and so our people finally get some relief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5536-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5536-S5537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              21ST ANNIVERSARY OF ``TEAR DOWN THIS WALL''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today is the anniversary of an \nimportant event in recent world history that demonstrates the impact \nthat words--well-chosen words--can have.\n  June 12, 1987, marks the day that President Ronald Reagan issued a \nchallenge to Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev to make unmistakably \nclear his commitment to lessening Cold War tensions and increasing \nfreedom in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.\n  Speaking before the Brandenburg Gate in what was then West Berlin, \nPresident Reagan stood only 100 yards away from the Berlin Wall, which \nhad divided the free people of West Berlin from the captive Germans in \nSoviet-controlled East Berlin for decades. An estimated 20,000 people \ngathered to hear him, including West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n  ``There is one sign the Soviets could make that would be \nunmistakable,\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\nthat would advance the cause of freedom and peace,'' President Reagan \nsaid.\n  Addressing the Soviet Premier directly, he then continued:\n\n       If you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet \n     Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberation: Come here \n     to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, \n     tear down this wall!\n\n  Two years later, Germans East and West did raze that wall, presaging \nGerman reunification and the fall of the Soviet Union. A piece of the \nBerlin Wall is preserved today in the Ronald Reagan Presidential \nLibrary in Simi Valley, CA.\n  At the time, the Soviet state-run press agency called this historic \nspeech ``openly provocative'' and ``war-mongering.'' But Chancellor \nKohl, who was there, knew the truth. ``Ronald Reagan was a man who \nachieved great things for his country,'' Chancellor Kohl said in 2004. \n``He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe.''\n  There we have an example of the power to make walls crumble, by the \nsound of freedom--all because of the right words, well chosen and \nlinked to the right policy.\n  We cannot say what national security crisis will confront us in the \nfuture, but we can say that confront us they will, no question about \nit. When that happens, the world must know that America will fight on \nthe side of justice and freedom.\n  One great leader made that clear 21 years ago today when he said four \nsimple words: ``Tear down this wall.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5537-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5537-S5539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the remarks my friend, the distinguished \nRepublican leader, made regarding the energy crisis facing us are, as \nhas been this past week, Orwellian. Everyone listening to what he said \nunderstands the direct opposite has happened. Everyone knows we are not \ndoing legislation because the Republicans will not let us.\n  There are 51 Democrats and 49 Republicans, a closely divided Senate. \nThe Republicans have decided they are going to let us do nothing, and \nthat is what they are doing, letting us do nothing. We want to \nlegislate; they want to obstruct.\n  Let's take the three bills we dealt with this past week. Global \nwarming: No, they would not let us legislate on that bill. We offered \ntwo amendments, three amendments, five amendments, eight amendments, \nrelevant, germane--nothing. They did not want to legislate, and we knew \nthat was the case because as we read into the Record several times, \nthere was a piece of work that came on e-mail from the Republicans who \nare devising the strategy for the Republicans in the Senate, and they \nsaid in that memo that there is no legislation going to take place \nhere; we are going to play political games. ``Political games'' were \ntheir words, and that is what they did.\n  As we have been here--the Senate opened 20 minutes ago--global \nwarming has gotten worse, not better. It is time we decided to take \nsome hard decisions and realize we cannot continue to take all this \ncarbon out of the Earth and put it into the sky. That is what global \nwarming is all about. We have to stop this.\n  We wanted to do something about gas prices. Of course gas prices have \ngone up. Since President Bush took office, the price of gas has gone \nfrom less than $1.50 a gallon now to $4.06 a gallon. As the Republican \nleader said, diesel fuel is approaching $5 a gallon. But during this \nperiod of time, we have been following the Cheney energy policy. The \nCheney energy policy was one devised in the White House in secret. The \npress, groups around the country have tried to find out what went on, \nwho came, what were the promises made. Obstruct--they would not allow \nus to find out what went on. The American people to this day do not \nknow what went on. But we do know the Bush-Cheney administration is the \nmost oil-friendly administration in the country. They made their \nfortunes in oil and they have treated the oil companies accordingly \nthis past 7\\1/2\\ years.\n  We tried to do something about gas prices. We think it is important \nthat we take a look at OPEC. It is not just Democrats talking about it. \nArlen Specter, the ranking member and former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, believes that is an extremely important issue. OPEC is \nviolating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Why shouldn't they be subject to \nit? That is what we wanted to legislate, and they would not let us.\n  We wanted to take away the huge amounts of free money the oil \ncompanies get. Why should they get all the free money from American \ntaxpayers when they made during the past year $250 billion in profit--\nnot million, billion. We tried to legislate on that issue saying these \nsubsidies to big oil should be terminated.\n  We thought it was important to do something about these windfall \nprofits these companies are making. We were stopped from doing that.\n  The Presiding Officer knows about legislating. He understands that \nlegislating is the art of compromise. Is any one of the pieces of \nlegislation we introduced perfect? Of course not. But it is an \nopportunity for us to try to do something about these gas prices. In \nthe short term--these are short-term fixes for the gas prices I talked \nabout--they would not allow us to legislate. And yesterday we tried to \nlegislate on doing something about alternative energy, renewable \nenergy. The Sun shines, the wind blows, steam comes out of the Earth. \nShouldn't we harness that for our own benefit? Shouldn't we use that so \nwe do not have to use 21 million barrels of dirty oil every day that is \nmaking our lives miserable with global warming, ruining the health of \npeople all over the world? Shouldn't we do that? The Republicans say \nno. They would not let us legislate on that issue yesterday.\n  We want to give the American entrepreneurs the ability to invest in \nrenewables. People are waiting to invest billions of dollars if they \nhave the opportunity for these tax credits, but the Republicans say no.\n  My friend said that Democrats think this is some kind of a corporate \nplot. We don't think it is a corporate plot. We do think the oil \ncompanies are making far too much money. And the sad part about it--my \nbrother for many years was a service station operator. My brother \nworked for Standard stations. I worked for Standard stations. He became \na manager for Standard stations. The Chevron oil company had Standard \nstations and Chevron stations. Chevron stations were dealers, \nindividuals such as my brother Dale--may my brother Dale rest in peace. \nHe died at the age of 47. He was a Chevron oil dealer. He worked very \nhard. He didn't make much money with the gas that was pumped. He made \nmoney selling water bags, which was a canvas bag people needed to go \nacross the desert if their car broke down, batteries, fan belts, tires. \nThat is where he made his money; not very much, but that is where he \nmade his money, not at the gas pump. And it is still that way. The \nmodern Dale Reids with stations around America are not making much \nmoney. The money is going to these massive oil companies.\n\n  I don't think it is a corporate plot. I think it is a Bush-Cheney \nplot. I think these people have done nothing. These two men have done \nnothing to address the energy crisis facing America. It took 7 years of \nthis man's Presidency before he could say the words ``global warming.''\n  My friend has used the name of the senior Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer. I am going to defend Senator Schumer. Senator Schumer is my \nfriend. He does an outstanding job representing the people of New York, \nand he has done an outstanding job representing all Democrats as \nchairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. This is a \ndifficult job, not one people seek. Senator Schumer took that job when \nhe could have been Governor of the State of New York. All the \neditorials said he would be the next Governor of New York. I knew that \nwhen I became Democratic leader. I asked Senator Schumer, recognizing \nhe could be the next Governor of New York: Will you take the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee? It is important for the country. And he \ngave up literally the governorship of New York, in my opinion, to take \nthis job. He has done a tremendous job: nine new Democratic Senators \nlast year.\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\n  He said yesterday in his speech before the Senate, among other \nthings, that the 75 filibusters the Democrats have had to face with \nthis Republican minority, which is so upset that we are in the \nmajority, is creating problems for Republican Senators. It is the \ntruth. Senator Schumer said:\n\n       It is unconscionable that the American public is being \n     forced to use their stimulus checks just to pay for gas.\n\n  Senator Schumer came and spoke for the American people. He spoke for \nthe people of New York, he spoke for the people of America, saying: Why \nnot let us legislate? And the fact that the Republicans are not letting \nus legislate on anything is going to work in November to the advantage \nof the Democrats. I think that is clear.\n  Look around the country. I am not going to predict what is going to \nhappen in November, but the majority is going to be bigger than 51 come \nNovember. Why? Because the American people see what is going on with \nthis Republican minority. It is the same in the House. Republicans have \nthe same philosophy: status quo, keep things the way they are, tread \nwater a while.\n  As a result, when Dennis Hastert--he broke the record for the longest \nRepublican Speaker in the history of the country--retired, a heavily \nRepublican House district in Illinois goes Democratic. That was only a \nquirk, they said.\n  Then we have a race in Louisiana, a heavily Republican district, been \nRepublican for a long time, and it goes Democratic. Why? Because the \nAmerican people see what is going on.\n  Illinois, a Republican district, sees what is going on; a Republican \ndistrict in Louisiana sees what is going on. In Mississippi, they \nappointed Congressman Wicker to be a Senator after Senator Lott \nretired. That district--we don't have to worry much about that, that is \na Republican district, always has been, always will be, except the \npeople of Mississippi see what is going on and they elected a Democrat. \nNow we have a Democratic House Member representing that so-called \nRepublican district.\n  We want to legislate. We want to legislate for the American people. \nAll we want is an opportunity to go forward and not have to face 75 \nfilibusters and legislate as the Senate has been doing for many \ndecades.\n  These Orwellian speeches given by my friend when he says ``It's the \nDemocrats' fault, they have been in power a year and a half; that is \nwhy gas prices are so high,'' think about that, everybody, think about \nthat, how unreasonable that is.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the speech of my good friend, the \nmajority leader, sounds eerily similar to the one he made yesterday \nmorning at exactly the same time, so I won't prolong this back and \nforth other than to say it is an interesting campaign speech, but the \nissue before us is, if we do want to legislate, we know how we have to \nlegislate in the Senate. We had the same discussion yesterday morning. \nThe way you don't legislate in the Senate is refuse to let the minority \noffer amendments.\n  I know this is inside baseball to most observers who don't follow \nevery nuance of what we do in the Senate, but the way you legislate in \nthe Senate is you call up a bill and you have a free amendment process \nand then you pass it. Prematurely filing cloture, filling up the tree, \npreventing the minority from having any serious impact on legislation \ndoesn't work. You can call that obstructionism if you want, but another \nway of looking at it would be to say the majority leader would like to \nturn the Senate into the House, and that is not the way we operate \nhere. The Republican minority is pretty unified over the notion that \nthey do not intend to be irrelevant.\n\n  With regard to the issue that is of most importance to the country--\nglobal warming--in fact, it is still the pending business. My Members \nare anxious to offer amendments on that debate. We have been on that \nmeasure. We discussed it all day yesterday and have been discussing it \nin previous days. We actually voted to continue the debate and would \nlike to have a chance to offer amendments to it.\n  But I think my good friend, the majority leader, would like, rather \nthan giving us a chance to truly amend the bill, to just simply check \nthe box and say: That is another filibuster, and move on.\n  It is a fact--it is not any kind of Orwellian spin--that gas prices \nare up $1.70 since the Democratic majority took over. It is also a fact \nthat Republicans, as I indicated in my comments earlier, are open to \nany of the conservation measures that have been suggested. But the \nfundamental problem is that our good friends on the other side are not \nwilling to do anything whatsoever on the production side.\n  Even though I think, for example, that suing OPEC is somewhat \nludicrous, I would be open to it if someone on the other side would \nsay: OK, we will sue OPEC and we will add to that a measure allowing \nthe opening of the Outer Continental Shelf, where States want to. I \nmean, why should the Federal Government prevent a State that actually \nwants to open the Outer Continental Shelf from doing so?\n  That is the way you go forward around here, with each side getting \nsomething. But, unfortunately, in these debates, they want it their way \nor not at all, and they do not even want to give us a chance to \nconsider or approve these efforts to increase our production.\n  So the way to legislate in the Senate is pretty clear. The majority \nleader and I have been around here a while. We remember when we used to \npass legislation, and we also remember how we did it. As I indicated \nyesterday morning, a good model for big, complicated bills, as the \nClean Air Act of 1990 was--it was on the Senate floor for 5 weeks with \n180 amendments and everybody participating, everybody offering \namendments. We worked our way through the process, and we passed a \nmajor piece of legislation. You can't bring up something like a climate \nbill, fill up the tree and file cloture, and call that a serious effort \nto legislate.\n  I am sure it is somewhat confusing to casual observers, all this spin \nback and forth, but the fact is, the Senate is a place full of serious \nlegislators on both sides of the aisle, and the only way we will \nactually be able to accomplish anything for the American people is for \neverybody's rights to be respected, for everybody to have a chance to \nparticipate, and at the end of the day to make some kind of bipartisan \naccommodation that would include some things the other side would like \nto accomplish, which I might not think is a great idea, but would also \ninclude some things that most of my Members believe would make a \ndifference. That is the way to pass major legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, I enjoy these morning discussions with the \nmajority leader. He is a good friend of mine. I like him a lot, I enjoy \nworking with him, and I hope we can get past making a campaign speech \nevery morning and actually see if there isn't some way to move forward \non important legislation for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend would like everyone to be \nconfused. No one is confused. No one is confused as to what is taking \nplace here. All records in the history of this country have been broken \non the number of filibusters. No one is confused about what is going on \nhere.\n  We know we have worked with the Republicans to do something about \nproduction. Of course we have. But we want to do something long term; \nwe want to do something short term. The American people are being \ndrowned with the smoke in the air, and too much carbon is coming out of \nthe ground into the sky. We want to do something with the Sun and the \nwind, the geothermal.\n  The OPEC measure is ludicrous? Mr. President, tell my friend, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, who is the biggest proponent in Congress of OPEC \nbeing subject to antitrust laws, that is ludicrous. I say to the \nRepublican leader, tell Arlen Specter it is ludicrous to go after OPEC. \nThose are the words of the Republican leader.\n  Finally, Mr. President, here is what they want to do on global \nwarming. This Orwellian verbiage we have heard this morning, that they \nwant to do something on global warming, well, here is what they want to \ndo about global warming. The e-mail on the Republican strategy that we \nobtained says this:\n\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\n\n       The focus is more on making political points than in \n     amending the bill.\n\n  That is what they said. And it continues:\n\n       GOP anticipates a struggle over which amendments are \n     debated and eventually fingerpointing over blame for demise \n     of the bill. The bottom line is that the GOP very much wants \n     to engage in it for a prolonged period, and then make it as \n     difficult as possible to move off the bill.\n       The focus is much more on making political points than on \n     amending the bill.\n\n  The American people aren't confused, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5539-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3101, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 3101, a bill to amend titles XVIII \n     and XIX of the Social Security Act to extend expiring \n     provisions under the Medicare program, to improve beneficiary \n     access to preventive and mental health services, to enhance \n     low-income benefit programs, and to maintain access to care \n     in rural areas, including pharmacy access, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have come to speak on the Medicare \nbill, but I must make a few remarks in relation to the debate between \nthe majority and the minority leaders. The bottom line is very simple, \nand that is they haven't said let's fight over what amendments nor have \nthey offered amendments. They have said that we will not even proceed \nto the bill.\n  So when the majority leader, Senator Reid, says it is Orwellian, of \ncourse it is. In every instance when the minority has come and said \nthey will do amendments related to the specifics of the issue at hand, \nthe majority leader has been more than accommodating, rankling even \nsome on our side. But they don't want to do that.\n  Senator Reid read the memo. They want to slow the bill down with \nextraneous amendments that have nothing to do with energy because they \ndo not want to allow a vote, even on ANWR.\n  Now, my friend from Kentucky talks about ANWR as the answer. Even the \nmost optimistic experts say it will be 7 years before we get a drop of \nthat oil. So the minority leader and the minority are saying wait 7 \nyears and maybe we will get oil prices down. We don't want to wait that \nlong. In 7 years, we could have an energy policy that weans us away in \npart from fossil fuels in a serious and significant way, like what is \nbeing done in Europe and other places. They do not want to do that \nbecause big oil dominates. They do not want to do that because their \nbase says drill in ANWR, and the people say no.\n  This idea that we don't want any production, the minority leader is \njust patently incorrect. Democrats, including myself, helped lead the \ncharge and voted to increase production in the east gulf. That is the \nplace where there is the most available oil and gas near refineries. \nAnd it wouldn't take 7 years the way starting a whole new venture in \nAlaska would. We voted for it under Republican leadership, when the \nRepublicans led. So we are willing to increase production, but we do \nbelieve we are not going to drill our way out of this problem.\n  The majority leader is exactly right. The actions of the minority \nleader say: Don't even debate it. Then he says they want to debate it. \nWell, if you want to debate it, don't block the motion to proceed. And \nI am certain--though I haven't talked to the majority leader about \nthis, but I will, and I know from his past actions--if they have a \nseries of amendments that are related to energy, they will be \nentertained. But if they want to debate George Bush's tax cuts or the \nestate tax, well, the majority leader has a perfect right to say, don't \ndo it.\n\n  So, Mr. President, again, this week in the Senate, Republicans are \nblocking lower energy costs. They are the party of no--no, no, no. They \nare the party of no on global warming, they are the party of no on \nlower energy costs, they are the party of no on tax help for solar and \nwind, and they are the party of no on preventing the oil companies from \njust doing everything they want. And as the majority leader said, the \nstatus quo is not what America wants, but the status quo is exactly \nwhat the minority, the Republicans, are standing for.\n  I said it yesterday, and I will say it again--I said in the DSCC that \nI care more about the substance. I would much rather we move forward. \nBut as head of the DSCC, the minority is filibustering themselves right \nout of their seats. When three-quarters of Americans demand dramatic \nchange, and the minority says no change, that is not a formula for \npolitical success. You don't have to be a political genius to know it.\n  So I would say to the rank-and-file members on the other side, I \ndon't understand the logic, I don't understand the thinking, but you \nare sure not helping yourself or helping your country.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to talk about Medicare for a \nminute--that is the bill we are on--and I rise to speak in strong \nsupport of the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of \n2008. I want to congratulate our leader on the Finance Committee, \nChairman Max Baucus, for introducing this much needed legislation.\n  When Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare into law in 1965, he promised it \nwould transform the lives of America's senior citizens, and he said \nthis:\n\n       No longer will older Americans be denied the healing \n     miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and \n     destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over \n     a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later \n     years.\n\n  No one could have said it better, and yet 40 years later we are at a \ncritical moment. Do we make much needed improvements to the program to \nallow it to fulfill its promise to America's seniors or do we ignore \nthis challenge?\n  We have worked hard in the Finance Committee to put together fair and \nreasonable legislation that is supported by all physicians groups and \nmillions of beneficiaries. We have compromised. I don't believe \nMedicare Advantage should come out of medical education. It affects my \nState, the majority of it will, and I am still willing to sort of suck \nit in and say, OK. But some on the other side are saying no, it has to \nbe all their way. We know that fee for service in Medicare Advantage is \nfar more lucrative and far more spread around the country. Yet we don't \nhave very much of that in here to help pay for the other necessary \nincreases. But it is a compromise bill. It is a bipartisan bill with \nbroad support on the Finance Committee, and I urge all Members to vote \nfor cloture today so we can provide help to millions of America's \nseniors and the hard-working health care providers who treat them.\n  We have to pass this bill to avoid catastrophic cuts to doctors. We \nknow these physicians face a 10-percent cut. To those who say, well, \nthey are doctors, they can afford it, the trouble is, if we do this \ncut, lots of doctors don't take Medicare, and our poor senior citizens \nare left in the lurch. When we cut resources to doctors, patients lose, \nin this instance. So we need to put aside politics and do the right \nthing for our seniors and pass this bill.\n  Some Members seem to think that doing more for low-income seniors--\nthose Americans who are trying to make ends meet and are deciding \nbetween filling their car's tank with $4 gas and paying for a doctor's \nvisit--is wrong. Opponents of this measure say now is not the time to \nimprove Medicare. Well, I say now is exactly the time. We need to cut \ncosts where we can and enhance the program where it is needed.\n  Our constituents are waiting for action. In my State of New York, the \nAARP dropped off 20,000 petitions in three wheelbarrows at my office in \nAlbany. These 20,000 petitions were from New Yorkers asking Congress to \npass this bill, to pass S. 3101, because it helps seniors on fixed \nincomes, establishes an e-prescribing requirement, and helps limit \npremium increases.\n  We are particularly pleased the bill emphasizes preventive health \ncare and expands coverage for key screenings, which can catch problems \nbefore they become more serious, and many other important measures.\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n  In addition, the bill stops the cuts to physicians for 18 months and \nprovides a 1.1-percent update for 2009.\n  The Medical Society of New York and medical societies throughout \nAmerica are in favor. I have spoken to the head of the AMA, who is Dr. \nNancy Nielsen from Buffalo, NY. She is the incoming President of the \nAMA. She has been tirelessly working, and I want to give her a shout-\nout of thanks here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill provides increased payments \nfor our ambulance providers. We put in a bill to do this; it got 25 \nbipartisan cosponsors. GAO found that ambulance providers are \nreimbursed on average 6 percent below their costs for providing \nservices to Medicare patients. This is unacceptable. It means they cut \nback on the lifesaving equipment needed in the ambulance. We all know, \nfor things like stroke and heart attack, having an up-to-date, modern \nambulance with the most lifesaving equipment is often the difference \nbetween life and death, so this increase will actually save lives.\n  It also, unlike the other alternative, ensures that pharmacists \ndispensing prescriptions are receiving payments on time. Two thousand \nindependent pharmacies in New York--and many more thousands around the \ncountry--are counting on this important change to keep them in the \nblack. That is in the bill. You cannot ask pharmacies, small \nbusinesspeople, to just give a line of credit to the Federal \nGovernment. That doesn't make much sense.\n  This is a good bill. I urge we move forward and get the 60 votes. I \nhope we will not have another filibuster, No. 76. Let's hope and pray \nthat doesn't happen so we can help America's seniors and continue to \nmodernize Medicare and move this bill forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that during the times when we \nare in a quorum call, the time be equally divided between the minority \nand the majority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now I again suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the remaining Republican time be allocated to the following \nlist for up to 15 minutes each, with Senator Grassley controlling the \nremaining time: Senators Enzi, Chambliss, Stevens, Hatch, Cornyn, and \nColeman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 3119 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                              Fuel Prices\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, over the past few weeks I have had the \nopportunity to come to the Senate floor to speak on a No. 1 issue I am \nhearing about as I travel around Wyoming, and that is the high price of \ngasoline and diesel fuel. I want to continue to address that issue \ntoday. I listened to the debate on S. 3044, the so-called Consumer-\nFirst Energy Act. It might as well be called the No Energy Act because \nthe bill does nothing to improve our Nation's energy situation and will \nactually do damage to it. One of the targets of S. 3044 is energy \nspeculators. Their role in the high price of energy has been brought up \ntime and time again, and my colleagues in the majority have been \nespecially vigilant in their desire to rein in this group as if they \nwere the big bad wolf.\n  If you listen to their arguments, they are persuasive. Unfortunately, \nthey don't tell the whole truth. An editorial I recently read from the \nWall Street Journal pointed out the flaws in their argument.\n  The article stated:\n\n       The first refuge of a politician panicked by rising prices \n     is always to blame ``speculators.'' So right on time for this \n     election season Congress has decided to do something about \n     rising oil prices by shooting the messenger known as the \n     energy futures market. Apparently this is easier than \n     offending the Sierra Club by voting for more domestic energy \n     supply. Futures markets are not some shadowy, dangerous force \n     but are essentially a price discovery mechanism. They allow \n     commodity producers and consumers to lock in the future price \n     of goods, helping to hedge against future price movements. In \n     the case of oil prices, they are about supply and demand and \n     the future rate of inflation. Democrats now argue that these \n     futures markets are generating the wrong prices for oil and \n     other commodities.\n       And who are these ``speculators'' driving up the prices? \n     The futures market operator Intercontinental Exchange says \n     that an increasing share of customers are not financial \n     houses but are commercial firms that need to manage oil-price \n     risks--[that means] the refiners, the airlines, and other \n     major energy consumers. Another term for these [energy] \n     ``speculators'' would be ``American business.''\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       If Democrats won't believe futures traders, maybe they'll \n     heed their biggest political funder. When . . . hedge fund \n     billionaire George Soros testified before Congress on this \n     issue, he noted, ``Regulations may have unintended adverse \n     consequences. For instance, they may push investors further \n     into unregulated markets which are less transparent and offer \n     less protection.''\n\n  The article concludes:\n\n       Democrats will find that moving jobs to Dubai from New York \n     and Chicago will not end commodity inflation that they \n     themselves have helped to create.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 10, 2008]\n\n                       Dubai's Favorite Senators\n\n       The first refuge of a politician panicked by rising prices \n     is always to blame ``speculators.'' So right on time for this \n     election season, Congress has decided to do something about \n     rising oil prices by shooting the messenger known as the \n     energy futures market. Apparently this is easier than \n     offending the Sierra Club by voting for more domestic energy \n     supply.\n       Futures markets aren't some shadowy dangerous force, but \n     are essentially a price discovery mechanism. They allow \n     commodity producers and consumers to lock in the future price \n     of goods, helping to hedge against future price movements. In \n     the case of oil prices, they are a bet about supply and \n     demand and the future rate of inflation. Democrats \n     nonetheless now argue that these futures markets are \n     generating the wrong prices for oil and other commodities.\n       And who are these ``speculators'' driving up prices? The \n     futures market operator Intercontinental Exchange says that \n     an increasing share of its customers are not financial houses \n     but commercial firms that need to manage oil-price risks--\n     refiners, airlines, and other major energy consumers. Another \n     term for these ``speculators'' would be ``American \n     business.''\n       Not ironically, the leaders of Capitol Hill's shoot-the-\n     messenger caucus are among those most culpable for the lack \n     of domestic oil supplies. Senator Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.) \n     has been threatening to hold up appointments to the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission until the CFTC increases \n     regulation of oil trading. In the best tradition of \n     bureaucratic self-protection, the CFTC's acting chief Walter \n     Lukken has agreed to investigate.\n       Ms. Cantwell's recent press release on ``outrageous energy \n     prices'' didn't mention her own contributions to the problem. \n     According to the Almanac of American Politics, she \n     ``successfully worked the phones'' in 2005 to round up enough \n     colleagues to block drilling in the Alaskan wilderness. Ms. \n     Cantwell has also backed a slew of mandates and subsidies \n     that have helped to raise food prices by diverting corn and \n     other crops to a fuel. She even claims to have helped create \n     the biofuels industry in her state.\n       Her counterpart in the House is Michigan's Bart Stupak, who \n     claims special credit for a permanent ban on drilling in the \n     Great Lakes and has also cast votes against exploration in \n     Alaska and off the California coast. With $4 gasoline, this \n     is a man in need of political cover as Michiganders head into \n     the summer driving season. A spokesman says Mr. Stupak is \n     hoping to roll out a new bill by the end of this week to \n     require ``additional reporting and oversight' in the oil \n     futures markets.\n       Then there's New York Senator Chuck Schumer, another \n     staunch opponent of new domestic oil supplies. Mr. Schumer \n     has\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\n     egged on the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting binge that has \n     contributed so much to the oil price spike. But, with \n     impeccable political timing, he now suspects ``price \n     manipulation by speculators'' is the real cause of rising gas \n     prices.\n       Mr. Schumer's answer is the ``Consumer-First Energy Act,'' \n     due for a cloture vote in the Senate today. Bundled with a \n     windfall profits tax on oil companies, the plan also includes \n     an increase in margin requirements for those who wish to \n     trade oil futures. This would of course make it more \n     expensive to trade in U.S. futures markets, which in a world \n     of computerized, instantaneous trading means that those \n     trades would merely move to markets overseas. As luck would \n     have it, the Dubai Mercantile Exchange celebrated its first \n     birthday last week with the launch of two new oil futures \n     contracts that compete with those offered by American \n     exchanges.\n       Leave aside the question of whether Mr. Schumer believes \n     that the Dubai exchange, which is majority-owned by Middle \n     Eastern governments, will offer more consumer protection than \n     America's shareholder-owned exchanges. This is the same Chuck \n     Schumer who warned in 2007 that heavy regulation threatens \n     New York's preeminence in global finance. Along with Mayor \n     Michael Bloomberg and former Governor Eliot Spitzer, Mr. \n     Schumer introduced a long report on the threats facing New \n     York with a short note that specifically mentioned Dubai as \n     an increasingly formidable competitor. That of course was not \n     an election year.\n       If Democrats won't believe futures traders, maybe they'll \n     heed their biggest political funder. When Senator Cantwell \n     invited hedge-fund billionaire George Soros to testify last \n     week, she probably didn't expect the backer of left-wing \n     causes to deviate from her market-manipulation narrative. But \n     among other things, Mr. Soros noted that ``Regulations may \n     have unintended, adverse consequences. For instance, they may \n     push investors further into unregulated markets which are \n     less transparent and offer less protection.''\n       Democrats will find that moving jobs to Dubai from New York \n     and Chicago will not end the commodity inflation that they \n     themselves have helped to create.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Do we need an open and transparent market? Yes. Is there \nmore that could be done? Probably. Which is why the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission announced, on June 10, that it was forming an \ninteragency task force to evaluate developments in the commodity \nmarkets. Rather than sitting here in the Senate Chamber spending our \ntime criticizing commodities traders, we should be working together to \npass legislation that we can agree on to improve our Nation's energy \nsituation. The problem we face is a problem of supply and demand, less \nAmerican-made energy and more demand for that energy. That is the \nproblem that Congress should be addressing. That is what those in \ncontrol of both Houses of Congress don't seem to understand at this \nstage, even though 2 years ago they complained about the price of \ngasoline and promised they would bring the price down.\n  The continued rise of gas prices is going to put an end to this dog-\nand-pony show eventually. Unfortunately, we are not at that point yet \nwhere the majority will seriously deal with this issue. The bills we \nare debating will do nothing to improve our Nation's energy situation. \nThe substitute to the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act would have \ncost us money, at a time when we are paying record energy prices. The \nso-called Consumer-First Energy Act would lead to less investment in \nenergy; therefore, less supply and, therefore, higher prices for \nconsumers. As bad as these bills are, the process by which they get \nhere is even worse. They don't go through committee. They won't be \nsigned by President Bush, and yet we still waste the time of the Senate \ntalking about them, as if they will be made law and they will improve \nthe Nation's energy situation. That is not the case. It is also not how \nwe do things around here.\n  I have heard complaints that Republicans are stopping progress on \nimportant legislation. I have heard complaints that the majority is \nunable to legislate. ``Unwilling'' would be a better term. We are \npaying record prices at the pump. Those record prices are connected to \nspecific actions or inactions by those in control of Congress in the \nrecent past and years ago.\n  Recently, on May 13, the Democratic majority defeated the American \nEnergy Production Act by a vote of 56 to 42. The measure would have \nexpanded domestic oil production as well as opening the potential of \noil shale and coal-to-fuel technology. In 1996, President Clinton \nvetoed a bill that would have enabled us to get 1 million barrels of \nAmerican oil a day. That is what we are demanding that Saudi Arabia \ngive us. I remember in 1973, when we made some demands on Saudi Arabia, \nand they cut us off entirely. Some of us are old enough to remember the \ngas lines and the shortages we had then. But he vetoed a bill that \nwould have enabled us to get a million barrels of American oil a day \nfrom the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area about a sixth the \nsize of Dulles Airport. The entire refuge is considerably bigger, but \nwe are talking about drilling on a very small portion of it.\n  On May 22, House Democrats voted down a measure sponsored by \nCongressman Mike Conaway that would have expanded the use of coal to \nfuel, oil shale, and tar sands, as well as expediting the permitting \nprocess for new refineries on three closed military bases. In December, \nDemocratic members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \ndebated a proposal to ensure development of nuclear energy to meet \nemission goals. That is this year.\n  The list goes on and on, as does the majority's theatrics of \ninaction. When they got the majority a year and a half ago, the Speaker \npromised lower gasoline prices. How have they delivered? Their answer \nfor our need to produce more American energy is to always say no, and \ntheir solution is always, let's tax the oil industry, a plan we know \nwon't work because, under President Carter, we tried that, and we drove \na lot of business overseas, which is where we have to ship our money \nunless we can get oil production in the United States. A lot of people \ndon't realize--maybe they do--that Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer \nand that the Soviet Union is the second largest producer. What they \ndon't realize is that the United States is the third largest producer, \nand we could solve a lot of our own problems if we were to do some of \nthe things suggested here.\n  Like most of my colleagues, I support developing more alternative \nenergy. I support the use of wind energy and the development of better \nsolar energy technologies. Wyoming is the perfect place for a lot of \nthat development to happen. We have, most days, the sunshine, and we do \nget some wind. While we need to develop those technologies for the long \nterm, we need all the energy we can get today. We need more American \noil from American soil, we need more domestic natural gas, we need more \nnuclear energy, and we definitely need more clean coal. More taxes and \nlawsuits are not going to get us there.\n  I emphasize again that I have a lot of faith in American ingenuity. \nFor the long term, there is some research that could be done that would \nwork with coal to make it cleaner, greener, and meet the needs, because \nthat is the biggest resource we have. We have more Btus in coal than \nSaudi Arabia has in oil, and we have that in one county in Wyoming. But \nfor the shorter term, yes, we do need to conserve, and, yes, we need \nalternative energy sources. We cannot abandon the sources of energy we \nhave right now.\n\n  I am going to end with a story. A while ago, I had to go out to \nCalifornia for a meeting. I was supposed to speak in the evening, and \nmy plane got into California at rush hour. I thought: I am probably not \ngoing to be able to make this speech. I rented a car. My wife was with \nme. I found out they have these high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Well, \nthere was one lane for high-occupancy vehicles. I have never seen so \nmany lanes. I am pretty sure there were six more lanes besides the one \nlane for high-occupancy vehicles. I made that speech on time. I zinged \nright through that high-occupancy-vehicle lane because it only required \ntwo people in the car--only two. Out here, there are a lot that require \nthree, but in California it was only two. Now, what about the other six \nlanes of traffic? Stalled out. Six lanes--cars stopped dead, idling \ntheir motors, putting carbon in the air, one person to a car. Now, that \nis a State with 34 million people and huge concentrations of people. So \nI would like to encourage California to carpool a little bit.\n  Now, I would encourage the people in Wyoming to carpool too, but I \nspend a lot of time trying to teach the East and the far West about the \nMidwest, and most of the people we have are driving because they have \nto and because they are going to a single site where they are the only \nworker. And\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\nwe only have half a million people, to begin with. But a lot of trucks \ncome through our State that are delivering produce and other things to \nthe rest of the Nation, and that is important to have happen.\n  But when people talk about gasoline and trying to reduce its use, \nthey have to remember that a lot of that is to provide services and \nproducts that we in the United States have grown very accustomed to. We \ndo not rely on everything coming from our own county; we rely on it \ncoming from not only the rest of the United States but the rest of the \nword.\n  The only way we are going to get out of this dilemma is to work on \nthe short term, which is to get people to conserve; work on the medium \nterm, which is to do some things with alternative energy but to put \nsome research into the future so we can handle the kinds of things we \nneed to provide for the energy we need for this country. Increasing the \nsupply is the only thing that is going to bring down the price.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about how Congress \ncan take action to provide relief to American families who are really \nfeeling the pain at the pump due to high gas prices.\n  Obviously, this is a very complex issue and requires a multipronged \nstrategy to respond. But the base price of gasoline reflects the \nprinciples of supply and demand. Asian economies continue to boom, \ncreating soaring demand for oil. At the same time, many oil-producing \nregions are curbing output. These factors can create a perfect storm \nthat leads to historic high prices for the price of crude oil and the \nresulting prices at the pump we see today.\n  I believe we must find both short-term and long-term solutions to \nprovide energy security for our Nation and give relief to the \nunprecedented gas prices we are experiencing today.\n  Republicans and Democrats recently came together and passed a piece \nof legislation, with my vote, to suspend the filling of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve until the end of the year. This was an attempt to \nprovide a short-term solution to high gas prices at the pump by dealing \nwith the supply side of the issue. It is a bill that passed with strong \nbipartisan support.\n  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has the capacity of 727 million \nbarrels of oil and currently holds just over 700 million barrels. The \nUnited States had been filling this Reserve to the tune of about 70,000 \nbarrels per day.\n  This was the right thing to do for several reasons: first, because we \nshould not be buying the most expensive oil ever and simply putting it \nin the ground; secondly, because it will leave a little more oil on the \nmarket, which will hopefully alleviate prices somewhat; and third, \nbecause it shows that Congress recognizes that increasing the supply of \noil in the market can have an impact on the price of oil. Finally, it \nsends a message to energy markets that Congress can take action and \nthereby reduce speculation, which certainly has been a participant in \nthe rising price of oil.\n  Congress also acted in a bipartisan manner to address a component of \nthe long-term solution to energy security by enacting the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act in December of last year. This \nlegislation, again with my support, was an attempt to provide a long-\nterm solution to high gas prices by dealing with the demand side of the \nissue.\n  This legislation contains an aggressive new renewable fuels standard \nthat requires fuel producers to include a certain amount of alternative \nfuel in their product. I am excited about the significant opportunity \nthis provides for Georgia, which has not been a large producer of \nbiofuels in the past, to participate in the development of renewable \nfuel sources. The renewable fuel standard requires 36 billion gallons \nof renewable fuels in American motor fuels by 2022. I think it was the \nright thing to do to require 21 billion of the 36 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuels to come from advanced biofuels. This means instead of \ncorn-based ethanol, we will be making fuels from cellulose such as wood \nchips, peanut hulls, and switchgrass.\n\n  This emphasis on biofuels is consistent with legislation I introduced \nlast year to increase the amount of advanced biofuels and gasoline. \nThis is also very consistent with the farm bill that passed this body. \nIn the energy title in that farm bill, of which I was particularly \nexcited about and remain excited, what we did was to induce the \nmanufacture of additional amounts of ethanol in this country. But the \nproduction of ethanol from corn has had unintended consequences--we \nhave seen the price of food products increase. It hasn't just been \ncorn-based food products as a result of the high demand for corn. We \nhave seen more corn planted, which means the demand for wheat, \nsoybeans, peanuts, as well as other commodities, has increased and \ndriven up the price because farmers are simply planting more corn due \nto the high price. It looks as if the demand is going to be there for a \nlong time to come.\n  So in this farm bill, what we did was to incentivize the production \nof ethanol not from corn but from cellulosic-based products, whether it \nis peanut hulls, switchgrass, pine trees, or who knows. In my part of \nthe world, we have a vine culled kudzu that grows rampant across \nGeorgia, and there is not much use for it. One of these days we may \neven see a biodegradable product, such as kudzu, become available for \nthe manufacture of ethanol. It is a serious problem, and in the farm \nbill we sought to address the additional production of ethanol through \ncellulosic-based products.\n  I wish to read a couple pieces of correspondence I have received from \nconstituents of mine which further emphasizes the intensity of this \nproblem, the seriousness of this problem, and the fact that all of a \nsudden families are simply not able to incorporate into their budget \nthis huge increase in gasoline prices in such a short period of time.\n  Deanna Payne of Winder, GA, writes as follows:\n\n       Senator Chambliss: Due to the high cost of gas, I am having \n     to cut down on groceries and visit local food banks. My \n     husband makes the same amount of money he did in 2007, but we \n     just can't make ends meet. Gas prices have doubled the cost \n     of some of the grocery items I used to purchase. I just can't \n     do it. Please give us some relief! This is ridiculous! \n     Americans are going hungry and losing everything!\n\n  Another constituent from Augusta writes:\n\n       I am very concerned about rising gas prices and what if \n     anything Congress plans to do to help Americans. I cannot \n     afford to fill up my vehicle at these rates which today are \n     approaching $4. My husband is a platoon sergeant training \n     troops at Fort Gordon. I work at the Medical College of \n     Georgia. We have a combined income of over $70,000. It is \n     becoming harder and harder to put any money aside. Not only \n     is the cost of gas rising, but the cost to heat and cool our \n     home and the cost of groceries are all making it difficult to \n     make ends meet. My husband re-enlisted in September 2007. We \n     as a family came to the decision that even during this time \n     of war, the Army was the only guarantee of a paycheck and \n     health care coverage for the next few years. I hope that \n     Congress is putting aside its partisan issues and working \n     together to help all Americans, as I feel our Nation will \n     soon fall apart at the rate it is going now.\n\n  A constituent from Montrose, GA, writes:\n\n       Please work to help us with the prices of gas and its \n     effects on every household's budget. We should be drilling \n     anywhere and everywhere to alleviate this current situation. \n     The brightest in this country need to be assembled and given \n     the resources to come up with alternative energy sources. We \n     need to have the Nation go to a 4-day work week starting with \n     government agencies leading the way by example. These \n     problems have been gradually getting worse all along with \n     nothing getting done. Steps better be taken soon before this \n     country gets into a position that it can't recover from. \n     Thank you.\n\n  From Douglasville, GA:\n\n       I am a single mother of 3. I had to take $20 out of my \n     grocery money to pay for gas just to get to work. That is the \n     only place I drive. The kids and I walk to our local stores \n     if needed. This is not the American Dream, or the way we are \n     supposed to live in the great United States! I can't afford a \n     new car that is better on gas. I already drive a 4 cylinder. \n     SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE!\n\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer has dozens and dozens of these same \ntypes of letters in his office, and it is a further indication of the \nfact that Americans truly are hurting at the gas pump.\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\nIt is imperative we provide the leadership in Washington that reacts \nfrom a short-term standpoint but, more importantly, looks to the long-\nterm solution to this problem. It is going to be very difficult to \nreduce gas prices in this short term, but I think, without question, if \nwe implement today long-term policies, we will see an immediate \nreaction by oil-producing countries and we will see an immediate effect \non gas prices and I think, without question, we will see a lowering of \nthose gas prices, to a certain extent.\n  But the important matter is we have to address the issue. As I look \naround this body and see the rhetoric going back and forth on both \nsides of the aisle, I don't see solutions coming out. I see blame being \nplaced. I see political statements being made. I think it is time we \nput those political statements aside, we put partisan politics aside, \nand we, sure enough, try to reach an accord for some commonsense \nsolutions to a problem that is having a direct effect on constituents \nof Republicans and constituents of Democrats alike. It is time we make \nsure we address this problem for the long term, incorporate the \nmultifaceted issues that are involved, and that we come together and \nmake sure we are doing the work the people sent us to do. I don't see \nthat happening today, and that is what I am hearing from my \nconstituents back home.\n  So I hope, as we move forward over the next several days before we \nadjourn for the Fourth of July week break, when we are all going to be \nback home and we are going to continue to hear these issues raised, we \ncan say: Here is what we are prepared to do in a bipartisan way to \nsolve this problem and to make sure we don't continue to be dependent \non foreign petroleum imports, to the tune of 62 percent of our needs; \nthat we are taking action to address that imbalance, and we are taking \naction to implement measures to ensure that alternative fuels are \ndeveloped, that the research is put in place to provide those \nalternative fuels at the gas pump, which will help drive the price \ndown, and that we are prepared to implement conservation measures and \nimplore the American people to also think about that from the \nstandpoint of the implementation of conservation measures. If we don't \ndo it ourselves, it is difficult for us to ask the American people to \ndo it.\n  So I do hope the leadership in this body, on both sides of the aisle, \nis listening to the American people and is cognizant of the fact that \npeople across America simply don't think we are doing anything and that \npartisan politics is not allowing us to do anything; that we address \nthat issue; that we find long-term solutions which will help in the \nshort term as well as the long term; and that we seek positive \nlegislation coming forward from both sides of the aisle to address this \nproblem immediately.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the situation regarding time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 15 minutes.\n\n\n                          Development in ANWR\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Americans are forced to pay more for gas \nevery day, every week. The price is going up and up. There have been \nmany ideas presented on the floor of the Senate, but I do think some of \nthe comments made by the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, need a \nresponse. He has made some comments about the developing of the Arctic \nPlain, known as ANWR. Actually, it is not part of the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge. It is 1\\1/2\\ million acres that were set aside in 1980 for oil \nand gas exploration and development. That land has been waiting for \napproval of Congress and the President. The 1980 act required that \nthere be an environmental impact statement finding that there would be \nno irreparable harm to the flora and fauna of the Arctic, and that \nfinding would have to be approved by the President and Congress; \nnamely, it would have to be approved by an act of Congress, signed by \nthe President.\n  Since 1981, we have tried to proceed as was planned at that time. At \nthe time that President Carter had withdrawn over 100 million acres of \nAlaska land, the one success we had in that bill--the 1980 bill--was \nthe provision that permitted the exploration and development of the oil \nand gas resources of this area of the Arctic Plain.\n  Now, the Senator from New York said opening ANWR's 1 million barrels \na day of production would reduce the price of gas at the pump by only a \npenny. We found that rather strange because he later said he wanted the \nPresident to ask the Saudi Arabian people to increase their production \nof oil from 700,000 to 800,000 barrels a day, and if they did, it would \nreduce the price of gas at the pump--at first, he said by 35 to 50 \ncents, and then he said it would reduce it by 62 cents a gallon. I find \nit strange that 1 million barrels of oil from Alaska would reduce the \nprice at the pump by only one penny but 800,000 barrels a day from \nSaudi Arabia would reduce the price at the pump by 62 cents. Somehow or \nother, that kind of calculation is not the way we add up things in \nAlaska.\n  Let me repeat that. He said: One million barrels a day from Alaska \nwould reduce the price at the pump by one penny, but 800,000 barrels a \nday from Saudi Arabia would reduce the price up to 62 cents. It is not \nreally understandable when a Senator presents arguments that contradict \neach other. I think it is time now for the Senator from New York to \ncome back to the Senate floor and restate his position on ANWR. Is it \nan economic position or is it just a philosophical position, where he \nis agreeing with those people who are against exploration and \ndevelopment of the Arctic Slope? If it is, I understand it.\n  At first, the Senator from New York said he favored drilling in the \neastern Gulf of Mexico because the oil could come to market more \nquickly than Alaskan oil. That, too, is too much to pass up. Congress \nauthorized the eastern gulf development a year and a half ago, in \nDecember 2006. The lease sale occurred this past March, and it will be \n7 to 10 years before that oil comes to shore. As a matter of fact, it \nis probably going to take longer to develop the gulf oil than it would \ntake to develop the Alaskan oil on the Arctic Slope because the 3-D \nseismic has been done in our State. We know where the oil is located. \nWe just have to finish exploration and develop that field. And it would \ntake less time because there is a pipeline already in place.\n  Perhaps the Senator from New York has forgotten that we have a \npipeline. At the time of the Persian Gulf war, that line carried 2.1 \nmillion barrels a day to American markets. Now it is carrying about \n700,000. It is about two-thirds empty, Mr. President. That is a very \ndifficult thing for Alaskans to understand, when we know there is oil \nin the Arctic Plain waiting to be developed. As a matter of fact, if \nPresident Clinton had not vetoed the ANWR bill in 1995, we would have \nup to 1\\1/2\\ million barrels a day being delivered today through that \npipeline. That argument has been the same every year since 1980.\n  I have been here every year trying to get approval of the finding \nthat there would be no irreparable harm to the Arctic if developed. It \nis supported by the people of Alaska and other people of the United \nStates and there is an overwhelming approval now to proceed with \ndevelopment of the Arctic Slope. It has to be done.\n  We have had development of our Arctic at Prudhoe Bay. At the time we \nargued on the floor of the Senate for approval of the amendment to \npermit the oil pipeline to be built back in the 1970s, there were cries \non the Senate floor, in the press, and throughout the country that it \nwould harm the caribou, that the caribou would be put into jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, there are three to four times as many caribou in that \narea now than before the pipeline was built. As the pipeline was built, \nin the area where it was restored, we planted grasses there that were \neven better than the natural grasses. If you want to see caribou in \nAlaska now, the place to go is by the pipeline. We have not had any \nspill on shore of any nature. There was some last winter--in terms of a \ngathering pipeline, that leaked a little. But it was during the \nwintertime, and it was totally cleaned up and there has been no \nirreparable harm.\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n  We have literally billions of barrels of oil available to us. At the \ntime we proceeded with the oil pipeline, the estimate was made that \nPrudhoe Bay would develop 1 billion barrels. Well, we have sent over 14 \nbillion barrels of oil to the south 48, by virtue of the Mondale \namendment to the Oil Pipeline Act, that all the oil transmitted in the \nAlaska pipeline must go to American markets. I voted for that \namendment. I think this is American oil, and it should fill American \nneeds. As a matter of fact, we are tired of seeing the increase in the \nimportation of oil from foreign sources.\n  At the time of the 1970s embargo on oil by the Arab nations, we were \nimporting about 33 percent of our oil. Today we are importing over 60 \npercent of our oil. In about 5 years we will be importing about 40 \npercent of our natural gas, LNG. Think about that. This Nation, which \nhas been a leader in the world in industrial development and in \ntechnology, is going to be at the place where almost two-thirds of our \nneed for oil or gas is going to be dependent upon foreign sources, when \nwe have known areas in this country that can boost out oil and gas.\n  It is primarily a situation where this is an opposition that has \narisen on a political basis. After President Clinton vetoed the ANWR \nbill in 1995, many of my friends on the other side of the aisle decided \nthey would not support ANWR anymore, and they have voted that way.\n  I think it is unfortunate because we should have access to develop \nAmerican sources of oil to meet American needs. This area of our North \nSlope meets those conditions fairly well. I do think the concept of the \nSenator from New York, in demanding that the President go to Saudi \nArabia to increase their production when he opposes doing so in this \ncountry, is unacceptable.\n  It is the duty of Congress to keep American dollars in America when \nwe can. By developing a very small portion--less than 2,000 acres of \nthat million and a half acres, which is all we need to develop for the \noil and gas resources of the Arctic Plain--we could offset the entire \noil imports we bring in from Venezuela or Saudi Arabia. I was surprised \nat my friend from New York, when he said the idea of developing the \nANWR oil is a poorly executed ``magic trick.'' I don't know what is \nmagic about it. It is just a matter of simple engineering. We can and \nhave developed oil and gas in the Arctic, and we have not seen the harm \nthat other people have indicated would come to either our area or to \nthe wildlife of our area.\n  We need to have Americans realize it is the very fact of starting to \ndevelop this oil that will bring down the prices from foreign sources. \nOnce the foreign sources see we are getting ready to increase our own \nsupply, they will start reducing their price in order to take away the \nincentive we have, based on the current prices, to open these areas in \nthe United States. So if you want an immediate reaction from anything, \nin terms of this current gas price problem, then have the Congress act \nand have the President sign a bill to start the development of the \nArctic Plain, known as ANWR. If we do that, that signal to the foreign \nproducers of oil will say America is just getting ready to restore its \nown supply. If it restores its own supply, prices will come down in \nforeign oil. They don't want our competition; they want our markets. So \nfar they are convinced that we will not provide our own oil, and since \nwe will not, there is no limit to what they will charge us for oil.\n  We have seen such a dramatic change that I cannot believe it. At the \ntime the oil pipeline was approved, oil was $7 and $8 a barrel. It is \nnow approaching $150 a barrel. Why? Because of the law of supply and \ndemand. We have refused to increase our domestic supply of oil, and \nhaving done so the price is set at a world price.\n  I remember there used to be a posted price in San Diego or Los \nAngeles or Philadelphia or Seattle or even in Alaska--a posted price by \nthe refineries on how much they paid for oil. That is no longer the \ncase. The case is now that we look to the foreign suppliers to see what \nthey are going to charge. We have to pay whatever they charge. With an \nincreasing demand all over the world from the developing countries, \nsuch as China, there is no reason for us not to understand what is \nhappening.\n  Just a week ago, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, there \nwas a chart that showed the future situation with oil and gas. It \nshowed the supply almost steady at the same level for coming years. It \nshowed the demand on an ever-increasing curve going up, up, and up. \nWhen the price of oil started going up, I predicted on the floor of the \nSenate, when we debated the ANWR situation in 2006, that the price of \noil could reach $100 a barrel. Actually, there was laughter from the \nother side of the aisle. Some of my Democratic colleagues laughed and \nsaid it was another exaggeration by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, it reached not only $100 a barrel, it is over that. It \nis going to stay over $100 a barrel, until we wake up and start \ndeveloping our own supply of oil. Once we start developing that supply, \nthe foreigners will know we are going to be able to bring that price \ndown by our supply, and they will start bringing it down so we will not \nincrease it to the point where we present a dangerous challenge to \ntheir domination of the world market, as far as oil is concerned.\n  I think the concept of these imports has just been totally missed. My \nfriends talk about exporting jobs. Nothing has exported more jobs than \npurchasing our oil abroad. Every 1 million barrels of oil a day coming \nin has eliminated 20,000 jobs in the United States. That is 20,000 jobs \nfor every million, and we are importing over 12 million barrels of oil \na day. Mr. President, 12 million barrels of oil is the same as 240,000 \njobs.\n\n  When we look at this, I think it is time for the Senate to settle \ndown. I do hope my friend from New York will settle down a little bit \nbecause there is no trickery in ANWR, there is no trickery in exploring \nand developing American sources of oil. The trickery is in terms of the \nprices we are paying, the exaggerated prices caused by those who are \nbuying futures and speculating futures on our oil. We are no longer \nbuying oil from foreign sources, we are buying them from some of our \nown people who invested in futures, and they are speculating on that \nprice and driving up the price.\n  It is time for us to get down to the fact that we must find a way to \nauthorize exploration and development of the Arctic Plain, known as \nANWR.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \nSenator Cornyn's time for up to 5 minutes, and I further ask unanimous \nconsent that after I speak, the Senator from Illinois be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Alaska \nraising some of these points. I was thinking particularly about the \npoint that the markets react to what actions are taken, and that is a \nkey point on driving prices down.\n  I used to report on commodity markets a number of years ago when I \nwas a broadcaster. The idea of buy on the rumor and sell on the fact is \nsomething to which markets react. So we could help on a near-term basis \ndriving these prices down if we would act. Plus, I like the idea of \npegging a price of a gallon of gasoline. When the average prices across \nthe country hit $4.50 a gallon, let's give Governors the option of \nopening some of these closed-off lands. These are ideas we ought to be \ntalking about on getting energy prices down.\n\n\n                        Tornado Damage In Kansas\n\n  Mr. President, the reason I have come to the floor is not to talk \nabout energy prices but to talk about what happened in my State last \nnight. We had devastating tornadoes. A series of tornadoes struck parts \nof our State and caused at least two deaths and a huge amount of damage \nin a swath 150 miles long. The counties of Ellsworth, Saline, \nDickinson, Riley, Clay, Geary, Pottawatomie, and Jackson all suffered \nsevere damage last night.\n  The town of Chapman in Dickinson County, with a population of 1,400, \nappears to be the hardest hit. Initial estimates are 85 percent of the \nhomes and businesses have received some damage, and up to 70 percent of \nthe town may be destroyed.\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\n  One person is reported dead in Chapman. Also one person is reported \ndead in Soldier, KS. That is in Jackson County. Certainly, my prayers \nand the prayers of many go to the victims and their families who are \nstruggling and suffering.\n  Damage was also reported in Salina, KS, and Manhattan, KS. The \nnorthern part of Kansas State University apparently received extensive \ndamage.\n  I am hopeful my colleague Pat Roberts and I will be able to travel \nwith others this afternoon to look at some of that damage.\n  Evidently, the tornado touched down near the old field house on \nKansas State University campus, the Ahearn Field House, and traveled \nacross campus. There was damage sustained on Cardwell Hall, Ward Hall, \nBurt Hall, and the engineering complex. Ward Hall houses a nuclear \nreactor, a teaching facility nuclear reactor, and the building received \nsome damage. The reactor is safe.\n  The Wind Erosion Laboratory, a federal laboratory on the K State \ncampus, apparently was destroyed.\n  Damage was also reported in several of the parking lots with cars \nbeing tossed around. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon house received extensive \ndamage. Thankfully all the residents there are safe.\n  While it is early, the damage will be well into the millions of \ndollars. My office and the office of my colleague Pat Roberts contacted \nFEMA and State officials this morning, and we continue to work closely \nwith both State and Federal officials to help the citizens of Kansas \nrebuild.\n  This has been a very difficult, extraordinary tornado season. I was \nin north central Kansas on Monday of this week looking at damage to \nanother of our towns, Jewell, KS, and the extensive damage there by a \ntornado within the past 2 weeks. We have had these on a periodic basis. \nWe are getting a lot of hail damage and a lot of wind and rain damage \nthroughout the State. It seems as if every other night there is some \nsystem developing and passing through the region.\n  Certainly, as well, everybody's thoughts and prayers are with the \nscout troop in Iowa that suffered four deaths, apparently perhaps more, \ndue to the tornado that was in much of that same line of thunderstorms \nand tornadoes that swept throughout much of the Midwest last night.\n  I say that to this body as a way of recognizing and stating to people \nwhat is taking place as far as damage, and also the support and help we \nare going to need throughout the Midwest for some of the tornado damage \nthat has occurred. It is extensive.\n  We are in a very difficult tornado season. It does not appear to be \nabating. We are getting a lot of flood damage, hail damage, and tornado \ndamage. We will be reporting back to the body on some of the work that \nis going to need to be done to rebuild, whether it is Kansas State \nUniversity, Chapman, or other places that have been damaged. We can \nonly hope we can last the rest of the season with no more loss of life \nand hope there is no more damage to communities. But it has been a very \ndifficult season.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Price of Gasoline\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in my brief period of time, I wish to \naddress two issues. One relates to a topic that is important across \nAmerica. Another relates to the pending legislation.\n  The first topic is the issue of the price of gasoline. I don't need \nto show this chart to people to remind them what is happening. \nBeginning with the Bush administration when the President was sworn \ninto office, the average price for a gallon of gasoline was $1.47. As \nof June 9, the average price across America was $4.04, the most \ndramatic increase in the price of gasoline in our history. It is a \nsituation which has called for analysis and attention because no matter \nwhere we go--in Illinois, Ohio, in any State--people say: Senator, what \nare you going to do about these gas prices? They are killing us.\n  They go to the gasoline stations, the service stations, pull out \ntheir credit cards and cash, and cannot believe how much it costs. It \nis not just an inconvenience for many people, it is a hardship. For \nsome, they have had to make family budget decisions because they cannot \nafford to keep the tank full, and many do not have an option. If they \nare from my part of the world in downstate Illinois, there are not that \nmany buses outside the cities. There is no mass transit. What are you \ngoing to do? You moved out into the country to get a home you can \nafford. You commute to a job spending an hour each way to work. And now \nfilling that gas tank takes so much of your paycheck, so you have to \ncut back in other areas or borrow more deeply, finding your credit card \nbalance growing and your ability to reckon with it diminishing. That is \nthe reality of where we are today.\n  Obviously, people across America say: Well, Senators, what are you \ngoing to do about it? You were elected, weren't you, to do something \nabout the issues and challenges facing our country?\n  So this week we came to the floor and said: Let's debate it. Let's \nput our best efforts to work. Let's debate a bill that may help and \namend it and try to come up with some way to deal with the energy \ncrisis facing America.\n  On Tuesday, we took this vote. We needed 60 out of 100 Senators to \nvote to start the debate--60 out of 100. When the final count was in, \nall the Democrats voted for it, six or seven Republicans joined us, and \nwe were still about nine votes short of what we needed. The motion to \nproceed failed.\n  At that point, we couldn't even debate the most serious issue facing \nfamilies and businesses across America. That is unfortunate. All we \nneeded were nine more Republicans to join us to start the debate. That \nis all we wanted to do--start the debate. Maybe we would have agreed on \nsomething. Wouldn't that be newsworthy.\n  But as it stands, we had two votes on Tuesday, we tried to proceed to \nbills, and in both instances, the Republican minority said: No, we \ndon't want to debate anything on the floor of the Senate this week. And \nthat is exactly what we have done. We have debated nothing.\n  If Members of the Senate were paid for the votes they cast, this \nSenate this week has not earned a minimum wage. I don't know how we can \ncontinue to do this in what is euphemistically called the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. Mr. President, do you know what the problem \nwas? One of the provisions in our bill angered the Republicans. We \nsuggested that the oil companies, if they are going to charge these \noutrageous amounts for their products, should be subject to a higher \ntax for windfall profits. I support that. I think it is the right thing \nto do, to discourage the profit taking that is going on. Many \nRepublicans oppose it, and I don't question their motives on it. Isn't \nit worth debating? Isn't it worth a vote? At the end of the day \nsomebody wins and somebody loses. That is what happens on the floor of \nthe Senate. But on the Republican side, they stopped us from even going \nto that debate over the oil companies.\n  Surely, they must hear from their voters at home how bad the \nsituation is. I know they hear from the oil company lobbyists who are \nroaming these hallways that they need to be protected.\n  Let's take a look and see how the oil companies have been doing. Not \nbad. Starting in 2001 when President Bush arrived on the scene, this is \nan indication of the profits of the oil companies. Profits of the oil \ncompanies under this administration have gone up 400 percent.\n  Some of the numbers are startling. In 2006, profits reported by \nExxonMobil were $39.5 billion, the largest recorded profit in U.S. \nhistory. Listen to that. Not the largest recorded profit by an oil \ncompany; the largest reported profit by any business in the history of \nthe United States of America.\n  Come 2007, ExxonMobil broke its own record. Profits went up to $40.6 \nbillion; the annual salary for their CEO, $21.7 million. A retirement \npackage for ExxonMobil's previous CEO--job well done--no gold watch for \nthis man, a gold mine, $400 million as his farewell gift. What a great \nparty that must have been to say thanks for all the good work you have \ndone for ExxonMobil. Here is $400 million. Have a nice day.\n  People across America are not having a nice day. When they pull into \nan Exxon station, when they fill up their\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\ngas tank, it is a bad day, it is a tough day for a lot of American \nfamilies.\n  The total combined net profits of the big five oil companies under \nthis administration are $556 billion. How much money did they invest \nback into more oil wells, more production? About an 80-percent increase \nin their capital investment, a 300-percent increase in the cash they \nheld back to buy back stock and improve their profitability--not \nimprove their productivity, their profitability.\n  Investments in alternative fuels by these big five oil companies? \nNegligible. That is the reality.\n  I think that is worth a debate, don't you? Isn't that what the Senate \nis supposed to be about? We come in and say it is time for this to end, \nit is time for Americans to stop being taken to the cleaners by the oil \ncompanies, and it is time for them to pay higher taxes to discourage \nthem from profit taking. I support that position. Others oppose it.\n  On Tuesday, the Republicans said: No, there will be no debate. And \nthat is the end of the story, at least for this week. We will go home \nand the voters will ask the same question: What did the Senate do about \noil prices, gas prices this week? And the honest answer is nothing.\n  This is not the first time we faced this filibuster. The Republican \nfilibusters so far in this 2-year session, 75 Republican filibusters \nand still counting--75. To put it in perspective, a filibuster is when \nyou delay or stop debate on an issue, delay or stop a bill, an \namendment, a nomination. It is your right in the Senate to do that. But \npeople were careful not to abuse it in the past.\n  In the history of the Senate, the largest number of filibusters in \nany 2-year period of time was 57. So far in this session, with another \n6 or 7 months to go, the Republicans have initiated 75 filibusters, 75 \nattempts to stop progress in the Senate, to stop debate in the Senate, \nto stop us from moving forward on bills related to everything under the \nSun. They even went so far as to filibuster a technical corrections \nbill. These are the bills that go in and take a hard look and see, oh, \nwe forgot the punctuation or there is a reference that needs to be \nchanged slightly. It is the kind of housekeeping you do when you have \nhuge pieces of legislation, where even though staff works hard and the \nMembers work hard, they miss something. So the technical corrections \nbill came up, we thought this would be easy, so let's get this over \nwith, but it took a week because we faced a filibuster on it. They \nwanted to filibuster a technical corrections bill. That doesn't take us \nto where we need to go as a nation.\n\n  We at least owe the American people a healthy, spirited, fair, and \nopen debate on the issue when it comes to this energy crisis. We can't \nget it in this Senate. We have been stopped. A 51-to-49 Senate does not \nallow us to come up with the 60 votes we need to move the debate \nforward. Well, the final vote will be in the hands of the voters of \nAmerica on November 4. They will decide whether they want change in \nthis town and change in this Chamber; whether they want to elect some \npeople who will come, roll up their sleeves, and get down to work.\n  We have a lot of things to do in this country--an energy crisis, \nglobal warming, carbon pollution, a health care crisis, two wars, a \nlooming recession, and the bankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security. \nWe don't need more filibusters. We need more work right here in the \nSenate. I hope we can return to that after the next election, or maybe, \nif there is a miracle, even next week, if the minority party decides \nthat is what will happen.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, we are debating a motion to proceed, once again, to a \nbipartisan bill to help Medicare. It has the support of AARP, the \nAmerican Medical Association, and lots of others. It picks up where we \nleft off in December, when we passed a bill that was a short-term fix. \nWe bought 6 months then, and we are back again.\n  The bill we are considering prevents physicians from facing a 10.6-\npercent cut in Medicare payments on July 1, and gives them a 1.1-\npercent payment increase for 2009. The physicians who work under \nMedicare will also receive a 2-percent bonus, if they participate in a \nprogram to reduce the number of errors and improve the quality of their \nservice, called the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative. It is a \nresponsible way to avoid a severe cut in payments to physicians and to \nensure payments are adequate for the next 18 months.\n  As important as it is to ensure that our physicians are paid \nadequately for the good work they do for millions of Americans--some 40 \nmillion Americans covered by Medicare--we didn't want this bill to just \nbe a doctor fix. The bill contains a lot of changes in Medicare that \nwill help beneficiaries.\n  The Medicare Savings Programs provide financial assistance to low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries who can't afford Medicare's premiums, \ncopayments, and deductibles. Many low-income beneficiaries are excluded \nfrom this assistance because they have accumulated modest savings. \nThese are retired people, by and large.\n  Today, if you have assets of more than $4,000, $6,000 for couples, \nyou can't qualify for Medicare Savings Programs. We haven't changed \nthat number for almost 20 years--$4,000. Under the bill before us, the \nasset limit will roughly double, providing real assistance to those who \ndon't have much money and still need Medicare.\n  This bill, which the chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman \nBaucus, brings to us, also makes an important move toward mental health \nparity. It is hard to imagine it has been more than 5 years, almost 6 \nyears since Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash. What a great \nguy. What a great Senator. His heart was there for so many issues but \nespecially when it came to mental health issues because his family was \ntouched by this challenge. Paul Wellstone used to ask: Why don't we \ntreat mental illness like an illness, instead of a curse? Why don't we \ntreat mental illness like a physical illness when it comes to health \ninsurance? He worked on us and worked on the issue and Senator \nDomenici, a Republican from New Mexico, joined him to make it a \nbipartisan effort.\n  I am sorry to say that some 6 years later, we haven't passed that \nWellstone-Domenici bill. Senator Kennedy was working on it before he \nhad his problems. I hope we can return to it. This bill takes a modest \nstep forward in that debate.\n  Over the years, our understanding of mental health and the ways to \ntreat it have grown, but Medicare continues to discriminate against \nservices for those who are mentally ill by imposing a 50-percent cost-\nsharing requirement compared to 20 percent for most other services. \nThis bill phases out that higher copayment over 6 years. It is a step \nin the right direction.\n  We have made some progress in recent years, adding preventive health \nservices to Medicare, such as screenings for heart disease, diabetes, \nand cancer, but it literally requires an act of Congress to add a new \npreventive benefit. The Baucus bill will make it easier to add \npreventive services to Medicare. It would create a process for the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to add them, if recommended by \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n  We also address market abuses in this bill. There is a program called \nMedicare Advantage. Private health insurance companies love it. You \nknow why. They make a bundle off these programs. They sell them to \nseniors, and they charge more than 12 percent over basic Medicare \npremiums. Frankly, I happen to believe they do not show the results for \ntheir effort, and they are involved in some marketing practices which \nwe have to try our best to curb.\n  Seniors are vulnerable. You know as well as I do that many people who \nreach their elderly years don't have someone at hand to give them good \nadvice, and many times, frankly, they sign up for things they \nshouldn't. This bill addresses disturbing reports of abusive and \nfraudulent sales-and-marketing practices by Medicare Advantage plans \nand Medicare drug plans. Medicare beneficiaries have been enrolling in \nprivate plans they didn't understand, and many of them have faced \noutright fraud and exploitation by these Medicare Advantage companies. \nThis bill will rein that in.\n  Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a man I respect and like, is going to \noffer an alternative to our bill, which I have described, but it \ndoesn't provide assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. It \ndoesn't deal with mental health parity, and it doesn't ease the process \nof adding preventive services.\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\n  There are many other provisions in this bill. It has been long \noverdue, and a lot of people have asked us to take up this bill because \nMedicare is so important at a time when people are losing their health \ninsurance coverage. For the seniors and disabled who count on Medicare, \nthis bill is important. But we need 60 votes. I hope we will get 60 \nvotes. I hope we don't face another filibuster on this critically \nimportant bill.\n  This is something that should pass. This bill is balanced, it \nprovides needed improvements to Medicare, but it is responsible. We \nfully offset any cost to the Treasury, primarily by reducing \noverpayments in the private Medicare Advantage plans, which are paid 13 \npercent--I said 12 percent earlier, but it is 13 percent--more than it \nwould cost to cover someone in traditional Medicare.\n  I think it is responsible. Rather than adding new costs to Medicare \nand to the deficit, we pay for it. Pay as you go. In the old days, that \nused to be called being a fiscal conservative. The other side of the \naisle used to be very proud to say they were fiscally conservative. \nNow, ironically, the table is turned. In fact, it is turned upside \ndown. The Democrats are calling for fiscal conservatism--pay as you go, \ndon't add to the deficit, be responsible--and the Republicans--some--\nare saying no. I hope they do not prevail. I hope we can prevail with a \npaid-for bill.\n  It is a bipartisan bill. Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, and Smith have \njoined Senator Baucus. I am going to support it, and I hope all my \ncolleagues do when it comes up for a vote later this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the Baucus Medicare bill, and there is reason to oppose at \nthis time.\n  I will keep my comments brief, but I wish to make one point perfectly \nclear. I have said, time and time again, I am willing to work with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to get a bipartisan Medicare \nbill through the Senate. I have always prided myself on being someone \nwho is fair, honest, and who wants to get the job done. Unfortunately, \nothers in this body don't seem to want to get the job done, and that \ndisappoints me more than most of you will ever know.\n  My biggest frustration is we are not that far apart. Both sides wish \nto restore physician Medicare payments so doctors are not cut by 10 \npercent on July 1. We also agree we need to implement the provisions on \ne-prescribing, electronic health records--where my home State of Utah \nis the leader--and value-based purchasing for Medicare providers and \nbeneficiaries. We both believe a strong, robust rural health care \npackage is necessary and, therefore, should be included in the Medicare \npackage. Both the Democratic and Republican Medicare bills include \nmarketing reforms for Medicare Advantage plans in order to ensure \nbeneficiaries are treated with respect and are given truthful and \nhelpful information so they may choose the Medicare Advantage plan that \nbest suits their personal needs. Medicare Advantage has worked \namazingly well. Democrats want to take the ``pay for'' out of the \nMedicare Advantage plans, and 90 percent of the people in this country \nwho are on Medicare Advantage want to continue on it because they \nbelieve they are better treated. They are, as a matter of fact. It is a \nsystem that works. Why change it?\n  We include provisions that would allow both hospital-based renal \ndialysis centers and skilled nursing facilities to be sites for \ntelehealth services. As a strong supporter of telehealth services, I am \nvery supportive of this provision, and both bills have it in.\n  Finally, both bills extend the Special Diabetes Program for 2 more \nyears. This program is very important to me. So as you can see, we \nagree on a lot. Unfortunately, the two outstanding issues, in my \nopinion, are Medicare beneficiary protections and offsets.\n  The Baucus Medicare provisions include provisions that would increase \nMedicare beneficiary protections in the Medicare Program. It would \nincrease the low-income subsidies for beneficiaries, extend the \navailability of the ``Welcome to Medicare'' physical examination from 6 \nmonths to 1 year.\n  I wish to make it clear our side could support these beneficiary \nchanges, but we are very concerned about the impact these changes would \nhave on long-term entitlement spending. The prices are going to \ncontinue to ramp up all the time, and our friends on the other side \ndon't ever seem to worry about that. With 76 million baby boomers \nretiring over the next three decades, the Medicare Program is already \nheaded for serious fiscal disaster. So we need to be thoughtful about \nthese provisions and not just do what our colleagues on the other side \nwant to do.\n  Therefore, we believe it makes sense to means test the Medicare Part \nD beneficiary premiums for higher income beneficiaries. Although my \nfriends on the other side are constantly arguing that the rich don't \npay their fair share, unfortunately, when we suggested this, colleagues \non the other side of the aisle--and, in fairness, some on our side as \nwell--objected to means testing Part D premiums. I do not understand \ntheir objections.\n  We already means test Medicare Part B premiums, and that had \nbipartisan support. Making that change would not only have wealthier \nbeneficiaries shouldering a greater share of their Part D premiums, it \ncould also pay for some of the beneficiary protections included in the \nBaucus Medicare bill.\n\n  It is greatly disappointing to me that our friends on the other side \nof the aisle are not willing to accept this offset. In fact, we have \nbeen told pointblank that they cannot support increasing Part D \npremiums for rich Medicare beneficiaries in order to provide more \nassistance and benefits to lower income seniors. That is despite the \nfact that they have cut some very serious programs for the poor in \norder to find offsets for some of the things they want to do. I am \ngoing to say it again. I do not understand it. Especially since both \nsides supported means-tested Medicare Part B premiums.\n  Hopefully, we will be able to change their minds when we begin our \nwork to improve the Medicare Program so it will be more efficient for \nboth beneficiaries and providers. That is the reason why we should vote \nagainst cloture, so our friends on the other side have to come together \nwith us to have a better bill, and I believe we can.\n  The second major issue concerns the offset used in the Baucus bill to \npay for its provisions. The White House has told us, time and time \nagain, the President will only be able to accept very minimal \nreductions to the Medicare Advantage Program. Time and time again he \nhas said that. Otherwise, he is going to veto the bill.\n  That is why Senator Grassley and I have insisted the White House be \nincluded in the Senate Medicare negotiations. We do not want to send a \nMedicare bill to the White House that is going to be vetoed and, \ntherefore, put the physicians' Medicare payments in jeopardy. It is \nanother reason to vote against cloture, so we don't go through the \ncharade we will have to go through if we don't.\n  But that is exactly what is going to happen if the Baucus Medicare \ngets cloture today. It will probably pass the Senate and then be \nconsidered by the House of Representatives. The House will make changes \nto the bill, too, that will probably not be acceptable to the White \nHouse. Then the Senate will have to consider the Medicare bill with the \nHouse's changes before it is sent to the White House for a certain \nveto. It is ridiculous. Why do they have to do a partisan bill? Why not \nwork with us, since we want to work with them?\n  We will not have the votes to override the President's veto of the \nMedicare bill, so we will be back to square one and we will have wasted \na lot of time and maybe even have done some very bad damage.\n  I believe the Grassley Medicare legislation, which I strongly \nsupport, would not suffer the same fate as the Baucus legislation. That \nis why I believe this bill should be considered by the Senate instead \nof the Baucus Medicare bill. We are so close together on almost all \nthese provisions, except for these few I have mentioned. The Grassley \nbill is a better bill. The President will sign it into law.\n\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight the major differences \nbetween the Grassley Medicare bill and the Baucus Medicare legislation.\n  On this chart, first, as you can see the Grassley Medicare bill \nencourages e-prescribing sooner rather than later.\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nThe Grassley bill requires physicians to e-prescribe by 2010, while the \nBaucus bill delays mandatory e-prescribing until 2011.\n  In addition, the Grassley Medicare bill repeals the Deficit Reduction \nAct provision on the transfer of ownership of oxygen equipment to \nMedicare beneficiaries. The Baucus bill cuts Medicare payments for \noxygen and oxygen equipment. It is somewhat shocking to me, but that is \nwhat they do.\n  On durable medical equipment for competitive bidding, the Grassley \nbill includes a sense of the Senate to delay competitive bidding for \ndurable medical equipment for 18 months. The Baucus Medicare proposal \nas filed does not even address competitive bidding.\n  Let's go to chart No. 2.\n  The Grassley bill also has provisions on hospital value-based \npurchasing. The Baucus Medicare bill does not include a similar \nprovision. You would think we would want to go to hospital value-based \npurchasing.\n  The Baucus Medicare bill reduces the Medicare reimbursement rates for \npower wheelchairs, of all things. The Grassley Medicare bill does not \ncut Medicare payments for power wheelchairs. You would think we could \nget together on that.\n  The Grassley Medicare bill provides continued relief for hospitals \nwith high numbers of undocumented individuals. The Baucus bill does not \ninclude a similar provision. Again, as anybody can plainly see, the \nGrassley bill is a better option.\n  I am going to conclude with one very valid and important point. My \ncolleagues need to vote against cloture today so we can begin work on a \nbipartisan bill that will be signed by the President. We do not need to \nbe wasting our time going back and forth on a bill that does not have a \nchance of becoming law. In fact, we need to roll up our sleeves and get \nto work immediately so we can get this legislation to the White House \nbefore the July 1 deadline. Otherwise, our Medicare beneficiaries and \ndoctors participating in the Medicare Program will lose. But you know \nwho the biggest loser will be in this process. That is the Senate, \nbecause we have failed to do our job, therefore letting down both \nMedicare beneficiaries and Medicare providers.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture to avoid this terrible \nsituation and to take the more appropriate, better designed, and more \ncompassionate bill. Frankly, that is what our bill is. I just hope our \ncolleagues will see this and vote against cloture.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Habeas Corpus\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly here to call \nto the attention of all Senators the very important decision that was \njust handed down this morning by the Supreme Court regarding the \nprisoners who are detained in Guantanamo.\n  The Supreme Court has once again rejected the administration's \napproach in disregarding basic due process rights and our Nation's \nlongstanding commitment to the rule of law. The Court, in a decision \nwritten by Justice Kennedy, held that individuals detained at \nGuantanamo have a constitutional right to challenge their prolonged \ndetention in civilian courts.\n  Furthermore, the Supreme Court found that the Military Commissions \nAct of 2006 amounted to an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of \nhabeas corpus. The Court today reiterated that the Great Writ, the writ \nof habeas corpus, remains as a fundamental protector of individual \nliberty and as a safeguard against arbitrary detention by the \nGovernment. This right, which is enshrined in our Constitution, simply \nallows for an independent and meaningful review of a person's \nconfinement by the Government.\n  Nothing in today's decision requires that the Government release the \nprisoners held at Guantanamo. Many of those prisoners have been held \nthere for over 6 years without access to meaningful judicial review. \nThe decision simply allows these individuals to ask a court whether \ntheir continued confinement is in accordance with our Constitution.\n  The President has asserted extraordinary authority to indefinitely \nimprison anyone he designates as a so-called enemy combatant--that \nwould include U.S. citizens, according to the administration's legal \nposition--and that that detention could continue without any judicial \nreview.\n  It is time that we change course and recognize that acting in a \nmanner consistent with our Constitution and with our core American \nvalues is not a sign of weakness.\n  It is a sign of our strength and a sign of who we are as a people. I \nam very pleased that our highest Court has reaffirmed our Nation's \nrespect for the rule of law and sent a clear message that the \nConstitution remains strong.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was just visiting with my colleague from \nNew Mexico. I was unaware of the Supreme Court decision this morning. \nBut the decision by which they have overturned some legislation that \nretracted the right of habeas corpus for those who might be suspected \nof some sort of illegal activity and so on in this country, that \ndecision by the Supreme Court is a very important decision.\n  I could not believe when the Senate passed a piece of legislation \nsaying that someone who is apprehended or detained in this country \nwould not have the right of habeas corpus. That is a different kind of \ncountry than I know. There are countries in this world where they can \npick you up right off the streets and say: Do you have papers? Even if \nyou have papers they can throw you in jail, and you have no right to \nanything, including filing a writ to say: A government cannot hold me. \nA government must prove there is reason to hold me.\n  That is unbelievable that this Congress it--not with my vote. But I \ncommend the Supreme Court. I haven't had much opportunity to do that \nrecently, I must say. But their ruling this morning gives me some hope.\n  Mr. President, we have a cloture vote at 3 o'clock this afternoon. I \nwanted to mention the important subject of the cloture vote is dealing \nwith some Medicare changes.\n  Medicare is an unbelievably important program. Prior to Medicare, not \nmany people look back and remember this because most of us have lived \nour lives with Medicare in existence. Before Medicare, one-half of the \nAmerican senior citizens had no health insurance at all. Does anybody \nthink that an insurance company says: You know what. We have a new \nbusiness plan. Our plan is we want to find people who are old and \nprovide health insurance for them. That is not the way a business plan \nworks. If you are selling insurance, you like to find somebody young \nand healthy.\n  As a result, if you go back to the 1950s, early 1960s, you will find \nthat one-half of senior citizens of this country had no health \ncoverage. Now, it is a very small percentage that have no health \ncoverage. The vast majority of American senior citizens are covered by \nMedicare. It is a good program.\n  I grew up in a little town of 300 people. We had a guy named Doc \nHill, Dr. Simon W. Hill. He came into town and he stayed until he died. \nHe practiced medicine. We did not have a Medicare Program, but he tried \nto give everybody whatever health care they needed. He tried the best \nhe could. We had no lawyer in our town, so he was never sued. He pulled \nthe tooth of my neighbor. He was not a dentist, but he was a doctor. \nThe neighbor had a terrible toothache, we were 50 miles from the \nnearest dentist, so Doc Hill pulled his tooth. It turns out he pulled \nthe wrong tooth. But, you know, the fact is, Doc Hill did the best he \ncould. He practiced medicine in my hometown. I think he delivered close \nto 2,000 babies decade after decade after decade. He ran his own \nMedicare and Medicaid Program. If you did not have any money, you got \nhealth care to the best he could give it.\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\nIf you had money, he would charge you an arm and a leg. If you had 24 \nfryer chickens, he would take that; maybe a quarter beef, maybe half of \na hog--whatever it was, he ran a program in a little town.\n  Well, that is all gone. That does not exist anymore. The fact is, we \nnow have a Medicare Program that serves America's senior citizens with \nhealth care and says to them: If you get sick, here is a program that \nis to provide some help to you.\n  Now, my colleague, Senator Baucus, and the Finance Committee have \nbrought a piece of legislation to the Senate floor, and we have to have \na cloture vote on it this afternoon because the other side is \nobjecting. My hope is that we will have sufficient votes this afternoon \nto advance this bill.\n  It makes some changes in Medicare that need to be made because we are \nbumping up against a deadline at the end of this month. Among other \nthings, it reauthorizes the special diabetes program. That is something \nin which Senator Domenici from New Mexico and I have been involved. We \nhave introduced some reauthorization legislation here.\n  The diabetes issue is a scourge in this country. I chair the Indian \nAffairs Committee in the Senate, and the fact is, we have some areas on \nIndian reservations in this country where 40 or 50 percent of the adult \npopulation are affected by diabetes. Go there and go to their dialysis \nunits and see all of them sitting hooked up to dialysis units. Then see \nhow many have lost their legs through amputation. See how many of them \nhave early heart disease as a result of their diabetes. This piece of \nlegislation by Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee begins to \naddress some of those issues.\n  It also makes reforms to what is called the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. Now, some of my colleagues have come to the floor and said, \nwell, this bill cuts Medicare. That is total rubbish. This does not cut \nMedicare. It takes one portion of Medicare, called the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, which pays more for healthcare as opposed \ntraditional Medicare.\n  This is one of those little pilot programs that some in this Chamber \nwanted, so they seeded it with extra funding. Well, the extra funding \nhas been a waste of money, a tragic waste of money. And this gets some \nof the waste and abuse out of it. If my colleagues are upset about \ngetting rid of waste and abuse, I am sorry. Maybe they will not sleep \nvery well if we pass this bill. But the fact is, when we see waste and \nabuse, we ought to go after that. That is what the Finance Committee \nand Senator Baucus have done.\n\n  They have used that funding they have achieved by getting rid of some \nwaste and abuse in the Medicare Advantage Program. They have used that \nfunding to address some other urgent issues.\n  If we do not do anything by the end of this month, we will see a 10-\npercent cut to physician payments. Well, physicians in my State are \nalready at the bottom of the wage index on physician payments. And the \nfact is, a 10-percent cut would be devastating to senior citizens in my \nstate who rely on Medicare. It seems to me we should not be doing \nthings that will predict a degradation of health care. We should not be \ndoing those things.\n  The Finance bill and Senator Baucus have brought a piece of \nlegislation to the floor that avoids that 10-percent payment cut and \nestablishes a 1.1-percent increase instead through fiscal year 2009.\n  It is the right thing to do. Now, if you decide you do not want to \nvote for cloture, to even allow this to proceed, then you are saying: \nYou know what, just whack these programs. It does not matter what kind \nof health care exists in our States. It does not matter what happens to \nthe senior citizens.\n  If that is your view, you know, God bless you. But it is sure a far \ncry from my view. I think we have responsibilities to make Medicare \nwork, to provide decent funds for the providers so that our senior \ncitizens have health care that all of us can be proud of.\n  There are many other features in this piece of legislation that are \nimportant. It talks about prompt payment to Main Street pharmacies. We \nhave drugstores and pharmacists on the Main Streets across this country \nthat are not getting the kind of prompt payment they should get. And \nsome of them are threatened with the closure of their business because \nwe have a system that is not reimbursing them as it should.\n  It improves access to telehealth, which is very important. This is a \nrather new form of delivery of health care, and Medicare is a part of \nit. It works. I have been in clinics, and I have seen the delivery of \nvery sophisticated CAT scans and the delivery of x rays to a \nradiologist 150 miles away to get a reading and to be sent back to that \nrural clinic.\n  All of that makes a lot of sense. It gives us access to some of the \nbest in the country through telemedicine. Then, in addition, the \ntelemental health part of that is an opportunity for psychologists and \npsychiatrists to be engaged in telemental health, particularly on \nIndian reservations and elsewhere, where we have some of the highest \nrates of suicide any place in the country. Accessing telemental health \nservices can be very important.\n  On the northern Great Plains--I know the Presiding Officer is from \nMontana. In Montana, North Dakota, on the northern Great Plains, the \nrate of suicide among Indian youth--I am talking about Indian teens--is \nnot double, triple, or quadruple the rate across the country, it is 10 \ntimes the national rate. That is why telemental health is so important \nfor all elements of our population, but also especially in Medicare for \nsenior citizens. We are doing it in other areas. Extending it to \nMedicare makes a great deal of sense.\n  The improvement of the quality of health care in Medicare, the \nprevention of the 10 percent in payment cuts to physicians, the \ndiabetes prevention program, the elimination of the wasteful payments \nto Medicare Advantage, are just a few of the examples of why we must \nexpect our colleagues will vote for cloture at 3 o'clock this \nafternoon. This is the right vote. It is an important vote.\n  Now, we have been through--yesterday it was energy, with gas at $4 a \ngallon, and oil at somewhere around $130, $140 a barrel, the minority \ndecided to embrace once again their just-say-no policy on everything. \nIt does not matter what it is, just say no.\n  It reminds me of an old codger in his eighties who was once asked by \na news reporter who said: Well, you have been around a long time. You \nmust have seen a lot of changes in your life.\n  He said: Yeah, I have been against all of them.\n  We have people on the floor of the Senate who have decided they are \nagainst everything--just say no. My hope is after just saying no \nyesterday to energy issues at a time when gas is $4 a gallon, it is \nunbelievable to me they would just say no to begin addressing that, but \nthey did.\n  My hope is that today, on behalf of health care for senior citizens, \nthey would finally decide to just say yes. If they will do that at 3 \no'clock, we will pass this cloture petition and we will take what the \nFinance Committee and Senator Baucus have offered in the spirit of \nimproving Medicare and saying to senior citizens and saying to their \nhealth care providers: We are going to do the right thing.\n  There is a time urgency. By the end of June we have to solve this \nmatter. And I hope my colleagues will be listening and understand that \nwe need this cloture petition to prevail at 3 o'clock this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I so appreciate the Senator from North Dakota and his \ncomments about the just-say-no philosophy around here. I have been in \nthis institution only 15 months. I have seen his leadership on a whole \nhost of issues, and I have also seen the disappointment that it is one \nfilibuster after another--74, 75 filibusters, more than anytime in \nSenate history--on such commonsense legislation as the Energy bill \nyesterday and the Medicare bill today.\n  I am happy to see that Senator Baucus and Senator Reid have brought \nthe Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act to the Senate \nfloor today. It is crucial not just immediately for physicians and \nhospitals, not just immediately for patients, most importantly, but it \nis also crucial to the future of Medicare.\n  The bill not only prevents a 10.6-percent cut to payments for \nphysicians\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\nand other health care professionals, it gives these providers a small \npayment increase. The cost of providing health care has increased; \npayments to health care professionals should increase too.\n  Our history with Medicaid should teach us about the importance of \npreserving Medicare by keeping payment rates viable for providers. \nInadequate Medicaid payment rates have compromised access to dentists \nand other health professionals. I visited with the dental unit at \nChildren's Hospital in Columbus and talked to dentists all over the \nState, talked to hygienists and others. It is pretty clear that we do \nnot have enough dental care, we do not have adequate dental care, \nespecially for low-income young patients. The reason is we do not have \nadequate reimbursement for dentists to provide Medicaid dental care, \nparticularly for those children. We need to fix that Medicaid problem, \nnot recreate that same problem in Medicare.\n  This bill is about so much more than provider payment, as Senator \nDorgan said. It contains important measures to improve Medicare for \nbeneficiaries. It increases subsidies for low-income patients. It \ninvests in preventative health care. It reduces out-of-pocket costs for \nmental health treatment.\n  Senator Durbin spoke of Senator Wellstone's work and Senator \nDomenici's work on mental health treatment; to treat it like a disease \nnot a stigma, and how important that is. This makes some downpayment on \nthat solution.\n  This bill eliminates late enrollment penalties for Part D and \nmodernizes Medigap policies. It bolsters rural health care, something I \nhave discussed in my roundtables around Ohio. I have done some 90-plus \nroundtables in 65 counties and seen how inadequate rural health care is \nin rural areas of my State, as it is in the Presiding officer's State \nof Montana. The bill authorizes a special diabetes program.\n  This morning in my every-Thursday-morning coffee, which I have for \nOhio residents in Washington, I met with Ohioans from Cincinnati, \nColumbus, Toledo, and Cleveland. Ohio's children are suffering from \ntype 1 diabetes. They told devastating stories. One man told about his \nteenage daughter going blind. Another told me that by the time a young \nchild with diabetes turns 18, she will have endured more than 30,000 \nshots.\n  Diabetes is one of the most prevalent and pressing health threats we \nface as a nation. The cost to the health care system is more than any \nother single disease. Reauthorizing the cost-effective Medicare \ndiabetes program serves patients and taxpayers.\n  The bill has other crucial provisions. It exempts the value of life \ninsurance from counting against seniors attempting to qualify for the \nlow-income subsidy in Part D. Constituents have written to me telling \nme they are afraid of saving for the future, of all things, because \nthey might lose their eligibility for subsidized drugs. What kind of \nsystem is that? This bill will help fix that.\n  One of the most common stories I have heard in my 90-plus \nroundtables, where I convene meetings of 15, 20, 25 people and ask them \nquestions for an hour and a half, 2 hours, and we talk about their \nhopes, dreams, and problems, and where we, as a Senate, might be able \nto work with them and make their lives better, one of the most common \nstories I hear from Defiance and Gallipolis, from Middletown and \nAshtabula, whether I am meeting with providers or patients, is about \nMedicare. My office receives thousands of constituent letters about \nMedicare. I recently heard from an infectious disease doctor in Lima, \nwho explained how he is squeezed by current Medicare rates. He said:\n\n       As health care costs have escalated and reimbursement has \n     fallen, we have had to make some hard decisions.\n\n  He told me he has had to let go of employees, cut office hours, and \nthat the financial stress is at the breaking point. He said:\n\n       Last year, a doctor would call me [about a patient] with an \n     infected abscess. Commonly, I had the patient sent to my \n     office, lance the boil, pack the wound, and give IV \n     antibiotics daily in my office until transitioned to pills. \n     The patient was never admitted to the hospital.\n\n  Since his office is less and less able to provide outpatient \nservices--remember, I said he had laid people off--similar patients are \nnow admitted to the hospital. What happens?\n  ``The admission day alone,'' he says, ``costs more than the entire \ncourse of therapy in my office.''\n  It is obvious how inefficient and expensive this is. We need to fix \nthe current payment system, and we will. But we should not grossly \nunderpay those professionals while we work on a better system. Until \nthat day, we should pass this bill. Medicare is one of the great \naccomplishments of our Government and of our country. Senators Dorgan \nand Durbin both talked about in 1965, half of America's seniors didn't \nhave any health insurance. Today that number is less than 1 percent. \nBecause Medicare is one of the great accomplishments of our Government \nand our country, we have to preserve it. This bill takes major strides \nto do so.\n  In addition to voting yes at 3 o'clock on cloture, there has been \nanother piece of related legislation I want to speak on for a moment. \nIt is the alternative bill offered by Senator Grassley, who I think is \none of the single best legislators in this body. The bill he wrote as \nan alternative to our bill, to the Baucus legislation, perpetuates a \nshameful politically motivated subsidy program that overpays private \ninsurance health maintenance organizations to the tune of $10 billion a \nyear. What this does is it overpays private insurance companies, \nundercutting fee-for-service traditional Medicare, causing taxpayers--\nrequiring taxpayers--to give huge, frankly, unearned dollars to these \ninsurance companies as they try to privatize Medicare. The Baucus bill \nredirects these taxpayer-funded windfall payments from HMOs to concrete \nimprovements in the Medicare Program.\n  In the beginning of my speech, the first 6 or 7 minutes, I talked \nabout improvements we are making in the Medicare Program. We are able \nto do so by taking money away from the private for-profit Medicare HMOs \nthat have reaped a windfall in the last 10 years as this Congress, \nparticularly the Republican House and Senate for most of the last \ndecade, shoveled more and more public dollars into these private \ninsurance programs, these private HMOs, and private HMO executives have \nhad grossly inflated salaries and benefits and retirements, all of \nthat. Ending those gratuitous overpayments to HMOs should not be an \noption for this Congress; it should be an imperative that we finally do \nthat.\n  Taxpayers can't afford to coddle private, for-profit health \nmaintenance organizations, and we can't continue to do it. I encourage \nmy colleagues to vote for the very crucial Baucus Medicare legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, you don't have to be an expert in health \ncare policy to know that our health care system is in need of reform. \nToday we spend $2 trillion on health care or almost $7,500 per person. \nIn 10 years, national health care spending is expected to reach $4.3 \ntrillion. That is more than double or $13,000 per person, which would \ncomprise almost 20 percent of our gross domestic product. Clearly, this \nrate of growth is unsustainable. While we should be enacting \nlegislation to address this health care crisis, Congress is once again \nbogged down in debate over how to prevent physician payment cuts from \ngoing into effect. Meanwhile, the sustainable growth rate, the SGR, \nwhich is the formula for these Medicare payments to physicians, has \nonly increased costs, decreased beneficiary access and quality of care, \nand discouraged future generations of physicians, especially in primary \ncare.\n  If Congress fails to act, Texas physicians will lose $860 million \nbetween July 2008 and December 2009. That is $860 million which is a \ncut of $18,000 per Texas physician. That figure balloons to $16.5 \nbillion by 2016, due to nearly a decade of scheduled cuts. It is great \nthat Members of Congress and outside coalitions are presenting health \ncare reform plans, but they are ignoring the fundamental problem. You \ncan have a great plan. You can have great coverage. But none of that is \nany good unless you have access to that coverage.\n  Physicians' reimbursement cuts have been looming over our heads for \nyears; in fact, since 1996 and the passage of the Balanced Budget Act. \nYet Congress continually decides to put off for tomorrow what \ndesperately needs to be done today. So every year Congress\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\ncuts segments of health care services, either rightly or wrongly, to \nprevent these cuts. I firmly believe--and physicians in my State firmly \nbelieve--that short-term fixes are not the solution. This last one was \na 6-month fix which will expire shortly. I don't know anyone else in \nthe private sector, whether they be a physician or a small business, \nwho can continually plan based on the vagaries of a 6-month fix, \nwithout knowing whether they will simply be put out of business or what \nthe Congress will come up with as a solution on a 6-month basis. We \nneed a longer term solution, in other words. We can't address greater \nhealth care costs until we fix the mess caused by the SGR or the \nsustainable growth rate formula for Medicare reimbursements.\n\n  Over 3 months ago, in anticipation of the looming physician payment \ncut set for July 1, I introduced legislation that addressed the issue \nat hand permanently. Even the proposal we will vote on at 3 is only \ngood for 18 months. I think we need a permanent solution. My \nlegislation is entitled Ensuring the Future Physician Workforce Act of \n2008. It provides positive reimbursement updates for providers. It \neliminates the ineffectual expenditure cap known as SGR, and it \nincreases incentives for physician data reporting. At the same time \nthis bill facilitates the adoption of health information technology by \naddressing costs and legislative barriers. It educates and empowers \nphysicians and beneficiaries in relation to Medicare spending and \nbenefits usage and studies ways to realign the way Medicare pays for \nhealth care.\n  My bill doesn't mandate whether physician payments should be based on \nutilization, performance, care, coordination, or any other particular \nmethodology. My bill does start to lay down a new path toward reform, \ninnovation, and restoration of the eroded physician-patient \nrelationship. It does say that providers and beneficiaries should not \nbe the ones to be punished by Congress's inaction.\n  Why Congress decided in 1996 to try to balance the budget on the \nbacks of health care providers is beyond me. Because beyond the \nchallenges that presents to the health care providers, it has \ndiminished access to health care. More and more physicians refuse to \ntake new Medicare patients, because the reimbursement rates are simply \nso low. In Travis County, where Austin, TX is located, there was a \nstory published in the Austin American Statesman that said only 18 \npercent of physicians in Travis County are accepting new Medicare \npatients. I would like to say that was an isolated incident, but it is \nnot.\n  This is a huge issue and deserves serious and thoughtful \ndeliberation. The last time the majority party held a hearing on \nphysician payment reform was almost 16 months ago, almost exactly a \nyear before I introduced Ensuring the Future Physician Workforce Act of \n2008. Yet there has been zero legislative activity, let alone \nintroduction of language addressing this critical issue from a long-\nterm perspective. Again, we have been stuck in the same old rut of \ncoming up with temporary fixes, including the 6-month fix that will \nexpire on July 1.\n  I am disappointed in Congress's inaction in this regard. I do believe \nthat Congress needs to do more than simply kick the can down the road \nfor another few months and put off a solution that we ought to be \nworking toward on a bipartisan basis and embracing today.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have missed a major \nopportunity to take positive steps forward. They presented a bill, \nunfortunately, on which we will vote at 3 o'clock, that bypassed the \ncommittee, ignored the importance of bipartisan input and contribution, \nand they are determined to have a vote on a bill that they know has no \nchance of becoming law. Because as we all know around here, no bill has \na chance of becoming law unless it is truly a bipartisan product. The \nrules and traditions of the Senate guarantee that. That is one of the \nthings that makes sure that when we vote on things, they have broad \nsupport, represent a consensus position, and that they are, in the view \nof the vast majority of Senators, in the best interest of the American \npeople. But when you try to force a bill that is strictly partisan, \nthat has very little bipartisan support, we know what will happen. That \nis what is going to happen this afternoon on this vote: It won't become \nlaw.\n  The American people were promised a different way of legislating by \nthe majority when they took power. But we have seen, unfortunately, \nthis sort of gamesmanship occur time and time again. I heard Senator \nSchumer, the Senator from New York, chairman of the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee, rail against obstruction of their \nlegislative agenda. But it is almost a sure thing, when all you do is \ntake a partisan position on legislation and you refuse, as the majority \nleader has done, to allow an amendment process, as he did last week on \nthe climate tax bill, and you deny full and fair debate, it is \nvirtually a guaranteed result of failure when you take that sort of \napproach to legislation. That is what is going to happen again this \nafternoon.\n  Because the chairman of the Finance Committee has chosen to take a \npartisan approach on this legislation, we have come up with an \nalternative that offers solutions to physicians, seniors, and \ntaxpayers. This alternative will provide doctors with a positive \nincrease in their reimbursement rates, extend critical programs, and \nreform payments to Medicare Advantage plans, and also implement many \nother necessary changes to the Medicare Program. This alternative \nlegislation includes provisions for e-prescribing, closely mirroring \nlegislation I cosponsored earlier this year.\n  We need to change our ways in the Senate. Rather than trying to check \noff a box saying, yes, we threw it up, a partisan effort we knew was \ngoing to fail, and now we can claim we were the champions of reform, \nwhile the ones who would not allow this partisan process to go forward \nare obstructing it, we need to get together and work in a bipartisan \nway to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries not only have the coverage \nthey need and deserve but also the access which is guaranteed by a fair \nrate of compensation for physicians.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                             Habeas Corpus\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while I was chairing a Judiciary Committee \nmeeting today, I received notice of the Supreme Court's ruling this \nmorning in Boumediene v. Bush. I normally do not come to the floor to \ntalk about Supreme Court rulings, whether I agree or disagree with \nthem, but this one is of fundamental importance to all Americans, and I \nwish to take just a moment.\n  We Americans know there is nothing more fundamental than the right of \nhabeas corpus--the right to challenge your detention by the Executive \nas unlawful. It was part of our reason for fighting a revolution. It is \nenshrined in our Constitution. We have preserved it through two world \nwars. We cherish it as something that has set us apart from so many \nother countries around the world.\n  This administration has tried repeatedly to push the limits of \nExecutive power, including its effort to extinguish the Great Writ for \ncertain detainees. In three separate decisions, a conservative U.S. \nSupreme Court in recent years has rejected this administration's \nerosion of fundamental rights. I applaud the Supreme Court for doing \nthat because these protections set the United States apart from those \nwho wish to harm us.\n  Today's decision repudiating the administration's efforts to curb \njudicial review of detainees echoes earlier court decisions that have \nsolidified our constitutional system of checks and balances.\n  The administration has rolled back essential rights that have long \nguided our Nation's conscience. The administration has acted as though \nthe President--and the President alone--can decide the rights of \nAmericans.\n  But the Great Writ has kept us strong as a nation from the time we \nfought a Revolution. We fought that Revolution to say that we will \nprotect our own rights and we will set up three branches of Government \nto do so, including an independent Federal judiciary.\n  Today's Supreme Court decision in Boumediene v. Bush is a stinging \nrebuke of the Bush administration's flawed detention policies. It is \nalso a vindication for those who have argued from the beginning that it \nwas unwise as well as unconstitutional for Congress, at the \nadministration's request,\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\nto try to override a core constitutional protection.\n  A majority of the Court has ruled that the constitutional right to \nhabeas corpus extends to territories, including Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, \nwhere the United States exercises de facto control. The Court further \nheld that the administration's detention procedures used at Guantanamo \nBay are a constitutionally inadequate substitute for habeas corpus \nrights. Therefore, the provisions of the Military Commissions Act that \nstripped away the habeas rights of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay are \nunconstitutional.\n  As a result, those detainees who have been determined to be \n``unlawful enemy combatants'' are entitled to seek habeas relief in \nFederal courts, just as they had been doing before Congress' ill-\nadvised decision to endorse the administration's detention policies \nthrough passage of the Military Commission Act in 2006. No detainee is \nset free as a result of this decision. Rather, detainees will simply be \nable to challenge their detention before a neutral, life-tenured judge.\n  The Court's 5-to-4 decision sustains the long held and bipartisan \nbelief that I and others have always maintained: Congress made a grave \nerror when it voted to strip habeas corpus rights in the run-up to the \n2006 mid-term elections, and leave in place hopelessly flawed \nprocedures to determine whether detainees could be held indefinitely \nwith no meaningful court review, merely by the President's decree.\n  I have said many times on the floor of this Senate that we are the \nconscience of the Nation. Certainly, part of our job is to uphold our \nConstitution. It is easy to uphold our Constitution when we see no \nthreats on the horizon. It is more difficult but even more important to \nuphold it when we do see threats on the horizon. So Congress, as I \nsaid, made a grave error in trying to diminish habeas corpus, and I am \ngratified that today's Supreme Court decision takes a significant step \nin reversing that action.\n  Mr. President, the Great Writ--the Great Writ of habeas corpus--\nprotects you and protects me. It protects all 300 million Americans. It \nprotects people who look to the United States to be a beacon of \nfreedom. I am grateful that the Supreme Court believes, as I do, that \nthis fundamental right must be preserved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the rising cost of \nenergy, at a time when Americans are suffering from gas prices that are \nseeing $4 a gallon and diesel fuel is higher than that. The price of \ndiesel fuel has gone up 65 percent from where it was a year ago. That \nimpacts farmers, it impacts small businesses. The Medicare bill is a \ncritical issue, but right now we need to address the impact the cost of \ngas and energy is having. It is having a devastating effect on folks as \nthey sit around the dining room table trying to figure out how to make \nends meet. It is getting tougher and tougher to find money for food and \nfuel. I wish to say up front that the principal culprit right here is \nour addiction and our dependence on foreign oil.\n  My folks in Minnesota--families, farmers, and businesses--can't \nafford these rising costs. They are talking about commodity prices \nrising. On the other hand, the cost of commodity prices is rising \nbecause of the cost of oil. The cost of energy, gas, and diesel on \nthose folks who are producing the food is having a devastating impact.\n  My State has one of the highest housing foreclosure rates in the \nNation. The State of Minnesota is always seen as being somehow outside \nthe economic woes that affect so many. The unemployment rate is going \nup, not down. Record fuel costs are the final straw for a lot of folks. \nIt should be the final straw for partisan bickering on energy that is \ngetting us nowhere and is letting the American people down.\n  Mr. President, 232 years ago yesterday, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, \nBenjamin Franklin, and other Founders were set to work by the \nContinental Congress on a document that set America on a new course, \njust as the American Army was retreating from the British to Lake \nChamplain.\n  The invasion we have today is the invasion of hundreds of billions of \ndollars of foreign oil. This year nearly a half a trillion dollars will \nbe sent overseas for energy we should be capable of producing at home. \nThis is America. We should have the technological ability, the \ncapacity, and the resources to end that addiction. The fact is we are \nbeing held hostage by a world oil market where much of the supply is \ncontrolled by thugs and tyrants such as Chavez and Ahmadinejad.\n  Just as the Founders, we have a choice. We can focus on our \ndifferences as Republicans and Democrats or we can work together to \nfight a common foe. Are our differences greater than those of the \ncolonists, most of whom had never been outside their home States? We \nknow that is not true.\n  Now is the time to write our own declaration of independence. Now is \nthe time to use every resource at our disposal to address this energy \ncrisis.\n  Now is the time for us to declare that American freedom, liberty, and \nsecurity are not going to be held hostage over a barrel of oil. That is \nwhat it is about. It is about being held hostage. We may in the future \nalways import foreign oil, but we are being held hostage by our \ndependency.\n  Our Nation's future depends on the decisions we make right now. The \ngood news is that we possess the resources to take our energy prices \nhead on. If we were, in fact, to make that commitment, we could stand \nup and say we are not being held hostage anymore. July 4 is just around \nthe corner. If we were to do that, I think it would have a dramatic \nimpact on speculation because they would know America is now \ncommitted--Democrats and Republicans--to doing the right thing. It is \nsimple: renewables, increased production, and redoubling of our clean \nenergy technologies efforts.\n  To make this happen, we not only have to transform how we do energy \nin this country, we have to transform how we do business in the Senate.\n  On Tuesday we had a contentious vote on an energy package that wasn't \na bipartisan product. I voted to go forward on the debate of that \npackage because I believe we must get going on a new energy bill. \nHowever, I think the only thing yesterday's process was set up to \ndeliver was finger pointing. We must sit down together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and find out what policies we can agree on and then send \nan energy bill to the President.\n  The energy bill proposed by the other side of the aisle includes many \nideas we have seen before. I am reminded of a quote by H.L. Mencken, \nwho wrote:\n\n       There is always a well-known solution to every human \n     problem--neat, plausible, and wrong.\n\n  I believe we need to stop rehashing ideas that don't get to the heart \nof the problem and begin an energy revolution by dramatically \nincreasing production of every energy resource at our disposal. I still \ndon't support drilling in ANWR. We have the opportunity, though, to do \ndeepwater exploration off the Outer Continental Shelf and tap into \nsubstantial resources. That is increased production. We had the worst \nnatural disaster in the history of this country, Hurricane Katrina, and \nthere wasn't a drop of oil spilled, so there shouldn't be an \nenvironmental issue there to increase production. We need to \ndramatically increase investment in renewable fuels. I support that. It \nis critical to my State. Energy efficiency, boost nuclear energy \nproduction, and take advantage of coal to liquids--coal to jet fuel.\n  This week I have been listening to my colleagues speak about energy. \nSome say what we need is more efficiency. The others say we need more \nrenewables in nuclear, oil, and gas development. I believe we need all \nof those sources of energy. I don't think our debate should be about \nwhether to drill or whether to tax those who drill. You are not going \nto increase production by simply taxing the oil companies. That is not \ngoing to solve the problem. It may make a political point somewhere, \nbut it is not going to solve the problem. Instead, I believe the answer \nto breaking through our energy crisis and our political energy logjam\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\nis to couple domestic oil and gas development with responsible \nenvironmental protection--you can do both--to fully utilize the clean \nenergy technologies at our disposal, such as nuclear, while we look to \nemerging technologies, to grow more fuel on the farm and save energy at \nhome. We need to move forward with at least the potential of cellulosic \nethanol.\n  Today I have introduced an energy bill, the Energy Resource \nDevelopment Act of 2008, that I hope will foster the bipartisan \ndiscussion we need to have. It is not about holding my idea of the \nperfect energy bill in the air, pointing a finger and saying: This is \nwhat they won't do. No, this bill is about asking the other side what \nwe might be able to do together.\n  Here is what I think we can do together: We could open the Outer \nContinental Shelf to oil and gas development outside of Florida in a \nway that protects the economy, the environment, and the economy of \nStates in new development areas. There is an estimated 2.8 billion \nbarrels of crude oil and 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that \ncould be produced between now and 2025 in areas currently under \nmoratoria. If developed, this could reduce America's trade deficit by \n$145 billion by offsetting oil imports.\n  We must open development in a way that recognizes that many States \nare opposed to opening development in the Federal waters off their \ncoasts, which is why my bill does not allow the Federal Government to \nallow development unless the State's Governor approves of the plan. \nAnd, to get the discussion going between the Secretary of the Interior \nand the Secretary of Defense and coastal Governors, this proposal will \ngive the Governors an opportunity to make a counterproposal and to \npropose long-term protection of Federal waters off their shores. The \nFederal Government can then accept this proposal and begin negotiation \nwith the Governor. The idea is to move past the take-it-or-leave-it \napproach to Outer Continental Shelf development and provide States the \nauthority and process they need to make a deal that protects their \neconomic and environmental interests.\n  My bill would require that an oil company holding an OCS lease \ndevelop the oil and gas on that tract in a reasonable timeframe or lose \nthe right to develop that area. Existing leases that come up for \nrenewal will face the same limitation.\n\n  No. 2, this proposal would create an energy independence trust fund \nto be funded with the Federal share of additional royalties that would \nbe collected when more of the Outer Continental Shelf is opened for \ndevelopment. This trust fund, which could receive tens of billions of \ndollars from new royalties, would go to fully fund all renewable \nenergy, energy efficiency, research and development, and technology \ndeployment programs from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy \nIndependence Security Act of 2007. We have made a big commitment to new \ntechnology in past energy legislation. This is a way to fund it. This \nwould make sure programs we already have on the books to develop \ntechnology such as fuel cells, hybrid vehicles, solar, wind, advanced \nbatteries, building efficiency--the list goes on and on--are fully \nfunded. We want to make sure they are fully funded.\n  Additionally, the fund will provide resources for a new ethanol \npipeline loan guarantee program and provide new nuclear energy \nproduction incentives.\n  No. 3, the bill would utilize our 250-year supply of coal by creating \na new standard of production of fuel from clean coal, often called \ncoal-to-liquid technology. My bill would take a new approach by \ntightening the environmental standards required of this fuel.\n  No. 4, my bill would recognize the fact that nuclear energy is one of \nAmerica's energy solutions as it provides an affordable, zero-emissions \nsource of energy. The French are not braver than we are. Close to 90 \npercent of their energy is nuclear. This proposal will improve the loan \nguarantee for nuclear production, create a nuclear production tax \ncredit, and increased training for the nuclear workforce.\n  I believe these measures do a great deal to address our current \nenergy crisis. But I promise my colleagues I am open to their ideas and \ninitiatives as well. The only thing I am not open to is more political \ngamesmanship and bickering.\n  The American people want and need bipartisan energy legislation that \ngoes to the root causes of our energy problems. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this proposal. I urge my colleagues and leadership on the \nother side of the aisle to sit down with a bipartisan coalition. I urge \nall of us on my side of the aisle to sit down and put together a \nbipartisan coalition that will produce a bill that truly transforms how \nwe do energy as we, as Senators, work together for the American people.\n  That is what they are looking for right now. They are frustrated. \nThey are scared. They are facing economic stress. They are looking to \nus. We have a responsibility to put the gamesmanship aside, put the \nideological divide aside, and figure out a way--can't we do renewables? \nCan't we do conservation? Can't we do production? It doesn't mean \ndrilling in every corner of the universe.\n  If there ever was a moment for us to come together as a nation to \nprotect and preserve our freedom and our liberty, that moment is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 7 minutes. I know it is unusual, but I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged to the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nMedicare reimbursement for doctors. Doctors are reimbursed through \nMedicare by a formula known as the sustainable growth rate, SGR. Due to \nthe formula's methodology, it has mandated physician fee cuts in recent \nyears. This has forced Congress to place a band-aid over the possible \ncuts that doctors and their practices have hanging over their heads.\n  So every year, or now 6 months, doctors must come to Washington, DC \nand plead with their Representatives and Senators to pass legislation \nthat will allow them to receive the adequate Medicare reimbursement \nthey need.\n  Medicare reimbursement is already well below the actual cost of \nproviding patient services, and physicians tell me every year that if \nthese cuts go into effect, they will be faced with the tough decision \nof either laying off employees or no longer treating Medicare patients, \nor both.\n  Oftentimes, we in Congress wait until the last possible moment of \neach year to pass legislation that will provide these physicians with \ntheir much-needed relief. While we all know that there is a need to \nreplace the current SGR formula, this afternoon I want to focus on the \nrelevant legislation pending before the Senate.\n  The bill before the Senate would alleviate the 10.6 percent physician \nfee cut and replace it with a 1.1 percent increase over 18 months. I \nsupport this element of the legislation and believe that an 18-month \nfix will not only keep physicians from worrying that their \nreimbursements will be cut, but will also give Congress time to look at \npossible alternatives to the SGR.\n  However, I do not agree with other aspects of this legislation. First \nand foremost, the President has threatened to veto this legislation. In \nDecember of last year, we passed legislation that would remove the SGR \ncuts until June 30 of this year.\n  Even if this legislation had overwhelming support, which it does not, \nthe process of this bill passing both Houses, getting vetoed by the \nPresident, and returning for a veto override would be quite a feat to \naccomplish in 18 days, and simply cannot practically happen.\n  Second, this legislation expands entitlement spending such as the \nPart D Low-Income Subsidy and Medicare Savings Program. While these are \ngood programs, I do not understand why we would expand these programs \nwhen there are already significant numbers\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nof seniors who are eligible for the programs at current levels but are \nnot enrolled.\n  This is not the time to expand entitlement spending when it is \nalready out of control and unsustainable.\n  Here we are trying to put a bandaid on reimbursement to our doctors \nand, at the same time, talking about additional expenditures in \nMedicare, so that the next year when we come back, it is going to be \neven harder if we don't have a permanent fix to use this bandaid \napproach for physicians and hospitals.\n  Third, this legislation reduces access to Medicare advantage plans.\n  These plans aren't perfect, but Medicare Advantage has been the one \nreform in the Medicare system we have seen that works. It needs some \nmodification to it, but the fact is it is working.\n  These plans, which are approved by medicare, save beneficiaries an \naverage of $86 per month compared to premiums in traditional fee-for-\nservice medicare. They have been especially important in enrolling low-\nincome and rural beneficiaries.\n  We should have learned from past congresses' mistakes that cutting \npayments to medicare advantage plans results in them being forced to \ndrop seniors. In my home State of Georgia, more than 138,000 \nbeneficiaries rely on these plans.\n  Senator Grassley has introduced alternative legislation that would \nprovide physicians with the exact same 1.1 percent fee increase that is \nincluded in the pending legislation. And it would do this while \neliminating duplicative indirect medical education payments to medicare \nadvantage plans, making reforms to curb controversial and abusive \nmedicare advantage marketing practices, and spending 25 percent less \nthan the pending legislation.\n  Most importantly, this alternative legislation would not be vetoed by \nthe President and could be signed into law before the July 1 deadline. \nUnfortunately, the majority will not allow us to bring this legislation \nto the floor. I hope that decision changes.\n  Doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that \naddresses the impending fee cut without playing politics, cutting \nessential services, and creating a major expansion of entitlement \nspending.\n  It is my hope that Congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement \nthat will provide doctors with the relief they need before July 1. With \nthat, I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Baucus in \nsponsoring this bipartisan legislation, which both abrogates severe \ncuts to provider payments, and also takes steps to reform Medicare \nspending to address the distressing fiscal trajectory of this critical \nhealth entitlement.\n  The bill before us today represents a product of what has become an \nannual--and recently a semiannual task--that of extending Medicare \nfinancing. It is a sad state of affairs when we see two Medicare bills \nemerge from the Finance Committee. For months Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley have worked to build consensus on Medicare--\njust as they did last year. In fact, their reputation for \nbipartisanship is legendary.\n  Ranking Member Grassley saw that we achieved the landmark benefit \nthat is in part enhanced in this bill--the coverage of prescription \ndrugs under Medicare. I have long regarded his leadership so highly, \nand I am confident that--as this debate continues--we will see him \nforge agreement to address critical Medicare issues because of his \nbipartisanship.\n  And in fact--but for intransigence to compromise from the \nadministration last December--we would not need to be here today \ndebating these issues. But instead only a 6-month extender bill could \nbe enacted--and now our providers and beneficiaries face cuts on July \n1.\n  The fact is, that just a few weeks ago, with compromise achieved on \nso many issues, we appeared to be separated by approximately $3 billion \nin spending directed to beneficiaries. The fact is, that amount of \nfunding represents less than what should be committed to meet critical \nneeds of our most economically challenged beneficiaries, and it \nrepresents less than two-tenths of 1 percent of total Medicare \nspending. And under this legislation, these funds would be obtained \nfrom fiscal savings which Medicare must begin to realize. Not from \ntaxes. Not from deficit spending.\n  And as we debate this difference between these two Medicare bills, we \nmust enact sound fiscal policy--not ideological dogma. As CBO has told \nus repeatedly, the factors of an expanding senior population--and more \nsignificantly, as this chart illustrates, a rise in per capita health \ncare spending--are working together to make Medicare the number one \nfiscal concern on the horizon. So it is critical that we take \nsubstantial steps to ensure the fiscal health of Medicare for future \ngenerations.\n  It was an attempt to do so which set us on this course. The creation \nof the sustainable growth rate formula--or ``SGR''--was originally \nintended to serve as a limiter of spending, and it did so effectively \nfor a time. Yet, today, the SGR operates crudely and irrationally to \nsimply restrain payments to physicians. Next month, without \nintervention, physician payments will be reduced 10.6 percent. Yet it \nis also essential to recognize that these annual Medicare bills \nencompass more than just the SGR. A number of other programs are \nrenewed on this same schedule. We call these ``extenders'' and they \nrepresent critical parts of Medicare--including items such as \nassistance to low income beneficiaries and programs which support rural \nhealth delivery--and they face termination without our action.\n  As we consider this bill today, it must be viewed in the light of how \nit will address two crucial issues. First, does it fairly assure \nreasonable payments to those who serve our beneficiaries to preserve \naccess to care? And second, does it take action to change the course of \nhealth spending to help assure the fiscal security of Medicare--\nparticularly when you see the growth and trajectory of growth in \nMedicare spending?\n  First, as it must, this legislation takes action to prevent a large \nreduction in payments to physicians. So too it enacts a number of \ncritical extensions to programs critical to assure that beneficiaries \nwill have secure access to health care.\n  We act to see that health centers receive relief from an artificial \ncap which prevents them from being fully reimbursed for the services \nthey provide to beneficiaries. This bill grants some relief from that \ncap and is a step towards the reform which my legislation with Senator \nBingaman would achieve to prevent health centers from serving Medicare \nat a loss.\n  In similar fashion this bill would ensure that pharmacies will be \npaid promptly for the medications they provide seniors under the Part D \ndrug benefit. And just as critical, we assure that Medicaid payment \npolicy does not discourage the dispensing of generic drugs through \ninadequate reimbursement.\n  And as we avert a pending physician payment cut it is unconscionable \nthat we would leave the most vulnerable beneficiaries behind. In \npassage of the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003, we worked in a \nbipartisan fashion to assure that our most vulnerable beneficiaries \nwould receive a low income subsidy, LIS, to provide extra assistance \nwith drug costs. Today, a beneficiary qualified for full LIS support \nmust have income below 135 percent of the Federal poverty level and \nassets not exceeding $7,790 for an individual and $12,440 for a married \ncouple.\n  Yet, our Medicare Savings Plans--which assist very low income \nbeneficiaries outside of Part D--utilize a very different assets test \nstandard--just $4,000 for an individual and $6,000 for a couple--\ndespite even more stringent income standards. In fact, the Qualified \nMedicare Beneficiary--Quimby program--enacted in 1988--has not seen an \nupdate in the assets test over two decades. Were the amount to have \nbeen indexed to a measure of inflation such as the Consumer Price \nIndex, today that amount would nearly equal the assets limit for full \nLow Income Subsidy under Part D. So it is common sense that we align \nthe assets tests for Medicare savings program with the full LIS limit \nso that truly needy seniors will realize the help we intended. We act \nto index these asset tests to inflation, and critically, extend \noutreach including through the\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\nSocial Security Administration. These provisions represent long-overdue \ncorrections--not an entitlement expansion.\n  As I stated earlier, this bill should also help us to change our \nspending trajectory. Because what we spend is in fact more critical to \nMedicare's fiscal health than even the aging demographics of our \npopulation, this legislation aims to help re-orient our spending to \nassure that Medicare implements more ``best practices,'' beginning with \ngreater support for preventive services. This follows what we began \nwith the enactment of the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003.\n  This bill allows the HHS Secretary to add support for services \nrecommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This is a key \nstep in payment reform. Because the fact is, we can no longer expend \nour first dollar on a disease for an individual's hospitalization. We \nmust be more proactive and cost effective.\n  Similarly, we address the inequity of access to mental health \nservices. Today, beneficiaries pay 50 percent of the cost of outpatient \nmental health services--compared to 20 percent for other care. So as \nthe Senate acts to ensure mental health parity in the private sector, \nwe must not leave our beneficiaries behind. Tragically, only half of \nseniors with mental health problems receive treatment, and the toll is \nseen in the fact that suicide rates among older Americans far exceed \nthose of other age groups.\n  This legislation includes provisions of legislation that I introduced \nwith Senator Kerry and accomplishes a phased-in elimination of the \ncopayment disparity.\n  This legislation takes a balanced approach, one which averts unfair \ncuts to providers, and meets the critical needs of our most vulnerable \nbeneficiaries.\n  Then one could rightly ask: Why are we here? If there was some \nagreement on such priorities, what is the obstacle?\n  The answer to that question, as it is so often, lies in how spending \nis paid for. Today, as we consider legislation affecting provider \npayments in particular, the issue of equity is central. When equity is \nconsidered, the subsidies of private plans in Medicare constitute an \nissue which must be addressed.\n  Today we are subsidizing such private Medicare plans by paying an \naverage of at least 112 percent above the rate of traditional fee-for-\nservice Medicare. Last year, the 5-year subsidy cost was estimated at \n$50 billion over 5 years. This year, we have already received revisions \nof cost projections which may indicate the total cost is much higher.\n  One might ask why, at a time when we are concerned about the fiscal \nhealth of Medicare and when we face critical needs, such as those of \nthe lowest income beneficiaries, would we spend this sort of subsidy?\n  The Chairman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, Glenn \nHackbarth, succinctly stated the problem last year when he stated that \n``right now, Medicare is sending the signal that we want private plans \neven if they cost substantially more than the traditional Medicare.'' \nHe added:\n\n       I think what we need, not just in Medicare, but in the \n     country more broadly, is to send the signal that we want \n     plans that more efficiently manage care.\n\n  I think we have an agreement that we expect these plans to deliver \nvalue for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike--to employ prevention, \nearly screening and detection, and prompt effective care to improve \nhealth and reduce costs.\n  Yet what we have seen in Medicare Advantage is deeply troubling. \nFirst, there is the paucity of data regarding outcomes. This chart \nquotes the CBO Director Orszag, who decried the absence of \nsubstantiation of performance, stating he was ``continuing to beg'' for \ndata from plans demonstrating performance. He noted the subsidies these \nplans enjoy. He said:\n\n       It's almost as if they're conducting a variety of \n     experiments in disease management and various other things. \n     And they are doing so with public subsidies.\n\n  Yet while the average Medicare Advantage plan receives a subsidy at \nleast 12 percent above traditional Medicare, a new plan type receives \nmuch more, as much as 121 percent of fee-for-service rates. These \nprivate fee-for-service plans primarily involve a redesign of the \nMedicare benefits package. So a beneficiary might initially see a plan \nas offering better value, such as offering vision benefits. Yet while \nprivate fee-for-service plans must cover the same benefits as fee for \nservice, they can substantially alter a senior's cost sharing so one's \nout-of-pocket costs can be much higher.\n  But the enticement of new benefits and aggressive and even abusive \nmarketing practices, as we learned in a number of hearings--I know, Mr. \nPresident, you were there at some of those hearings in the Senate \nFinance Committee--has resulted in explosive growth in these plans.\n  As we see on this chart, it demonstrates the increased enrollment \nfrom less than 26,000 beneficiaries in 2003 to 1.5 million at the \nbeginning of this year. So far this year, another 400,000 beneficiaries \nhave enrolled.\n  I am pleased we have seen bipartisan agreement to address the \ngrievous marketing abuses which have plagued beneficiaries. Many of our \nconstituents have been confronted in their homes by high-pressure, \ndoor-to-door, and telemarketing sales efforts. We have seen seniors \nenticed to events by free meals and gifts and frequently enrolled \nunknowingly in new plan coverage they neither needed nor wanted. Much \nof this has been fueled by high commissions.\n  Such abuses led me to introduce a bill with Senator Rockefeller in \nMarch to ban these practices and protect beneficiaries. In fact, I can \nsay my State of Maine has been in the forefront passing legislation on \nits own. States are taking unilateral action to foreclose these \npractices that get people to join plans unnecessarily and adding to \ntheir costs and their problems.\n  The legislation Senator Rockefeller and I introduced has provisions \nthat will include prohibitions on the activities I described earlier.\n  It is abundantly clear such plans not only cost more and are plagued \nby marketing abuses, but they lack the mandates which HMO and PPO plans \ncarry to actually act to improve care. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office Director, Peter Orszag, said again, ``The type of things \nwe are talking about--disease management, care coordination--is much \nless salient and much less prevalent in private fee-for-service.''\n  Also, because private fee-for-service plans are not required to \nestablish contracted networks of providers, such plans use deeming, a \npractice in which, by serving a patient, a provider is deemed to have \naccepted the plan's terms. That shortchanges providers. Since these \nplans are also not required to provide care management, they \nshortchange beneficiaries. So we are paying more through subsidies and \nthey are providing less and are capturing them through the deeming \nprocess, which is inherently unfair and extremely costly.\n  With these deficits, private fee-for-service plans require subsidies \nto function, and today they are paid far more than the traditional fee \nfor service--which I mentioned earlier--and are a large and growing \nshare of Medicare Advantage costs. They are subsidized, as I said, as \nmuch as 121 percent above the rates Medicare was paying local providers \nbefore this so-called innovation.\n  So as we see an escalation in the cost of subsidizing Medicare \nAdvantage, it is wholly appropriate that we examine a reduction in \nunfair subsidies to these plans, subsidies that are provided by the \ntaxpayers.\n  We recognize, as does the administration, that built into these \nhigher Medicare Advantage rates is a duplication of the institutional \nmedical education payment which institutions already receive directly \ntoday. The cost of that duplication was estimated at $8.7 billion \nearlier this year. Yet today, with rapid growth in these plans, the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us the cost of the unnecessary \nsubsidy is now an estimated $12.5 billion. The fact is, that estimate \ndoes not reflect a deeper rate of reduction than we discussed 6 months \nago. It simply reflects the escalation in costs as a growth of these \nsubsidized, uncompetitive plans continue.\n  So as we examine areas in which we could save, there can be no doubt \nthat the duplicate payment is a prime candidate. In fact, the Medicare \nPayment\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\nAdvisory Commission, MedPAC, recommended we bring all Medicare \nAdvantage plans to parity and specifically recommended eliminating this \nduplicate payment, as indicated by their comments on this chart.\n  On the latter recommendation, the President has agreed we must \neliminate the duplicate payment. I note the President included a \nproposal in his budget this year to eliminate it, but he has imposed \nreductions which would affect the rate of reduction we have now \ndiscussed, which would reduce subsidy spending by $12.5 billion. The \nPresident also prefers to eliminate payments to the institutions \nresponsible for this Institutional Medical Education Program and \ninstead would rely on plans to funnel payments to teaching \ninstitutions. Although we differ with him in terms of how to eliminate \nthe duplicate payment, reducing the plan subsidy for this savings is \nreasonable, and agreement should be possible.\n  As I said earlier in my statement, it is a difference of $3 billion, \nand therein lies the difference in the subsidy. The Congressional \nBudget Office recalculated the original cost of savings of achieving \nthis reduction in the Institutional Medical Education Program earlier \nthis year at $8.5 billion. They recalculate to $12.5 billion. You say: \nWhy won't the President support that now? It is the same savings, the \nsame plan. It has been recalculated, and we achieve greater savings in \norder to offset the additional provisions we provided for the lowest \nincome beneficiaries. So it seems to me this is an area in which we \nshould achieve agreement. If we agree we should eliminate the duplicate \npayment--and it has now been estimated in savings from the \nCongressional Budget Office at $12.5 billion instead of $8.7 billion--\nwe ought to be able to agree on the pending legislation.\n\n  This legislation effects a second savings in Medicare Advantage by \neliminating deeming wherever two managed care plans have succeeded in \nestablishing networks. It simply makes sense that if managed care plans \ncan contract providers, these private fee-for-service plans should as \nwell.\n  By reducing the duplicate IME payment by $8.7 billion and modifying \nthe deeming provisions for plans, this legislation realizes $12.5 \nbillion in savings. Still just less than one-fourth of the current \nMedicare Advantage subsidy cost.\n  I note these savings fall far short of the fiscal responsibility \nwhich MedPAC, the Congressional Budget Office, and others suggest is \nabsolutely necessary and vital. Yet some still claim these savings \njeopardize Medicare Advantage. But the fact is, they are modest in \nterms of changing an environment which is both fiscally irresponsible \nand anticompetitive.\n  For those who suggest subsidies should be maintained, they must \nanswer some critical questions: When will these plans be economically \nviable? When will savings be realized by the taxpayers who are \nproviding these subsidies to private insurance companies, in fact, far \nmore than the traditional fee for service? When will more effective \ncare be demonstrated? Again, they don't provide for prevention, \neffective disease management, screening or many of those tests that are \nso essential today that a provider in traditional fee for service, and \nyet not under these private plans, who are getting paid more than what \nwe pay under fee for service in Medicare. What costs must the rest of \nMedicare bear as a result of these anticompetitive subsidies?\n  The fact is the limited savings we accomplish in this legislation do \nnot even threaten the continued operations of these uncompetitive \nplans. Even Wall Street knows that. I note in this final chart that an \nanalyst for Goldman Sachs actually stated that savings exceeding those \nwe make here do not affect the viability of these plans and that the \nMedicare Advantage Programs actually could ``absorb $15 billion in cuts \nover 5 years without materially undermining the fundamentals.''\n  As I said earlier, we are using $12.5 billion, not even $15 billion, \nand they are saying it would have no negative impact on those private \nprograms.\n  Further, we should, in fact, be fostering competition. In fact, that \nis what it was all about originally, providing those subsidies so there \nwould be some competition. Business will respond, they said, and \nthereby achieve some of the objectives on which these plans were \npredicated.\n  There is always political risk. As Simon Stevens of United Health \nCare noted, ``There is always political risk in government programs,'' \nhe said, ``but we will weather it by evolving as Medicare evolves.''\n  There are urgent Medicare financing needs today which must be met. We \nmust fix the physician payment formula. We must reform Medicare to see \nthat care is improved and beneficiaries and taxpayers receive better \nvalue. We have so much more to do. Yet here we are being stymied by a \ndifference of less than two-tenths of 1 percent of Medicare spending, \nthat all is accomplished by reducing the subsidies to private health \ninsurance companies. That is the difference in the pending legislation \nand those who object to it.\n  This legislation, in fact, reflects many issues on which we have had \nbipartisan agreement. It bridges the critical gap between us in \nconsidering the vital and essential requirements of beneficiaries, by \ntaking actions to see best practices emphasized and low-income \nassistance standards are at least updated for inflation. It also acts \nto see that Medicare policies are not penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n  I hope we will see this very modest compromise on this legislation \nthat will produce progress for the providers, for current \nbeneficiaries, and for generations to come to achieve the savings we \nthink is essential--and it is offset because we think that is the \nfiscally responsible approach to take--and also not to skew \ndisproportionately the subsidies we are providing to private health \ninsurance companies for private fee for service, for both to work in a \ncompetitive fashion, and what we are seeing are subsidies growing by \nleaps and bounds.\n  To reach that compromise, we have to support this legislation. \nHopefully, the Senate will express its support for sound fiscal policy. \nHopefully, we can override the cloture. If that fails, I hope we can, \nagain, come to together and resolve these differences and demonstrate \nto the American people that we have the capacity to solve problems at \nthis very crucial juncture in our Nation's history.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is a very important bill for reasons \nwhich I am discussing in this statement. I believe that it is vital for \nthe Senate to take up this important measure to have open debate to \ngive Senators an opportunity to offer amendments and to have the Senate \nwork its will on these important questions.\n  As noted in previous floor statements, I have been concerned about \nthe majority leader's practice of employing a procedure known as \nfilling the tree, which precludes Senators from offering amendments. \nThat undercuts the basic tradition of the Senate to allow Senators to \noffer amendments. Regrettably, this has been a practice developed in \nthe Senate by majority leaders on both sides of the aisle, so both \nRepublicans and Democrats are to blame.\n  I announced publicly at a Senate Judiciary Committee executive \nsession this morning, June 12, 2208, that I would vote with Senator \nBaucus for cloture if I knew the majority leader would not fill the \ntree. In a telephone conversation this afternoon, June 12, 2008, \nMajority Leader Harry Reid advised me that he would not fill the tree.\n  This will provide an opportunity for a full range of debate and \ndecisions by the Senate on many important issues.\n  On the Medicare bill specifically, S. 3101 has a number of issues \nwhich are important to Medicare beneficiaries in Pennsylvania and \nacross the Nation. Foremost of those issues is the prevention of a \n10.6-percent reduction in the Medicare reimbursement for physicians. A \ndecrease of this size could result in doctors limiting the number of \nMedicare beneficiaries they take on as patients or refusing to take \nthem on as patients at all. To resolve this grave problem, the \nlegislation prevents the scheduled reduction, continues the current .5 \npercent increase for 2008, and provides an increase of 1.1 percent for \n2009. This is a needed increase that will improve access to physicians \nfor seniors.\n  This legislation also contains an important provision to extend the \nsection 508 wage index reclassification program. This program, \nestablished in the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003,\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\nprovides important funding for hospitals that have been disadvantaged \nby Medicare's wage index reclassification. This is of particular \nimportance in northeastern Pennsylvania where hospitals struggle to \nmeet the wages needed to keep employees from commuting to other areas \nwhich have a higher reimbursement rate. This is an important extension; \nhowever, a permanent solution is needed to solve this problem for all \nhospitals.\n  I am informed that the bill will include a delay in the Medicare \ndurable medical equipment, DME, competitive bidding program. This is \ncritical to western Pennsylvania, as it is one of the regions selected \nto begin the program. While competitive bidding can be productive in \nlowering the cost of medical equipment, the manner in which this \nprogram was implemented was unacceptable. During the competition for \nbids, half of the bids were disqualified, often for clerical problems. \nFurther, the program is set to begin in just over 2 weeks and seniors \nhave not been notified of these changes. This legislation will delay \nthe implementation of this program to allow for the proper \nimplementation of this program and correction of these problems.\n  I am also informed that the bill will include a provision to increase \nMedicare payments to oncologists and other physicians for the cost of \npatient treatment. Physicians are facing shortfalls in their \nreimbursement, especially pertaining to cancer treatment. This \nprovision will provide an accurate and up-to-date reimbursement for \ndrug costs, ensuring cancer treatment will be accessible to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I am concerned about a change that this legislation makes in the \nability of beneficiaries to purchase power wheelchairs. S. 3101 \nrequires the rental of standard wheelchairs for 13 months instead of a \nphysician determining if the beneficiary should purchase the equipment \nimmediately. This provision removes the problem of purchasing \nwheelchairs for short term users but increases the cost 5 percent for \nthe purchase after those 13 months. To insure that beneficiaries get \nthe wheelchairs they need without overspending, a physician should be \nrequired to certify that a power wheelchair is needed for at least 13 \nmonths. I am confident as we consider this bill we can work out the \ndifferences we have and come to an agreement.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today, we will continue to discuss the \npolitical exercise surrounding the Medicare ``doc fix'' bill. I am \nhopeful that after the vote this afternoon, bipartisan discussions can \nresume so that we can get a bill to the Senate floor that we can all \nsupport. While others have fully outlined all of the problems with the \nprocess and content of S. 3101--the Democrats version of the bill--I \nwant to take the time to discuss a small aspect of the Republican \nversion of the bill.\n  Just last week, I came to the floor to discuss Senator Thomas, \nacknowledging that just over a year ago the State of Wyoming and our \nNation lost one of the great cowboys ever to ride this land. Although a \nyear has passed since Craig left us, his spirit is alive and it is felt \nby all of us within this body. Work he championed on behalf of Wyoming \nresidents and all Americans is ongoing today. In fact, we continue to \nacknowledge his great work to improve health care in rural areas within \nthe Grassley Medicare bill--the Preserving Access to Medicare Act.\n  There is a whole subtitle named after Senator Thomas with provisions \nto assist providers and patients in rural areas. These provisions will \nhelp keep the doors open for rural hospitals so that critical care is \navailable. In addition, they will ensure that individuals in rural \nareas have the emergency transport services available to get them from \nthe scene of an accident to immediate care, to expand access to \nlaboratory services so one can quickly obtain test results for a \npotential cancer diagnosis, and to ensure greater access to telehealth \ncapabilities at skilled nursing facilities and dialysis centers. These \nare just to name a few of the key rural health provisions. Given the \nwork of Senator Thomas, I do hope that these provisions can be \nmaintained in future bipartisan discussions.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 3101, the \nMedicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.\n  This bill merits the support of every Senator. Action on this \nlegislation is mandatory now because, in 18 days, the temporary fix we \npassed at the end of last year for providers will expire. If we fail to \nact, reimbursements to physicians and other providers who are paid \nunder the physician fee schedule will be cut by 10.6 percent.\n  On Tuesday, I met for over an hour with several physicians from \nMaryland. They cannot sustain a 10 percent cut in their Medicare \npayments, and they know that if these cuts are put into effect, many of \ntheir colleagues will stop accepting new Medicare patients into their \npractices.\n  These pending cuts are the result of a flawed system that pegs \nreimbursement to the growth of GDP. We all recognize that this system, \nknown as SGR, does not work. Every year since 2001, Congress has had to \nact to prevent the cuts from going into effect. We know that SGR must \nbe repealed.\n  I have introduced legislation in past years to eliminate SGR and \nreplace it with a system that reimburses based on the actual reasonable \ncosts of providing care. S. 3101 provides another temporary fix through \nDecember 31, 2009. That is sufficient time for Congress, working with a \nnew administration and the provider community, to develop a new system \nof reimbursement that will contain unnecessary increases in volume \nwhile ensuring that reasonable costs are covered.\n  But this bill is so much more than a ``doctor fix bill.'' Also \nexpiring on June 30 is the exceptions process for outpatient therapy \nservices. Therapy caps for physical, occupational and speech language \ntherapy were added to Medicare law more than 10 years ago for purely \nbudgetary reasons. The authors of that provision had no policy \njustification for limiting services, and the amount of the caps was \npurely arbitrary.\n  Unless the exceptions process is extended, seniors recovering from \nmore complex conditions, such as hip replacement and stroke, will face \nunreasonable and arbitrary dollar limits on the rehabilitation services \navailable to them.\n  This urgently needed legislation will help not just providers, but \nalso the millions of seniors that Medicare was created to serve. This \nSenator is proud that the bill's title reflects the right priorities \nfor Medicare--this is The Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProviders Act.\n  The 43 million seniors and persons with disabilities who rely on \nMedicare deserve a program that meets their health care needs. Our goal \nshould be to ensure that Medicare provides comprehensive, affordable, \nquality care. S. 3101 makes important steps toward a better Medicare.\n  It is significant that Chairman Baucus has led with important \nbeneficiary improvements. In 1997, I worked in a bipartisan way to add \nto the Balanced Budget Act the first-ever package of preventive \nbenefits to the traditional Medicare Program. That was 11 years ago. At \nthat time, the members of the Ways and Means Committee recognized what \nmedical professionals had long known--that prevention saves lives and \nreduces overall health care costs.\n  Preventive services such as mammograms and colonoscopies are vital \ntools in the fight against serious disease. The earlier that breast and \ncolon cancer are detected, the greater the odds of survival. For \nexample, when caught in the first stages, the 5-year survival rate for \nbreast cancer is 98 percent. But if the cancer has spread, the survival \nrate drops to 26 percent. If colon cancer is detected in its first \nstage, the survival rate is 90 percent, but only 10 percent if found \nwhen it is most advanced.\n  Seniors are at particular risk for cancer. In fact, the single \ngreatest risk factor for colorectal cancer is being over the age of 50 \nwhen more than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed. Sixty percent of all \nnew cancer diagnoses and 70 percent of all cancer-related deaths are in \nthe 65 and older population. Cancer is the leading cause of death among \nAmericans aged 60-79 and the second leading cause of death for those \nover age 80. So preventing cancer is essential to achieving improved \nhealth outcomes for seniors. Screenings are crucial in this fight.\n  In addition to improving survival rates, early detection can reduce \nMedicare's costs. Under Chairman Conrad's leadership on the Budget \nCommittee, we have had fruitful debates about the\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\nlong-term solvency of Medicare. A more aggressive focus on prevention \nwill help produce a healthier Medicare Program.\n  Let me give you some examples. Medicare will pay on average $300 for \na colonoscopy, but if the patient is diagnosed after the colon cancer \nhas metastasized, the costs of care can exceed $58,000.\n  Medicare will pay $98 for a mammogram, but if breast cancer is not \ndetected early, treatment can cost tens of thousands of dollars. One \ndrug used to treat late stage breast cancer can cost as much as $40,000 \na year. There is no question that these vital screenings can produce \nbetter health care and more cost-effective health care.\n  The 1997 law established place improved coverage for breast cancer \nscreenings, examinations for cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer, \ndiabetes self-management training services and supplies, and bone mass \nmeasurement for osteoporosis. Since then, Congress has added screening \nfor glaucoma, cardiovascular screening blood tests, ultrasound \nscreening for aortic aneurysm, flu shots, and medical nutrition therapy \nservices. In addition, in 2003, a Welcome to Medicare Physical \nexamination was added as a one-time benefit for new Medicare enrollees \navailable during the first 6 months of eligibility.\n  But we can only save lives and money if seniors actually use these \nbenefits. Unfortunately, the participation rate for the Welcome to \nMedicare physical and some of the screenings is very low. I have spoken \nwith primary care physicians across my State of Maryland about this. \nOne problem is the requirement to satisfy the annual deductible and \ncopays for these services.\n  Patients are responsible for 20 percent of the cost of a mammogram, \nbetween $15 and $20. Most colonoscopies are done in hospital outpatient \ndepartments, where their copay is 25 percent, or approximately $85. Our \nseniors have the highest out of pocket costs of any age group and they \nwill forgo these services if cost is a barrier.\n  The other barrier to participation is the limited 6-month eligibility \nperiod for the one-time physical examination. By the time most seniors \nbecome aware of the benefit, the eligibility period has expired. In \nmany other cases, it can take more than six months to schedule an \nappointment for the physical exam and by that time, the patients are no \nlonger eligible for coverage.\n  I have introduced legislation to eliminate the copays and deductibles \nfor preventive services and to extend the eligibility for the Welcome \nto Medicare physical from 6 months to 1 year. My bill would also \neliminate the time consuming and inefficient requirement that Congress \npass legislation each time a new screening is determined to be \neffective in detecting and preventing disease in the Medicare \npopulation. It would empower the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto add ``additional preventive services'' to the list of covered \nservices. They must meet a three part test: (1) They must be reasonable \nand necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness; (2) \nthey must be recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, \nand (3) they must be appropriate for the Medicare beneficiary \npopulation.\n  S. 3101, the Baucus bill, incorporates several elements of my bill in \nthe very first section, and I want to thank the Finance Committee for \nincluding them. It will waive the deductible for the physical \nexamination, extend the eligibility period from 6 months to 1 year, and \nallow the Secretary to expand the list of covered benefits.\n  These provisions are supported by the American Cancer Society, AARP, \nthe Alliance for Retired Americans, the Leadership Council of Aging \nOrganizations, SEIU, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the National \nHispanic Medical Association, the American Academy of Nursing, and many \nmore groups.\n  This bill will also help low income seniors by raising asset test \nthresholds in the Medicare Savings Programs and targeting assistance to \nthe seniors who most need it.\n  As this Congress continues to make progress toward passing a \ncomprehensive mental health parity bill, the Baucus-Snowe bill steps up \nfor our seniors and provides mental health parity for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, moving their copayments from 50 percent to 20 percent \ngradually over 6 years. Depression, bipolar disorder, and other mental \nillnesses are prevalent among seniors, and yet fewer than half receive \nthe treatment they need. This provision will help them get needed \nservices.\n  Section 175 of the Baucus bill will ensure that a category of drugs \ncalled benzodiazepines are covered in Medicare Part D. When the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit took effect on January 1, 2006, \nmillions of beneficiaries found that the prescription medicines they \ntook were not covered by the new law. A little-known provision in the \nMedicare prescription drug bill actually excluded from coverage an \nentire class of drugs called benzodiazepines. These are anti-anxiety \nmedicines used to manage several conditions, including acute anxiety, \nseizures, and muscle spasms. The category includes Xanax, Valium, and \nAtivan. Most are available as generics.\n  They constitute the 13th leading class of medications in the U.S., \nwith 71 million prescriptions dispensed in 2002. A study of dual-\neligibles in nursing homes found that 12 percent of patients had at \nleast one prescription for a benzodiazepine. This exclusion has led to \nhealth complications for beneficiaries, unnecessary complexity for \npharmacists, and additional red tape for the states. Beneficiaries who \nare not eligible for Medicaid have had to shoulder the entire cost of \nthese drugs or substitute other less effective drugs. In 2005, I first \nintroduced legislation that would add benzodiazepines to the categories \nof prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D and Medicare advantage \nplans.\n  I want to thank Chairman Baucus for recognizing the importance of \nthis coverage and adding section 175 to this bill. Without this \nprovision, dual eligibles would have to rely on continued Medicaid \ncoverage for benzodiazepines. Medicare beneficiaries who are not \neligible for Medicaid will have to continue to pay out-of-pocket for \nthem. For those who cannot afford the expense, their doctors would have \nto use alternative medicines that may be less effective, more toxic, \nand more addictive. This is a significant improvement for our seniors \nwho are enrolled in Part D and for the fiscal health of our States.\n  The Baucus bill is paid for by slight reductions to the overpayments \nthat the federal government makes to private health plans. The \nnonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, has \nrecommended that we equalize payments between Medicare Advantage and \ntraditional Medicare.\n  As we discuss the solvency of the Medicare Program, we must take note \nthat private health plans are not saving the Federal Government money. \nIn fact, they are costing us money. I was a member of the Ways and \nMeans Committee when health plans approached us with an offer. If the \nFederal Government would pay them 95 percent of what we were spending \non the traditional Medicare Program, they would create efficiencies \nthrough managed care that would save the Federal Government billions of \ndollars each year. They promised to provide enhanced coverage, meaning \nextra benefits as well as all the services covered by traditional \nMedicare, for 95 percent of the cost of fee for service. Congress gave \nthem a chance to do just that.\n  Instead, what we saw across the country was cherry-picking of \nyounger, healthier seniors. Each time Congress indicated that it would \nroll back their overpayments to a more reasonable level, they responded \nby pulling out of markets. In Maryland, the number of plans declined \nover a 3-year period from eight to one, abandoning thousands of \nseniors. Since 2003, when payments were substantially increased, the \nnumber of plans has steadily increased as well, but at too high a cost \nto beneficiaries, taxpayers, and the future of the Medicare Program.\n  Right now, these plans are paid up to 19 percent more than the amount \nthat we would pay if these seniors were in fee-for-service Medicare. \nOver 10 years, we are overpaying them by more than $150 billion.\n  That is enough to make significant valuable improvements in the \noverall\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\nMedicare Program, or to permanently repeal the sustainable growth rate \nformula. It is time, for the health of the Medicare Program, to pay \nthese plans appropriately. This bill would make small reductions to \nthese overpayments as well as prohibit the abusive marketing practices, \nsuch as cold calling, door-to-door sales, and offering incentives such \nas free meals, which have led to many seniors being enrolled in private \nplans without their knowledge or consent.\n  This is a balanced and responsible bill that addresses immediate \nreimbursement concerns while setting the foundation for a higher \nquality, more cost-effective Medicare Program. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the motion to proceed to S. 3101 and to vote for this well-\ncrafted bill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Taxes\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon I discussed the \nburden that high gas prices are having on all Americans, and not just \non my constituents in Iowa but all over this great country. I think now \nthat most of my colleagues in the House and Senate know that high gas \nprices mean less discretionary income for people--less discretionary \nincome to spend at the mall, to spend at the farmers market, less \ndiscretionary income to buy ice cream on hot summer days, and less \ndiscretionary income to save for a rainy day.\n  I can assume my Democratic colleagues know that actions that take \ndiscretionary income away from the American people are detrimental to \nthose people and detrimental to the overall economy--detrimental to \ntheir way of life and detrimental to our country's future. I guess I \ndon't have to assume folks on the other side know this. This body has \nbeen debating the issue of escalating oil prices and energy for the \nbetter part of this week. I heard countless accounts from my Democratic \ncolleagues about how their constituents are hurting. So I think my \nfriends on the other side get it. They get that taking the hard-earned \ndollars out of the pockets of their constituents is detrimental to \nthose constituents.\n  What my Democratic friends don't get is that raising taxes has the \nsame effect. Raising taxes takes hard-earned dollars out of the pockets \nof their constituents. Don't folks on the other side think this is a \nproblem? It is a problem for their constituents' way of life, and it \nmultiplies into problems for our economy. It is a problem for our \ncountry's future. But I don't think the leadership on the other side \nunderstands this fundamental fact. So I guess folks on the other side \njust don't get it.\n  Is this change Americans can believe in? If they are not being told \nthe entire story, how can they know what to believe? If the leadership \non the other side isn't telling the entire story, the folks in the \nmedia need to. And I believe folks in the media are well enough \neducated to know what the truth is and to spread the truth. So I \nchallenge our media friends and beltway pundits--a little like I did \nyesterday in remarks here--to report that higher taxes means less \ndiscretionary income, it means slower economic growth, and it won't \nmean more revenue for the Government to spend. It is too bad that \npeople are of the frame of mind that if you raise tax rates, you bring \nin more revenue, and if you reduce tax rates, you lower revenue. I like \nto disabuse people of those facts.\n  Yesterday, I also told the beltway punditry and related press people \nto stop referring to the bipartisan tax relief of 2001 as the Bush tax \ncuts. These are the talking points of the leadership on the other side \nof the aisle that the press seems to somehow eat up because it gets \nrepeated. It is just a fact of life: Bush gets all the credit for the \ntax cuts. Well, it is intellectually dishonest, and it gives Americans \nthe impression that the bipartisan tax relief that was passed back \nthen--7 years ago--is bad.\n  But then again, what should we expect from the other side of the \naisle and their leadership's campaign? Everything coming out of that \nshop tends to be poll-driven. Take a poll the night before, and \nwhatever the people are telling you the night before, that is what the \nmessage is the next day as opposed to being more concerned about good \npolicy being good politics.\n  The 2001 tax relief put more money into the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans, and they are better off for it. Sure, the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle wants the voters to believe tax relief is bad. \nThe junior Senator from Illinois wants the voters to believe raising \ntaxes will solve all problems. The distinguished Senator also wants \nvoters to believe taxes will only be raised on people who earn lots of \nmoney, where there isn't the money to solve all the problems. His party \nwants people to believe there are no downsides for taxpayers, no \ndownsides for economic growth if income taxes go up by 10 percent, even \nif taxes are raised on families making $250,000 or more.\n  Now, it is too bad, but the media seems to believe this propaganda \nand ignores the fact that the economics behind it are not responsible \nand factual, because that is the report they put out there, so that is \nwhat the people hear.\n  The Democratic leadership has also successfully convinced the media \nthat raising taxes will bring in more revenue. I want to remind the \nmedia that the bipartisan tax relief brought in more revenue than was \nprojected, much more revenue than what the 1993 Clinton tax increase \nbrought in over a comparable period.\n  I have a chart here that I would like the media to take a look at, a \nchart which illustrates that lower taxes have generated record \nrevenues.\n  See, you have the actual revenues that came in and you have the \nprojected revenues before we lowered taxes. This chart illustrates that \nFederal tax revenues have been and generally continue to be coming into \nthe Federal Treasury at or above the historical average--and the \nhistorical average, the way I say it, is the last four decades--of \nabout 18.2 percent of gross domestic product. Now, what does that 18.2 \npercent of gross domestic product mean? It means that by lowering the \ntax rates, as we did in 2001, it does not in any way gut Federal tax \nrevenue.\n  But how easy is it to explain to people who don't look at economics \nevery day that if you lower tax rates, you are going to bring in less \nrevenue; if you raise tax rates, you are going to bring in more \nrevenue? Because that is kind of what common sense might tell you. But \nthe study of economics and what really happens by the facts are two \ndifferent things. You can keep tax rates where they historically have \nbeen for the last 40 years, about 18 to 19 percent of gross domestic \nproduct--and when they were at 20, we reduced them down to that point; \nin fact, even a little bit less growth has brought them back up--and \nyou can do it without hurting the Federal Treasury. In fact, you can \nenhance it. Do you know why? Because of the dynamics of our economic \nsystem, of our market system. When you let 137 million taxpayers, with \nmore money in their pockets, decide how to spend the money--and \nprobably in 137 million different ways--it does more economic good than \nwhen 535 Members of Congress decide how to do it. But you know, some \nhave the attitude around here that the judgment of 535 Members of \nCongress is much better than the judgment of 137 million taxpayers, so \nwe don't need to raise taxes in order to generate revenue.\n  So to the media people: Don't believe the Chicken Littles. I have a \nchart here of Chicken Little, who says that the sky is going to fall if \nwe keep taxes low.\n  I can't let my colleagues on the other side and some of the skeptics \nin the press say to the American public that if you earn less than \n$250,000 a year, you won't see higher taxes, so I have these news \nflashes:\n  News flash: You don't have to be earning $250,000 to invest money in \nthe stock market.\n  News flash: You don't have to be earning $250,000 to have real estate \nholdings.\n  News flash: You don't have to be earning $250,000 to have your \nsavings in mutual funds.\n  All those flashes prove that if you earn less than $250,000 a year \nand you\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nhold these investments, guess what--you will be paying more taxes. Let \nme take a closer look so I can demonstrate that is what is going to \nhappen.\n  In 2003, Congress reduced the top tax rate on capital gains, lowering \ntaxes again from 20 percent to 15 percent. Congress also did the same \nthing for dividend income, tied it with the capital gains tax rate at \n15 percent. For lower income taxpayers, we thought they ought to have \nan incentive to save, so the tax rate on capital gains and dividends \nfor low-income taxpayers is zero--that is zero with a ``z.'' Millions \nof low-income taxpayers receive dividends and capital gains. All of \nthese taxpayers are not making more than $250,000.\n  To help out the media, I will illustrate these points with yet \nanother chart. As you can see from this chart, over 24 million tax \nreturns reported dividend income. In Iowa, for instance--my State--over \n299,000 families and individuals claimed dividend income on their \nreturns.\n  Another chart we have deals with capital gains. The first one dealt \nwith dividends, now this one with capital gains. Nationally, 9 million \nfamilies and individuals claimed capital gains--9 million families--and \nin my State of Iowa, over 127,000 of them. Now, that is a lot of \ntaxpayers who are not earning a lot of money. So I want the media to \nreport that. It doesn't seem to get reported. I want to see news \nreports that say something like this: ``Even if the other side's \nPresidential candidate's plan raises taxes on folks making $250,000, \nmillions of taxpayers make less than $250,000 and will still see a tax \nincrease.''\n  That is end of my proposed quote, but you will never see it in the \nnewspaper.\n  I also want my friends in the punditry and media to connect the dots. \nIf more people are paying higher taxes, the result is less \ndiscretionary income and of course slower economic growth. That is the \nsame thing that is going on with high gas prices. The press doesn't \nseem to have a problem reporting that fact, but it still ends up with \nthe consumer having less discretionary income.\n  I fought both Democrats and Republicans. I hope I have a reputation \nof taking on a cause and not worrying about whether it is a Republican \ncause or Democrat cause. So I have fought both to ensure that our \ncountry is on the right course. That course must be and is economic \nprosperity. I wish to see a real discussion of the negative \nimplications of changing current economic policy. With high gas prices \nsqueezing taxpayers, it is more compelling than ever.\n  Let's clear away the fog about what is meant to be negative about the \nBush tax cuts, because broad-based tax increases are not gauzy ``feel \ngood'' economic changes. Let's examine the benefit of keeping taxes \nlow.\n  While I have the floor, I wish to speak on an issue that is coming up \nfor a vote. This is the Medicare vote in a little while.\n  The vote we are going to take later today is a very important one--\nimportant for our senior citizens and important for all health care \npractitioners around the country. The outcome of that vote will \ndetermine whether we begin working together again on a bill that the \nPresident will sign. For the sake of 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, \nI am here now to urge my colleagues to defeat the cloture motion today. \nThen we can get to work on a bipartisan basis and write a bill that can \nbe signed into law. That is something Senator Baucus and I know how to \ndo.\n  This afternoon the Senate will be voting to move forward on a bill \nthat will be vetoed and will mean a lot of lost time--not only for the \nSenate, but we have to get these things done by July 1. With a \nPresidential veto, I doubt we will. This is a pointless exercise, then, \nthat can be stopped in its tracks by a ``no'' vote on cloture.\n  What is worse, the reality is that the bill is not even ready for \nserious consideration. Members of the Senate, it is very incomplete, \nobviously incomplete. It was introduced with blanks and brackets. It \nwill not become law.\n  It cuts oxygen reimbursement. It cuts power wheelchair reimbursement. \nIt threatens future physician updates. The danger is July 1, doctors \nget cut 10.6 percent if we do not intervene. It is a partisan bill that \ndelays bipartisan consideration of the Medicare bill.\n  While the Senate wastes time with this bill, millions of taxpayers' \ndollars in administrative costs are also going to be wasted because the \nCenter for Medicare Services has to program their system to not have \nthe physicians' pay cut go into effect July 1. But they can only do \nthat if Congress can pass a bill that can be signed by the President.\n  Voting for this bill is the same as asking for the physician pay cut \nto go into effect. If it does, then CMS has to potentially hold \nmillions of claims, to process them later. That costs millions and \nmillions of dollars a week. If the Senate votes cloture on this bill, \nwe may as well be taking a match to millions of taxpayers' dollars.\n  We had been working in a bipartisan process that could get us a bill \nthat could be signed into law. For some reason the majority walked away \nfrom the table. That was kind of recently, during the end of May. With \nall due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the 3 \nweeks since they have produced a bill that, for all the rhetoric we are \nhearing about it, is not worth the paper it is printed on. It will not \nbecome law. It will be vetoed.\n  Meanwhile, doctors in this country are looking at the calendar, \nwondering what their payment will be after June 30, and wondering \nwhether they can still afford to see Medicare patients. They are \nwondering if they have enough cash reserves if Congress doesn't get its \nact together.\n  I want to say something to the doctors back home who are listening to \nthis debate. They tend to be very busy, so I don't expect a lot of them \nto be listening, but if they are I want to have them hear this. Your \ninsider Washington lobbyists are telling you that supporting cloture is \nthe best way to prevent the physician pay cut from going into effect \nJuly 1. I think these high-paid lobbyists here in Washington are giving \nyou, the family practitioners and surgeons and interns back home, bad \nadvice. It is a good thing they are not giving the advice to real \npatients, as you do, if this is the kind of judgment they would use. \nThe fact is, a vote in support of cloture is the absolute worst thing \nthat could happen if you want the physician payment update addressed by \nthe date it ought to be ready for CMS to carry it out, July 1.\n  If 60 Senators support cloture we will move to pass a bill out of the \nSenate. Of course that will be a bill that will be vetoed. Then the \nSenate will sit down with the House on a partisan basis and produce a \ncompromise that has even more spending yet, and is even more liberal \nand more certain to be vetoed. Then it will be voted on in the House \nand come back here for a vote. Then, finally, it will go to the \nPresident where it will be vetoed. Then we will have a veto override \nthat will certainly fail.\n  Then and only then--how many weeks away that is I don't know--we will \nsit down again on a bipartisan basis to write a bill that will become \nlaw. Given how quickly things move around here, that could well be at \nelection time. If cloture fails, I am ready to roll up my sleeves and \ngo to work tonight. So, to all the doctors listening to this wherever \nyou are--in your hospitals, your homes--and to folks who pay dues to \ngroups such as the American Medical Association and to the American \nCollege of Physicians, hear me when I say the people telling you that \nsupporting cloture is the way to get the physician payment update done \nfastest do not deserve the jobs they hold and the hundreds of thousands \nof dollars you pay them. The answer is a simple one. We need to defeat \nthe cloture motion today and we need to get back to bipartisan work to \nprotect Medicare for America's seniors and the providers who serve \nthem.\n  Yesterday Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, and I introduced \na bill, S. 3118, to address the problems we face in Medicare. The \nDemocrats are blocking our bill from getting a vote today. It is too \nbad, because this is a very good bill. I spoke of some of the \nprovisions of this bill in the last several days. It is a bill that \nclearly serves Medicare beneficiaries. Our bill reduces medication \nerrors with stronger e-prescribing provisions. This will help ensure \nthat our seniors' health care is not compromised by duplicative, \ndangerous, and incompatible prescriptions.\n  Our bill helps patients who have had a heart attack with cardiac and \npulmonary rehab. Our bill ensures that\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\nseniors who need access to outpatient therapy services will continue to \nreceive the therapy they need.\n  I am very pleased our bill pays a tribute to our beloved departed \ncolleague, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, by including a number of \nprovisions that protect access for beneficiaries in rural America. \nSpecifically, our bill would accomplish helping rural America by \naddressing inequitable disparities in the Medicare reimbursement \nbetween rural and urban providers, and helps ensure these providers are \nable to keep their doors open.\n  By continuing to fund two important and very successful programs to \ncombat diabetes, our bill helps people with that dread health problem.\n  Finally, our bill includes a number of extensions to help low-income \nseniors and families.\n  As we close this debate--and the vote is about 35 minutes away--I \nthink the vote is a very simple one. The President will sign a bill \nthat preserves Medicare for American seniors and the providers who \nserve them. The President will sign a bill that will provide increases \nin payments for rural health care in America. The President will sign a \nbill that reduces payments to Medicare Advantage. The President will \nalso sign a bill promoting value-based purchasing, electronic \nprescribing, and electronic health records. The President will then \nsign a bill that does not require cuts in oxygen payments or payments \nfor power wheelchairs.\n\n  Unfortunately, regarding the bill we will be voting cloture on, the \nvote is to move forward on a bill that is not a bill. I have described \nthat. I am not going to go into greater detail.\n  People back home often don't understand votes on procedural motions \nsuch as the one we call cloture, which we will have at 3. But this one \nought to be very easy to understand. Voting for this bill is a step \nbackward; it is not a step forward. It will not become law, and we have \nto get something to the President that he will sign by July 1 to avoid \ndoctors taking Medicare cuts of 10.6 percent.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the cloture motion so we can \nget to work on a bill the President will sign. Let's set aside partisan \ngames and get to work protecting Medicare for America's seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, since I do not see other speakers, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, unless we act, on July 1 the law will cut \nMedicare payments to doctors by 10 percent. Today, we have an \nopportunity to vote on proceeding to a bill that will stop that cut. In \naddition to averting the 10-percent payment cut, the bill on which we \nwill vote today will also make important improvements for \nbeneficiaries.\n  It will help those with very modest incomes to get the help they \nneed, and it will expand access to preventative benefits in Medicare. \nWe should all agree that prevention is critical to moving our health \ncare system from one that treats disease to one focused on wellness.\n  The bill includes a provision intended to give a boost to primary \ncare physicians. These represent a downpayment on changes that I would \nlike to consider in the near future to advance the role of our front-\nline physicians.\n  The bill will improve access to health care in rural areas. The bill \nincludes many policies from the Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and \nProvider Equity Act, all supported so strongly by so many Senators.\n  The bill will lend a hand to pharmacists. Pharmacists face so many \nchallenges right now. And the bill will help ambulance providers. \nToday, these first responders must contend with record high and rising \ngas prices.\n  That is what this bill will do. It is a good bill, it is a balanced \nbill, and it is a bill that my colleagues should be proud to support. \nLet me also talk about what this bill would not do. I have heard some \nclaims made about the bill. I would like to set the record straight.\n  First, the bill would not make drastic cuts to Medicare Advantage \npayments. This is not the House-passed CHAMP bill. Although I believe \nthere is justification for making significant reductions to Medicare \nAdvantage benchmarks, this bill will not do that. This bill would not \naffect the benchmarks in Medicare Advantage.\n  Second, this legislation will not eliminate private fee-for-service \nplans. What it will do instead is take away the ability of these plans \nto ``deem'' doctors and hospitals into their networks. Right now \nprivate fee-for-service plans are permitted to circumvent network \nrequirements. They can deem any Medicare provider to be part of the \nplan network. They can do so without any formal agreement between the \nprovider and the private fee-for-service plan.\n  What does that mean? That means that doctors and hospitals are \nautomatically considered by the plan to have agreed to all the terms \nand conditions of the plan automatically. They are automatically \nconsidered to have agreed to payment levels, to patient cost-sharing \nobligations, and to billing procedures, even when they have not made \nsuch agreements.\n  So it is no wonder that we hear from providers that they do not like \ndealing with these plans. I would go so far as to say that forcing \ndoctors and hospitals to accept the terms that plans lay out, without a \nchance to negotiate, seems un-American.\n  How will this legislation address deeming? It will eliminate this \ndeeming authority in 2011--yes, 2011; not right now but 2011; not next \nyear, not 2010 but 2011. The plans would have 2.5 years to develop a \nnetwork. I believe that is plenty of time.\n  Moreover, the bill will protect choice in rural areas. The deeming \nprovisions will only affect areas where there are already two or more \nplan options available that have a network. In those areas where \nexisting plans have contracted with providers to form a network, \nprivate fee for service has a competitive advantage. This bill will \nlevel the playing field across all plans.\n  Second, this bill will not cut teaching hospitals. It will not \njeopardize access to plans in areas where academic medical centers are \nmost prevalent.\n  Right now, Medicare pays twice for indirect medical education on \nbehalf of patients in Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare pays once when \nit reimburses teaching hospitals directly for IME costs, and Medicare \npays a second time by inflating payments to Medicare Advantage plans \nfor the same costs. So under this bill, teaching hospitals will \ncontinue to receive IME payments directly from Medicare, but the \nunnecessary double payments will be eliminated.\n  Third, this bill will not allow wealthy seniors to qualify for low-\nincome subsidies, as has been claimed. The bill will raise the asset \ntest from $4,000 to just under $8,000 for individuals. And it will \nraise the asset test from $6,000 to $12,000 for couples. The bill will \ngive more seniors with very limited means the ability to qualify for \nadditional subsidies.\n  The income cut-offs to qualify for the subsidies will remain the \nsame. Beneficiaries will need to have incomes below $10,200 for the \nQualified Medicare Beneficiaries Program, and below $12,500 for the \nSpecified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries Program. That is under \ncurrent law, no change.\n  I think we all would agree that anyone with an annual income below \n$12,500 and personal assets below $8,000 is someone we should want to \nhelp. And if we can get the 60 votes to get to this bill, I will do \nsomething else. I will offer an amendment to delay implementation of \nthe competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment. That is \na pledge that I made to many of my colleagues, and it is a pledge that \nI make publicly, a promise I intend to keep.\n  I will offer as an amendment the language of the bipartisan bill \nintroduced earlier today in the House by Representatives Stark, Camp, \nBoehner, and Pallone. Their bill is thoughtful, it is balanced, and it \nresponds to many of the concerns we have all heard from the DME \nindustry. If we get to this Medicare bill, we will include that \nlanguage in this bill.\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\n  Another policy in S. 3101 that I intend to revisit is oxygen cuts. \nCongress needs to address overpayments to oxygen. In some cases, \nMedicare pays 1,000 percent above what these supplies cost, and \nbeneficiaries pay the price through inflated copayment rates.\n  But this is a limited bill. It is not intended to fix all that ails \nMedicare. We will revisit oxygen payments when the Congress next takes \nup Medicare. By my estimate, that would be next fall when the 18-month \nphysician fix and other policies will expire.\n  In sum, time is running out. It is running short. We need to complete \na bill by June 30. That is not many days away. The options before us \nare few and fraught with pitfalls. By far, the best option for getting \na Medicare bill done this year is a bill on which we will vote today.\n  This bill is bipartisan. It is carefully balanced. It does what we \nneed to do. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from time that is \nreserved for the leader or, alternatively, from time that is available \nat this point that is open.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Chair if there is time presently available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes for the minority leader.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to raise my concerns about the \nprocedure and about the substance. We all know there has to be a fix \nrelative to the doctors. We all know we cannot have this sort of \nreduction in payments to physicians. That is just a fact.\n  My own personal preference is that we fix this permanently. It is \ngoing to cost a lot of money, but that is the way it should be done. We \nshould not be fixing this every year. And, in fact, it is becoming a \ngeometric progression which is spiraling downward, with every year \nbecoming a much more difficult effort.\n  We should basically do Medicare reform. But short of that, we should \ndo a permanent doctor fix so that the physicians in this country know \nthey are going to get a reasonable upgrade of their reimbursement every \nyear. We should not have to go through this.\n  However, this bill does not accomplish that. In fact, this bill \naggravates the problem significantly. I genuinely wish the \nbipartisanship effort which Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley had \nbeen pursuing had been the effort that had come to floor, but it did \nnot.\n  What has come to the floor is a partisan effort; regrettably, it is \nnot a very good one. It has a couple of practical problems, and then it \nhas a very substantive problem. The substantive problem is that it \nspends $2 trillion that we do not have, not to fix the doctor problem \nbut to add new benefits in certain elements for certain recipients \nunder Medicare Part D. Well, Medicare Part D is already $36 trillion in \ndebt, unfunded liabilities. Put $2 trillion more on top of that, it \nmeans we are passing a huge cost on to our children. It is not fair. It \nis not appropriate.\n  The practical problem this bill has--I find it incredible that we are \nbeing asked to vote on it, quite honestly--is that it has blanks. This \nis the first time I have ever seen this. This bill literally has blanks \nin it. We are being asked to vote on a bill where the numbers, which \nare operative relative to how much this bill is going to cost, are left \nout. There are actually parentheses with nothing in them. There are \nlines where there is a blank. And we are being asked to vote to close \nthe debate on this and move to final passage on this without even \nknowing what the numbers are going to be which are to fill in those \nblanks.\n  This is so egregious, so egregious, that the CBO, which is the \nindependent scorekeeper around here, which is the fair umpire around \nhere, has written us and said: They cannot score this bill. They cannot \ngive us a cost estimate since the introduced version has blanks.\n  The Congress should not work this way. The Senate should not work \nthis way. This is totally inappropriate. It is a terrible precedent. It \nis worse than a terrible precedent. It is an incompetent precedent to \nset to bring to the floor a bill that does not tell us how much it is \ngoing to spend because the other side of the aisle does not want to \ntell us how much it wants to spend or, alternatively, because they are \nnot competent enough to put numbers into the bill.\n  It is incredible to me that we would be asked to vote cloture on a \nbill that the Congressional Budget Office says they cannot estimate the \ncost of, which is their responsibility, because it has blanks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As you requested, enclosed are CBO estimates \n     of the costs of the provisions of S. 3101, the Medicare \n     Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, as \n     introduced on June 6, 2008.\n       As you noted in your request letter, some of the provisions \n     of the introduced bill are incomplete: there are some \n     elements that are necessary to producing a cost estimate for \n     the bill that are not included in the current language. In \n     addition, a number of elements in the bill are bracketed and \n     thus could be considered subject to change.\n       The enclosed table contains estimates for those provisions \n     of the bill for which we can estimate the costs, but does not \n     include a CBO estimate for the total cost of the bill since \n     the introduced version has blanks for some of the values for \n     key provisions. For the purposes of these estimates, CBO \n     assumed that all bracketed language would have full force and \n     effect.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tom \n     Bradley.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our greatest successes in this Congress \nhave come when both sides have worked together. We saw it last year on \nthe Energy bill when we increased the CAFE standards to historic levels \nand, more recently, the first thing this year on the economic stimulus \npackage.\n  We started initially down the path of compromise when we began the \nMedicare discussions. Both sides wanted to prevent cuts to physicians \nin the Medicare Program and to preserve access to the quality of \nmedical care our seniors have come to depend upon.\n  Unfortunately, the majority walked away from these bipartisan \ndiscussions. In an effort to preserve some of the progress, protect \nbenefits for seniors, and to produce a bill that can be signed into \nlaw, Senator Grassley crafted a Medicare bill which, if it were to be \npassed today, it would be signed by the President of the United States.\n  Senator Grassley's alternative, which I will shortly ask consent to \ngo to, includes a 1.1 percent increase in the physician update, \nprotection for patients who need extensive therapies following a \nstroke, 2 years of funding for the special diabetes program, a new \ncardiopulmonary rehabilitation benefit--this is, by the way, especially \nimportant to Kentucky where far too many of our citizens struggle with \npulmonary diseases.\n  There is a new program to improve care and save money by encouraging \ndoctors to write prescriptions electronically, a very important step in \nthe right direction. And it also preserves patient choice and access to \nMedicare Advantage, which helps retired Kentucky teachers.\n  We all know what is going to happen. Once this bill is not proceeded \nto, we will have bipartisan negotiations, which is the way this process \nstarted out in the first place and, frankly, the way it will ultimately \nend. That is the way the Senate does its best work. Having said that, I \nhave notified my friend, the majority leader, that I did have a consent \nagreement to propound. I see that he is now on the Senate floor. I will \nask that consent at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending motion be temporarily set \naside and that it be in order for the Republican leader to move to \nproceed to S. 3118, a bill introduced by Senator Grassley to extend \nexpiring provisions under the Medicare Program and to file cloture on \nthat motion. I further ask that the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 3118 occur immediately following the cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3101. I further ask that if the motion to \nproceed to either\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\nMedicare bill is adopted, no other pending business be displaced.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, on the floor now is the \nPresiding Officer and the chairman of the Finance Committee. Two more \nbipartisan Senators we do not have in the Democratic Caucus, Senators \nalways willing to work with the other side. They both have \nreputations--Baucus in Montana, Nelson of Nebraska--of working with the \nother side. There is no partisan advantage in the minds of either one \nof these Senators.\n  Why can't we move to this bill? If there is a way to improve it, \nlet's improve it. That is all we want.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Parliamentary inquiry: Is this an objection?\n  Mr. REID. Why do we have to go through this routine of stopping--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the leader asking for the regular order?\n  Mr. REID. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I have time set aside at this time. Why in the world do we \nwant to object again?\n  Mr. President, downtown this morning one of the Republican Senators \nwhose name I won't mention said, meeting with a number of people \ndowntown--this Republican Senator said: There is a lot of frustration \nwithin the Republican caucus about blocking motions to proceed.\n  Of course, there is. The Republicans don't like it. Why do they \ncontinue to do this? We want to legislate on this important piece of \nlegislation. It is not only a doctors fix, it is a fix to our health \ncare delivery system.\n  I am disappointed very much that the Nelsons of the world, the \nBaucuses of the Senate world can't work together in a bipartisan basis. \nThey want to. I received a call before lunch, before I went to our \npolicy luncheon, from a Republican Senator. He said: Are you going to \nfill the tree? I said: Of course, I am not going to fill the tree. Why \nwould I? He said: OK. I will vote with you. So I know at least we have \none Republican vote. He told me he is going to vote with us on cloture. \nI hope others would follow with that.\n  In 1965, President Lyndon Baines Johnson traveled from Washington, DC \nto Independence, MO to join former President Harry Truman in Harry \nTruman's hometown of Independence, MO. The purpose of the trip and the \nmeeting between the current and former Presidents was to sign into law \na bill Harry Truman had conceived and Johnson had championed. The new \nlaw created Medicare.\n  I know a little bit about Medicare. My first elective job was in \n1966. I was elected to the Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital board of \ntrustees. It might not sound like much to anybody but to me that was \nimportant. I beat an incumbent. At the time I took that job--I was \nthere for 2 years--40 percent of the senior citizens who came into our \nhospital had no insurance. What did we do? We had them sign a \ncertificate or we would not let them in the hospital, unless a father, \na mother, a husband, a wife, a brother, a sister, or a friend agreed to \npay their bill. If they didn't pay the bill, we had a collection \ndepartment, and we went after them big time, as they did every place in \nthe country.\n  Medicare came into being. When I was there, before I left, Medicare \ncame into being. Now 99-plus percent of older people who go into \nhospitals in America have Medicare insurance, a pretty good deal. That \nis why Truman thought of it. That is why Johnson implemented his \nthought process. The new law they were there to celebrate created the \nMedicare Program, a program that has ensured quality health care to \nAmerica's senior citizens for more than four decades. Since Johnson \nsigned the bill and gave Truman the first ceremonial Medicare card, \nhundreds of millions of senior citizens have also received their \nMedicare card. With each new Medicare card issued, our country renews \nits commitment to bedrock values of those who have worked hard and made \ntheir contribution to society, and they deserve to know they will be \ncared for as they reach those golden years.\n  But even on the day that bill was signed, President Johnson \nacknowledged the bill was imperfect. Who were the Senators who voted \nagainst Medicare when it came into being? Who were the Senators who \nrecognized they would not vote for that bill? All Republicans. Every \nperson who voted against Medicare's implementation was a Republican \nSenator. They haven't changed. They reluctantly do what they can for \nMedicare, but they don't support it.\n  President Johnson acknowledged it was imperfect. For all the good \nMedicare has done our Nation's seniors through the years, for all the \ngood it has done for them today, it could be better. Our efforts to \nmake Medicare work better continue today with the Medicare Improvements \nAct. That is what the chairman of the committee was trying to do, make \nit better. That is what this is all about.\n  I am grateful for the work of Senator Baucus, chairman of our \ncommittee. Anyone who knows, I repeat, the Senator from Montana is well \naware of his ability to work with both sides of the aisle to forge \nbipartisan solutions. On this legislation, Senator Baucus worked \ntirelessly with Democrats and Republicans. He reached out to the Bush \nadministration and to the Republican leader. In these efforts, though, \nhe was met with a reluctance to move forward, reluctance that has sadly \nbecome the rule, not the exception, among our Republican colleagues. \nNevertheless, Senator Baucus moved forward. He worked side by side with \nDemocrats and willing Republicans to create a bill that would make \nMedicare work better for millions of senior citizens.\n  Senator Baucus laid out the many virtues of this legislation \nyesterday so I will do no more than summarize the key points of this \nmost important legislation. The Medicare Improvements Act provides \nincreased coverage for Medicare. This is so important. There is no \nbetter way to treat illness than true preventive care. Not only will \nthis enhanced preventive coverage improve the health of Medicare \nrecipients, but it will also save taxpayers in the long run from the \nastronomically higher costs associated with treating serious illnesses \nwhich could have been avoided with preventive care.\n  This legislation also makes mental health care more affordable. I \nhave worked throughout my time in Congress to shed light on the tragic \nbut all too often hidden cost of depression and other mental health \nproblems among older Americans. Sometimes depression among seniors \nleads to suicide. There is no group of Americans that dies more than \nseniors from suicide. Medicare currently discourages beneficiaries from \nseeking care for mental illness by requiring a 50-percent copayment for \nmental health services versus a 20-percent copayment for physical \nhealth services. This legislation will eliminate that disparity and \nexpand coverage for medications to treat mental health illnesses.\n  The Medicare Improvements Act also makes it easier for low-income \nseniors to access benefits by extending the Qualified Individuals \nProgram, increasing eligibility for the Medicare Savings program and \neliminating the drug benefit penalty. And for all seniors, this bill \nprovides funds for State and local programs to help navigate through \nthe program and ensure the greatest benefits possible.\n  When President Johnson signed Medicare into law in 1965, he \nacknowledged that for all the good this program would do, I repeat, it \nwasn't perfect. That has not changed today. For all its virtues, far \ntoo many seniors are not accessing the care they earned and to which \nthey are entitled. Far more can be done to prevent and treat physical \nand mental illness to provide older Americans with the very best \nquality care we can provide them. Will the Medicare Improvements Act \nmake Medicare perfect? No. But there is no question it will make it \nbetter, far better. There is no question it will help millions of \nAmericans access Medicare and get the most of its benefits once they \ndo.\n  There has been some talk of Republicans refusing to join Democrats to \nsupport the motion to proceed to this legislation. That is what the \nRepublican leader said today. He told all of his Republicans: Don't \nvote for this. We will work out something better. That is the process. \nThe process is not the status quo. If there are improvements they want \nto make, there is no bigger listener than Max Baucus of the Finance \nCommittee. He will manage this bill. But if they follow the lead of\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\nthe Republican leader, they are being led off a cliff. Republicans \nwouldn't just be refusing to support the bill, they would be refusing \nto let us even move to debate it. They would be stopping this crucial \nlegislation in its tracks and deny any possibility of progress or \ncompromise in the near future.\n\n  I hope people on the other side will follow what I read to them from \na Republican Senator downtown this morning: There is a lot of \nfrustration within the Republican caucus on blocking motions to \nproceed.\n  And well there should be.\n  I will use leader time, Mr. President.\n  I can't imagine why all 100 Senators would not flock to quickly pass \nthis legislation, much less why they would not all vote eagerly for the \nmotion to proceed. Denying debate on the Medicare Improvements Act and \ndenying its passage would be a grave disservice to tens of millions of \nAmericans over age 65. It would be a slap in the face to all those who \nsuffer silently through mental illness because they can't afford the \ntreatment that would make them well. Opposing this legislation and \nclinging to the status quo, as I fear some Republicans may choose to \ndo, would be an abandonment of our decades-old commitment to honoring \nand caring for senior citizens in the manner they deserve.\n  In Independence, MO, 43 years ago, President Johnson said this:\n\n       Many men can make many proposals. Many men can draft many \n     laws. But few have the piercing and humane eye which can see \n     beyond the words to the people they touch.\n       Few can see past the speeches and political battles to the \n     doctor over there that is tending the infirmed, and to the \n     hospital that is receiving those in anguish, or feel in their \n     heart the painful wrath at the injustice which denies the \n     miracle of healing to the old and to the poor.\n       And fewer still have the courage to stake reputation, and \n     position, and the effort of a lifetime upon such a cause when \n     there are so few that share it.\n       But it is just such men who illuminate the life and history \n     of [this] nation.\n\n  Because times have changed in 43 years, I call upon the men and women \nof the Senate to do the right thing and let us move to this \nlegislation. It is the right thing to do. President Johnson's words go \nto the heart of this country. People need to vote their conscience, not \nthe status quo.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. REID. I have time? OK.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In a minute or less, I am rather stunned to hear that the \nRepublican leader is suggesting that Republican Senators vote no to \nmove to a bill for the purpose of making improvements in Medicare. I \nask my friend, because people sometimes lose track of what happens, \nwould this not be the third straight bill in a row where the \nRepublicans have been fierce defenders of the status quo--global \nwarming, gas prices, and now fixing Medicare? Am I correct on that?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my distinguished friend from California, it has \ngotten so out of hand that we are having trouble keeping up. We now \nhave on filibusters 75, but we have it on Velcro because we know they \nwill add another one to it in the near future. We also have Velcro as \nto what they are blocking on a given day. We pull it off because \nyesterday they were blocking global warming. The day before they were \nblocking gas prices, today Medicare improvements. It has gotten so \ndifficult around here that we have Velcro as to what they are stopping.\n  If there is no more time to be used on the Republican side, we could \nstart the vote early. We are going to start the vote early. We were \ngoing to consider having it started at 3 o'clock. There are some people \nwho want to leave and we have some coming back. Anyway, I have gotten a \nnod to yield back all time for both Democrats and Republicans, and I \nask that the vote start.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, over the last several weeks, I have \ncome to the Senate floor to discuss my ideas on how to address the high \nprice of gasoline in this country. I understand the toll these high \nprices are taking on the American people, and I understand the grave \nconsequences of continuing our cycle of dependence upon foreign oil.\n  Americans are looking to us for some solutions and leadership. But, \nso far, all they are getting is gridlock and fighting. However, I think \nthere are some things that we ought to be able to come together on that \nwould truly address the fundamental global supply and demand imbalance. \nToday, I would like to talk about them with the Senate and anybody who \nis interested out in the hinterland of America.\n  This morning, my friend, the senior Senator from New York, said the \nRepublican leader was incorrect in his assertion that the Democrats do \nnot want to increase American oil and gas production. I was glad to \nhear him say that because given the votes that the other side has \ntaken, I had my doubts. Just in the last month alone, they have opposed \nexploring in Alaska, opposed deep sea exploration, opposed lifting the \nmoratorium on final regulations for commercial leasing of oil shale, \nand they have opposed converting coal to liquid fuel. That liquid fuel \ncould be used by the U.S. military, as an example. They will be using \nit in one way or another. They could use the liquid that comes from \nconversion from coal.\n  In fact, in the past, a large majority of the other side of the aisle \nhas opposed taking inventories on our U.S. lands to simply find out how \nmuch oil and gas we actually have. Why would that proposition be \nobjectionable? Wouldn't it seem appropriate, with such large resources \noffshore, that we would inventory them, even if it costs some money? \nThe amount we could find out there may be terrific and tremendous in \nsize. Yet we have had objection to even doing that.\n  If the United States were to explore in our deep sea and move to \ndevelop our vast quantities of oil shale--just those two things--we \ncould completely shift our dependence upon foreign oil in ways I \nsuspect my friends on the other side of the aisle don't even realize. \nThe amount of oil shale potential alone in our Nation is massive. This \nmorning, I met with officials from the Department of the Interior who \ntold me that in the coming decades, American companies are predicting \nproduction of up to 3 million barrels per day from our American oil \nshale. That gives us a good idea of just how much our Nation has at its \ndisposal that we are not taking advantage of.\n  Nevertheless, my friend from New York pointed out that he supported \nmy effort in 2006 to open a portion of the Gulf of Mexico to \nexploration. In fact, he even said he ``helped lead the charge.'' Well, \nif that was the case, then I invite him to help me once again lead the \ncharge to increase domestic production. Everything I have tried so far, \nhis side has said no to. Tell me, what proposal will get them to say \n``yes''? The Senator knows that I have been here a long time, and I \nhave had a hand in passing many pieces of legislation. I understand it \nusually takes some bipartisan compromise to get something done. So I \nsay to my friend, on the production side, how can we compromise?\n  One reason I have been so discouraged about our ability to get \nsomething done is because even a limited, reasonable proposal to allow \none single State to explore natural gas was rejected by the other side \nlast year. My good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner--who you all \nknow is respected for his bipartisanship--introduced an amendment a \nyear ago this week, with Senator Webb's support, that would have \nallowed his home State to conduct natural gas exploration in the deep \nsea over 50 miles off the coast. He did this because the Democratic \nGovernor of Virginia, and Republicans in the legislature expressed \ninterest in possibly developing Virginia's coastal resources.\n  It all sounds pretty reasonable, doesn't it? What is the harm in \nletting Virginia explore for natural gas if Virginia is interested in \nit? And yet Senator Warner's amendment was defeated by the Senate. Six \nMembers from the other side of the aisle voted for it, and 39 voted \nagainst it--including my friend from New York.\n  America has enormous oil and gas resources. Total offshore oil \nreserves are around 85.9 billion barrels of oil. Over 19 billion of \nthat is completely off-limits for exploration. On shore, we have 30.5 \nbillion barrels of oil, and over 60 percent of it is considered off-\nlimits. We have over 1.6 trillion barrels of oil equivalent in oil \nshale, which is the equivalent of more than three times the oil \nreserves of Saudi Arabia.\n  This policy of taking our own resources off the table simply makes no \nsense, especially when we face a price of $135 per barrel of oil and $4 \nper gallon of gasoline. No other nation in the world deliberately \nprevents itself from using its own resources. Look around the world--\nBrazil, Norway, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Russia and many others. \nThey are producing their own oil and gas off of their own shorelines. \nSo I sincerely hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will \njoin with me to try to find a way to allow States that wish to explore \n50 miles off their coasts to be able to do so.\n  The other side of the aisle frequently tells us that we can't drill \nour way out of this problem. This morning, the majority leader said \nthat the ``answer to this is not drill, drill, drill.'' I agree with \nhim. He is right. The answer to this problem is not just ``drill, \ndrill, drill.'' There is no question that our long term future requires \nus to find solutions other than drilling. We need to reduce our \ndependence on oil from all sources. But we need to build a bridge to \nhelp get us there. On the far side of the bridge is a world in which \ncellulosic ethanol and plug-in hybrid vehicles are available and \ndeployed on a wide scale basis. But in the near term our experts tell \nus we need oil to fuel our economy and our lives. So the question \nremains: is Congress going to choose to create jobs and revenues in \nAmerica by exploring for our own oil and gas, or are we going to \ncontinue to increase our deficit by purchasing foreign oil in greater \nquantities?\n  In order to get across this bridge I just described to secure an \nenergy future, we need to develop our own natural resources. So let's \nbuild this bridge to a cleaner, more independent energy future by \nincreasing domestic production here at home. It will take time and \ninvestments. Congress has already made great progress developing these \nresources for the long term and for the future of this country, but we \nare falling short in the near term. So let's come together in a \nbipartisan fashion to build a bridge to the future and begin to reduce \nour reliance on foreign oil.\n  I truly believe that if we decided we could do this, the independence \nthat would be shown to the world because of the great quantities we \ncould say we would produce for ourselves, for the world inventory, \nwould have an immediate impact on those who are speculating and those \nwho are counting on a future of shortage. When they see the United \nStates is going to do something about it, it can do something rather \nsignificant, I am convinced.\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\n  We don't need to look at those other countries in awe when we have at \nhome great resources that we are refusing to explore just because we \nrefuse to do it. There should be no higher priority than the \nexploration of these resources, unless it is some great national \ninterest that takes over and takes place and displaces this enormous \ninterest we have to stop sending $125 a barrel to a foreign country for \nevery barrel of oil we use.\n  I repeat what I have said before: We are growing poor--p-o-o-r. Our \neconomy is not flourishing, and we are asking why. We are being given \nall kinds of reasons. This Senator says one of the big reasons is that \nwe are approaching the time when we will have sent $600 billion a year \nto foreign countries just for the crude oil we consume at home. If we \nhave some of that locked up offshore of our country, we should say: \nWhere is it, and what damage will it do if we use it? The answer will \nprobably be that we have plenty and there will be no damage to use it. \nAnd if we move it out 25 or 50 miles from the shoreline into deep \nwaters, there will be no damage to anyone.\n  This technology has been perfected. Hurricane Katrina hit a part of \nthe offshore where we had many of these rigs. Some were old and some \nwere brandnew technology. It didn't matter, the technology was strong \nenough to where there was no leakage, no oil was spilled.\n  I believe my friend has been waiting; therefore, I will not use my \nlast 2 minutes. I will certainly yield to my good friend from \nConnecticut. I told the Senator that if he lets me go first, good \nthings would follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Energy Production\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, who \nis a wonderful friend. I appreciate his kindness and generosity.\n  I wish to speak, if I may, about the so-called Merida Initiative. \nThis is a proposal which was made by President Bush, along with \nPresident Calderon of Mexico, to deal with the raging drug violence \nthat is occurring along the Mexican border, particularly in Mexico \nitself. However, I also wish to briefly address, if I may, the issue of \nenergy production.\n  We had this debate earlier this week on energy issues. I know one of \nthe arguments being raised is, of course, that we are denying the oil \nand gas industry the opportunity to drill for more of these products \noff our own shores, and if we did more of that, then we would be \nreducing our problems and bringing down costs.\n  Let me announce to my colleagues that I intend to propose legislation \ndirectly addressing this issue of oil production and development. I \ncommend the Members of the other body--Congressman Markey, Congressman \nHinchey, Congressman Rahall, and Congressman Emanuel. They proposed a \nbill over there, which I will offer here, which addresses this issue.\n  We hear this argument that if we allow production in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge and some of the coastal regions, we will be in \ngreat shape. But, Mr. President, there are 44 million offshore acres \nthat have been leased by the oil companies, but these companies have \nput only 10.5 million of those acres into production. Of the 47.5 \nmillion onshore acres under lease for oil and gas production, only 13 \nmillion are in production. Combined, oil and gas companies hold leases \nto 68 million acres of Federal land and waters on which they are not \nproducing any oil and gas, despite the fact they have the leases and \ncould be drilling there. Compare that with just 1.5 million acres of \nANWR that proponents of drilling say they want us to open. The vast \nmajority of oil and natural gas resources on Federal lands are already \nopen for drilling, and they are not being tapped.\n  I hear complaints about the 1.5 million acres closed off in ANWR, and \nyet we are sitting on roughly 68 million acres under lease but not in \nproduction--why don't they talk about that?\n  So our bill is basically a ``use it or lose it'' lease idea. If you \nare going to sit on these leases and do nothing with them, then you \nought to be paying a higher fee. In our proposal, this fee would be $5 \nper acre per year for the first three years. We would then raise the \nfee, if the property remains unused, to $25 per acre in the fourth year \nand to $50 per acre in the fifth year and beyond. This will be an \nincentive to companies to put these millions of acres where leases have \nalready been granted for oil and gas production to actually use this \nland they control. This is our answer to the great complaint: Let us \ndrill in ANWR. Why not use the leases you have already been given?\n  I will offer that legislation.\n  By the way, the revenue that would come in from those production \nincentive fees would be devoted to the development of wind, solar, \nother alternative energy ideas, weatherization programs, and, of \ncourse, low-income energy assistance, to help with what is sure to be a \nstaggering cost for moderate and lower income families come next \nwinter.\n  This is an idea that I think will debunk this notion that if we can \nonly produce more by drilling in new areas, we will solve our energy \nproblems. Well, why aren't you drilling on the millions of acres you \nhave leases on already instead of complaining about 1.5 million acres \nor a few more offshore when there are literally millions of acres \nalready under lease that oil companies are doing nothing with? If they \nare not going to drill on it, they are going to pay more.\n\n\n                           Merida Initiative\n\n  Madam President, I wish to address the Merida Initiative. As all of \nmy colleagues are aware, this bilateral initiative, the Merida \nInitiative, is a proposal between the United States and Mexico designed \nto combat the shocking increase in drug-related violence in Mexico over \nthe past year.\n  Last weekend, I spent the weekend at an interparliamentary meeting in \nMonterey, Mexico, with our colleague from Tennessee, Senator Corker, at \ntheir annual meeting. This is the 47th gathering of the bilateral \nMembers of Congress of the United States and Mexico to meet and talk \nabout bilateral issues. I am pleased that this was my 20th or 21st year \nin which I participated in these bilateral meetings with our neighbors \nto the south. But the issue of the drug cartels and the violence they \nare causing in that country, not to mention our problems on the border, \nwas the dominant theme of this past weekend's gathering. Much of the \ndiscussion, as I say, focused around this initiative, in large part \nbecause of the grotesque increase in drug-related violence in Mexico \nwithin recent months.\n  While in Mexico, I expressed my condolences to the Mexican people on \nbehalf of our colleagues here and the American people for what they \nhave gone through. Some 4,000 people, police officers, military \npersonnel, have lost their lives to the drug cartels in recent months, \nincluding the assassination of the chief of police of the country, \nMillan Gomez, who was gunned down inside his home. Cartel members \nwaited inside his house to assassinate him. This would be tantamount to \nthe Director of the FBI being gunned down in his home in the United \nStates. That is how violent these cartels are. That is how unafraid \nthey are of any retribution. So I think the notion of cooperation \nbetween our two countries is absolutely critical.\n  Mexico, as I said, has been under siege, and they need and deserve a \ncombined effort. Though it is the Mexican people who bear the brunt of \nso many of these problems they are facing, there are, indeed, common \nsecurity challenges affecting both of our people. So let me say \nunequivocally that the United States is committed--I believe all of us \nare--to helping and working with our colleagues, our neighbor to the \nsouth, Mexico, to end such violence.\n  President Calderon of Mexico made a very sincere gesture in reaching \nout to the United States for cooperation in this battle. Combating drug \ntrafficking and related violence and organized crime through \nintelligence sharing, law enforcement, and institution building is \ncritically important.\n  But it was unfortunate that the proposal that was made to the Mexican \nGovernment by the Bush administration lacked any input or consultation \nwith the respective two legislative bodies. That was not just a \nviolation of good manners. Rather, if you are going to propose these \nkinds of initiatives, it is critically important that you invite the \nMembers of Congress who will have\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\nto appropriate the money and be responsible for the oversight of these \nprograms. So at the outset you need to involve Democrats and \nRepublicans in both Chambers, not because you fear they are going to \nobject to the proposal, but because you are going to need their ongoing \nsupport.\n  In the case of the Merida Initiative, while all the good intentions \nare there, when you announce these proposals and do not invite input, \nyou invariably end up with a train wreck that caused the problems that \nI had to listen to all weekend long in Mexico about whether we are \nputting conditions on these proposals, in some way limiting them or \ncertifying this kind of financial assistance to Mexico, which was met \nwith incredible hostility by every political party in the country--\npolitical parties that rarely agree on anything, by the way, but on the \nresponse to the Merida Initiative, there was unanimity among the \npolitical parties in Mexico despite what I think is a clear desire to \nsee the kind of cooperation we absolutely need if we are going to have \nany success at all in taking on these cartels.\n  There also needs to be more accountability on both sides of the \nborder. My primary concern is that Merida, as presented to both \nCongresses, focuses too much on the short-term fixes, which are of \ncourse needed, and very little on the longer term problems which we \nmust address. I do not and would not object to this program on that \nbasis alone, but I think it is important that we acknowledge this \nshortcoming.\n  No one denies that we need well-trained and well-equipped police \nforces to confront the most violent criminals, and no one doubts that \nMexico urgently needs assistance fighting these violent criminals. They \nare tremendously well financed, and they are incredibly well armed. \nThey have equipment and armaments that would compete with almost any \nmilitary in the world, let alone a police force.\n  But what is equally needed is well-trained and well-equipped civilian \njudicial authorities and institutions to enforce and uphold the rule of \nlaw. We must work to combat corruption and do a better job of sharing \nintelligence.\n  These are all commonly held goals. We must tackle the larger, \nsystemic problems which only exacerbate the drug trafficking and \nviolence we witnessed over the last number of months.\n  Only by creating robust economic alternatives to the drug trade can \nthe United States and Mexico together build the kind of future that \nreduces the number of people who enter into the drug trade either by \nforce or by choice. That is why I am very supportive of an approach \nthat more broadly promotes regional trade and political engagement, an \napproach that fosters sustainable growth through private investment, \nincreased foreign aid, and supports regional institutions, such as the \nInter-American Development Bank. Given our shared border of thousands \nof miles, the United States and Mexico must also deepen their bilateral \npartnership in ways that are mutually beneficial, such as more closely \ncoordinating border security to ensure our goods and services can move \nthrough more effectively and efficiently. We should promote more \nbusiness and cultural ties and more direct investment across the border \nas well. The United States must also support Mexico's integration with \nits southern neighbors as well and the role they play in both of our \neconomies.\n  While a bilateral approach will be necessary, given the interrelated \nnature of our economies, a regional approach will be required to ensure \neffective and sustainable economic growth over the long term.\n  In addition to fostering sustainable economic development, we must \nalso cooperate on financial intelligence and counter money-laundering \nprograms and combat the black-market peso exchange which undermines the \nvery economic alternatives we are trying to create on a bilateral \nbasis.\n  In addition, of course, our own country must take responsibility for \nour contributions to the growing insecurity and to the violence that \noccurs in Mexico. Though we often fail to admit it or take action to \naddress it, one of the biggest markets for illegal drugs, and by far \nthe largest supplier of weapons to some of the most violent cartels in \nCentral South America and Mexico, is, of course, our own country. Any \nsustainable effort to reduce trafficking and violence in Mexico must \nseriously address problems on both sides of the border, and here, I \nthink, Merida, while it is a very good proposal and idea, falls a \nlittle bit short.\n\n  Despite all this, Merida is a very good first start, and I support \nit. Despite the failure of this administration to work with and consult \nDemocrats and Republicans in both Houses, which should happen if we are \ngoing to succeed with this initiative, and despite the fact Merida is \nfocused too much, in my view, on short-term fixes, and despite the fact \nCongress will most likely not be able to fully fund Merida as much as \nwe would like--given problems in other places around the world, \nincluding Burma and Darfur, U.N. peacekeeping and food aid--this is a \ngood beginning and it is deserving of our support--identifying the \ncommon concerns we share with our neighbor to the south.\n  While in Monterrey, I heard many concerns voiced by our Mexican \ncounterparts about some of the language in the Merida Initiative, \nparticularly language which many of our friends to the south are \ncalling conditions in the legislation. Let me be clear, at least for my \nown part. The intent of the Senate language is not to condition our aid \nbut rather to insist--as Mexicans ought to as well--on accountability \nfrom both our administration and from the Government of Mexico.\n  I, for one, am not going to sign off on a blank check that does not \ndemand accountability from this administration. Of all the terrible \nlessons we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, surely one is that more \naccountability can only be a positive thing, not only to guarantee \ntaxpayer money is being well spent but also to sustain these programs \nover the longer term. That said, I understand Mexico's sensitivity to \nthe idea of conditions, and I agree with those sensitivities.\n  Many in this Chamber will remember the arduous and contentious \ncertification process we used to use to determine whether Mexico was \ncooperating in counternarcotics programs. My friend and colleague, \nSenator Pat Leahy, has been a hero on these issues, to me and many \nothers, over many years. His concern about human rights and \naccountability of dollars is long-standing and never focused on any \ncountry, or one specific issue. He is concerned, as he should and all \nof us should be, to make sure we abolish the certification process.\n  He was not only cooperative but also understood better than most when \nthe debate raged in this Chamber about a certification bill, because \nrather then ensuring cooperation on counternarcotics operations, all \ncertification ensured was that the United States and Mexico would \nsimply feud day in and day out over what qualified--a development that \nbenefitted no one but the drug traffickers.\n  So as a joint effort, we were able to change that certification \nprocess. And cooperation improved dramatically as a result, I might \nadd. So I support the work Senator Leahy is engaged in. I explained to \nour Mexican counterparts what his intentions were in regard to the \nMerida Initiative, and because of the negotiations we have had over the \nlast number of days, I believe the Merida Initiative, as constructed, \nis going to work well and be received well.\n  The people of Mexico, indeed, Latin Americans in general, have no \ngreater friend than Patrick Leahy, a Senator who champions human rights \nand has worked throughout his career to foster closer ties and change \nin our hemisphere.\n  The United States--including myself, Senator Leahy, and others--is \ncommitted to addressing many of the concerns voiced by Mexico and to \nreaching a compromise acceptable to everyone, a compromise that will, \nin the words of Senator Leahy, ``provide support for the Merida \nInitiative in a manner that addresses our shared interests and \nconcerns.''\n  So rather than characterize these ongoing talks with our friends in \nMexico, as some have in the United States, as ``rejecting Merida'' or \n``abandoning Mexico'' or an ``infringement on sovereignty,'' I believe \nwe have an obligation--both countries do--to share responsibilities \nwith our executive branch, to tone down the rhetoric, to lower the \ntemperature, and to work together to craft an effective broad-based\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\nstrategy that combats drug trafficking, takes on these cartels, and \nlets them know they are never going to prevail in the efforts they are \nusing today to advance their narcotics trafficking.\n  It is important that the cartels understand this debate about the \nMerida Initiative in no way should be construed as a retreat from our \ncommon goals to see that the cartels are soundly defeated; that they \nare wiped out as cartels trying to do what they do every day.\n  Secondly, the audiences in our respective countries should understand \nthat we will work cooperatively, that we will work together to advance \nthis cause. I believe that is a sentiment that we all share in this \nChamber, and that people across this country share too.\n  So working together, I think we will get Merida right. I am confident \nthat, in the end, we will produce an agreement that will be acceptable \nto both the Mexicans and Americans so we can join together in building \na safer, more productive future and successfully combat those engaged \nin the violence within Mexico and along our border area. That is our \nshared goal. That is the kind of lasting change I think we all want. \nAnd through this process, this is what I believe we can produce \ntogether.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague from Pennsylvania, who is here and \nready to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                        U.S. And Iraq Agreements\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to discuss two agreements under \nnegotiation between the United States and Iraq that have grabbed \nheadlines in recent days as more and more Iraqi politicians announce \ntheir strong opposition to these agreements. The two agreements will \nshape the presence of American military forces in Iraq long beyond the \ntenure of the current administration. Unfortunately, the \nadministration, in my judgment, is handling these negotiations in the \nsame manner that has characterized its entire approach to Iraq since \n2003. Its approach is this: unnecessary secrecy, a disdain for \ncongressional input, and an arrogant insistence that its course of \naction--the administration's course of action--is the only reasonable \noption.\n  Let me talk about each of these agreements. The first agreement to \nwhich I am referring is a proposed Status of Forces Agreement, known by \nthe acronym SOFA. The Status of Forces Agreement would define the \nauthorities, privileges, and immunities of American troops on Iraqi \nsoil and allow U.S. forces to remain in Iraq beyond December 31, when a \nU.N. Security Council mandate, authorizing the presence of coalition \ntroops, is scheduled to expire. Administration officials insist the \nextension of the U.N. mandate, which has been repeatedly renewed on an \nannual basis, is no longer possible; the Iraqis seek to return to a \nnormal status in the international system and no longer want to be the \nsubject of a U.N. authorized military operation.\n  The second agreement involves a more ambiguous ``strategic \nframework,'' which would lay out the broad political, security, and \neconomic ties between our two nations. While the administration walked \nback from previous statements indicating the United States is prepared \nto offer a binding security guarantee to Iraq's Government to come to \nits defense in the event of foreign aggression or internal turmoil, it \nis still prepared to agree to ``consult''--consult--with the Iraqi \nGovernment under such circumstances. While the promise to consult, in \nthe event of aggression, has been extended by the United States to many \nnations around the world, and is known in diplomatic jargon as a \n``security arrangement,'' it still raises concern when the United \nStates maintains a large-scale troop presence in a nation. Any promise \nto consult with a foreign government takes on much greater weight when \nmore than 100,000 troops are stationed there.\n  The Congress and the American public first learned of these two \nproposed agreements when President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki \nsigned a ``Declaration of Principles'' last November, outlining their \nshared intention to conclude negotiations by July 31. A week later--a \nweek after July 31--joined by five other Senators, I sent a letter to \nPresident Bush expressing deep concern over the proposed security \nguarantees to the Iraqi Government and the insistence of the \nadministration that it could conclude both these agreements without--\nwithout--congressional input or approval. Since then, many Members of \nCongress, on both sides of the aisle, I might add, have expressed deep \nunease with the administration's approach. Some of the questions we \nhave raised, including at a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations \nhearing in April, include the following: Here are a couple pertinent \nquestions we should be asking and the administration should be \nanswering.\n  First, why the sudden insistence on a termination of the U.N. \nSecurity Council mandate for the U.S. and other coalition troops in \nIraq at the end of this year? Why not simply extend the mandate for \nanother year and allow the next President to negotiate a bilateral \naccord with the Iraqis instead of a lameduck President?\n  Why would we accept a bilateral accord with the Iraqi Government that \nincorporates greater restrictions--greater restrictions--on U.S. \ntroops, including limitations on the authority to conduct combat \noperations and detain prisoners of war than the current mandate? Why \nwould we agree to that? I am a strong opponent of an open-ended U.S. \ncombat presence in Iraq, but so long as American troops remain in Iraq, \nthey should retain the discretion to conduct necessary operations to \nensure their safety and security. American troops can never answer to a \nforeign government, especially one as dysfunctional as the Iraqi \nGovernment is now.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S5568, June 12, 2008, the Record reads: I am a strong \nproponent of an open-ended U.S. combat presence in Iraq.\n  \n  The online record has been corrected to read: I am a strong \nopponent of an open-ended U.S. combat presence in Iraq.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Why has the Iraqi Government committed to submitting these agreements \nto the approval of the Iraqi Parliament, acknowledging a national \nconsensus in Iraq must exist to support their implementation. Yet the \nBush administration stubbornly insists the Congress of the United \nStates--the Congress--can have no formal role in approval, even \nrefusing to share a draft text with key Members of the Congress.\n  Finally, why did the administration first characterize the Strategic \nFramework Agreement as a nonbinding ``declaration'' but has now changed \nits tune and has agreed, at the request of the Iraqis, to categorize it \nas an executive agreement that imposes binding obligations on both \nsides?\n\n  At a news conference yesterday during his overseas trip to Europe, \nPresident Bush responded to a question on the ongoing negotiations by \nasserting:\n\n       There's all kind of noise in their system and our system. I \n     think we'll get the agreement done.\n\n  Well, this isn't noise, Mr. President. What you are hearing is \nbipartisan unease over the course of United States-Iraq negotiations \nand puzzlement over the supposed urgency of concluding these accords \ninstead of merely extending the U.N. mandate.\n  For the President of the United States to dismiss these concerns \nexpressed by some of the leading foreign policy and national security \nvoices in the Congress as mere ``noise'' is offensive and I think \nrepresents a fundamental misreading of our constitutional system of \ngovernment.\n  As on other issues, I encourage the President to listen closely to \nhis Secretary of Defense. In a television interview yesterday, \nSecretary Gates responded to a question over congressional input on \nthis issue and on these agreements by acknowledging:\n\n       If it emerges in a way that does make binding commitments \n     that fit the treaty-making powers or treaty ratification \n     powers of the Senate, then it will have to go in that \n     direction.\n\n  Let me conclude with this. There is no urgency to concluding long-\nterm agreements that define the future of U.S. military presence in \nIraq. There is even less reason to conclude agreements that impose \nunhelpful restrictions on American military personnel and obligate the \nUnited States to an ambiguous commitment to Iraq's future security. I \nurge the President to acknowledge the importance and essential role the \nCongress has to play. If the President insists on completing these \nagreements during the last days of his administration, he should fully \ninvolve the relevant congressional committees in the ongoing \nnegotiations and agree to submit any final accords for congressional \napproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nPreserving Access to Medicare Act. It was introduced by the ranking \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and I have \ncosponsored the act.\n  Having practiced medicine for almost 25 years, I can tell you that \nour Nation's health professionals and our hospitals face tremendous \npressures. If these pressures are not addressed, it can and it will \nimpede access to quality health care services. That is why we must act \nnow to stop the upcoming Medicare physician reimbursement cuts.\n  But this is not just a physician issue, it is a Medicare access issue \nand a Medicare quality issue. If Congress does not act, many Wyoming \nphysicians could be forced not only to stop seeing Medicare patients, \nsome could decide to lay off staff, to restrict office hours, or may \neven leave rural America and move to the big cities.\n  We, the Senate, must put aside partisan differences and craft a \nreasonable bill that President Bush can and will sign into law before \nJune 30. But we have to act quickly. Senator Grassley has offered \nlegislation that would allow us to do that. The Preserving Access to \nMedicare Act provides a \\1/2\\-percent physician update for the \nremainder of 2008. It also makes sure doctors will receive a 1.1-\npercent update in 2009. These payment increases will preserve access to \nhealth care for millions of Medicare beneficiaries. But the Grassley \nbill accomplishes much more. It improves the quality of care and it \ngives doctors an incentive to report quality measures. Senator \nGrassley's measure also retains the Physician Assistance and Quality \nImprovement fund. Congress created that fund specifically to help stop \nfuture cuts. The bill that has been defeated eliminates this fund.\n  The Grassley proposal promotes e-prescribing, it promotes electronic \nhealth records, and it returns ownership of oxygen equipment to the \nsupplier, not the beneficiary. The bill curbs abusive Medicare \nAdvantage marketing practices, but it does not make large across-the-\nboard cuts to Medicare Advantage. Doing so would disproportionately \naffect patients in rural areas and it would alter policies designed to \nmaximize patient choice. Most importantly, the Grassley bill protects \naccess to quality health care for rural patients.\n  By now it should come as no surprise that rural health care issues \nare near and dear to my heart. I practiced medicine in Casper, WY, for \nalmost 25 years, so I have some firsthand knowledge of the obstacles \nfamilies face to obtain medical care in rural America. I also \nunderstand the challenges our hospitals and providers must overcome to \ndeliver quality care to families in an environment with limited \nresources.\n  In my maiden speech on the floor of the Senate, I made a simple \npledge to the people of Wyoming. I promised them I would fight every \nday, I would fight every day to strengthen our rural hospitals, our \nrural health clinics, and our community health centers; that I would \nfight every day to increase access to primary health care services, and \nI would fight to help successfully recruit and retain health care \nproviders in rural and in frontier America.\n  Over the past year I have kept my word. Working with the bipartisan \nSenate Rural Health Caucus, I led and joined in several efforts to \npreserve and strengthen our Nation's rural health care delivery system. \nI believe the Federal Government must recognize the important \ndifferences between urban and rural health care providers and respond \nwith appropriate policy.\n  Senator Grassley's Preserving Access to Medicare Act includes a \nrobust but responsible rural health package. Most importantly, the \nSenator from Iowa pays tribute to the late Senator Craig Thomas. The \nbill's rural equity title is called the Craig Thomas Rural Hospital and \nProvider Equity Act. As Members of this body know, Senator Thomas \nhonorably served as cochair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus for over \na decade. In that position he worked closely with his caucus colleagues \nto advance rural and frontier-specific health care legislation. Due in \npart to Craig's efforts, comprehensive rural health care bills have a \nlong history of collaboration and cooperation on both sides of the \naisle and at both ends of this building.\n  For example, when Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act of \n2003, it included a broad health care package specifically tailored for \nrural communities, rural hospitals, and with rural providers in mind. \nThis was the largest rural health care provider payment package ever \nconsidered by Congress.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act finally put rural providers on a level \nplaying field with their neighbors in larger communities. With the \npassage of the act, Congress put into place commonsense Medicare \npayment provisions critical to maintaining access to quality health \ncare in isolated and underserved areas. Rural and frontier America \nachieved a significant victory, and there was much to celebrate.\n  The mission, however, is not complete. Several of the act's rural \nhealth provisions have expired and many are set to expire soon. The \nCraig Thomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act, which is a title \nincluded in S. 3118, reauthorizes expiring health care provisions \nincluded in the Medicare Modernization Act. It also takes additional \nsteps, steps to address inequities in the Medicare payment system that \ncontinually place rural providers at a disadvantage.\n  First, the legislation recognizes that low-volume hospitals have \nconsiderably more volatility over time in the demand for in-patient \nservices. This makes it very difficult for those hospitals to set \nbudget and recruitment goals. Many small rural facilities are often \nbacked into a financial corner. They are forced to convert to what are \ncalled critical access hospitals in order to make ends meet. This \nprovision will help certain rural hospitals cover the higher cost per \npatient and stay within the prospective payment system.\n  Second, the bill reinstates the ``hold harmless'' payments to rural \nsole community hospitals. This is a temporary fix until analysts can \nfind out why some rural hospitals do not perform as well under the \nMedicare Program. S. 3118 extends the geographic practice cost index \nwork floor. As we all know, Medicare payments for physician services \nare based on a fee schedule. There are three components to the fee \nschedule: liability, practice, and work. Physician work is defined as \nthe amount of time and skill and intensity necessary to provide the \nmedical services. Prior to the Medicare Modernization Act, the \nphysician work component was lower in rural communities than it was in \nbig cities. Rural physicians put in as much or even more time and more \nskill and greater intensity into their work as doctors in the big \ncities. Rural physicians should not be paid less for their work. This \nis a simple fairness issue and it is addressed in the Grassley bill.\n  Additionally, the bill would allow independent laboratories to \ncontinue billing Medicare directly for certain physician pathology \nservices.\n  Finally, S. 3118 would help rural areas maintain access to lifesaving \nemergency medical services. Senator Grassley's bill makes sure that \nrural ambulance providers receive a 3-percent add-on payment. This \nextra payment is critical and it is critical because rural emergency \nmedical service providers are primarily volunteers. They have \ndifficulty recruiting, difficulty retaining, and difficulty putting the \ntime and effort into educating the personnel. They also have less \ncapital to buy and upgrade essential equipment.\n  The Grassley legislation clearly preserves the achievements gained in \nthe Medicare Modernization Act. It also gives much needed relief to our \nrural hospitals and to our rural providers.\n  The time has come to move beyond this political wrangling. We need to \nsend a bill to the President that the President will sign. Wyoming's \nseniors and disabled patients are counting on us to get it right. We \nmust enact bipartisan legislation now that protects seniors, that pays \ndoctors fairly, and that strengthens the rural health care delivery \nsystem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, a few months ago I asked my \nconstituents in the State of Vermont, and it turns out people around \nthe country, a\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\nvery simple question. We sent out an e-mail and said: Tell me, what \ndoes the decline of the middle class mean to you personally? Not in \ngreat esoteric terms, not in academic terms--What is going on in your \nlife? Frankly, in my State we expected to receive a few dozen \nresponses. We ended up receiving over 700 responses.\n  Then I asked people in Vermont and also around the country: Tell me \nwhat these high gas and oil prices mean to you. We received 1,100 e-\nmails that came in, 90 percent from Vermont but some from around the \ncountry.\n  I want to do two things this afternoon. I want to read, in the words \nof ordinary people, what these high gas and oil prices are meaning, in \nterms of how they impact their lives; and what the decline of the \nmiddle class means in the words of people who are in the midst of that \ndecline.\n  For many years I have been very angry about the Bush administration \ntalking about how strong the economy was, how robust the economy was. \nThat is like the operation being a success except that the patient \ndied. The economy has been so great except that the working people in \nthe economy are seeing a decline in their standard of living. What we \nare seeing, generally speaking, in the economy is poverty increasing, \nthe middle class shrinking, while the people on top have never had it \nso good since the 1920s.\n  Let me read some e-mails that came to my office within the last \nseveral months, mostly from Vermont but occasionally from other parts \nof the country. This is what we heard recently:\n\n       I am a single mother with a 9-year-old boy. We lived this \n     past winter without any heat at all. Fortunately, someone \n     gave me an old wood stove. I had to hook it up to an old \n     unused chimney we had in the kitchen. I couldn't even afford \n     a chimney liner--the price of liners went up with the price \n     of fuel. To stay warm at night my son and I would pull off \n     all the pillows from the couch and pile them on the kitchen \n     floor. I would hang a blanket from the kitchen doorway and we \n     would sleep right there on the floor.\n\n  State of Vermont, United States of America, 2008.\n  Another letter:\n\n       My 90-year-old father in Connecticut has recently become \n     ill and asked me to visit him. I want to drop everything I am \n     doing and go visit him, however I am finding it hard to save \n     enough money to add to the extra gas I will need to get \n     there. I am self-employed with my own commercial cleaning \n     service and money is tight, not only with gas prices but with \n     everything.\n\n  In other words, here is an instance where a 90-year-old father is ill \nand a son cannot even visit him because of the high price of gas.\n  Another story:\n\n       My husband and I are retired and 65. We would have liked to \n     have worked longer but because of injuries caused at work and \n     the closing of our factory to go to Canada, we chose to \n     retire earlier. Now with oil prices the way they are we \n     cannot afford to heat our home unless my husband cuts and \n     splits wood--which is a real hardship as he has had his back \n     fused and should not be working most of the day to keep up \n     with the wood. Not only that, he has to get up two or three \n     times each night to keep the fire going.\n  Another story:\n\n       I, too, have been struggling to overcome the increasing \n     cost of gas, heating oil, food, taxes, et cetera. I have to \n     say this is the toughest year financially that I have ever \n     experienced in my 41 years on this Earth. I have what used to \n     be considered a decent job. I work hard, pinch my pennies, \n     but the pennies have all but dried up. I am thankful my \n     employer understands that many of us cannot afford to drive \n     to work 5 days a week. Instead, I work 3 15-hour days. I have \n     taken odd jobs to try to make ends meet.\n\n  Another story:\n\n       I am 55 years old and worse off than my adult children. I \n     have worked since age 16. I do not live from paycheck to \n     paycheck, I live day to day. I can only afford to fill my gas \n     tank on my payday. Thereafter, I put $5, $10, whatever I can. \n     I cannot afford to pay for the food items that I would. I am \n     riding around daily to and from work with a quarter of a tank \n     of gas. This is very scary as I can see myself working until \n     the day that I die.\n\n  Another story:\n\n       I am a working mother of two young children. I currently \n     pay, on average, about $80 a week for gas so that I can go to \n     work; $80 a week just to go to work. I see the effects of the \n     gas increase at the grocery stores and at the department \n     stores. On average I spend about $150 per week at the grocery \n     store. And, trust me, when I say I do not buy prime rib, I \n     buy just enough to get us through the week, and I cannot \n     afford to make sure that we have seven wholesome meals to eat \n     every night of the week. Some nights we eat cereal and toast \n     for dinner because that is all that I have.\n\n  Another story. This is an interesting story because I am sure it \napplies all over the country:\n\n       As the chief of a small ambulance service, I have seen the \n     impact of rising costs. As the service is made up of \n     primarily volunteers, we have seen our numbers decline. When \n     soliciting for volunteers in the community, we have been told \n     that they are unable to put the time in due to the need to \n     work more to pay their bills.\n       Our costs associated with running an ambulance\n\n  --this is a volunteer ambulance service--\n\n     have also risen in the last few years. When discussing with \n     our supplier fuel prices, they play a large part in the \n     increase both to the manufacturer and to transport.\n\n  Here is another story. This is just incredible. It reminds us of all \nof the ways that this increase in gas and oil is impacting our people \nand our communities. Here is this story:\n\n       My story involves my capacity as an oncology social worker \n     working with cancer patients in an outpatient clinic. I also \n     run an emergency fund through the Cancer Patient Support \n     Program which provides funds to cancer patients in need \n     during their cancer journey, including the initial diagnosis, \n     surgery, and treatment period in which they experience a \n     significant decrease in income during a medical leave.\n\n  This is an oncology worker at a hospital.\n\n       I cannot describe how devastating it has been for these \n     folks who need to travel great distances to get to and from \n     their cancer treatment and followup care with the way gas \n     prices have been. Many of these folks need to travel on a \n     daily basis to radiation therapy for several weeks, while \n     others come from surrounding counties every 1 to 2 weeks for \n     chemotherapy. The high price of gas has had a tremendous \n     impact on our ability to provide the financial assistance to \n     our emergency fund to all of those in need.\n\n  Imagine someone living in a rural area dealing with cancer, dealing \nwith chemotherapy, dealing with radiation, sick as a dog, worried about \nthe future, and then having to worry about how they can afford to get \nto the hospital to get the treatment they need.\n  Another letter:\n\n       First of all, I am a single mother of a 16-year-old \n     daughter. I own a condominium. I have worked at the hospital \n     for 16 years and make a very good salary, in the high $40,000 \n     range. I own a 2005 Honda Civic. I filled up my gas tank \n     yesterday, April 1. It cost me almost $43; that was $3.22 per \n     gallon. That was on April 1. If prices stay at that level it \n     will cost me $160 per month to fill up my gas tank. A year \n     ago it cost me under $20 to fill up my tank.\n\n  On and on it goes. I think the message is that high gas and oil \nprices are having a devastating impact on tens of millions of Americans \nin every aspect of their lives and on our economy. As bad as it is all \nover this country, it is especially bad in rural areas where people \nhave to travel long distances to work, and it is especially devastating \nin cold States where people have to spend a huge amount of money for \nhome heating oil.\n  It seems to me it is absolutely imperative that we get our act \ntogether and that we do everything we can to lower the price of gas and \noil. In that regard, let me talk a little bit about some of the events \nthat have taken place on the floor of the Senate in the last couple of \ndays.\n  I think it is interesting that many Americans have already given up \non any belief that the Bush-Cheney administration even understands the \nproblem, let alone is prepared to do anything about it. It is amazing \nthat no one even looks to the White House for leadership on this issue, \nand for appropriate reasons; that is, because Bush-Cheney, from the day \nthey have been in office, have been much more concerned about the \nprofits of large multinational corporations, including the oil \ncompanies, than the needs of ordinary Americans.\n  There are a few points that I want to focus on at this time. First, \nit is a national obscenity that at a time when oil prices are off the \nwall, when people are paying over $4 for a gallon of gas, at exactly \nthis same moment the major oil companies are enjoying recordbreaking \nprofits and are giving their CEOs outrageous compensation packages.\n  It seems to me that while there are multiple causes for why oil and \ngas are soaring, one of the reasons certainly has to do with the greed \nof these huge oil companies. And the time is long overdue for the \nCongress to say enough is enough and stop ripping off the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\n  During the last 2 years, ExxonMobil has made more profits than any \ncompany in the history of the world, making over $40 billion in profits \nlast year alone--$40 billion, one company.\n  But it is not only ExxonMobil; Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and BP \nhave also been making out like bandits. For example, in the first \nquarter of this year, BP announced a 63-percent increase in their \nprofits--a 63-percent increase in their profits--and people are paying \nover $4 for a gallon of gas.\n  As a matter of fact, the five largest oil companies, the five largest \ncompanies in this country, have made over $600 billion since George W. \nBush has been President; 7 years, $600 billion in profits.\n  Let me mention what these large oil companies have been doing with \nsome of their profits. In the year 2005, Lee Raymond, who was then the \nCEO of ExxonMobil, received a retirement package of $398 million. Let \nme repeat that. Former CEO leaves his position, retirement package of \n$398 million.\n  Workers all over this country, as indicated in the letters that I \nhave read, are finding it harder and harder to fill their gas tank and \nget to work.\n  In 2006, Ray Irani, who is the CEO of Occidental Petroleum--that is \nthe largest oil producer in the State of Texas--received over $400 \nmillion in total compensation, one of the biggest single-year payouts \nin U.S. corporate history.\n  People here tell us, often my friends on the other side of the aisle \nsay: Well, we have to trust the oil companies. They really are \nconcerned about the American people.\n  I do not think so. I think one has to be very naive to believe \ncompanies in the midst of this energy crisis, when people are \nstruggling with these very outrageously high prices, when these \ncompanies are giving hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation \npackages to their CEOs, and then they tell us that the oil companies \nare concerned about the American people. I do not think so. I really do \nnot.\n  The situation is so absurd that there was an article the other day in \nthe Wall Street Journal. Not only are these companies giving huge \ncompensation packages to their CEOs, they now have a deal that if the \nCEO dies while he is CEO, their heirs and families will receive huge \ncompensation packages.\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago, the family \nof Ray Irani, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum, will get over $115 \nmillion if he dies while he holds that job. The family of the CEO of \nNabors Industries, another oil company, will receive $288 million.\n  Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of this country people are \nsaying: How am I going to stay warm this winter? Prices of home heating \noil are soaring.\n  We need a windfall profits tax on the oil industry. We need to tell \nthem: Enough is enough. The windfall profits tax on the oil industry is \nnot the only thing that we should be doing. We need to take a hard look \nat speculation that is taking place in the industry.\n  As you well know, as I think the American people increasingly know, \nthere are estimates out there that as a result of the activities of \nmajor financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP \nMorgan Chase, and others, there are estimates that between 25 and 50 \npercent of the cost of a barrel of oil today has to do with speculation \nin oil futures.\n  Earlier last week, George Soros told the Commerce Committee that \nrampant speculation in oil and gas futures is ``intellectually unsound \nand distinctly harmful in its economic consequences.''\n  We have had representatives in the oil industry themselves who have \ntold us that speculation is one of the reasons oil prices are so high. \nMark Copper with the Consumer Federation of America told the Commerce \nCommittee last week that the speculative bubble in the price of oil has \ncost the U.S. economy over a half trillion dollars over the past 2 \nyears and has cost U.S. families an average of a $1,500 increase in \ngasoline and natural gas costs.\n  So I think those are two areas at which we have to take a hard look. \nNow, in terms of speculation, people say: Well, this sounds like a \nconspiracy theory. Well, let's talk about some recent history. In 2000 \nand 2001, as the American people well know, especially the people on \nthe west coast, Enron successfully manipulated the electricity markets \nand drove up prices by 300 percent.\n  Now, what was interesting is during the debate over this terrible \ntragedy on the west coast, what was Enron saying? They were saying: The \nreason that prices are going up is supply and demand. It is the natural \nforces of the market. Do not blame us.\n  That is what they said. I guess that is what some of the guys who are \nnow in jail, after being convicted for massive fraud, told the public.\n  It was not supply and demand, it was excessive manipulation. But it \nwas not only Enron in 2000 and 2001, in 2004, energy price manipulators \nmoved to the propane gas markets. That year the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission found that BP artificially increased propane prices \nby purchasing ``enormous quantities of propane and withholding the fuel \nto drive prices higher.'' That was the Commodities Future Trading \nCommission.\n  By the end of February of 2003, BP had almost 90 percent of all \npropane delivered on a pipeline that stretches from Texas to \nPennsylvania and New York. BP's cornering of the propane market caused \nprices to increase by 40 percent during the month of February 2004. And \nas a result of their illegal actions, our friends at BP paid a $303 \nmillion fine.\n  So we have Enron, those guys are in jail, having caused severe \neconomic damage on the west coast. We have BP, a major oil company, \npaying a $303 million fine.\n  But it goes on. In 2006, 2 years ago, energy manipulators moved to \nthe natural gas market, when Federal regulators described that the \nAmaranth Hedge Fund was responsible for artificially driving up natural \ngas prices.\n  Amaranth cornered the natural gas market by controlling as much as 75 \npercent of all of the natural gas futures contracts in a single month. \nThe skyrocketing cost of natural gas cost American consumers an \nestimated $9 billion. I should point out that the Amaranth hedge fund \neventually collapsed, as a result of their illegal activity.\n  When people say, let us take a hard look at speculation, this is not \nconspiracy theory. This is based on some very real economic realities \nwhich have taken place in the last few years.\n  Today, the price of oil has more than doubled over the past 14 \nmonths. We need to find out who is manipulating oil and gas prices. \nRight now, oil and gas futures are largely traded on unregulated \nmarkets and enormous conflicts of interest exist between investment \nbank analysts, energy traders, and employees involved with oil and gas \ninfrastructure.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has the authority and \nresponsibility to prevent fraud, manipulation, and excessive \nspeculation in U.S. commodity markets. Unfortunately, this authority \nand responsibility has largely been abdicated through the use of over-\nthe-counter energy derivatives that are largely unregulated and by \nforeign boards of trade that have received no action letters from the \nCFTC to operate terminals inside the United States, trading U.S. \ncommodities to U.S. investors free from regulatory oversight. It is \npretty complicated stuff. But the bottom line is, huge amounts of money \nin oil futures are being traded in an unregulated, below-the-radar-\nscreen market, and we don't know who is controlling what.\n  Congress needs to end what some have referred to as the ``Wild West'' \nof energy trading by requiring anyone operating a trading terminal in \nthe U.S. trading U.S. commodities to U.S. investors to register with \nthe CFTC and be subject to CFTC oversight. We also need to \nsubstantially increase margin requirements for these trades to make it \nharder for speculators to manipulate oil prices.\n  In addition, major conflicts of interest exist in the commodities \nmarkets. Goldman Sachs and other large financial institutions seem to \nhave a corner on virtually every sector of this market. When Goldman \nSachs and Morgan Stanley predict the price of oil will go up, so do \ntheir profits in the oil futures market. When ExxonMobil wants to sell \nor buy oil in the futures market, they go to Goldman Sachs or other \nlarge financial institutions. When Sovereign Wealth Funds, pension \nfunds, or\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\nsmaller dealers want to invest in energy derivatives, Goldman Sachs and \nother investment banks facilitate those trades. Goldman Sachs, Morgan \nStanley, BP and other major institutional investors even co-founded the \nInterContinental Exchange that now trades West Texas Intermediate crude \noil to U.S. investors free of U.S. regulatory oversight.\n  And when Morgan Stanley and other investment banks need insider \nknowledge of the heating oil market to benefit their traders, they \nphysically purchase large quantities of heating oil for storage and \ndelivery. This is an issue that I am paying particular attention to. \nHeating oil prices right now are skyrocketing. Right now, fuel dealers \nin my State have told me that the residential price for heating oil \nwould cost about $5 a gallon. If heating oil prices keep climbing there \nare a large number of my constituents who are in danger of freezing to \ndeath. We cannot let that happen.\n  I want to know why heating oil prices are high right now and if \nMorgan Stanley or others are manipulating these prices through \nexcessive speculation. We have got to get heating oil prices to go down \nbefore winter.\n  We need to end these massive conflicts of interest in the energy \nmarkets. There are a number of ideas that I am exploring on this issue, \nbut for starters, I strongly believe that the commodities market should \nhave similar laws prohibiting insider trading that our securities \nmarket currently has.\n  Further, we must once and for all begin to break up OPEC. OPEC is an \nillegal price-fixing cartel that is clearly in violation of \ninternational trade rules. The high price of oil is expected to \nincrease OPEC's crude oil export earnings by more than $300 billion \nthis year to a record of over $1 trillion. That is an astronomical \nfigure.\n  The time has come for the President to file a complaint with the \nWorld Trade Organization and demand the dismantling of OPEC. The ending \nof collusion with regard to oil production will result in increased \nproduction and lower oil prices.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, over the long term we need a \nstrong program to break our reliance on fossil fuels once and for all. \nThat means transitioning electricity generation away from fossil fuel \npower and demanding automobiles that get substantially more miles per \ngallon. Plug-in hybrid prototypes currently get in the range of 150 \nmiles per gallon. We need to get them out of the laboratory and onto \nthe roads. We also have to invest heavily in mass transit, including \nrail and rural bus transportation. These steps can help break the power \nof the big energy companies, reduce damage to our environment, and \ncreate millions of good-paying, green-technology jobs across the \ncountry.\n  The bottom line is this: Congress and the President can no longer sit \nidly by while Americans are getting ripped off at the gas pump, and \nExxonMobil, greedy speculators, and OPEC are allowed to make out like \nbandits pushing oil and gas prices higher and higher. The time for \naction is now. We need to lower gas prices.\n  That is something we must address, if the Congress is going to gain, \nperhaps once again--hopefully regain the confidence of the American \npeople that we understand what is going on in their lives, we \nunderstand the absolute necessity of addressing this crisis of high gas \nand oil prices, that we understand the necessity of transforming our \nenergy system away from foreign oil and our dependence on foreign oil, \naway from fossil fuels which is causing so many problems in terms of \nglobal warming, that we understand that the potential for moving toward \nenergy efficiency, toward sustainable energy such as wind, solar, \ngeothermal, biomass is sitting there right in front of us.\n  Yesterday there was a conference right here in Washington where \npeople were talking about plug-in hybrids that get 150 miles per \ngallon. These are the kinds of developments we need. There has been a \nlot of discussion about a so-called Manhattan project. I believe in it. \nI think if we focus and are aggressive and are prepared to transform \nour energy system, take on the big, powerful special interests, we can \nnot only create millions of good-paying jobs, we can reverse global \nwarming. We can address environmental concerns. That is what we have to \ndo.\n  The challenge we face is to understand that the oil industry and the \ncoal industry have put hundreds of millions of dollars into lobbying, \ncampaign contributions, advertising. They are very formidable folks. \nThey want the status quo. We have been represented by the people, \npresumably not by the special interests. Our job is to represent \nordinary people. I hope we can do that. If we do the right thing, I \nbelieve not only can we lower gas and oil prices today, we can \ntransform our energy system and create a much better tomorrow for our \nkids and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the high cost of gasoline has had a \ncrippling effect on the economy of my State of Mississippi. The people \nin my State, where earnings are below the national average, are simply \nnot able to keep up with the rising cost of living. High gasoline \nprices not only increase the cost of going to work, they also result in \nan increased cost of food and other consumables.\n  As a constituent who called my office yesterday said: I can stand the \nhigh price of gas, but my utility bills have stretched me to the \nbreaking point.\n  The Daily Journal, a newspaper in northeast Mississippi, quoted \nanother constituent, Jennifer Skinner, of Tupelo, as saying:\n\n       Working class people can barely make it. I'm a single Mom \n     with three kids.\n\n  We have been very fortunate that our farmers have been getting record \nprices for corn, soybeans, and wheat, other commodities as well, over \nthe last 2 years. While the value of these commodities is high, energy \ncosts have caused the inputs for farm operations to rise significantly. \nThis has affected costs of fertilizer, pesticides, electricity, and the \ndiesel fuel farmers use. As a result, some farmers who have worked so \nhard to produce food at a lower cost to the consumer than in any other \ncountry are not able to sustain their farming operations. These high \nprices and high costs have created a cycle of higher food costs that \nhave been added to the burden of my constituents.\n  Crude oil prices are, of course, linked to supply and demand. While \nthere are many other compounding factors, such as a weakened dollar, we \nmust remember that at the root of the problem is the increased \nworldwide demand for energy. According to the Federal Highway \nAdministration, Americans drove 12 billion fewer miles in the first \nquarter of this year compared with the same period last year. Americans \nare driving less due to increased costs. However, the decreased demand \nfor energy in America has had little effect on the increased worldwide \ndemand.\n  We know that demands for oil will continue to escalate as more \ndeveloping countries use crude oil. According to the International \nEnergy Agency, between now and 2030, China and India will account for \n70 percent of all new demand for oil. The Congress and the \nadministration must consider now how much future demands will increase \nin the coming years. While there are steps I believe the Congress can \ntake to help cope with higher prices in the short term, our future \ndemands for energy independence will require us to move to new sources \nof fuel. Americans are looking to their leaders for answers. They want \nto know what the Congress can do to help them through these hard times.\n  As we consider energy policies that will ease the burdens of higher \ncosts for our constituents and their struggling businesses, we should \nnot impose policies that create higher tax burdens or costs for energy \ncompanies. Higher taxes will not lead to lower prices but will only \nserve to increase the expenses of doing business that will be passed on \nto the consumers. Our economy relies heavily on transportation. A \npolicy that doesn't provide real long-term reforms to the way our \ncountry acquires and uses energy will not provide Americans with a \nbetter deal or a stronger economy.\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\n  While we search for better energy sources, we must remember that \nuntil developing technologies are able to create affordable and \nefficient fuels, the short-term supply-and-demand problems will still \nexist. Some Senators have called for increased exploration and \ndrilling. While I am always mindful of protecting our environment, I \nthink we need to be reminded that advancements in drilling technology \nover the last several years mean we are much better able to protect our \nvaluable natural resources as we explore for new energy.\n  In addition to acquiring more crude oil within the United States--and \noffshore drilling provides another opportunity--we should do all we can \nto promote the exploration and use of oil shale. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico talked about his views, which \ninclude the use of oil shale. It is already used extensively in many \nother countries.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, there is a potential \nequivalent of 1.8 trillion barrels of oil to be found in America alone. \nIt is my hope the Congress, the administration, and private industry \nwill come together, work together with those who are concerned about \nenvironmental consequences and impacts, deal with those challenges in a \nthoughtful and effective way, and proceed with exploration and \nextraction of oil shale. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 identified oil \nshale as a very important resource that should be developed. While \nprogress in the development of this important resource has occurred, we \nshould do more to make oil shale resources as a motor fuel into a \nreality.\n  Peter J. Robinson, vice chairman of Chevron Corporation, recently \ntestified before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and \nGlobal Warming. He said:\n\n       The search for the next source of energy--whether it be oil \n     or next-generation fuels from renewable sources--takes \n     enormous capital, specialized expertise and the \n     organizational capability that characterizes Chevron. \n     Transforming raw materials into usable energy products and \n     delivering them to market some six continents takes \n     substantial financial strength, advanced technology, and \n     human energy.\n\n  I think Mr. Robinson is correct when he says we face a huge \nundertaking in determining the next source of fuel. I also believe the \nCongress should not be in the business of trying to pick a winner for \nthe next form of energy. Rather, we should be doing what we can to \npromote all forms of alternative energies that show promise through \nappropriated research dollars, grants, and public/private partnerships.\n  In Mississippi, we are prepared to play a major role in the \ndevelopment of new energy. Our farmers have the knowledge and expertise \nto create renewable feedstocks such as corn, soybeans, timber, grasses, \nanimal fats, and even wastewater. The University of Southern \nMississippi, for example, is engaged in research to create more \nefficient and lower cost fuel cell membranes. The University of \nMississippi is using termite research in an innovative approach to \ncellulosic energy research.\n  In addition to researching alternative fuels that include waste \nwater, timber, and other feedstocks, Mississippi State University \nstudents were winners of the 2008 Challenge X Competition. This \ncompetition is a partnership between the Department of Energy and \nGeneral Motors. It challenges university students to create vehicles \nthat are more fuel efficient and produce lower emissions.\n  I am proud of my State's commitment and contribution to creating a \nbetter energy future, and I hope we can continue to work hard to make \nthe ideas and efforts of these students and university researchers and \nour entire population in our State who are involved in this challenge a \nreality.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized with unanimous \nconsent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5573-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5573-S5586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HABEAS CORPUS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  This morning, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the \nportion of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 which denied habeas \ncorpus rights to detainees at Guantanamo Bay. In making its decision, \nthe Supreme Court has recognized that detainees at Guantanamo cannot be \ndenied the fundamental legal right to habeas corpus, enshrined in the \nConstitution.\n  Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy wrote:\n\n       The laws and the Constitution are designed to survive, and \n     to remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and \n     security can be reconciled; and in our system they are \n     reconciled within the framework of the law.\n\n  I think that is a very important statement. I think it crystallizes a \nlot of the debates this Senate has been having over the past 5 to 6 \nyears. It recognizes the importance of the rule of law, one of the most \nfundamental values our country was founded upon.\n  Detainees at Guantanamo have been in a legal quagmire since 2002. As \nthe Court recognized, some have been held without court review for more \nthan 6 years--6 years--many in isolation for long periods of time. The \nCourt specifically stated it was not ruling on the issue of whether the \nwrit for habeas corpus should be issued or whether detainees should be \nreleased. Rather, the decision focused on the fact that the detainees \nare entitled to the fundamental right of habeas corpus as a means to \nreview whether they are being properly held.\n  Four times now the Supreme Court has stepped in and struck down the \nBush administration's policies at Guantanamo. Four times. In the Hamdi \nand Rasul decisions, the Court stated that U.S. law applied to \nGuantanamo and that detainees had to be determined enemy combatants \nbefore they could be held.\n  In the Hamdan decision, the Court struck down the administration's \nclaim that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the detainees at \nGuantanamo and repudiated the legal framework the Bush administration \ntried to construct to handle the trials of detainees.\n  In today's decision, the Supreme Court has once and for all made it \nclear that even at Guantanamo our constitutional principles remain \nsound. It also recognizes that President Bush's repeated assertion that \nhe has essentially unchecked powers in the war on terror is simply \nwrong.\n  Guantanamo Bay has been a case study in what not to do in the war on \nterror. Consider all the early choices this administration has made: to \ndeny the protections of the Geneva Conventions, to establish military \ntribunals based on the theory of unchecked Presidential power, to deny \nhabeas corpus and, finally, to reverse decades of old precedent and \nauthorize the use of coercive interrogation and torture.\n  These decisions by the Bush administration and its operation of \nGuantanamo will go down in history as a black mark on the United \nStates, decisions where this administration and this President simply \nforgot--or worse ignored--our own values and laws.\n  Today's decision provides another reason why Guantanamo should be \nclosed. Closing this facility is critical to our Nation's credibility \nand stature and our ability to conduct foreign policy and \ncounterterrorism operations worldwide. If there is one thing that is \nvery clear, the credibility of the United States as a bastion of law, \nof constitutional rights, and of human rights has gone downhill all \nover the world. As I have said on this floor before, I have never seen \na time in my lifetime where Americans are thought so poorly of by \ncitizens of countries that are our firm allies as well as our \nadversaries.\n  Let me be clear: I have no sympathy for al-Qaida terrorists, Taliban \nfighters or anyone else around the world who wishes to harm Americans \nat home or abroad. But I strongly believe that continuing to operate \nGuantanamo, in the face of repeated reprimands from the Supreme Court, \nthe stated wishes of senior administration officials, and a tidal wave \nof congressional and international condemnation, weakens the United \nStates in its effort to fight the war on terror.\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\n  Last July, I submitted an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 Defense \nauthorization bill to close Guantanamo. I was joined in that amendment \nby 15 cosponsors: Senators Harkin, Hagel, Dodd, Clinton, Brown, \nBingaman, Kennedy, Whitehouse, Obama, Salazar, Durbin, Byrd, Biden, \nBoxer, and Feingold. I intend to offer this amendment again this year.\n  President Bush, Secretary Gates, Secretary Rice, Colin Powell, 9/11 \nCommission heads Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, numerous retired four-star \ngenerals and admirals, as well as Senator Obama and Senator McCain, \nhave all expressed their support for closing Guantanamo.\n  It kind of boggles my mind. I was sitting in the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, when I asked the question of Secretary \nGates, and he said: Yes, I am for closing Guantanamo. I have heard \nColin Powell say: Yes, I am for closing Guantanamo. I would do it right \nnow. I have heard generals and admirals say: Guantanamo does this \nNation no good. Yet nothing changes. So the question of closing the \nfacility is when and not if.\n  Guantanamo, as I have said, is a lightning rod of condemnation around \nthe world, and not just because of a lack of adequate legal rights and \nremedies. It has also drawn criticism for the treatment of detainees \nthat violates both American and international standards, laws and \nvalues. And coercive interrogation techniques undertaken there have \nfailed to yield reliable and usable intelligence.\n  Both the Presiding Officer and I sit on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. We hear the classified data which obviously cannot be \ndiscussed here. We know there are bad people in Guantanamo, but we also \nknow there are people who are hapless victims, who may have been picked \nup just because they were in a certain place at a certain time.\n  This week I held a hearing on coercive interrogation techniques being \nused at Guantanamo. Glenn Fine, the inspector general of the Department \nof Justice, testified about his report that concluded that over 200 FBI \nagents observed or heard about military interrogators using a variety \nof harsh interrogation techniques, including but not limited to stress \npositions and short shackling, in which a detainee's hands are shackled \nclose to his feet to prevent him from standing or sitting; isolation, \nsometimes for periods of 30 days or more; use of growling military \ndogs; twisting a detainee's thumbs back; using a female interrogator to \ntouch or provoke a detainee in a sexual manner. Mr. Fine also argued \nthese techniques are not only shocking but they are less effective and \nthey produce less reliable intelligence than noncoercive means.\n  Experienced FBI interrogators agree. We heard yesterday afternoon--\nand it was kind of interesting because the minority apparently \nexercised a rule that would prevent the hearing from continuing. When I \nasked the question, why, I found it was because of my hearing, which \nwas to elucidate some, I think, valuable facts and timelines of how all \nthis happened. Fortunately, and thanks to the majority leader who came \nto the floor and recessed the Senate, we were able to conclude our \nhearing.\n  One of the people testifying was a former FBI agent by the name of \nJack Cloonan. Now, Jack Cloonan has interrogated at least six members \nof al-Qaida. He testified under oath that he was able to get \nconvictions for three of them and was able to get actionable \nintelligence for every one of them using noncoercive techniques. As a \nmatter of fact, he said these al-Qaida members were so struck by the \nprocess he used, the fairness of the process, they not only gave him \ninformation that was valuable, they are now in witness protection \nprograms. I thought that is very relevant information. Why do this if \nit isn't effective?\n  The conditions at Guantanamo have led to at least 4 documented \ndetainee suicides and another 41 attempted suicides, according to media \nreports from 2006 and 2007. More recent press accounts discuss how \ndetainees have gone mad during extensive periods of isolation, sleep \ndeprivation, and degrading treatment.\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement an article from the New York Times, dated April \n26, 2008, entitled, ``Detainees' Mental Health is Latest Legal \nBattle.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the article describes how Salim Hamdan \n``has essentially been driven crazy by solitary confinement in an 8-\nfoot-by-12-foot cell, where he spent 22 hours a day, goes to the \nbathroom, and eats all his meals.''\n  This is not about abuses from 2002 and 2003, like al-Qahtani and the \nAbu Ghraib scandal. This is 2008, and I fear it is going to continue as \nlong as Guantanamo is able to operate in its isolated setting, in a \nhighly confined environment, with no visitors and nobody able to go in \nand talk with inmates.\n  Let me say a little about the status of Guantanamo today. There are \napproximately 260 detainees being held. They can be divided into \nroughly three equal groups: those the administration intends on \ncharging with a crime and prosecuting; those the administration says \ncan be transferred to another country, if another country is willing to \ntake custody--and I will admit there are problems there. There are \ndetainees, I know, who are awaiting repatriation to their own country, \nif they will take them back. In many cases, they will not take them, \nand that is a problem. We, on the Intelligence Committee, need to pay \nattention to this and find a solution to it.\n  Third are those who can't be tried for a crime but who are deemed too \ndangerous to transfer and who, presumably, will be held indefinitely \nwithout charge.\n  I think we need to provide a legal framework for that kind of \nadministrative detention so that the detainees in administrative \ndetention have certain due process rights to ensure they can know why \nthey are there, that they can have an opportunity to rebut the charges, \nand that they can have access to counsel.\n  Since the end of 2001, nearly 500 detainees have been transferred \nback to the custody of their home nations. A group of seven Chinese \nUighers, who had committed no crime, were sent to Albania, where they \nare now held as refugees in poor conditions.\n  Exactly one man, in the 6 years Guantanamo has existed as a detention \nfacility, has been convicted of a crime. He, of course, is David Hicks, \na kangaroo skinner from Australia, who pled guilty in order to get out \nof Guantanamo. He has since been released by the Australian Government.\n  I believe there are 19 more detainees against whom charges have been \nbrought. The military commissions process is in turmoil. It is my hope \nthat with today's ruling these cases will be moved to the district and \ncircuit courts rather than the deeply flawed and separate system of \njustice set up in the Military Commissions Act, which I voted against, \nand I am very pleased I did so.\n  Guantanamo began in the Bush administration, and it should end in the \nBush administration. At every turn, the Supreme Court has struck down \nPresident Bush's policies with respect to Guantanamo.\n  John Adams said that ``we are a Nation of laws, not men.'' This \nadministration has turned that concept on its head, with President Bush \ndeciding that he alone should make the legal and policy decisions in \nthe fight against terrorism, and that the rule of law does not apply.\n  In rejecting this notion, the Supreme Court's decision today once \nagain reiterated that it would be wrong ``to hold that the political \nbranches may switch the Constitution on or off at will.'' I hope the \nadministration hears that. To me, this clearly indicates that the \nPresident's article 2 powers are limited, that his powers as Commander \nin Chief are limited, and that his powers under the war resolution and \nthe authorization for use of military force in Afghanistan are limited, \nand he must follow the Constitution of the United States. That is what \nthis decision says to me.\n  So I commend the Court for its decision. I hope the President will \nrecognize this. I suggest that he should. I suggest that after being \nrepeatedly rebuffed by the Supreme Court, the administration come to us \nand say that the time has come to close Guantanamo. I would expect, now \nthat we have both potential presidential nominees supporting closure of \nGuantanamo, we will close it. The Secretary\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\nof Defense, the former Secretary of State, the present Secretary of \nState, the co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission, Governor Kean and \nRepresentative Hamilton, and dozens of admirals and generals, recommend \nthe closure of Guantanamo.\n  When I present this amendment on the Defense authorization bill, I \nhope I will be able to press this toward a successful vote.\n\n\n                         Signing Authorization\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Tester, be authorized to sign the enrollment \nof H.R. 6124.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                             Habeas Corpus\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator, my friend from California. She is an excellent \nSenator and a very good person. She certainly tries to bring both sides \nof the aisle together. Over the years we have had a number of \ndisagreements, but that is part of the legislative process. However, \nthat has never diminished the respect that I have for her.\n  Yet the fact is, I disagree with her regarding the Supreme Court's \ndecision. This decision, written by Justice Kennedy, gives terrorists \none of the most important rights enjoyed by the people of the United \nStates.\n  We face difficult times ahead. Many have legitimate concerns about \nthe prospect of closing Guantanamo Bay and then housing these alleged \nterrorists somewhere within the continental United States.\n  These are not easy questions. However, I do not believe that the \nSupreme Court has provided the correct answer.\n  Our government has publicly stated that there have been three \ninstances in which waterboarding has been used. In one of those \ninstances, it was used against a leading terrorist who actually \nmasterminded the terrible incidents that occurred on 9/11.\n  These are interesting and difficult issues. I certainly appreciate \nthe anguish and the feelings of those who believe, as the distinguished \nSenator from California does, that we should provide these alleged \nterrorists every right that the American people have, in spite of the \nfact that these terrorists do not represent a country, do not wear a \nuniform, are willing to kill innocent human beings, and are willing to \nhave their own children blow themselves up. We have never before faced \nthese types of events in our society. Yet it is important that we not \nignore them. We are dealing with people who do not abide by the norms \nof the world.\n  Some concerned people ask, why should the terrorists have the rights \nthat everybody else has? Are we not binding future Presidents who may \nface even greater terrorist threats? Will the next President be able to \nget the information we need to protect the American people? We know \nthere are terrorists who would, if they could, not bat an eyelash as \nthey used a nuclear weapon against the innocent.\n  Sometimes we have to take stern measures to deal with these types of \npeople. It is always nice to be concerned about people's feelings and \nabout people's rights, even those of terrorists, but sometimes we have \nto be practical and pragmatic and do the things that have to be done to \nprotect the American people, and our citizens overseas.\n  These are tough issues. We should all work together to try to resolve \nthem. There are many who will believe that the Supreme Court made the \nright decision and others, such as myself, who believe that the Court \nmade a lousy decision.\n  However, I uphold the Supreme Court, even though it was a 5-to-4 \ndecision. Nevertheless, it is a decision by one-third of the separated \npowers of this country, and must be recognized as such.\n  Having said all that, I admire my friend from California. She knows \nit. We have worked together on a whole raft of issues through the \nyears. I appreciate her sincere leadership in the Senate and will \nalways appreciate knowing her and having the experience of calling her \nmy friend.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to address arguments by \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle related to energy production. \nSome Democrats are complaining that oil companies own tens of millions \nof acres of oil and gas leases on Federal lands that they are just \nsitting on.\n  Now, that is an interesting way of formulating an argument because \nsome are obviously trying to paint a picture of oil companies holding \nback production purposely to raise gas prices. Some Democrats have \nargued that the oil companies are purposefully holding back production \nto raise gas prices, and others are arguing that this fact makes it \ntotally fine to close off all our good offshore oil and natural gas and \nall our oil shale and tar sands because there are undeveloped leases on \npublic lands right now. Here we go again with the anti-oil agenda of \nthe more extreme environmentalists, which the Democratic leadership has \nadopted as their own energy policy--or should I say anti-energy policy, \nwhich is what I believe it to be.\n\n  Take oil shale alone. We have an estimated 3 trillion barrels of oil \nin the tristate area of Colorado, Wyoming, and my home State of Utah. \nThere is anywhere from 800 billion at the low end to 1.6 trillion \nbarrels that are recoverable, and recoverable at a much lower price \nthan the $135 we are paying for oil, but we're being told we can't \ndevelop it.\n  It is true that there are tens of millions of acres of leases held by \noil companies. But it is also true that they are being developed as \nfast as possible. Guess what. You cannot develop a lease on Federal \nland unless you have a permit to drill, and there is a very large \nbacklog in the permitting process on Federal lands. It is the job of \nthe Bureau of Land Management to issue these permits, and I don't blame \nthem for the backlog because they are working as hard and as fast as \nthey can. All of the environmental work has to be done before one of \nthese permits can be given. Our Nation happens to have very stringent \nenvironmental laws on oil and gas drilling.\n  In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, I supported an effort pushed by the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, who has been one of the most prescient \nforces in our Senate on energy and who was chairman of the Senate \nEnergy Committee at the time, to put more funds toward the permitting \nprocess, and that has helped to a certain degree.\n  What proof do we have that our oil companies are trying their hardest \nto develop their leases? Let's look at the numbers. In the year 2000, \nthe BLM gave out 3,413 permits for oil drilling. In 2007, just this \nlast year, the BLM gave out 7,124 permits for oil drilling. In the year \n2000, oil companies drilled 2,341 new oil wells. In 2007, again just \nthis last year, they drilled 4,640 new wells. In other words, in the \nlast 7 years, oil companies have more than doubled their effort to \ndevelop their leases on Federal lands. I am not sure how an industry \nthat is literally doubling its efforts to supply our energy needs can \nbe painted as ``sitting on their leases.'' I don't blame the liberals \nin Congress for not understanding this because it seems as if they get \nalmost everything they know about energy from the most extreme \nenvironmentalists in our society who have no problem with seeing our \npeople suffer as long as their anti-oil agenda moves forward. That is \nthe best you can call it, an anti-oil agenda.\n  In Utah, we have leases, and we have a lawsuit every time somebody \ntries to develop anything. It is ironic because the extreme \nenvironmentalists know perfectly well that oil companies are drilling \nas fast as they can on these leases. How can they be so sure, one may \nask. I know for sure because I have watched these groups do everything \nin their power through protests, lawsuits, and policy changes to slow \nthe oil companies down. The oil companies could do a much greater job \nif they did not have all of these lawsuits, slowdowns.\n  The Federal Government spends a large portion of its public land \nmanagement budget fighting these lawsuits. I have heard estimates that \nduring certain periods, up to 50 percent of the Bureau of Land \nManagement budget has gone to litigation costs. That is pathetic. Can \nyou imagine what could be done for our habitat, our forest lands, BLM \nlands, and so many other things if we didn't have all of that money \nbeing spent on lawsuits?\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\n  It is ridiculous for these radical groups to do everything in their \npower to stop energy production on our public lands and then sell an \nargument to liberal Members of Congress that oil companies are not \ntrying hard enough to drill on their own leases. They would drill a lot \nmore if they had the leases and no lawsuits in areas where they \nactually have leases.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again: Our country simply \ncannot afford to promote an anti-oil agenda. It is an agenda that will \ncause the most harm to our poorest citizens. The poorest among us spend \n50 percent of their income on energy prices mainly to get to work or to \nbuy groceries. I hope my well-intentioned but sometimes misguided \nfriends in Congress keep that in mind.\n  We have it within our power to alleviate a lot of pressure on the \nprice of oil. If we just announced tomorrow that we are going to go \nforward and do more oil and gas exploration offshore and developing our \noil shale in that tristate area, the price of oil could drop simply \nfrom the announcement. The problem is that Saudi Arabia and the other \ncountries do not have the ability to flood the world with oil and to \nbring the prices down anymore. There is such an insatiable demand for \nthe current oil that is being developed.\n  I heard familiar arguments against oil shale during the Clinton \nadministration in 1995: It will take 10 years to develop oil shale, \nthey said. Here we are 13 years later, and now they are saying: It will \ntake 10 years to develop oil shale. What if we had started to do it \nthen in a realistic fashion and we were able to get that 100,000 to 1 \nmillion barrels of oil out of each acre of oil shale in the productive \nareas of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming--keep in mind, abiding by very \nstringent environmental concerns? It is mind-boggling to me.\n  Yesterday, I was on a radio show in my State, one of the most popular \nradio shows. The announcer said: Why aren't you for the Democratic \nEnergy bill? I briefly said: Well, it is not an energy bill, it is a \nregulatory bill that will stifle energy development.\n\n  Back in the last years of the Carter administration, they put on a \nwindfall profits tax that cost us 129 million barrels of oil and sent \nthis country into a downward spiral. If you tax something, you get less \nof it. That is just a simple fact of life. But that is what my \ncolleagues are doing in their ``energy'' bill.\n  I am the author, along with some other wonderful colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, of the CLEAR Act. It took us 5 years to get the \nCLEAR Act through, if I recall it correctly, something that should be a \nno-brainer for anybody.\n  We now have the Freedom Act, which will give economic incentives for \nthe development of plug-in hybrids and other kinds of battery-operated \nelectric cars. I just saw one today that is all electric, it goes more \nthan 200 miles on a charge and goes from zero to sixty in less than 4 \nseconds. The problem is it costs around $100,000 to buy. But future \nmodels will be cheaper, and plug-in hybrids will be affordable for \naverage citizens.\n  But today, and tomorrow, and for quite a while, we're going to need \noil. I cannot believe we in this body cannot acknowledge that for many \nyears from now, we are going to have to use our oil, our coal, our \nnatural gas, and we are not going to be well off if we do not.\n  I am proud to tell you that I believe we have some 22 natural gas-\nproviding gas stations in Utah for natural gas-driven vehicles. We \ncould do that all over the country. We have 22 of them, and those \npeople are driving their vehicles--mainly Honda Civics--at a rate of 68 \ncents per equivalent gallon of gas. If we would move into these types \nof situations--yes, it would take us years to get there, and it takes \noil to fill up those intervening years--if we would move that way and \nacknowledge that this is what we have to do, within 10 to 15 to 20 \nyears, we would become very energy independent.\n  If we would develop our offshore oil instead of letting China and \nCuba and other countries come offshore and take our oil because we will \nnot allow it to be done--let the States have control over it. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer comes from Florida. If Florida does not \nwant energy development offshore, that is Florida's concern, as far as \nI am concerned. But we stop it here. There are a number of other \nplaces, such as Virginia, that would love to be able to do this and \nwould help alleviate the dependency we have right now in our country.\n  I wish we could get around these extremists who seem to control the \nliberal agenda. I wish we would work together to provide a means \nwhereby we can overcome these problems together and keep our country \nstrong.\n  We are sending upwards of $700 billion every year to other countries \nfor foreign oil, much of which comes from countries that are not all \nthat friendly to us, and it is ridiculous. It is time that we wake up \nand do something about it.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I am sorry to have gone on. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, certainly no apology is necessary from \nmy colleague. He comes to the floor very passionately and has worked \nwith great passion, and we appreciate that.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to echo so many comments \nthat were made by many of my colleagues on the great policies in the \nMedicare bill that has been introduced by the Finance Committee \nchairman, Senator Max Baucus.\n  I have, along with others, been exhausted, certainly disappointed and \ndismayed that so many in this body voted against moving forward on this \nbill today, a bill that I believe is essential to the needs and \nconcerns of so many of the constituency I represent in our great State \nof Arkansas.\n  When I first came to the Senate, people said: It is always easy to \nvote no. But to move things forward, to be progressive, to be willing \nto start and engage the debate and to move forward in starting to solve \nthe problem, that means voting yes. And sometimes it is a difficult \nvote, to move forward and to get things going, to come together, to \nwork together and to find the solutions that are necessary for this \ncountry.\n  But as we have seen time and time again in these votes, it is a \nsimple vote that happens on the other side. It is ``no.'' No, we are \nnot going to create jobs and move forward in this tax extenders bill, \nproviding tax cuts to industries for research and development and help \nin the creation of new jobs in the renewable fuels industry. No, we are \nnot going to move forward in trying to fix the concerns our \nconstituents have in their access to health care, particularly in the \nMedicare Program. ``No'' is that simple vote. The tough vote is yes; \nbeing able to say yes, it is worth it to the people of this country for \nus to come to the floor, to work together, and to be able to move \nforward in the debate. Not that any of us are going to get everything \nwe want, but it is important that we are willing to come together and \nwork on behalf of the people of this country.\n  Now, I am not sure how many of my Senate colleagues here pump their \nown gas, but I do. I drive myself, unlike many of my colleagues, and I \npump my own gas. I guess it was a couple of days ago, in between a \nLittle League game and purchasing some items for the end-of-school \nparty, that I stopped to buy my gas, and I was astonished, just as I \nhad been the time before. My son commented on the fact that it had gone \nup so much since the last time we filled up, and I am thinking to \nmyself here I am, with both my husband and me working and bringing home \na paycheck, and realizing the crunch we feel. Think of how other hard-\nworking Americans feel across this country.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has many of the same duties I do, \nwhether it is Little League or school parties or birthday events or all \nkinds of things, but I think it is so important for our colleagues to \nstop and think. Because if they do not fill up that tank, if they are \nnot going to the grocery store, as I am, and seeing the rising cost of \nfood, then they need to start. They need to understand what Americans \nout in our States, the hard-working families of this country, who are \nthe fabric of our Nation, are faced with, the decisions they must make.\n  Certainly on job creation, on moving forward with the tax cuts, we \ncould have provided those to industries and businesses, extending some \nwhere people don't know whether they are going\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nto be there, and certainly providing them the wherewithal, the \nbusinesses and industries of this country, to be progressive in \naddressing and creating the kinds of jobs we need out there in these \nnew and innovative technologies and new and innovative industries.\n  Here today, we had an opportunity to move forward on improving the \nMedicare system, the health care available to seniors and others, and \nwe missed it. We missed that opportunity. We are not here to create a \nwork of art. I say this all the time. We are here to create a work in \nprogress. Several years ago, we passed the Medicare Modernization Act. \nHere we had an opportunity to improve upon and to move forward in \nmaking sure that some of these policies in Medicare can continue to \nhappen.\n  S. 3101, the bill we tried to move forward today, contains a number \nof provisions that would improve care and access to care for low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries, and a number of important provisions to support \nour providers in the Medicare Program. Low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries, the people more than likely who are on a fixed income, \nget hit the hardest by increased gasoline prices and increased food \nprices because they are on a fixed income. So here was an opportunity \nto say yes, we understand the pain you are feeling, we are working on \nit. We know there is not a ton of immediate impact that we can make on \nthe price of fuel, but we can do some things, and here is something we \ncan do. We chose not to, because there weren't enough votes to move \nforward.\n  Besides fixing the reimbursement for physicians, it bolsters Medicare \nin rural areas and includes a number of provisions from the Craig \nThomas Rural Health Care bill, in honor of our former colleague, \nSenator Craig Thomas. That is a bill I and so many of my colleagues in \nthe Senate have supported year after year. These are not new things. \nThese are things that are essential.\n  If you look in rural America today--and I was visited in my office by \nelected officials from a county that is predominantly Federal lands. \nThey won't be able to meet their county budget this year. They are \noperating a jail that is over 100 years old and on the National \nHistoric Register, but it doesn't do the job they need it to do.\n  People who live in rural America, hard-working Americans, those who \nhave worked hard to make this country great, need us to be paying \nattention. Yet what are we doing? We are not moving forward. We are \ncontinually stymied from even getting to the debate on the issues and \noffering amendments and moving forward on these matters because people \nwant to say no. It doesn't work. We have to come away from that.\n  The bill we tried to bring up earlier today, S. 3101, would continue \nto allow exception to when seniors need medical therapy beyond current \nfunding caps. I have seniors who will not get their therapy until \nAugust because they are worried they are going to fall and they will \nneed their therapy more desperately in the last several months of the \nyear. If they use it in the first part of the year, they will hit the \ncap. So what does that do? They do not get the therapy, because they do \nnot want to reach their caps early in the year, so they are not as \nambulatory, they are more fragile, and then what happens? Yes, what \nthey anticipate does happen. They do have a fall in August and then \nthey have to go through even more extensive rehabilitation. It is not \ncost effective and it doesn't make sense. These are such smart things \nwe could do on behalf of Americans who need our help and our \nrationalization in moving forward.\n  The bill also extends a provision to pay pathologists for the \nvaluable, technical component of their services. I didn't understand \nthis one, so I took a tour of a pathology lab. I was taken through the \ndifferent processes of what happens in that pathology lab and I saw \nwhat that technical component was. There were several steps in that \npathology instrument, or that pathology series of events that didn't \ncatch the eye of the physician--the trained pathologist, because they \nwouldn't get reimbursed. He looked at me and said: Would you want that \nto be the sample of your cancer tissue, or the possibility that it is \nnot going to be caught because we are going to leave out three \ndifferent processes or three different pieces in this process? No. We \nwant to be thorough, and there is no reason why we shouldn't be.\n\n  The bill also gives Medicare beneficiaries access to cardiac and \npulmonary rehabilitation, which has already shown us to lower costs \nassociated with COPD and other respiratory diseases. These are diseases \nthat oftentimes are predominantly in older people, low-income older \npeople who live in rural areas who are least likely to be able to get \nthe help elsewhere. Why would we not want to save those dollars and \ncreate a greater quality of life for these individuals? That is an \ninvestment.\n  The bill also educates kidney disease patients with managing their \ndisease, before they end up on costly dialysis, which can drastically \nimprove their quality of life and greatly reduce medical costs down the \nroad. Again, we are talking about procedures and making sure those \nprocedures are reimbursed that are cost effective. That is how we \nimprove on Medicare.\n  We are getting ready to see an explosion of baby boomers who are \ngoing to be using the Medicare system. Why would we not want to act now \nto put in cost-saving measures that will create greater savings and \ngreater quality of life?\n  It also extends for 2 years the critical diabetes research conducted \nin the CDC and the NIH. I tell my colleagues if they have not met with \nthe families in their State who suffer from diabetes, they should do \nso. I have never in my life sat with more passionate people, \nparticularly those families who suffer with a child who has juvenile \ndiabetes, who are passionate about the idea of not only how do we find \nbetter ways to care for our children but also investing in the research \nthat will one day find the cure.\n  I looked at a mother who had tears in her eyes and she said: My \ndaughter, who is 12 years old, is going to her first sleepover, and I \nam going with her because I cannot leave her side. She needs to be so \nclosely monitored, she said. But I refuse--I refuse--not to let my \nchild have a childhood.\n  These are the things we can change, and we should.\n  Now, unlike the Republican alternative that was introduced by Senator \nGrassley, the Baucus bill also ensures that pharmacists receive prompt \npay in Medicare. As I mentioned before, I don't work under the auspices \nthat we are here to create a work of art, and when I supported the \nMedicare Modernization Act, I knew it wasn't perfect, and I knew we \nwould have to watch to see what worked and what didn't work. I went a \nstep further. I went to my State and I traveled county to county and \nhad meetings with seniors, with the AARP, with our area agency on \naging, and with Sunday school teachers to try and work through what we \nneeded to know and what they needed to know to help one another about \nthe prescription Part D in Medicare, and we had good results. Arkansas \nwas one of the top States in terms of signing up seniors and getting \nthem into the right plans, figuring out how we could help them, and \nworking through making that a success.\n  But the fact is that in rural America, oftentimes pharmacists are the \nlast touch for a medical provider. If you are in a community that has a \ncommuting physician, perhaps, or maybe you don't have a hospital and \nhave to use one in a larger MSA somewhere, your pharmacist is probably \nthe only person who is going to be there on the weekend, and it is \ncritical that we keep them in business. Well, if they do not get paid \non a timely basis--I had two, three pharmacists, at least, who had to \ntake out loans of $500,000 to be able to carry over the burden of \nproviding the prescription drugs for seniors on Medicare when we \ntransitioned into the Medicare Part D. That is unreasonable to ask of \nany small business such as that, to have to carry that over.\n  The bill we tried to move forward today also delays the harmful \nMedicaid average manufacturers price rule so that we can improve it to \nreflect the true cost that pharmacists face and to increase patient \naccess to generic drugs; again, a commonsense way to move us into a \nmore practical, more cost-effective delivery of Medicare services--\ngeneric drugs. We all talk about them frequently. Here is something \nthat would actually implement\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\nmoving in that direction, not to mention the true cost these smalltown \npharmacists face.\n  Many of them can't work within cooperatives. They don't have the \nadvantages, lots of times, of the large pharmacies out there, where \nthey can buy in these huge bulk purchases and get greater prices. We \nneed to make sure we are supporting everybody, and those pharmacists in \nrural America definitely have their needs. That was something in our \nbill that the Republicans did not address.\n  S. 3101 makes several much needed reforms to the Medicare Advantage \nProgram, or the Medicare Part C. This is something new we added. When \nCongress first decided to allow private insurers to participate in the \nMedicare Program, the health insurance industry maintained that the \nefficiency and the competitiveness of the private marketplace would \nenable them to provide Medicare beneficiaries with better coverage at \nless cost to the Government.\n  Despite congressional intent, these plans do not save the Government \nmoney. As a matter of fact, they cost the Government money. Many of \nthem offer absolutely no data to suggest they provide significant extra \nbenefits or any better quality at all.\n  Since passage of the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003, more and \nmore private health insurers have entered the private Medicare market \nand enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has increased exponentially \nacross the country. I heard someone make the comment the other day that \nthey were multiplying like rabbits, particularly in rural America. The \nhigh enrollment growth, especially for Medicare Advantage plan types \nknown as private fee for service, is alarming to me since these private \nplans are paid 20 percent more by the Government, on average, than it \nwould cost traditional Medicare to cover those same beneficiaries. So \nif they are multiplying like rabbits out there and we are paying them \n20 percent more than what we would pay for traditional Medicare fee for \nservice, we are wasting taxpayers' dollars.\n  Private fee-for-service plans are not required to create networks \nwith providers or to report any quality measures. So in terms of \ntracking whether they are providing greater quality, we have had \nstudies done, but we cannot even track the measures to determine \nwhether there is an improved quality.\n  Many seniors in my State of Arkansas have run into trouble with \nprivate fee-for-service plans. Many of them have been duped into \nsigning up for these plans through misleading or even fraudulent \nmarketing practices. Once they do sign up, they often find that when \nthey try to go to their regular doctor, their provider does not accept \nthe plan. People have signed them up for something simply to get a \nbonus for the number of people they can sign up for a plan.\n  We had one woman who came into our office. We heard about this case \nin Arkansas of a sales agent going door to door, wearing medical scrubs \nand a stethoscope, trying to enroll seniors in this plan, not knowing \nmuch about the plan, and certainly not being willing to work with these \nseniors to figure out what was best for them.\n  The Baucus Medicare bill includes a number of improvements to the \noversight of sales and marketing of Medicare Advantage plans, much \nneeded and certainly a part of our responsibility, including banning \ncertain practices such as door-to-door sales, cold calling, and free \nmeals to seniors as an enticement to sign up.\n  We saw the invitations sent out to seniors for a free meal if they \ncome and sign up for this package or seniors who simply get cold-called \nin their homes who get kind of hassled and made to feel insignificant \nto the point they say: OK, whatever, come see me.\n  It also asks the HHS Secretary to place limits on free gifts and \ncommissions to sales agents. That is completely reasonable. We have \nheard of agents getting paid $10,000 for signing up up to 150 \nbeneficiaries. That is not right. That is taking advantage of seniors \nwho may not understand some of these programs and who need more time \nand assistance to be able to figure out what is right for them if, in \nfact, they need to change at all.\n  S. 3101 also requires private fee-for-service plans and Medicare \nAdvantage to develop networks of providers to ensure care for \nbeneficiaries and to measure and report on quality of care. Plans would \nno longer be allowed to deem a hospital or provider as part of the \nplan's network without negotiating an actual contract for payment and \ncare.\n  In Arkansas, we have about 11 percent of our total Medicare-eligible \npopulation enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Most of these beneficiaries \nhave the private fee-for-service plan type, and that is why it is \nespecially critical to me that these plans work for our beneficiaries \nor, if they do not, that we get our seniors back into regular Medicare, \nwhere they can have their needs met. Let me tell you, we have worked \nhard. Some of these seniors have been duped. They called my office, we \nsat down with them, and we worked hard. Getting them back into \ntraditional Medicare fee for service where they were, and they liked \ntheir service, is unbelievably difficult getting through that redtape \nover at CMS.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric on the Senate floor lately about \n``choice'' and ``fiscal responsibility.'' However, I would like to ask: \nWhat kind of choice is it when the plan you chose doesn't meet your \nneeds, and you chose a plan because you have been harassed by people \nwho are either trying to make an extra $10,000 or who are just out \nthere trying to sign up as many people as they possibly can?\n  As for fiscal responsibility, we already know the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund is estimated to be insolvent by the year 2019. \nWhen American taxpayers are subsidizing private companies' profits \nrather than the needs of our seniors, we are simply exacerbating that \nproblem. We are adding to the debt of our children and our \ngrandchildren. I, for one, would argue this is not fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I hope we can move beyond the rhetoric. I hope we can have \nproductive, bipartisan negotiations over the next days and weeks and \nmake these many needed improvements to our Medicare Program a reality. \nSimply saying no is not good enough. It is hard to say yes sometimes, \nbut the fact is the American people need us to be working right now. \nThey need us to be focused and paying attention to the issues with \nwhich they are faced.\n  Yes, the price of gas is out of control. Yes, their food prices are \ngoing up. Yes, their health care costs are going up and their access is \ndwindling. The number of Medicare patients I know in my State who can \nno longer find doctors because doctors are no longer taking new \nMedicare patients--we actually experienced that in my own family. Our \nlifetime family physician who lived across the street passed away, my \ndad hit Medicare age, and all of a sudden we didn't have a physician. \nThese are issues people in our States are facing every single day. The \nleast we can do is bring forward measures that will show the people we \nare working toward figuring out some of these issues and some of these \nconcerns that are hitting them square in the face.\n  As I said before, I stop and pump my own gas and I do the grocery \nshopping at my house. I have to say I see what they are up against. I \nthink every one of us needs to take the time to figure out what it is \nour constituents are facing and redouble our efforts to work together \nto find the solutions that will make an impact on this great country \nand, more importantly, on its greatest asset and that is the working \nfamilies of this great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             National Debt\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the need for \nfiscal responsibility and to call attention to our ever-increasing \nnational debt. Building on a speech I gave in March, I hope to \nregularly provide my colleagues and the American people with updates on \nour growing national debt.\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\n  I recently voted against the budget bill that would have allowed the \nnational debt to increase to $11.8 trillion over the next couple of \nyears. We need to be reminded of the fiscal realities in which we find \nourselves. We cannot continue to live in the United States of Denial.\n  Behind me is a chart that shows the accumulated national debt today. \nAs of 2007, the national debt stood at almost $9 trillion. Today it is \nat $9.4 trillion, with each American owing some $31,000; that is, every \nman, woman, and child in the country owes $31,000. And the deficit for \n2008 will be added to that number, including an average $273 billion a \nyear in interest payments on that debt.\n  If interest rates increase, the interest payments could be much more, \neating up revenues that could be used for other purposes. In January, \nthe Congressional Budget Office projected a $219 billion deficit for \n2008, but they did not include the $152 billion economic stimulus \npackage that President Bush later signed into law in February.\n  With the addition of the economic stimulus bill and other recent \nchanges in the baseline, CBO's updated deficit projection for 2008 is \n$357 billion. The Congressional Budget Office number also does not \ninclude borrowing from the Social Security trust fund and other trust \nfunds to the tune of almost $200 billion.\n  We only talk about the public debt, but we do not talk about the \ndebt, the money that we are borrowing from our own Government. In \naddition to all of this, soon we are going to be considering a \nsupplemental appropriations bill to the tune of $193 billion which, \nagain, will be added to the national debt.\n  So if we are really honest with the American people, the projected \nreal debt for 2008 is $746 billion--$746 billion. That is more than \nthree times the $219 billion deficit projected at the start of 2008.\n  Now, to get an idea of how much that is, $746 billion is more than we \nspent on the war on terror, including Iraq and Afghanistan and \nelsewhere, during the last 5 years. And we borrowed every penny of it.\n  The Treasury Department in April reported that the deficit through \nthe first 6 months of the budget year to date was $311.4 billion, up 20 \npercent from the same period a year ago. That was the largest deficit \nfor the first half of a budget year on record, surpassing the old 6-\nmonth mark of $302 billion that was set back in 2006.\n  The Federal deficit through the first half of fiscal year 2008 is an \nall-time high, underscoring the pressure the budget is coming under as, \noverall, our economy slumps, spending is higher, tax revenues are \nlower.\n  But the deficit only describes the annual difference between revenues \nand outlays. And that is not what is really threatening our future. We \ndo not talk about it. It is the cumulative ongoing increase in our \nnational debt that really matters, with too many people in Washington \npretending this debt does not even exist.\n  When was the last time you heard the President of the United States \ntalk about the national debt? I cannot remember. And he happens to be a \nRepublican. One of the reasons I am a Republican is that I have always \nbelieved in balancing budgets and paying down debt. But we do not even \ntalk about it. It is not even there. It is like it has evaporated. When \nhave we heard the Presidential candidates talk about the national debt \nand what they are going to be doing about it?\n  Recently, USA Today reported that the Federal Government's \naccumulated long-term financial obligations grew by $2.5 trillion last \nyear--$2.5 trillion--as a result of the increase in the cost of \nMedicare and Social Security benefits as more baby boomers retire.\n  I think $2.5 trillion is about what we spend on everything in the \nFederal Government each year. Taxpayers are on the hook for a record \n$57 trillion in Federal liabilities to cover the lifetime benefits of \neveryone eligible for Medicare, Social Security, and other Government \nprograms.\n  If you figure it out by households, that is $500,000 per household in \nthis country. When people come to me and ask me to spend money on a \nspecial program that they want me to spend money on, I explain our $9.4 \ntrillion national debt and the fact that each of us owes $31,000. Then \nI ask them if what they want is important enough to borrow the money \nand put the cost, including interest, on the back of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n  It is an interesting question that I pose to people. And they think \nabout it. After a moment, the smiles on their faces vanish, and their \nanswer is no. Unfortunately, however, our political leaders in \nWashington hide the real budget numbers from the public and fail to \neven mention the rising national debt.\n  Most Americans are clueless as to how fiscally irresponsible Congress \nand the administration have been. The U.S. Government is the biggest \ncredit card abuser in the world. We talk to our kids and others: You \nhave to watch credit. We are the worst example of a credit card abuser \nin the world.\n  You know what. The rest of the world gets it, which is why they are \ncovering their bets on the U.S. dollar. So why do we refuse to see the \nwarning signs? A decade ago who would ever have imagined that the \nCanadian dollar would be worth just as much as the U.S. dollar? I \nremember when it was two to one. Now the dollar's value has fallen by \nhalf.\n  A few years ago, one Euro was worth barely 80 cents; now it is worth \nmore than $1.50. I think the President remembers when we were in Rome \ntogether that the dollar that we had bought 60 cents of a Euro. It is \nhard to believe. Then, to top it off, because of our deficits, we are \nforced to borrow money from other countries.\n  As a matter of fact, 51 percent of the privately owned national debt \nis held by foreign creditors. It is supposed to be held by the United \nStates; that is public debt. But they have come in and they have 51 \npercent of it. That is up from 37 percent 6 years ago.\n  Foreign creditors provide more than 70 percent of the funds the \nUnited States has borrowed since 2001, according to the Department of \nTreasury. Think about it. And who are those foreign creditors? \nAccording to the Treasury Department, the three largest foreign holders \nof U.S. debt are China, Japan, and the oil-exporting countries known as \nOPEC.\n  As you know, we are sending them a lot of money because of the high \ncost of gasoline. So we send them the money and then they come back and \nthey are now buying our companies and they are buying more of our debt. \nIf these foreign investors were to lose confidence and pull out of U.S. \nTreasurys, ``Katey, bar the door.''\n  Borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from China and OPEC puts \nnot only our future economy but also our national economy at risk. It \nis critical that we ensure that the countries that control our debt, \nthe countries that control our debt, do not control the future of this \ncountry.\n  To try to avert this train wreck, I have introduced the Securing \nAmericas Economic Future--it is a commission--legislation that would \ncreate a bipartisan commission to look at our Nation's tax and \nentitlement systems and recommend reforms to put us back on a fiscally \nsustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for \nfuture generations. My colleague, Senator Isakson, has cosponsored \nthat.\n  Over in the House, Democratic Congressman Jim Copper of Tennessee and \na Republican Congressman, Frank Wolf of Virginia, have introduced a \nbipartisan version of the same commission. In the House they have 93 \ncosponsors from both parties. This bicameral group has support from \ncorporate executives, religious leaders, think tanks across the \npolitical spectrum from the Heritage Foundation to the Brookings \nInstitution. Brookings is real liberal; Heritage is real conservative. \nThey all agree we have to do something and we have to do it fast.\n  Building on that legislation, two of my colleagues in the Senate, the \nBudget Committee chairman from North Dakota and the ranking member from \nNew Hampshire, introduced a bipartisan bill that would create a tax and \nentitlement reform task force very similar to the same commission. We \ncall it the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action. There \nare 19 cosponsors of the Conrad-Gregg proposal. I have a commitment \nfrom Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad that they were going to bring \nthis bill to the floor so we could get the commission created. It is a \n16-member commission: 14 members made up of the\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\nHouse and Senate, and then two of the other members would be the \nSecretary of Treasury and also the head of the Office of Management and \nBudget. And the vision is that we would get that legislation passed \nthis year.\n  By the way, the way it works is that if 75 percent of the people make \na suggestion as to tax reform, entitlement reform, it gets an expedited \nprocedure here, and we have an up-or-down vote like the BRAC process. \nYou can't have our colleagues spend a lot of time doing this hard work \nand not guarantee them that if most agree about it, they are going to \nget a vote and it is not going to get stalled like so much other stuff \nthat we would like to see and never do.\n  The thing that disappoints me--and I have greatest respect for the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad. We have worked \ntogether over the years on all kinds of things. He said he doesn't \nthink we are going to get it out. He said that the Democratic, at that \ntime, Presidential candidates, the last time I talked to him about it, \ndecided that ``People don't want to do something extraordinary unless \nthey are absolutely persuaded.'' I think we need to persuade our \ncolleagues and the American people that entitlement and tax reform \ncannot be put off for another day. Wouldn't it be just great if we got \nthis done? The new President comes in, puts in the head of the OPM and \nthe Secretary-Treasurer, and they go to work. It would probably take \nthem almost a year, but they would be able to come back and do \nsomething about tax reform.\n  When I tell people, they are shocked: $240 billion we all pay to \nsomeone to do our taxes. It is unbelievable. I am a lawyer. I used to \ndo my own return. I used to do returns for my clients. I wouldn't touch \nmy tax return with a 10-foot pole.\n  In fact, a couple weeks ago, my wife looked at our return and said: I \ndon't understand it.\n  I said: I don't understand it either. We have to go see our \naccountant and have him explain what this is about.\n  She said: No, you don't. He will charge us $200 an hour.\n  I have to believe there are many Americans out there who have no idea \nwhat this is all about. We have had 15,000 changes in the code. It is \noverdue that we do this. Tax reform is a no-brainer. We have to do it. \nEven if we save half the $240 billion, think of the savings to \nAmericans. By the way, that is a real tax reduction, and it doesn't \ncost the Treasury one nickel. I am hoping we can continue to push this \nwith everything we have.\n  Recently, David Walker, former Comptroller General, accepted a new \nchallenge by joining Pete Peterson's new foundation to address the \nundeniable fiscal challenges our country must face. I have known Pete \nPeterson for a long time. He is head of the Blackstone Group. He \nstated, in creating the foundation, he ``cannot think of anything more \nimportant than trying in this way to preserve the possibilities of the \nAmerican Dream for my children and grandchildren's generations and \ngenerations to come.''\n  I would like to say a few words about Pete Peterson and David Walker. \nPete is chairman of the Peterson Foundation. He was President Nixon's \nSecretary of Commerce. He was born in Kearney, NE, to Greek immigrant \nparents, received an undergraduate degree from Northwestern, and \ngraduated summa cum laude. He then received an MBA from the University \nof Chicago and is now senior chairman and cofounder of the Blackstone \nGroup. He is also chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign \nRelations, chairman of the council's international advisory board, \nfounding chairman of the Peterson Institute for International \nEconomics, and founding president of the Concord Coalition, which I \nhave worked with for the last number of years. Here is the son of an \nimmigrant who has made a pile of money, and he is so worried about his \nchildren and grandchildren. I suspect he has a little money over the \nyears, and his grandchildren and children are probably going to be a \nlittle better off than mine, most Americans. But here is somebody who \nis worried about the rest of us and our families.\n  The other is David Walker. David Walker is the president and CEO of \nPeterson. He is charged with leading the foundation's effort to enhance \npublic understanding of the sustainability challenge that threatens \nAmerica's future. If David Walker were here, he would have given a far \nmore eloquent speech than I have to explain to my colleagues and to the \nAmerican people where we are. The purpose of the foundation is to \npropose sensible and workable solutions to address these challenges and \nbuild public and political will to do something about them. Prior to \njoining the foundation, he served over 9 years as the seventh \nComptroller General of the United States and head of the U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office.\n  Here is a man who had a job, a good job, a high-paying job, and he is \nleaving it with 6 years left because he is so concerned about where we \nare. Everywhere he goes, he talks about this. I have been with him on \nseveral occasions. Somehow, we keep banging away, banging away, banging \naway, trying to get people to pay attention.\n  I have sent letters off to both the Presidential candidates. They are \nboth Members of the Senate. Why don't they sign on to Kent Conrad and \nto Judd Gregg's legislation, sign on, talk about the debt. Let the \nAmerican people know we have a problem out there and they are going to \ndo something about it. When people hear both candidates talking about \nthis program and that program and now they are counting up how much \nmoney they are going to cost, at the same time they are talking about \nthe programs, they ought to be talking about the debt. What are you \ngoing to do about tax reform? We have to ask these questions. We are \nrunning out of time.\n  I wish Pete Peterson and David Walker the best of luck in this \nendeavor. I look forward to working with them.\n  The time to act is now. When you look at the numbers, it is self-\nevident that we must confront our swelling national debt. We must make \na concerted bipartisan effort to reform our Tax Code. Nothing works \nhere unless it is bipartisan. That ought to be the flag we fly under \nthe rest of this year. Working together, like the Presiding Officer and \nI are working on a couple pieces of legislation, is the only way to get \nsomething done around here.\n  It is a moral issue. When I first introduced the legislation that \ntalked about it, I got a call from Frank Wolf, a terrific guy. He said: \nYou know, George, I want to join you. I haven't paid much attention, \nbut this is a moral obligation. It is a moral obligation to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I think most of us down here are worried about the legacy we are \ngoing to leave to the next generation. We have a lot to say about it. \nThese are challenging times. I am confident that with the inspiration \nof the Holy Spirit, maybe we will get it and get on with some of these \nthings that are long overdue so that we can get back on our feet again \nfinancially.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, before my friend from Ohio leaves the \nfloor, I want to tell him, through the Chair, that he has his finger on \nthe right issue. There are so many of us here in this Chamber on both \nsides of the aisle who recognize that the fiscal house of America is in \na disastrous condition, and how we move forward when we get a new \nPresident in 2009 is going to be very important in terms of how we \naddress the fiscal reality and fiscal challenges we face.\n  I think the recklessness we have seen with respect to this mountain \nof debt, which my good friend from Ohio has pointed out is now nearing \nthe $10 trillion mark, is something we have a moral obligation to \naddress. I know among colleagues on both sides, including Senator \nConrad and Senator Gregg, there have been conversations about how we \nmight be able to develop a process to try to get our fiscal house back \nin order. And I appreciate the leadership of my friend from Ohio on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an issue which has \nbeen talked about here quite a bit over the last several days. It has \nto do with what people think is an easy solution that will deal with \nthe gas price and energy crisis we face here in America.\n  I have heard several of my colleagues come to the floor saying we \nhave a panacea here--just develop the oil shale of the West, just \ndevelop 2 trillion barrels\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\nof oil that are locked up in the shale of the United States of America, \n80 percent of which is in Colorado, and somehow we are going to wave a \nmagic wand and that magic wand will automatically start creating these \nbillions and trillions of barrels of oil that all of a sudden will \nbring about this abrupt decline in the price of gasoline and the price \nof oil.\n  There is a lot of hot air in those statements that are being made \nbecause the reality of it is that oil shale development in Colorado is \nstill a long way away. That is because the research and development \nprogram, which we approved in this Congress, in the Senate, in the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act, contemplated that we would enter into a research and \ndevelopment phase to determine whether oil shale could be commercially \ndeveloped.\n  Why is that so important? It is important, first of all, because for \n100 years people have been looking at the possibility of developing the \noil that is locked up in the shales of mostly Colorado and some in Utah \nand some in Wyoming, and they haven't been successful. We have had the \nlargest economic bust of the West and in western Colorado in 1980s, as \nmajor companies tried to develop oil shale and found out, after \ninvesting billions of dollars, that they simply could not under those \ntechnologies.\n  It is easy to understand why. It is because when you look at where \nthe kerogen is, which is the oil substance, it is locked up in the \nrock. It is shale. There is a reason why they call it oil shale. It is \nnot kerogen. It is shale. It is rock.\n  So when my friends come to the floor on the other side and say: Hey, \nhere is a panacea to deal with the high gas prices of today, I would \nask them all, with all due respect, to simply look at the reality of \noil shale and its potential and also to look at its limitations.\n  Chevron, which is one of the largest oil companies in the world and a \ncompany that has been interested in looking at the possibility of oil \nshale development, in submitting its own comments to the Department of \nInterior's Bureau of Land Management, as they moved forward with their \nprogrammatic environmental impact statement on commercial oil shale \ndevelopment a few months ago, said:\n\n       Chevron believes that a full scale commercial leasing \n     program should not proceed at this time without clear \n     demonstration of commercial technologies.\n\n  That was a statement by Chevron on March 20, 2008. Yet there are \nmyths being spread across the country. There are people who are talking \nto newspaper editorial boards and all around the country saying that \nall we have to do in America is go to Colorado, go to the western \nslope, go get the trillion barrels of oil locked up in that rock and, \nhey, we will solve all of our gas problems in America. That is simply \nnot true.\n  I want to first go through what I think are some myths with respect \nto oil shale development, myths that have been propagated by some who, \nfrankly, have the financial interest and concerns of only the oil \ncompanies, not the interests of the environment and of developing real \nsolutions to the energy problems we face.\n  Myth No. 1 is that we on this side, including myself and other \nDemocratic colleagues, are in fact stopping oil shale from being \ndeveloped. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  In 2005, under legislation that we offered out of the Energy \nCommittee in a bipartisan way, with the leadership of Senator Domenici \nand Senator Bingaman, we included oil shale provisions which I helped \nto write. Those oil shale provisions created an orderly process for us \nto move forward with oil shale development. That legislation, which \ncame out of committee and which came out of this Chamber, included \nsponsors: Senators Hatch, Allard, myself, Domenici, and Bingaman. What \nthat legislation asked the Secretary of Interior to do--in fact, it did \nnot ask; it directed the Secretary of Interior--was to enter into a \nresearch, development, and demonstration program on oil shale.\n  Since that time, not so long ago, 2005--we can still remember that, \njust a few years ago--six of these leases have already been issued. \nFive of them are in Colorado. Three of them have been issued to one \ncompany, the Shell Exploration and Production Company.\n  Under the provisions of the law that we included in that legislation, \nit is also important to remember that with the 160-acre research and \ndevelopment lease, these companies also have the right to convert those \nresearch and development leases to 5,000 acres. That is 5,000 acres of \nour public lands for R lease. That is 5 times 5, 25,000 acres that \ncan convert over into full-scale commercial development, if they should \nso wish. So we have a program that is already underway.\n\n  Now, the Bureau of Land Management has decided to move forward with a \ncommercial oil shale leasing program under provisions that were stuck \nin, in the dark of night, in the conference committee over in the House \nof Representatives that seem to direct the Bureau of Land Management to \nmove forward with a commercial oil shale leasing program.\n  I do not believe, nor do many of the leaders in my State of Colorado, \nincluding our Governor of Colorado, that this is the way we ought to \nmove. Governor Freudenthal in Wyoming does not believe this is the way \nwe should move forward on the possibility of oil shale development. \nThey support the legislation I have introduced on how we move forward \nwith oil shale development. It is very simple legislation. I introduced \nthis legislation that would clarify the process for us to look at how \nwe move forward with oil shale development.\n  Let me simply walk through what the five steps would be.\n  First, the BLM would have 1 year to complete an environmental review \nof a commercial oil shale leasing program. That is a good amount of \ntime for the BLM to look at completing the environmental review of \nsomething which is going to be so impactful to the Western Slope and to \nthe State of Colorado.\n  Second of all, because we believe in making sure the States are \nproviding us input on these Federal lands, which is so important to us \nin the West--it is so important to us in the West in large part because \na third of my State is owned by the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment is the largest landlord we have in our State. So it has \nalways been important for us to make sure the States and local \ngovernments are having input into the development of the resources that \nare on those Federal lands. My legislation would allow the Governors of \nthe affected States to have 90 days--90 days is not a lot of time--to \ncomment on a commercial oil shale leasing program.\n  Third, the legislation would give the BLM a year to develop a \ncommercial leasing program and to propose the regulations to accompany \nit--all, I think, very reasonable pieces of the legislation.\n  Fourth, the Department of the Interior and the National Academy of \nSciences would prepare reports to Congress on the technology and the \nproposed plan for oil shale development.\n  Finally, oil shale development would have to comply with our already \nexisting environmental laws--a very simple, straightforward process for \nus to look at how we can develop oil shale.\n  There are people out there who are saying we in Colorado oppose oil \nshale development or that Democrats have opposed it. That is simply not \nthe case. We did not oppose it in 2005, and we do not oppose it today. \nWe simply say we want to move forward in a thoughtful and responsible \nway as we look at the possibility of developing oil shale.\n  So myth No. 1--that we are opposed to oil shale--is simply false. It \nis a myth. It is not true.\n  Secondly, there is another myth out there that says the current \nmoratorium which is in place as a result of legislation which the \nCongress adopted last year on commercial leasing regulations is somehow \npreventing energy companies from developing oil shale, that we are \nsomehow preventing the oil companies from developing oil shale today. \nAgain, that is a myth. It is not true.\n  The reality is, the BLM has clearly stated that the current \nmoratorium on issuing commercial leasing regulations will have no \neffect--no effect--on U.S. energy supply or on when commercial oil \nshale production could begin.\n  I have here a part of a transcript of a hearing we had in the Energy \nCommittee not too long ago, where we had the Assistant Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior, Secretary Allred, come before our committee \nand testify about the potential of oil shale. It debunks the myths that \nsomehow we are\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\ngoing to wave this magic wand and all of a sudden, this year or next \nyear or the following year, we are going to have all this oil flowing \nfrom oil shale in the West.\n  I asked Secretary Allred:\n\n       When I look at your chart on oil shale development on \n     public lands, you have at some point on that chart this \n     little brown dot that says ``project completion: phase 3--\n     commercial.'' When do you think that will happen? What year?\n\n  Assistant Secretary Allred responded:\n\n       Senator, it's hard to predict that because . . .\n\n  I asked him the question:\n\n       2011?\n\n  Secretary Allred's response:\n\n       Oh no, I think, I think . . .\n\n  I then asked Secretary Allred:\n\n       2016?\n\n  Secretary Allred responded:\n\n       Probably in the latter half of, say, 2015 and beyond.\n\n  ``2015 and beyond.'' So that is what the Assistant Secretary of the \nInterior, responsible for this program, is actually saying, that we \nwould be ready possibly to move forward with commercial development of \noil shale in the year 2015--7 years from now.\n  Why, therefore, is there such a rush to move forward headlong today \nand to complete the development of commercial oil shale regulations \nbefore the end of the Bush administration? Why is that the case? I do \nnot understand it because it is not going to produce any oil that will \nhelp us deal with the energy crisis we face in the Nation today or \ntomorrow or the next year. So we have to keep asking those questions.\n  There is another part of the myth with respect to oil shale, and that \nis that we need to understand that even companies such as Chevron and \nothers do not know what kind of technology ultimately is going to be \nviable for us in the development of oil shale. Even Jill Davis from \nRoyal Dutch Shell Corporation, in the Rocky Mountain News, is quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       The thing is we have to determine whether it works on a \n     commercial scale.\n\n  So there are lots of myths.\n  Myth No. 3 is that the BLM is prepared--I hear some of my colleagues \ncome to the floor and writing letters and making statements in the \nmedia--that the BLM is prepared to issue commercial oil shale leasing \nregulations because the BLM knows the nature and the needs of the \ndevelopment of oil shale, including water and power requirements.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. BLM has clearly stated it \ndoes not know how much water would be required to implement and carry \nout a commercial oil shale leasing program. So how can we move forward \nwith a commercial oil shale leasing program when we do not know how \nmuch water would be required to develop this oil shale?\n  In a hearing, again with Assistant Secretary Allred, I asked the \nfollowing question:\n\n       Let me ask you about water availability. Under the Colorado \n     River Compact, as described, there is a significant share of \n     water of the Colorado River between all of the seven States--\n     Upper Basin, Lower Basin--we have a share of water within \n     Colorado that we are entitled under the compacts to consume \n     for Colorado water users. Do you know, today, how much of \n     that water consumption under those compacts would be required \n     to be able to implement a commercial oil shale leasing \n     program?\n\n  Secretary Allred's response:\n\n       Senator, we do not. And that's part of the . . . that's \n     part of the purpose of the R leases--to try to determine \n     that.\n\n  So how can we move forward headlong with a commercial oil shale \nleasing program when we have no idea how much water is going to be \nconsumed in the development of these so-called half a trillion or a \ntrillion barrels of oil? We do not know because we do not know how much \nwater is going to be required based on whatever technology ultimately \nmight be chosen.\n  Another myth is that the BLM, Department of the Interior, is \nabsolutely ready to move forward with a commercial oil shale leasing \nprogram because they know what they are doing with respect to the power \nrequirements.\n\n  They do not know what the power requirements are going to be. \nProducing 100,000 barrels per day of oil shale will require \napproximately 1.2 gigawatts of dedicated electric generating capacity. \nThe question is, where is that electricity going to come from? Where is \nthat power going to come from? What will its impact be? None of those \nquestions have been answered. Yet the Bureau of Land Management is \ninsistent on completing this commercial oil shale leasing program as \nfast as they can. I think, again, they are wrong.\n  There is another myth out there that says without commercial \nleasing--I hear some of my colleagues say this--without commercial \nleasing regulations from the Bureau of Land Management, investors may \ndecide to stop risking their capital on oil shale and instead focus on \nother projects with more certain returns.\n  That is not true. The reality is the commercial leasing moratorium is \ngiving BLM, investors, energy companies, scientists, Congress, and \nlocal communities the time they need to get more information about oil \nshale development and to allow the technologies to mature before any \nfull-scale operation begins on public land.\n  Again, as Chevron commented in the Programmatic Environmental Impact \nStatement:\n\n       Chevron believes that a full scale commercial leasing \n     program should not proceed at this time without clear \n     demonstration of commercial technologies.\n\n  So there are a lot of myths with respect to oil shale development.\n  Mr. President, I have several more minutes to go, and I see the \nassistant majority leader has come to the floor, so I will yield to him \nif he would so choose.\n  Mr. President, I will continue.\n  Myth No. 5. Somehow or another, those purveyors and artists of \nwanting to move forward with oil shale development with all speed ahead \nare saying this is somehow supported by the State and local governments \nit affects.\n  Well, more than half--probably 75 percent--of all the oil shale \nresources are located in my State of Colorado. The Governor of the \nState of Colorado, Bill Ritter, says let's go slow and be thoughtful \nabout oil shale development because we know the kind of impact it can \nhave on the vast Western Slope of the State of Colorado. But it is not \njust the Governor of the State of Colorado who says that, it is also \nthe Governor of Wyoming, Governor Freudenthal, as well.\n  Within my State of Colorado, there is a whole host of local \ngovernments that are very concerned about the Department of the \nInterior and the BLM moving forward, rushing headlong, moving \nrecklessly to develop oil shale on the Western Slope without knowing \nyet what they are doing. Joining in stating those concerns are the City \nof Rifle, the town of Silt, the Pitkin County Board of County \nCommissioners, the Routt County Board of County Commissioners, the San \nMiguel County Board of Commissioners, the Front Range Water Users \nCouncil, the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, the Colorado \nSprings Utilities, Aurora Water, the Board of Water Works of Pueblo--\nand the list goes on and on.\n  Even the newspapers in Colorado are saying this. This is an editorial \nthat was written in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. The Grand \nJunction Daily Sentinel is the newspaper that covers the 20 counties of \nthe Western Slope of Colorado. This is what the Grand Junction Daily \nSentinel said:\n\n       There is no need to accelerate leasing of federal land for \n     commercial oil shale production. The notion that the one-year \n     moratorium on commercial leasing approved by Congress last \n     year is somehow a barrier to commercial development is \n     nonsense. If anything, that moratorium should be extended.\n       The real barriers to commercial oil shale production are \n     technological, environmental and financial.\n\n  The Denver Post, the State's largest statewide newspaper, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Given that oil from shale isn't just around the corner, and \n     given the vital questions of water and energy, shale \n     development deserves the most careful--and lengthy, if \n     necessary--study possible.\n       Developing oil shale has been a dream since the early 20th \n     century. But careful planning is needed to make sure the \n     dream doesn't turn into a nightmare.\n\n  In conclusion, what I want to say is I think Chevron is correct \ntoday, that it is a mistake for the Department of the Interior and the \nBureau of Land Management to want to push forward to complete the \nimplementation of the Bush-Cheney agenda with respect to oil and gas \nand oil shale development. They want to rush head long to get this done \nbefore the end of the administration when we know that there are so\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nmany technological barriers and so much we do not yet know about how we \nare going to develop oil shale. So Chevron is correct when it says we \nare not ready to move forward with a full-scale oil shale program.\n\n  Let me conclude by simply saying this: For me, as a longtime farmer \nand rancher and as a person who has spent my life fighting to protect \nthe beauty of Colorado, fighting for the land and water of that State, \nit is important for me always, as a Senator, to remember that the \nplanet we have and the great State of Colorado I have is something I \nneed to protect for my children and for my grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren for generations to come. It would be a mistake for us, in \nmy view, for the State of Colorado or the United States of America to \nmove forward with a program that is going to create significant \nproblems to that legacy we are attempting to give to our children and \nto our grandchildren. I hope we could work together in a bipartisan \nbasis to look at the possibility of the development of the oil shale \nresource but to do it in a thoughtful and deliberate way so we don't \ndestroy the environment along the way.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                         Republican Filibusters\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for his \nstatement on oil shale. I wish to tell him a little story that goes \nback many years. When I first was involved in political life, in 1966 \nas a college student I worked for a Senator from Illinois named Paul \nDouglas who used to give speeches about oil shale, saying there is a \ngreat untapped natural and national resource of oil shale in the \nRockies, in Colorado, and in other areas. Yours is the first comment I \ncan remember on the floor of the Senate in all of those years relating \nto this issue again. I am glad the Senator from Colorado not only \nbrought it up but put it in perspective in terms of our national energy \nneeds and the impact of oil shale exploration and production in the \nSenator's State. I think he has every right to be careful in what he \ndoes.\n  I hear many colleagues, particularly from the Republican side of the \naisle and from the White House, suggesting the reason we have our \ngasoline prices today and high crude oil prices is because we are not \ndrilling for oil in ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I, for \ninstance, personally think that is an oversimplification, that that one \npotential source of oil could in no way solve our problems in terms of \nwhat it could produce.\n  I might call the attention of my friend and colleague from Colorado \nto some information that was given to me today. I hope the Senator from \nColorado is aware there are 44 million offshore acres, off the shores \nof the United States of America, that have been leased by oil \ncompanies--44 million. Of those, only 10.5 million have been put into \nproduction. One-fourth of all of the leased offshore acreage oil \ncompanies currently hold--land that the Federal Government has a right \nto--is being actually explored and utilized. Of the 47.5 million \nonshore acres under lease for oil and gas production, only 13 million \nare in production; again, about a fourth. So three-fourths of all of \nthe land offshore and on shore owned by the Federal Government and the \ntaxpayers, leased by oil companies for the potential production of oil \nand gas, is actually in production. Only one-fourth. Combined, oil and \ngas companies hold leases to 68 million acres of Federal land in waters \nthey are not producing any oil and gas on--68 million. That is compared \nto 1.5 million acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  So those who come to the floor and say: ``You know the problem here? \nWe are just not opening up enough area for oil and gas exploration,'' \nignore the obvious. Oil and gas companies spend money to obtain them \nand then sit on them and then come back to us when we complain America \nneeds a national energy policy and say the real problem is the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. ``If we could just have a crack at those 1.5 \nmillion acres,'' after they have taken 68 million acres, put them under \nlease, and are not utilizing them.\n  I might add that Congressman Rahm Emanuel from my State of Illinois \nand Congressman Dodd are working on legislation that would say to these \noil and gas companies: If you are going to lease this land and not use \nit, the cost of the annual lease is going to keep going up. Let someone \nelse lease it who might use it. I think that is reasonable. They are \nsuggesting that money from the leases should be dedicated to wind and \nsolar energy--energy-efficient buildings; LIHEAP--which I know would be \na good idea for the Senator who is now presiding who is from New \nEngland; weatherization assistance, and a number of other areas.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for his thoughtful reflection on \nwhat we are facing here.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for \na question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Through the Chair, I ask my friend from Illinois whether \nit is true that we have already opened huge amounts of offshore \nresources as well as onshore resources for the potential development of \noil and gas and that ultimately, if we are going to get our Nation to \nhave the kind of energy independence and national security that has \nbeen talked about now for 30 or 40 years, we need to, yes, develop \nthose potential resources and those 75 percent of those offshore and \nonshore lands the Senator spoke about, but also to look at a whole new \nagenda of clean energy that will help us get to our national security, \nour environmental security, and create an economic opportunity here at \nhome?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would respond to the Senator from Colorado and tell \nhim, yes, of course. He has anticipated the reason I came to the floor: \nto discuss what happened this week in the Senate or, to be more \naccurate, what didn't happen this week in the Senate. Because on \nTuesday, we offered to the Senate, both sides, Democrats and \nRepublicans, an opportunity to debate what the Senator from Colorado \nsuggested, whether we will invest as a nation in energy and job \ncreation. The Senator from Colorado knows what happened as well as I \ndo. The Republicans refused to join us to bring to the floor to debate \nthe bill that would create tax incentives for investments in energy \nefficiency, renewable, sustainable energy that will not lead to global \nwarming and will not lead to pollution. The frustration that I and \nother Members on the Democratic side feel comes from the fact that we \nhave tried repeatedly to bring these measures to the floor and we have \nbeen stopped time and time again.\n\n  I say to my colleague and friend from Colorado, through the Renewable \nEnergy and Job Creation Act, we can create incentives we know will \nwork. In my home State of Illinois, and probably in the State of \nColorado, we are finding wind turbines being built in massive numbers \nto generate clean electric power. Near Bloomington, IL, an area I never \nwould have dreamed of as a wind resource area, 240 wind turbines are \nbeing built. They will generate enough electricity there to provide all \nthe needs of the two cities of Bloomington and Normal, IL, without \npollution, using nature as a source.\n  Why did this recently happen? Because we created, over the last \ncouple of years, incentives for businesses to do it. Now when we come \nthis week to the floor of the Senate and say to our Republican \ncolleagues: Let's not stop this now; this is a move in the right \ndirection for green energy sources, what did they say? ``We don't want \nto even debate it.'' They stopped us again.\n  This week in the Senate--\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, would the Senator from Illinois yield for \na question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Through the Chair, I ask of my friend from Illinois how \nimportant the extension of these energy tax credits is for renewable \nenergy, given the fact that this is not pie-in-the-sky kind of \ntechnology we are talking about. As I understand, in my State--and I \nknow there are already three solar powerplants that are functioning--\nthere is a plan in the State of Arizona to put together a 400 or 500-\nmegawatt powerplant that will be powered by the Sun, a 200-megawatt \npowerplant in the State of California, a whole host of ways in which \nthe Sun can become harnessed for our energy needs.\n  The same thing is true with respect to wind. As my good friend from \nIllinois talked about, what is happening in\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nIllinois is happening across America, including in my own home State of \nColorado where we have gone from almost no wind production 3 years ago \nto 1,000 megawatts, and there are three or four coal-fired powerplants \nin my State.\n  So how important, I ask my friend from Illinois, would the extension \nof these tax credits be until 2015, 2016--however we end up finally \nreaching that number--to continue investing in harnessing the power of \nthe Sun, the power of wind, the power of biofuels?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response, through the Chair to the Senator from \nColorado, if we don't extend these Federal renewable energy tax \ncredits, America could lose 76,000 jobs in the wind industry, 40,000 \njobs in the solar industry. The bill the Republicans refuse to allow us \nto bring to the floor to even debate provides $8.8 billion for research \nand development investment. This year alone, over 27,000 U.S. \nbusinesses would use this tax credit to benefit companies in computers \nand electronics, chemical manufacturing, information services, and \nscientific R services. The list goes on and on. The Renewable Energy \nand Job Creation Act, which they would not allow us to bring to the \nfloor to debate this week, includes $18 billion in incentives for clean \nelectricity, alternative transportation fuels, carbon sequestration, \nand energy efficiency.\n  I say to my friend from Colorado through the Chair that this is \nnothing new. So far, during this session of Congress, the Republicans \nhave engaged in 76 filibusters as of today. The record in the Senate \nfor any 2-year period of time was 57 filibusters. A filibuster is every \nSenator's right to stop any bill, any nomination, for an indefinite \nperiod of time, and that filibuster can only be broken if 60 Senators \nvote to break it. It is called a cloture motion. We tried three times \nthis week to break Republican filibusters, first on a bill dealing with \nthe price of gasoline to try to bring it down and make it more \naffordable. The Republicans filibustered it. When we had our vote, we \ncouldn't find 60 votes because they wouldn't cross the aisle to join \nthe Democrats in breaking the filibuster and debating specific ways of \nbringing down the price of gasoline.\n  We followed that with a measure to deal with, as I have said here, \ntax incentives for the right energy decisions for our future. The \nRepublicans initiated another filibuster. We called it for a vote. We \nfailed to come up with 60 votes again because we only had nine \nRepublican Senators who would cross--well, I think the number was seven \nRepublican Senators who would cross the aisle and join us. We needed \nmore. Out of 49, we needed about 10 or 15. We didn't get those. So that \nbill to create incentives for businesses and individuals to make the \nright energy decisions was defeated by another Republican filibuster.\n  The last thing we considered was related to another program. It had \nnothing to do with energy but a lot to do with health care. We wanted \nto make certain the Medicare Program continued to reimburse the doctors \nand medical professionals who provide critical care for 40 million \nelderly and disabled Americans. The Bush administration wants to cut \ntheir compensation by 10 percent or more. I think it is unfair. These \nmen and women are not being paid as much as others, and they are \nproviding critical health services to a lot of needy people. The Bush \nadministration, which is no fan of Medicare or Social Security, wanted \nto cut their reimbursement. Well, they will cut that reimbursement and \nfewer doctors will participate in the program and seniors will have a \nmore difficult time getting their care.\n  So we started to bring to the floor a measure that would restore the \npay for doctors helping patients under Medicare and we also provided \nsome incentives in there for better practices to reduce overall costs \nto the Medicare Program. We paid for it by looking at the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. The Medicare Advantage Program allows private \ninsurance companies to offer Medicare benefits. The Republicans have \nalways favored that, saying that creates a competitive atmosphere. \nMedicare competes against private health insurance when it comes to \nbasic Medicare coverage. As a footnote, it is ironic that they would \nwelcome this kind of competition from Medicare, but fought us tooth and \nnail when we tried to bring the same competition when it came to \nprescription drugs. Nevertheless, we said this Medicare Advantage \nProgram costs too much money for the services provided. We have had \nexpert testimony that it is about 13 percent more expensive for private \nhealth insurance companies to offer the same benefits as the Medicare \nProgram. We took savings from that program and paid for the increase in \npay for doctors under Medicare.\n  We didn't add to the deficit. I suppose that is why the Republicans, \nby and large, have turned on us. They don't want to pay for the actions \nthey bring to the floor. They don't want to offset the costs of \nprograms or tax cuts by actually balancing the books. They want to \ncontinue to add to our deficit.\n  The vote came up today, and nine Republicans crossed the aisle to \nvote for us. Overwhelmingly, they represented Republican Senators who \nare afraid they are going to lose in the election in November. They \ncame over to join us and vote for our position. The Republican \nleadership was careful not to let too many come over. So at the end of \nthe day, we were unable to bring this Medicare bill to the floor for \ndebate.\n  So here we are at the end of a full week of the U.S. Senate, in \nWashington, DC, in our capital, on Capitol Hill, and we are beset by a \nworld about us in turmoil, with the war in Iraq; we have a nation that \nis torn by energy prices, gasoline prices, and diesel prices; we have \nAmericans concerned about their health care, and when we try three \ndifferent times to bring to the floor of the Senate measures that \naddress these challenges, each and every time the Republicans answered \nwith a filibuster and stopped us from acting.\n  The sad reality is that the GOP, the Grand Old Party, has become a \n``Graveyard of Progress.'' I am afraid that is what GOP stands for \nthese days. They cannot face the possibility of change. They are \nfrightened by it, determined to stop it. They have stopped it with 76 \nfilibusters, which is a recordbreaking number of filibusters in the \nSenate.\n  Well, we could not come up with 60 votes to turn that around; there \nare not enough Democratic Senators. The final word will be in the hands \nof the voters in November, on November 4. They can decide whether they \nwant change in Washington, change in the Senate, or more of the same. \nThey are going to have that opportunity in a series of elections. I \nhope those who follow this debate and believe this Government, working \nin a constructive bipartisan way, can achieve good things, will \nremember that when they go to the polls in November.\n  Let me say as well, Mr. President, that I have watched this \nPresidential campaign carefully because my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Obama, is now, as they say, the ``presumptive Democratic \nnominee'' for the Presidential nomination. A long campaign awaits us, \nalmost 5 months. Senator McCain is a substantial and formidable \nopponent in this election campaign. But make no mistake, the voters are \ngoing to have a clear choice in this election about who will represent \nthem in the White House for the next 4 years.\n  We are also initiating the first national dialog on health care \nreform in 15 years. For 7\\1/2\\ years, the Bush administration has \nsummarily ignored the major problems facing America. When President \nBush gets up in the morning and looks out the window of the White \nHouse, all he sees is Iraq. For 7\\1/2\\ years, that has been the focus \nof his attention and the centerpiece of his energy. I will tell you, \nthere are many other things this President ignored at the peril of our \ngreat Nation. His economic policies have brought to us a sorry state.\n  Last Friday, we had the terrible announcement about a dramatic \nincrease in the price of crude oil, an increase in the price of \ngasoline, a substantial increase in unemployment, and a 350-point loss \nin the Dow Jones, in the stock market. It was a sad and gloomy Friday \nacross America from an economic viewpoint. But even those large \nnumbers--the big numbers that come to us at the lead of any newscast \nand on the front page of the paper don't tell the true and complete \nstory.\n  The Senator from Vermont invited his constituents to talk about \nchallenges they face as families all across his State. He has told me \nand our colleagues--and has spoken on the floor\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\nabout it--that he was overwhelmed by the response. Ordinary people in \nVermont--and I am sure those in Illinois are having a tough time--are \nstruggling to pay for gasoline, for the increased cost of food. They \nunderstand utility bills are going to be challenging this summer to \ncool their homes, as we face a brutal summer in most parts of the \ncountry. They are scared to death, I know, in New England--because I \nvisited there--of dramatic increases in the cost of home heating oil \nthis winter. Those realities are translating into economic insecurity \nfor some of the hardest working families in America.\n  If you just could consider what has happened under the Bush \nadministration to the middle of the middle class in America. These are \nfolks who are working hard every day, trying to raise families, are \nplaying by the rules, and they are falling further and further behind. \nThese are the ones, many times, who are losing their homes because of \nsubprime mortgages and deceptions which led them to an indebtedness \nthey could not handle, and now they face the loss of their home, one of \ntheir major assets, if not their only asset. They have transferred \ntheir debt onto credit cards as often as they can, but they reach a \nbreaking point.\n  A friend of mine is on the risk committee for a major bank in this \ncountry. He told me that the balances on credit cards are going down \nbecause people realize they cannot pay any more and they cannot buy \nthings they need. But the default on credit cards is going up, leading \nto even more bankruptcies. That is the reality.\n  President Bush doesn't understand that reality. His economic \npolicies, which are supported by John McCain, are really based on one \nbasic principle: cut tax rates for the wealthiest people in America. \nThey continue to believe that if wealthy people have more money, \nsomehow this will translate into a better quality of life for those \nworking families and middle-class families who are struggling to \nsurvive. Well, 7\\1/2\\ years of that thinking led us to this point. \nThese people, faced with the Bush economic policies, are struggling to \nget by.\n  The President doesn't understand the energy picture. Every 6 months, \nhe makes a trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and is seen holding hands with \nthe sheiks of Saudi Arabia, begging them to release more oil into the \nUnited States and bring prices down. But they give him a pat on the \nback and send him off with the very curt answer of ``no.'' They tell \nhim time and again that they are not going to release more oil. They \nhave plenty of customers around the world and they don't need the \nUnited States. That is the reality and totality of the Bush energy \npolicy.\n  This President has yet to call in the CEOs of the major oil \ncompanies. In this country, these companies are reporting \nrecordbreaking profits at the expense of families, businesses, farmers, \nand truckers. This President has yet to call them in and hold them \naccountable for what I consider to be pure greed when it comes to \nprofit-taking. He won't call them in because, apparently, he believes \nthat is the natural course of events, that some who are in a virtual \nmonopoly position, providing energy and oil to this country, ought to \nhave whatever profits they can reap at whatever cost to America's \nfamilies and our future. I think the President is wrong.\n  There is another issue, the issue of health care. We know that under \nthis President, more people have lost health insurance than ever in our \nhistory. People who had health insurance lost it because they lost a \njob or they could no longer afford it. Now they are completely \nvulnerable to any illness or diagnosis that could bring them down \ntomorrow and virtually destroy all of the savings they have. The status \nquo in health care in America isn't satisfactory. The American people \nknow that. Despite President Bush's inaction, they want change.\n  Premiums for health insurance have been rising more than twice as \nfast as employees' wages, while this administration has been in power. \nThe number of uninsured Americans has been increasing by more than a \nmillion people a year under President Bush. Each year, the United \nStates spends about twice as much for health care per person as other \ndeveloped nations. The closest nation in spending for health care to \nthe United States per person, per capita, annually, is Luxembourg, \nwhich spends less than half of what we do. We spend about $7,000 per \nyear on health care per person. The United States, despite all the \nmoney being spent, continues to score poorly on measures of the \npublic's health, such as life expectancy and infant mortality.\n\n  The challenge for this country and for the American people is making \nquality health coverage available and affordable for all Americans. We \nmust take steps to improve quality and make our health care system more \nefficient so that we can get the greatest value for every health care \ndollar we spend. We have to put our health care ideas on the table and \nstart the real debate about change.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have put forward some \nideas on health care reform. I applaud them for acknowledging the need \nto change, but I am concerned with the direction in which they want to \ntake us.\n  One of their ideas is to create incentives for more people to buy \nhealth insurance in the individual insurance market. Those who support \nthis idea talk about it in glowing terms. Think about it. They say you \ncould choose your own health plan and keep your health plan when you \nchange jobs. But they ignore the most important implication of that \nidea: You are on your own. Remember President Bush's famous ownership \nsociety, the ownership society that wants to privatize Social Security? \nThank goodness that was rejected on a bipartisan basis. The model of \nthe ownership society of President Bush and the philosophy behind this \nthinking is very basic: Just remember, we are all in this alone. That \nis their notion. It doesn't work. It doesn't work in life. It doesn't \nwork in your family, in your community, or when it comes to health \ninsurance. Anybody in a less-than-perfect health care situation doesn't \nwant to be on their own. It is a place you end up when you have no \noption.\n  In most States, insurers are free to tell a person they won't cover \nthem for a particular medical condition. To the cancer survivor, they \ncan say: Congratulations for surviving cancer; we will cover you for \neverything else that might affect you but not for cancer. Or they can \ndeny coverage altogether. Many of us in this Chamber would have trouble \nfinding health insurance in the individual market, if it were \navailable, and it might be too expensive. This would be a health \ninsurance system the Republicans support that is a great idea for the \nyoung, healthy, and the wealthy but not for the rest of America. It \nwould move our health insurance system in the wrong direction.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle are having trouble responding to \nthese criticisms. They appear unwilling to require insurers to cover \neverybody, regardless of their health condition, or to require greater \nsharing of health costs between the young and the old and between the \nhealthy and the sick. That would require Government regulation. They \ndon't like to have the Government involved. They want the market to \nreach the conclusion. The market has already reached a conclusion when \nit comes to health care, which is that the cost of health care and \ncoverage will increase every year, and it will cover less every year. \nThat is what the market says, and that is what they accept.\n  They are caught in a dilemma because the free market insurance \nsystem, without reasonable regulation, means allowing health insurers \nto enroll the healthy and exclude the sick. To get out of this \nideological quandary, they have proposed an idea: creating high-risk \npools for everybody insurers don't want to cover. Insurers would \nprobably like that idea, to take the people for whom it is most \nexpensive and put them in a separate pool.\n  Today, high-risk pools exist on a small scale in 34 States. These \nState high-risk pools can serve as a life preserver for people who have \nnowhere else to turn in the current health insurance system, but they \nshould not serve as a foundation of a reformed health system.\n  State high-risk pools have many shortcomings. They are not often able \nto cover everybody who can't find affordable health insurance. Premiums \nare way too high. In Illinois's high-risk pool, a 50-year-old woman \nwould have to pay more than $800 a month in premiums for a policy with \na $500 deductible. Benefits are often limited. With\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\nthese shortcomings, I cannot understand how these high-risk pools could \nbe the bedrock of the Republican position when it comes to health care \nreform.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle also want to \nallow insurers to choose which State insurance regulations they want to \nlive by. Proponents say this is a way to let all insurers sell \ninsurance nationwide. But if you follow this, you know that doesn't \nwork. Without State regulation and basic State requirements on \ncoverage, there is no guarantee of solvency and no guarantee of \ncoverage when you get sick.\n  If enacted, these changes would move our system in the wrong \ndirection. Instead of pooling people together, those who are well and \nthose who are sick, to spread the risk, Republicans would have us \nseparate the healthy from those who are not healthy. Instead of helping \npeople with chronic diseases, they are pushed over into high-risk pools \nwith high premiums.\n  The whole point of expanding health coverage is to make sure you have \naccess to quality, affordable insurance. Changes to our health \ninsurance system that make health insurance cheaper for some but more \nexpensive for others is hardly a solution. We need to create large \npurchasing pools and offer a wide range of plans. Change the rules for \nsetting premiums so that health costs are shared more broadly between \nthe healthy and the sick. We need to provide a tax credit to businesses \nthat step up and say: We believe the health of our employees is as \nimportant as the money we pay them. We are going to make a sacrifice in \nour profit taking so that our coverage extends to not only the owners \nof the company but the employees. That kind of good, responsible civic \nconduct should be rewarded in our Tax Code.\n\n  I am glad we are starting to discuss health care reform again. \nNothing is going to happen under this President. We are going to have \nto just count the days until January 20, 2009, when this President \nleaves office and another President comes to office, and the American \npeople will then have a real chance for real change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               Oil Prices\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, within the span of 1 week, the Senate \nmissed three opportunities to engage in productive debate on how we can \ncombat the rising price of oil, and alleviate the dangerous emission of \ngreenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change. It is highly \nregrettable that we have missed these opportunities, especially when it \ncomes at the expense of improving the Nation's welfare.\n  Americans are working harder, yet finding that their paychecks are \nnot keeping up with inflation. Many are finding it difficult to pay \ntheir mortgages, health care expenses, and other daily needs. While \nrelief, for some, is expected this July from an increase in the \nnational minimum wage, more must be done to improve the lives of \nworking families. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to work with \nthis administration to make any meaningful changes that would assist \nworking families.\n  On June 10, the Senate was blocked in its attempt to further debate \ntwo bills offering legislative solutions to rising oil prices and our \nreliance on foreign oil. One of them, the Consumer-First Energy Act of \n2008, would have put consumers' concerns before those of the oil \ncompanies, by holding the companies accountable for price gouging and \nprofit taking.\n  Families do not need to be reminded that rising oil prices contribute \nheavily to their rising bills for energy, transportation, shopping and \ngroceries. These families, for the most part, have not had a \ncorresponding increase in their wages. They find themselves in \ndifficult financial positions, and having to make tough choices on what \nnecessities to spend their money on. This strain is even more evident \nin my home State of Hawaii.\n  Hawaii depends on imported oil to supply more than 90 percent of our \nenergy needs. The record-high crude oil prices cause higher processing \ncharges for food and other manufactured items. The increase in cost for \nHawaii's foods is due in large part to the higher cost of transporting \nthe goods to the islands--80 percent of Hawaii's food products are \nimported via ship or airplane. Grocery prices have seen their biggest \nincrease in nearly two decades.\n  Furthermore, the high cost of jet fuel results in higher airfare \nprices and reduction in flights significantly limit travel for Hawaii \nresidents and tourists. The reduction in visitors traveling to Hawaii \ncould hurt our economy. While the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau \nis proactively working to aggressively resuscitate the market, the \nhotel occupancy in April hit a 5-year low. The city of Honolulu is \nconsidering raising taxi meter fares in light of record gas prices and \nthe downturn in tourism.\n  The administration must work with us to help our families and our \ncommunities by finding a way to decrease fuel prices. In addition, we \nmust search for ways to reduce our dependence on oil. It is necessary \nthat we continue to debate our energy future and enact appropriate \nreforms.\n  Meaningful debates on three significant bills were unfortunately \ncurtailed, despite the agreement of many members that we must do \nsomething about increasing oil prices, our reliance on foreign oil, and \nthe need for cleaner energy. The aforementioned Consumer-First Energy \nAct of 2008, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, and the \nLieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008, would have helped the \nNation move forward by continuing to invest in renewable and \nsustainable energy. Finding a solution should not be a partisan issue. \nEncouraging the development of renewable energy technologies will play \na critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and our Nation's \nreliance on fossil fuels. In Hawaii, we are mindful of preserving \nnatural and cultural resources. We are also aware of the powerful \npotential of nature to provide sustainable sources of energy.\n  I am proud that we had bipartisan support for the Marine and \nHydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2007, which I \nintroduced, and was later enacted into law as part of the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007. This measure recognized that \nocean and wave energy are viable sources of sustainable energy. We need \nto support marine renewable energy research and development of \ntechnologies to produce electric power from ocean waves. However, like \nmany other tax credits for renewable energy, the incentives put in \nplace to ensure robust investments will expire at the end of 2008. The \nRenewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008 would have extended these \nvaluable credits.\n  By harnessing the Sun, wind, ocean, and geothermal power to generate \nelectricity, Hawaii is trying to reduce our heavy reliance imported \nfuel and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The vast ocean, Sun, \nwind, and land are natural elements that we, as a nation, share and \nenjoy. We must do all that we can to encourage the development and \nproduction of renewable and sustainable energy technologies from these \nnatural resources. Achieving our goals will only be possible if we \napproach the problem as responsible stewards of our environment. \nTogether, we will make an impact.\n  I am committed to finding legislative solutions to ease the burden of \nincreasing oil prices and to reduce greenhouse gases. As responsible \nstewards, we must do what we can to uphold the welfare of our \nenvironment and our Nation for the generations to come. An investment \nin the development and implementation of renewable energies is a \nsignificant part of the solution. I stand ready to work with others to \nenact legislation to address these concerns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5586-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a very special \nperson, one of our fallen heroes, MAJ Scott Hagerty. I feel a very \npersonal relationship with this man. As we all do when we hear of a \ntragic loss, we research and see what he was doing,\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nwhere he was. It is almost impossible to conceive of the idea that \nmaybe I didn't even meet him personally because, in looking at where he \nwas in Afghanistan and when he was there, where he was in Iraq and when \nhe was there--I was there at the same time. Ironically, even in \nnorthern Uganda. Not many people even know where Uganda is, but in a \nminute I will share a few things that are going on there and what Scott \nHagerty was doing.\n  Scott died on June 3, 2008. He gave his last full measure when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle while he was on \npatrol in Zormat, Afghanistan. Scott was a member of the Army Reserve \nand was assigned to the 451st Civil Affairs Battalion, Pasadena, TX.\n  Born and raised in Oklahoma, Scott graduated from Stillwater High \nSchool in 1984. As a senior in high school, he joined the U.S. Army at \nthe rank of a specialist. He earned a bachelor's degree in political \nscience, pre-law, and international relations from Oklahoma State \nUniversity--OSU--in 1993.\n  He received his commission through the ROTC program and then \ncompleted the Field Artillery Officer Basic Course at Fort Sill. After \nserving on active duty, he continued his service in the Army Reserve. \nHe spent 11 years with the 291st Regiment in Oklahoma before \ntransferring to the U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological \nOperations Command, Airborne, in 2004.\n  Scott married his wife, Daphne, 12 years ago. They have two sons, \nJonathan 10 years old and Samuel 21 months. Scott loved his family and \nenjoyed being a father. He spent his life helping others gain the same \nfreedoms and experience the same joys that he had.\n  Scott was deployed for a 12 month tour in South Korea and then served \nin Iraq from October 2004 to August 2005. As a civil affairs officer, \nhe worked with Iraqis and Iraqi civilian authorities in helping them \nrebuild their government and country.\n  Prior to his tour in Afghanistan, Scott spent a tour in Djibouti, \nAfrica, to help promote stability and prevent conflict in the region. \nHis mission included repairing wells in northern Uganda, where he and \nfellow soldiers restored more than 60 wells and provided 250,000 local \nresidents with clean water. In Africa, he was also involved in \nproviding suitable facilities for basic medical care for children.\n  This is the part I find very interesting and coincidental. Scott was \ninvolved in northern Uganda. In northern Uganda, there are some things \nthat are going on that not many are aware of. There is the LRA, the \nLord's Resistance Army. One individual--his name is Joseph Coney. \nJoseph Coney, for 30 years, has mutilated and tortured little kids, \nrecruited them to be in the army as his boy soldiers--12, 13, 14 years \nold. If they refuse to do it, they make this individual go back and \nmurder his own family, back in the villages. I have been there. I have \nbeen in the same villages, the same places where Scott was.\n  Scott didn't have to do this. This is something that was beyond the \ncall of duty. It is heavy lifting. I saw a picture of him in an \norphanage in northern Uganda. I have been to that same orphanage. There \nare not many of our troops who have done what Scott Hagerty has done. \nHe wrote about his experience there saying:\n\n       I have always dreamed of being a soldier, even as a little \n     boy, so I know I am doing the job that was destined for me.\n\n  He deployed to Afghanistan shortly after being assigned to the 451st \nCivil Affairs Battalion in February. His family said, ``Scott was very \nproud of his career in the Army, and we know he died doing what he \nloved . . . serving his country.''\n  Scott received numerous military honors, including two Meritorious \nService Medals, six Army Achievement Medals, two National Defense \nService Medals, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service \nMedals and a Korean Defense Service Medal.\n  I am saddened by the loss of my fellow Oklahoman. I am proud of his \nservice, integrity, and commitment to our country. I read through some \nof the comments written in Scott's on-line Guest Book from people who \nknew him at different points in his life and I would like to share a \ncouple with you:\n\n       I had the honor of serving with Maj Hagerty in Gardez, \n     Afghanistan. He was a father figure to me. I have great \n     respect for him. He is truly my hero and will be missed more \n     then he knows. I know he is looking down and watching over us \n     as we continue our mission. We love you Maj Hagerty and will \n     never forget you.\n       The Highland Park family are mourning the loss of a \n     wonderful parent at our school. Scott was not only a devoted \n     soldier, but a devoted husband and father . . . Scott's \n     presence will be missed at home and abroad. Thank you Scott! \n     We are very proud of you! Highland Park Elementary School.\n       Another one: Growing up with Scott, I was impressed by his \n     quiet strength. I always knew there would be great things in \n     his future as we stumbled toward adulthood . . . Thank you \n     for the sacrifice you have made for my family.\n\n  And lastly a comment left by his team that he worked with in Africa: \nSincere condolences to the family of Maj Scott Hagerty from the present \nand third Civil Affairs team in northern Uganda. We only had e-mail \ncontact with him, giving updates on how things were going here, as he \nwas still interested--he was the first team leader here and broke a lot \nof ground. I am sure he stands guard over us all now.\n  Today I pay tribute to Scott, a man who exemplified integrity and \ncourage and gave his life as a sacrifice for his family and our Nation.\n  I have to say this in the case of Scott: This is not goodbye, Scott. \nIt is job well done. We love you, and we will see you later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the kindness \nof the Senator from Oklahoma. I think that so often we forget the \nsacrifice that our American people have made so we could bring some \nstability to Afghanistan and to Iraq.\n  Now, 2 weeks ago I attended a service actually on the front steps of \nthe Ohio Capitol Building where we commemorated the lives of 23 \nindividuals from the Lima Company that was extraordinarily hit in Iraq. \nTears rolled out of my eyes and everyone else there as a mother of a \nman by the name of Hoffman talked about her son and the sacrifice that \nhe made and why he made that sacrifice.\n  I think that too many Americans are not aware of the fact that we \nhave lost over 4,000 people in Iraq and that 30,000 of them have \nreturned, and half of them are going to be disabled. I think it \nunderscores that we need to be very responsible in our future activity \nin Iraq so that the parents of those young men and women do not feel \nthat their lives were lost in vain.\n  I am sure, Mr. President, you have mixed emotions, as I have, about \nwhere we should be going there. I heard Jim Dobbins today. Jim was at \nthe State Department for many years. He was talking about our next \nmoves in Iraq and how difficult it is because on one hand, we know that \nwe have to move our troops out of there for the benefit of our \nvolunteer Army. Because of the deployments, they are stretched, and \nthey are not getting the re-ups that they need.\n  At the same time, we want to make sure we do not move too fast so we \nend up with a civil war there. So it is a dilemma. But the people who \nget lost in all of that are the folks who have lost their loved ones. \nAnd it grieves me that we have spent almost $650 billion on that war, \nand we have never asked the American people to participate.\n  The only ones who have participated are the families whose sons and \ndaughters have come back in body bags, and that loss will be with them \nfor the rest of their lives. So I think all of us ought to think about \nthose families and pray for them and pray that those of us in \nresponsible positions will be enlightened by the Holy Spirit to make \nthe right decisions for them, their families, for our country, and for \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5587-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5587-S5588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO SECOND BLUEGRASS CHAPTER HONOR FLIGHT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nsecond Bluegrass Chapter Honor Flight. I had the privilege of meeting \n38 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who arrived \nin our Nation's Capital yesterday morning to see the memorial on the \nNational Mall dedicated to them.\n  Thanks to the national nonprofit organization, Honor Flight, which \ntransports World War II veterans from anywhere in the country to see \ntheir memorial, and a group of dedicated volunteers, veterans from all \nover the state\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nare able to make this memorable trip, free of charge.\n  The World War II Memorial was completed in 2004 and is a fitting \ntribute to the men and women who put on their country's uniform to \nfight the greatest and most destructive war the world has ever seen. \nAnyone who has ever visited this special place will agree that its \nstateliness is nothing short of awe-inspiring much like the men and \nwomen for whom it was built and who are so deserving of their title as \n``the Greatest Generation.''\n  On the memorial's field of gold stars, known as the Freedom Wall, the \ninscription reads ``Here We Mark the Price of Freedom.'' The veterans \nfrom my home State of Kentucky who visited today paid that price with \ntheir blood, sweat and tears; their families paid with sleepless nights \nand constant fear for the safety of their loved ones; and many of their \nfellow fighters paid with their lives.\n  We should remember the bravery of the men and women who served, and \nthe World War II Memorial is a fitting tribute for all those who \nsacrificed in defense of our Nation and our way of life.\n  Mr. President, it is really a moving experience to be in the company \nof some of the men and women of the ``Greatest Generation,'' and I ask \nunanimous consent that the names of the World War II veterans from \nKentucky who were here yesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     Kentucky World War II Veterans\n\n       Elmer Morgan, William Coffey, Curtis Lesmeister, Lewis \n     Grahm, Morgan Bradford, Leslie Spillman, Ralph Holman, \n     Richard Thompson, William Richmond, Frank Parks, Vaiden Cox, \n     James Wells, Daniel Rateau, Kenneth Becker, Morris Alford, \n     James Hartman, Richard Doty, Melvin Campbell, Sr., Salvador \n     Miceli, Veachel Lile.\n       Alexander Fehr, Kenneth Fehr, Charles Nichter, George \n     Johnides, Jarl Harris, J.B.

DOWNEY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound \ngratitude and heartfelt best wishes to Frederick M. Downey, a true \nfriend and dedicated public servant who will be leaving my Senate \noffice after serving 12 years as senior counselor and legislative \nassistant. Given all that we have been through together, Fred's \ndeparture is truly a bittersweet occasion. While I am excited for Fred \nas he pursues an exciting opportunity with the Aerospace Industry \nAssociation, I can't help but think what a great loss his leaving will \nbe for me, my staff, and the people of Connecticut.\n  Fred came to my office having already amassed a long and \ndistinguished record in public service and national security. A \ndistinguished military graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, \nFred served in the U.S. Army for 24 years, rising to the rank of \ncolonel. In the Army, Fred held a variety of infantry, troop, and staff \npositions in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and in \nVietnam.\n  Between 1988 and 1991, Fred worked in the Office of the Deputy Chief \nof Staff for Operations and Plans in the Department of the Army, where \nhe was responsible for advising senior Army leaders on national \nsecurity policy and military strategy. He played a leading role in \nexamining the post-Cold War strategic environment, formulating options \nused by Army leaders when developing a national security strategy and \nforce structure to meet the needs of the new international system. Fred \nalso played an integral role in developing the Army's strategy for \nOperation Desert Storm. Fred then served as assistant to the director \nof net assessments, before retiring from the Army in 1993 and joining \nTASC, Inc. At TASC, Fred provided analytical services to the U.S. \nGovernment and our allies.\n  Even with all Fred had already done for our country, his instinct for \npublic service proved strong; and in 1996 he agreed to leave TASC and \naccept a position as my legislative assistant for defense and foreign \naffairs. Naturally, I was delighted to have someone with his background \nand expertise join my team.\n  Fred's tenure in the Senate has been one of remarkable distinction. \nFor over a decade, while America's role in the world has undergone \nprofound and sometimes tumultuous changes, I have consistently been \nable to rely on Fred to give me the highest level of counsel on \ncritical military and foreign affairs issues. In addition to his almost \nencyclopedic knowledge of military matters, Fred quickly demonstrated \nthat he possessed keen legislative and political instincts. As my \ndesignated representative to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Fred \nhas been indispensable in my efforts to transform America's military so \nthat is it better suited toward the national security needs of a post-\nCold War world. With Fred's invaluable assistance, I was able to \ndevelop and pass legislation establishing the Quadrennial Defense \nReview and the National Defense Panel, which requires the Pentagon to \nregularly assess what it will require to keep America safe in the \nfuture, as well as legislation establishing the U.S. Joint Forces \nCommand. Also, as part of the annual Defense authorization bill, Fred \nand I crafted a series of provisions to reform the policy, procurement, \nand research and development process at the Department of Defense.\n  Fred was just as focused and passionate in helping advance foreign \npolicy legislation that was both tough on America's enemies and \nrepresentative of our Nation's core values. With his strong guidance, I \nwas able to enact a number of initiatives that promoted human rights \nand religious freedom abroad, increased American assistance to fight \nthe spread of global HIV/AIDS, encouraged increased international \ncooperation and the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, and authorized efforts to prevent genocide.\n  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when America was \nawakened to the grave threat posed by radical Islamist terrorism, Fred \nwas steadfast in his efforts to advance legislation giving the Federal \nGovernment the tools it needs to protect Americans from further \nattacks. Working with my talented staff on the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Fred played a vital role in producing \nlegislation that implemented the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. Fred also \nteamed up with the committee on the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, which enacted the most sweeping reform of our \nNation's intelligence community in over half a century, and on \nlegislation creating the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Fred recognized early on that for the United States to ultimately \nsucceed in the war on terror, it is not enough to just seek out and \ncapture terrorists, but that we must also work to provide the people of \nthe Middle East and the rest of the Islamic world an alternative to \nradical Islamism by promoting democracy and economic development. With \nthis in mind, Fred toiled relentlessly to advance initiatives designed \nto expand America's diplomatic outreach to the Muslim world and to \npromote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in the Middle \nEast. He also guided to passage the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act, \nwhich committed the United States to aiding Afghanistan as it seeks to \nrebuild for the long term.\n  In 2005, when the Pentagon recommended that the Naval Submarine Base \nin Groton, CT, be closed, Fred worked tirelessly as a leader in an \neffort to keep it open. Once again, his advice was pivotal toward \ndeveloping a successful strategy that demonstrated to the Base Closure \nand Realignment Commission that the unique synergy of submarine \nconstruction and operating talent in southeast Connecticut is critical \nto our national security. Connecticut truly owes a debt of gratitude to \nFred for his perseverance and commitment to the well-being of our \nState.\n  Of course, I couldn't possibly discuss Fred's service in the Senate \nwithout mentioning all the times he and I have traveled the world \ntogether on official business. Whether it was our annual trip to the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels, or the numerous \nfact-finding trips taken to Iraq and Afghanistan, Fred was there to \nprovide his thoughtful perspective.\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\nOften these trips would keep Fred away from home during the holidays, \nan enormous sacrifice that I cannot begin to say how much I appreciate. \nWherever we traveled, my visits to other parts of the world were always \ngreatly enhanced knowing that Fred was at my side.\n  Fred is respected throughout the Senate for his outstanding work and \nbreadth of knowledge. He has built a reputation with Senators and staff \nfrom both sides of the aisle for always being willing to take into \naccount everyone's views and work together to reach a consensus. He is \na true professional in the very best sense of the word.\n  I am deeply grateful to Fred's wife, Claudia, for her understanding \nof the marathon hours and taxing travel schedule that was so often \ndemanded of Fred. Having been lucky enough to have gotten to know her \nand their two daughters, Dawn Harvey and Kelly Emery, I can only \nsurmise that they served as an endless source of strength for him as he \ngrappled with the tough issues facing the world today.\n  My entire Senate staff has been extremely fortunate to work with \nFred, who was always willing to share his broad knowledge and counsel \nwith his coworkers. When things would sometimes get hectic, Fred was a \nbeacon of calm and stability; ready to impart the wisdom he had \naccumulated from his vast experience to help us all weather the storm. \nMany new legislative aides and fellows would find that Fred was someone \nthey could approach whenever they needed assistance, and we have all \nbeen touched by his graciousness and sense of humor. He will always \nremain a treasured part of our office family, and the office will never \nbe the same without him.\n  I am honored to have had Fred as a trusted advisor for all these \nyears, and I am even prouder to call him my friend. While he will be \nmissed immensely, my staff and I wish him happiness and health, knowing \nthat he will be equally successful in his next endeavor. On behalf of \nmyself, my staff, and the country, I sincerely thank Fred Downey for \nhis many years of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5589-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                233RD BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to wish happy birthday to the \noldest branch of our Armed Forces, the U.S. Army. Two hundred and \nthirty-three years ago, June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress \napproved the creation of a Continental Army--10 companies of riflemen, \nto defend American liberty. From the Revolutionary War to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, our men and women have served with bravery, selflessness \nand noble purpose.\n  Love of their country has inspired men and women to serve a cause \ngreater than themselves. Regard for the principles our Nation was \nfounded on motivates them to continue to fight and defend.\n  To say simply our Armed Forces have shaped history is an \nunderstatement. They have not only shaped history, they have defined \nAmerica, and represented our nation's highest values . . . ``Duty, \nHonor, Country.''\n  Every generation of soldiers since the foundation of our country has \nprotected our democracy and helped make the world more peaceful, secure \nand prosperous.\n  The sacrifices our soldiers have made in service to our country, and \nthe price their families have paid are worthy of America's honor and \nrespect. So as we celebrate the Army's 233rd birthday, we really \ncelebrate our men and women in uniform who have given so much. Thank \nyou.\n  In the Army's grandest tradition and as a proud Army veteran, I \nproclaim my annual Senate floor . . . ``HOOAH!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5589-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last month, I came to the floor to speak about the death of Sean \nKennedy of Greenville, SC. This young man was attacked outside a local \nbar and sustained fatal injuries. His attacker, Stephen Moller, had \npunched him in the face and left a message on a friend of the victim's \ncell phone, calling Sean a faggot and bragging that he had knocked him \nunconscious. Sean died 20 hours later.\n  Sean's mother, Elke Parker, watched as Moller pled guilty to \nmanslaughter, for which the judge gave him a 5-year sentence. The \nsentence was then reduced to 3 years. For the mother of a son killed in \na hate crime, this is not justice. Had the Matthew Shepard Act been \nsigned into law before Sean's death, prosecutors would have been able \nto charge the defendant with a violent hate crime under the law. \nAdditionally, the Federal Government would have been authorized to \nprovide investigatory and prosecutorial assistance, which could have \nled to a sentence commensurate with the brutality of this attack.\n  After the trial, Elke told reporters that she would push for Federal \nhate crime legislation. ``It may not help Sean today, but I want it to \nhelp future victims that they can be assured that there is justice. If \nyour son or daughter is different, you need to support them for who \nthey really need to be,'' she said. I was honored to speak with her \nabout this legislation last month and look forward to working with her \nas we push for its passage.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5589-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5589-S5590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARAIS DES CYGNES MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last month in Kansas, I was able to be \npresent for the commemoration of an important, but little known, event \nin American history. 150 years ago, May 19, 1858, a little defile in \nKansas near Mine Creek was the site of one of the incidents that led up \nto the Civil War; the massacre of free State settlers by proslavery \nmen.\n  The Marais des Cygnes Massacre is considered the last significant act \nof violence in Bleeding Kansas before the final cataclysm of civil war \nengulfed the Nation. On May 19, 1858, 30 men led by Charles Hamilton, a \nsouthern proslavery leader, crossed into Kansas from Missouri. Once \nthere, they captured 11 free State men, none of whom was armed and none \nof whom had engaged in violence. Many of them knew Hamilton and didn't \nsuspect he meant to harm them. These prisoners were led into a defile, \nwhere Hamilton ordered them shot and fired the first bullet himself. \nFive men were killed.\n  Hamilton's gang went back to Missouri, and only one man was ever \nbrought to justice. William Griffith of Bates County, MO, was arrested \nin the spring of 1863 and hanged on October 30 of that year.\n  The incident horrified the Nation, and inspired John Greenleaf \nWhittier to write a poem on the murder, ``Le Marais du Cygnes,'' which \nappeared in the September 1858 Atlantic Monthly. The incident and the \npoem strengthened the resolve of the antislavery cause around the \nNation.\n  In 1941 the Kansas Legislature authorized acceptance of the massacre \nsite, including Hadsall's house, as a gift to the State from the \nPleasanton Post, Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 1961 it provided funds \nfor the restoration of the building, and in 1963 the entire property \nwas turned over to the Kansas State Historical Society for \nadministration. A museum was established in the upper floor of the \nbuilding in 1964. The Kansas Historical Society has done great work in \nadministering the site since 1963. Just recently Riley Albert Hinds, a \nyoung man from Pleasanton, did some work for an Eagle Scout project \nthat was very important for the restoration of this site, and \ncontributed greatly to the existing historical research on Marais des \nCygnes.\n  From 1854 to 1861 Kansas was the scene of a bitter struggle to \ndetermine whether the territory should enter the Union as a free or a \nslave State. We\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\npaid greatly as a Nation for the ``original sin'' of slavery in terms \nof blood and treasure, and there is still much healing that needs to \ntake place. Part of our greatness as a Nation is our ability to \nacknowledge both the good parts and the bad parts of our history, and \nto make amends for injustices of the past.\n  Keeping alive our historical memory is a key to understanding \nourselves as a Nation and as people. Communicating the rich history of \nour Nation to every generation is of the utmost importance. Knowing and \nlearning from our history is one of the keys to maintaining a healthy, \ndemocratic society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5590-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING MY CHILDREN ON FATHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, though the origin of Father's Day is not \nclear, fathers throughout the United States are made to feel special by \ntheir children every year, on the third Sunday in June.\n  Sunday, June 15, marks my 24th year as Dad to Mike, Jay and Shae. And \nin recent years, their seven children have made me a doting granddad to \nboot, doubling the joy of our celebration.\n  Throughout these years, I have never taken a Father's Day remembrance \nfor granted--perhaps because I adopted my children when I had the \nwisdom and maturity to appreciate the pure joy of having them in my \nlife. I have treasured the handmade trinkets, the interesting ties and \nthe simple melody of their voices greeting me on that Sunday morning \nevery year, ``Happy Father's Day, Dad! We love you.''\n  Father's Day always has been a time of reflection for Suzanne and \nme--to look back fondly on our kids' achievements and to take pride in \nhow they handled life's disappointments. I remember Shae's first date \nand her first breakup, Mike's first car and Jay's first soccer game.\n  But nothing affected me as emotionally as my children's love and \nloyalty during the dark days of last August.\n  When I was under siege by the media, by my political opponents and \neven by some I thought were my friends, it was my three children who \nsurrendered their privacy and risked being tarred by those demanding my \nhead to take on their Dad's critics.\n  They were relentless in correcting the record--in television \ninterviews and in doggedly responding to newspaper reporters' endless \nquestions. And when I appeared before the media to respond to \nunspeakable accusations, my kids stood with me, looking my accusers \nsquarely in the eye. In the privacy of our home, when I would despair, \nthey were there to lift up their Dad.\n  Someone once said, ``If there is anything better than to be loved, it \nis loving.''\n  No father in America is prouder of his children than I. So this \nSunday, the luckiest Dad in Idaho won't be just waiting around for his \nannual Father's Day calls and visits. This Father's Day, Dad is \nhonoring the three who chose me to be their father--Shae, Mike and Jay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5590-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this Saturday, June 14, our Nation \ncelebrates Flag Day. It was on this day 231 years ago that the Second \nContinental Congress officially adopted the red, white, and blue flag \nto serve as an icon for our newly formed Nation. Living and working in \nthe United States, one may find it easy to overlook the prevalence of \nour flag--it stands atop buildings, in school yards, next to libraries, \nand even in our neighborhoods. President Woodrow Wilson, in recognition \nof the significance of our flag, set aside June 14 as a day to observe \nour flag and take pride in our Nation.\n  The first flag, commonly known as the ``Betsy Ross'' flag--given the \nname after the legend that she designed the flag--contained 13 stars \nand stripes to symbolize the 13 original colonies. As our Nation grew, \nso did the stars in the constellation, finally leaving us with the 50 \nstars that we all recognize today.\n  One of the many beautiful aspects of our flag is that it can mean \ndifferent things to different folks and is even open to your own \npersonal interpretation. For many, the flag represents freedom; for \nothers, individual rights or justice. For some, it is a reminder of \nthose who fought to protect all Americans' right to life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness.\n  Our first President, George Washington, had this to say about the \nflag's symbolism: ``We take the stars from heaven, the red from our \nmother country, separate it by white in stripes, thus showing that we \nhave separated from her.''\n  This year, we honor our flag the day before Father's Day. In light of \nthis, I would especially like to pay tribute to all the fathers serving \nin our armed forces who will be unable to celebrate with their families \nthis weekend. I ask that we keep these brave men--whose service ensures \nthe freedom that our flag so gallantly symbolizes--in our hearts and \nprayers as we celebrate Flag Day.\n  In closing, let me read an excerpt from a poem that is familiar to \nmany in our country, because it has been read at countless ceremonies \nwhere American citizens are gathered. It's entitled ``I am the Flag,'' \nand it was written by Howard Schnauber:\n\n     I am the flag of the United States of America.\n     My name is Old Glory.\n     I fly atop the world's tallest buildings.\n     I stand watch in America's halls of justice.\n     I fly majestically over institutions of learning.\n     I stand guard with power in the world.\n     Look up . . . and see me.\n\n     I stand for peace, honor, truth and justice.\n     I stand for freedom.\n     I am confident.\n     I am arrogant.\n     I am proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5590-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LOSS OF LIFE DURING IOWA TORNADO\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nheartfelt sympathies for the families of four young Boy Scouts who lost \ntheir lives, and 48 other who were injured, in a terrible storm and \ntornado which struck last night just across the border from Nebraska in \nmy neighboring state of Iowa.\n  Josh Fennen, 13; Sam Thomsen, 13; and Ben Petrzilka, 14--all of \nOmaha, Nebraska--and Aaron Eilerts, 14, of Eagle Grove, IA, were on \nwhat should have been a fun-filled camping trip with their Boy Scouts \nof America troop in a beautiful and rugged area not far from Omaha when \nthis terrible weather hit their campsite.\n  At this somber time, I would like to recognize the heroism of the \nScouts who came to the aid of those injured yesterday. You have the \nadmiration of our entire State; your heroism and courage are in the \nfinest tradition of Scouting. As an Eagle Scout, my thoughts go out to \nthe entire Boy Scouts of America organization--nowhere is the sense of \nbrotherhood so deep as with this wonderful group. While it is a dark \nhour for the Scouts, the character, strength, and sense of duty of \nthese brave young men will help carry them through this tragedy.\n  Midwesterners are accustomed to violent weather, but we will never be \naccustomed to the tragic loss of life it sometimes brings. My thoughts \nand prayers are with these young victims and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5590-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5590-S5591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        2007 SLOAN AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER.

A bill to stimulate the economy by encouraging energy \nefficiency, infrastructure and workforce investment, and homeownership \nretention, and by amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncertain business tax relief and incentives, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Economic \nRecovery Act of 2008. I think it is evident our economy is struggling \nto overcome the twin effects of record-high energy prices and a steep \ndownturn in the housing market.\n  Earlier this year, this Congress acted to provide rebates to \ntaxpayers to help them cope with the effects of the downturn in the \neconomy. The hope was also that the impact of these rebate checks would \nbe to stimulate the economy.\n  It is evident much more needs to be done, so the legislation I am \nintroducing today is aimed at reinvigorating our economy. It is my \nproposal for a second economic stimulus package.\n  Over the course of the past several years, we have seen the price of \noil climb by more than 400 percent, from about $30 per barrel in 2003, \nto more than $133 per barrel this morning. This escalation in energy \ncosts threatens to plunge our economy into a recession, and it is \nimposing a tremendous hardship on middle-income and low-income \nfamilies, on our truckdrivers, our farmers, our fishermen, our schools, \nvirtually everyone.\n  Big factories and mills, as well as small businesses, have also been \nharmed by high energy prices. In fact, a week ago we learned a mill in \nMillinocket, ME, is going to be forced to shut down because it can no \nlonger afford the oil that is essential to the operations of that paper \nmill.\n  We are working with Governor Baldacci to try to find alternatives. \nBut it is a prime example of the tremendously harmful impact high \nenergy prices are having on the economy of our State and indeed States \nthroughout the Nation.\n  Gasoline is already topping $4 a gallon 2 weeks into the summer \ndriving season. Maine families fear the cost of staying warm next \nwinter because home heating oil prices have reached record highs.\n  At the same time, the cost of diesel fuel is pushing some of \nAmerica's independent truckers to the brink of bankruptcy. Consider \nthis astonishing fact. In 1999, a Maine truck driver could go from \nAugusta, ME, all the way to Albuquerque, NM, on $500 worth of diesel. \nToday, $500 worth of diesel will not get that truck driver to Altoona, \nPA. What a difference a few years makes.\n  Of course, with diesel prices continuing to increase, the problem is \nonly getting worse. Meanwhile, weaknesses in the housing market are \nmaking it impossible for millions of Americans to get the financing \nthey need to stay in their homes when their adjustable rate mortgages \nreset. Many of these families are being forced into foreclosure, \nleaving behind vacant properties and creating a ripple effect that is \npulling down home values even further. This problem hurts communities \nacross the Nation, and it requires an effective Federal response.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would provide much-needed help \nto Americans who are struggling with high energy costs and the weak \nhousing market. Let me outline the provisions of the economic stimulus \npackage I am proposing.\n  First, the Economic Recovery Act proposes a series of initiatives to \npromote increased energy efficiency that would help consumers save \nmoney on their energy bills, and help advance the goal of energy \nindependence for our Nation.\n  Second, the bill provides relief from truck weight regulations that \nare injuring truckers in the State of Maine.\n  Third, it proposes a new program to finance transportation \ninfrastructure that is based on the model of the Build American Bonds \nBill.\n  Fourth, it would increase funding under the Workforce Investment Act \nso we can help displaced and unemployed or underemployed workers.\n  Fifth, it proposes tax incentives designed to help America's small \nbusinesses.\n  And, sixth, it would help to restore stability in the housing market \nby expanding the FHA Secure Program, which would help homeowners \nrefinance mortgages that are in danger of foreclosure.\n  We have focused a lot on the housing problems and the turmoil in the \nhousing and financial markets. Indeed, that is an important factor in \nthe decline of our economy. As I have indicated, I think more needs to \nbe done. But I am convinced high energy prices are an even greater \ncause of the economic downturn.\n  We must act to protect ourselves from rapid increases in oil prices \nand in the long term achieve energy independence. One way to help \nachieve both those goals is to encourage greater efficiency. My bill \nwould double the funding for the Department of Energy's Weatherization \nProgram, reaching $1.4 billion by the year 2010.\n  The bill would also provide $112 million each year for the valuable \nEnergy Star Program, which helps consumers choose energy-efficient \nappliances, and would extend the renewable electricity tax credit \nthrough 2011 and the residential investment tax credit for solar and \nenergy-efficient buildings through 2012.\n  My bill also includes a $500 credit to consumers who replace their \nold wood-burning stove with a new, cleaner-burning model using wood or \nwood pellets. This complements a proposal I introduced in February.\n  We must take action to address the impact rising diesel prices are \nhaving on the trucking industry, which is struggling. The rapid \nincrease in the price of diesel is making it more difficult for our \nNation's truckers to stay on the road.\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\n  It is also increasing the cost of delivering goods that communities \nthroughout our country rely on. We can help trucks to operate more \nefficiently if we ease Federal trucking regulations that prohibit \ntrucks that carry more than 80,000 pounds from traveling on the Federal \ninterstate system.\n  My bill includes a provision that would create a 2-year pilot project \nthat would permit trucks carrying up to 100,000 pounds, which is the \nweight level that is permitted on Maine's highways, to travel on the \nInterstate Highway system when diesel prices are at or above $3.50 a \ngallon. The savings on fuel consumption will benefit the trucking \nindustry, the consumer, and our Nation at a time when we are looking \nfor ways to decrease our dependency on foreign oil.\n  Let me tell you, the current system simply makes no sense at all. In \nMaine, the trucks that have 100,000 pounds of cargo are forced to leave \nthe Interstate in Augusta, ME, a road that is built to accommodate the \nheaviest trucks, and instead are forced to go on secondary roads \nthrough towns and villages, stopping at railroad crossings. That wastes \nfuel, and is less safe than keeping them on the Interstate. The trip \ntakes much longer because they are on secondary and slower roads that \noften are not the most direct routes to the destination. So that simply \nmakes no sense at all.\n  Any proposal to stimulate the economy should help to fund \ntransportation infrastructure projects. They are a proven means of \nfostering economic growth and are a lasting investment; an investment \nwe need.\n  This past winter has been so difficult and so hard on the roads in \nMaine. I do not think I have ever seen so many frost heaves and so much \nwear and tear that the very difficult cold and snowy winter has had on \nour roads and highways as I have seen this spring in Maine. The \nlegislation I have introduced calls for a $50 billion investment \nthrough new transportation bonds for roads, bridges, transit, rail, and \nwaterways.\n  Now, I wish to give credit where credit is due. This proposal which I \nput into the economic stimulus package was first introduced by Senator \nWyden. I was very pleased to be a cosponsor of his bill. I have \nincluded our proposal as part of this broader package. Not only will \nthis funding serve as the catalyst for thousands of good jobs today, we \nall know construction jobs are good jobs, but it also will improve our \ntransportation infrastructure, which is critical to economic \ndevelopment over the long term.\n  This is an investment that makes sense. Many of these transportation \nprojects are ready to go. They only need the funding. We must also act \nto provide assistance to those who have lost their jobs in this \neconomic downturn. Now, that means extending unemployment compensation \nbenefits. I hope we are going to do that soon. But in addition, we need \nto invest in our workers.\n  In the last 4 months, we have seen 340,000 jobs lost across the \ncountry. Today, we have more than 1.6 million additional unemployed \nworkers, compared to 2001; 800,000 more than a year ago. The national \nunemployment rate has jumped to 5.5 percent. In my home State, 33,600 \nMainers are looking for work.\n  In view of this increase in unemployment, it makes no sense \nwhatsoever that the President's budget actually proposes another cut in \nthe Workforce Investment Act. In fact, overall, the President's budget \nwould cut $1.5 billion from the Department of Labor's workforce \nprograms.\n  We must invest in America's workforce. Yet since fiscal year 2001, \nfunding for the Workforce Investment Act programs has been reduced by \nnearly $1.7 billion in real terms. My bill would provide $1 billion in \nadditional Workforce Investment Act funding that would enable us to \ntrain nearly 300,000 additional workers.\n  The bill would also increase funding for the Dislocated Workers \nprogram and for Youth and Adult training programs. Support for job \ntraining, investing in our workers is critical, but it is also \nimportant that we provide relief to the job creators in our economy, \nand that is our small businesses. The fact is, small businesses create \n80 percent of the net new jobs in America. During economic downturns, \nhowever, they struggle with cash flow and they must forgo investments \nthey need to grow and remain competitive. That is why I am proposing \nsome tax incentives to help small businesses.\n  First, we should make the Section 179 expensing limit for small \ncompanies permanent so they can count on it. Second, we should renew a \nprovision of tax law that allows restaurant owners to depreciate their \nequipment more quickly, over 15 years.\n  Finally, we must take action to steady the housing market. More than \n50 million Americans hold mortgages at present and, fortunately, most \nof them are current with their payments. But 7 million of these \nmortgages are so-called subprime loans, and most of them are adjustable \nrate mortgages that reset to higher, often unaffordable rates after \nonly 2 or 3 years of very low introductory rates. What we are finding \nis a lot of first-time homeowners simply did not understand the risk \nthey were taking with subprime loans. As a result, approximately 1.3 \nmillion of these 7 million subprime mortgages are delinquent and could \nsoon be in foreclosure. This number is expected to rise as more \nmortgages reach the reset date.\n  I am not interested in bailing out speculators, people who took a \ngamble that housing prices were going to increase. What I am talking \nabout are homeowners who were peddled an unsuitable mortgage product. \nWe need to help them. Foreclosures inflict losses all around--on the \nfamilies who lose their homes; on the neighborhoods where values fall \nas empty houses proliferate; on borrowers who face tighter requirements \nand higher costs, as perceptions of lending risk increase; and on those \nwho work in the construction or real estate industry, dependent on a \nstrong housing market.\n  One source of help--and this is what I am proposing in my bill--would \nbe to bolster the FHASecure program administered by the Federal Housing \nAdministration. This program allows eligible homeowners to avoid \nforeclosure by assisting them with refinancing so they can afford to \nmake their mortgage payments. My bill would expand this program to make \nit easier for lenders to accept voluntary write-downs of distressed \nmortgages and allow borrowers whose incomes are not sufficient to meet \nthe terms of their existing mortgages to refinance their homes on terms \nthey could afford. My bill also grants the FHA expanded authority to \nadjust insurance premiums, depending on the individual borrower's risk \nprofile, to ensure the solvency of the FHA insurance fund. These \nprovisions could help FHA reach hundreds of thousands of additional \nhomeowners by the end of the year, and to do so without taxpayer \nsubsidies.\n  The legislation I am introducing today includes comprehensive \nproposals that, taken together, would go a long way toward addressing \nthe two factors truly harming our economy--high energy prices and a \nweakening housing market. I urge my colleagues to work together in a \nbipartisan way, to look at the ideas that I and others have proposed so \nwe can work together on a second stimulus package to address these \nconcerns and to help restore and strengthen our Nation's economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 3125. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \ncertain expiring provisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, George Bernard Shaw once said: ``If all \neconomists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.''\n  Sometimes I feel the same about legislation to extend expiring tax \nprovisions. Sometimes it feels as though that process never reaches a \nconclusion. Regrettably, Tuesday, the Senate failed to invoke cloture \non the motion to proceed to the House-passed renewable energy and tax \nextenders bill.\n  Today, we must begin anew the march to a conclusion for the tax \nextenders package.\n  Next week, the Senate will face a choice. We'll vote again on getting \nto the tax extenders bill. We'll vote on allowing the Senate to get to \nthe substitute amendment, the text of which I introduce today. I think \nthat it's a pretty easy choice.\n  We need to decide whether we will develop new jobs and new \nmedications.\n  Or, we can continue to allow hedge fund managers to defer, without \nlimitation, their compensation for investing other people's money.\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\n  The choice is easy. We must pass this package of expiring provisions. \nWe must reach a conclusion.\n  Last month, the House passed its renewable energy and tax extenders \npackage, by a vote of 263 to 160. It came over to the Senate last week. \nMy Colleagues on the other side of the aisle objected to moving to the \nHouse bill, for which I was prepared to offer a substitute amendment.\n  Today, I am introducing that substitute amendment as a stand-alone \nbill. This extender package is fully paid-for. These offsets are \nfiscally responsible. And these revenue-raising provisions are also \nsound tax policy.\n  The first revenue-raising provision is an extension of the effective \ndate of the worldwide allocation of interest. The bill would delay \napplication of the new rule.\n  This section of the code is scheduled to take effect in 2009.\n  Many of the companies that will benefit from this provision told me \nthat they would rather have business extenders, including R, active \nfinancing, and CFC look-through. They prefer those important extenders \nto a 2009 application of the world wide allocation of interest.\n  These companies want a conclusion. And, they realize that to get a \nconclusion, they, along with Congress, must be fiscally responsible and \npay for these provisions.\n  This provision allows Congress to be fiscally responsible and to pay \nfor the priorities of the business community.\n  The second revenue-raising provision addresses offshore deferred \ncompensation. This provision prevents hedge fund managers from \ndeferring income. This is not an increase in tax on hedge fund \nmanagers. Rather, it is a change in the timing of when they have to pay \ntheir income tax.\n  We need to make decisions about our priorities. Is the ability of \nhedge fund managers to defer taxation of their compensation more \nimportant than spurring research and development?\n  This bill has a solid energy-tax package. It has about $17 billion in \nincentives for alternative energy, efficiency, and clean coal. This \npackage is important for our environment and energy security. And it's \nimportant to facilitate the transition to a carbon-controlled economy.\n  I have been working to get the Congress to pass a good energy-tax \npackage for the better part of a year. At the beginning of last year, \nthe Finance Committee conducted several hearings. Last June, the \nCommittee marked up a bill to bolster investment in clean energy, \nefficiency, and clean coal. Our bill--a roughly $30 billion package--\npassed the Finance Committee with a 15-to-5 vote.\n  The bill included a 5-year extension of the credit for production of \nrenewable electricity. That credit enjoys strong bipartisan support.\n  It included 8-year extensions of credits for solar power. Solar power \nstill needs significant subsidies to compete with fossil-based energy.\n  It included $4 billion in new funds for clean coal tax credits. These \ncredits are needed to demonstrate that coal--which accounts for half of \nthis Nation's electricity--can be burned cleanly.\n  The bill included a new consumer credit for plug-in hybrids. Already \nprototypes of plug-in hybrids can go a hundred miles on a gallon of \ngas.\n  The bill included a new credit for cellulosic ethanol. Some experts \npredict that cellulosic ethanol will become the fuel of the future.\n  Last June's Finance Committee package was largely financed by \nreducing tax benefits for oil and gas companies. We proposed repealing \nthe manufacturing deduction for oil and gas firms. That raised about \n$9.4 billion for the package.\n  We proposed a tax on production in the Gulf of Mexico, with credit \nfor the tax provided to companies paying royalties on that production. \nThis raised more than $10 billion.\n  We also proposed tightening the rules on tax credits received by oil \nand gas companies that pay taxes to overseas jurisdictions. This \nproposal raised about $3.2 billion.\n  Taken together, these tax changes would have financed about two-\nthirds of the roughly $30 billion energy-tax package. We argued that \nthe oil and gas offsets were justified, in part because of record-high \noil prices. Recall that in 2005, President Bush said, ``With $55 (a \nbarrel) oil we don't need incentives to oil and gas companies to \nexplore.''\n  When the Finance Committee passed this energy-tax bill, oil traded at \n$69 a barrel.\n  After moving the bill through the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley \nand I offered that measure on the Senate floor. We offered it as an \namendment to the energy policy bill.\n  But our amendment got 57 votes on the floor, 3 shy of the 60 votes \nthat we needed to break a filibuster.\n  The objections, almost entirely from the other side, were that the \nbill would increase energy prices. They argued that our bill \nunreasonably targeted the oil and gas industry. They argued that the \npackage was simply too big.\n  So we went back to the drawing board. In negotiations with the House, \nwe cut the size of the energy package by about a third. We dropped the \n$10 billion tax on Gulf production. We retained repeal of the \nmanufacturing deduction for large oil and gas firms, and the provision \nto tighten loopholes on foreign tax credits for oil and gas companies. \nAnd we also included nearly $7 billion in offsets from President Bush's \nown budget proposal.\n  That's right. About one-third of the package that came to the Senate \nfloor in December was offset by items taken directly from proposals \noffered by President Bush in his 2008 budget.\n  Even though we cut the package by about a third, the bill still \nmaintained meaningful support for alternative energy and efficiency. It \nincluded extension of the renewable energy production credit. It \nincluded long-term extensions of credits for solar power. It included \n$2 billion for clean-coal projects. And it included a new consumer \nincentive for plug-in hybrid cars.\n  It was not as ambitious as the June 2007 Finance Committee bill. But \nthe compromise product that came to the Senate floor in December was a \nvery good package.\n  Nonetheless, the President issued a veto threat on the bill. And 40 \nSenators followed his lead. On December 12, 2007, the compromise \npackage failed in the Senate by a vote of 59 to 40, just one shy of 60 \nneeded to break yet another filibuster.\n  Faced with the choice of maintaining tax breaks for oil and gas \ncompanies and investing in a fledgling alternative energy industry, the \nSenate minority chose to protect the oil and gas companies.\n  Faced with the choice of investing in green-collar jobs or \nmaintaining the status quo on energy, the minority chose the status \nquo.\n  Remember the President's assertion that tax breaks were not needed \nwhen oil traded at $55 a barrel? Well, when the Senate voted on the \nenergy package on December 13, 2007, oil cost more than $92 a barrel.\n  So where are we now? Vital new energy-tax provisions--such as \nincentives for plug-in hybrid vehicles--have not become law. Existing \nincentives--such as those for energy-efficient appliances--have lapsed. \nAnd in less than 7 months, many others will lapse, including the \nrenewable energy production credit, solar credits, incentives for \nefficient buildings, and credits for biofuels.\n  So what do we do about it? To paraphrase Thomas Edison, ``I have not \nfailed. I've just found two ways that won't work.''\n  I hope that this attempt will work. The bill that I introduce today, \nand on which I hope the Senate can vote next week, includes a robust \nenergy package. It is very similar to that negotiated with the House \nlast year. It is very similar to the one that got 59 votes in the \nSenate.\n  Like last year's bills, this package includes long-term extensions of \nrenewable energy credits. It includes major funding for clean coal \nprojects. It includes a new incentive for plug-in hybrids. And it \nincludes extensions of vital incentives to promote energy efficiency.\n  This $17 billion energy package is slightly smaller than last \nDecember's. But it's still critically important to our Nation's energy \nfuture.\n  There is a key difference between this year's package and last \nyear's: the offsets. In response to criticisms of the oil and gas \noffsets and the President's veto threat, we have dropped proposals to \nrepeal oil and gas tax breaks.\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\n  Instead, we have included two offsets that have nothing to do with \noil and gas. In fact, they have nothing to do with energy. They are \nsimply good policy. And they have broad support.\n  The bill also extends provisions that offer tax benefits to \nindividuals and businesses. One such provision is the teacher expense \ndeduction.\n  Our schools are in desperate need of repair. Our students don't have \nthe books or supplies they need. Some teachers have taken it upon \nthemselves to use money from their own pockets to provide classroom \nsupplies for their students.\n  In 2005 alone, more than 3.4 million families took the teacher \nexpense deduction. The average salary for a teacher is about $38,000.\n  This says a lot about this profession's dedication to educating \nAmerica's youth. These teachers work diligently to make sure that \nAmerica stays competitive in this global economy by educating our \nchildren. And yet they pay out of their own pockets for supplies. The \nleast we can do is to help share the cost.\n  Another provision that is important to American families is the \nqualified tuition deduction. Tuition costs have long been increasing \nfaster than inflation. Parents and students worry about how to cover \nthese escalating costs.\n  4.4 million families took the qualified tuition deduction in 2005. \nBut the provision expired at the end of 2007.\n  The bill that I introduce today has other important benefits. \nMillions of families get tax relief from these expiring provisions and \nwill suffer without this legislation.\n  Businesses will also suffer if Congress does not act. Many of the \nbusiness provisions contained in the extenders package are crucial in \nallowing U.S.-based multinational corporations to compete effectively \nin a global economy.\n  America accounts for a third of the world's spending on scientific \nresearch and development, ranking first among all countries. This is \nimpressive. But relative to the size of our economy, America is in \nsixth place. And the trends show that maintaining American leadership \nin the future depends on increased commitment to research and science.\n  Asia has recognized this. Spending on research and development has \nincreased by 140 percent in China, Korea, and Taiwan. In America, it \nhas increased by only 34 percent.\n  Asia's commitment is already paying off. More than a hundred Fortune \n500 companies have opened research centers in India and China. I have \nvisited some of them. I was impressed with the level of skill of the \nworkers I met there.\n  There are workers in other countries who seek coveted research \npositions. Ireland, Poland, and other European countries would like \nAmerican corporations to shift their R operations to their countries. \nSome of these countries offer incredible tax and non-tax benefits.\n  Yet our R tax credit expired on December 31. American corporations \nare at a competitive disadvantage. They are unsure if they will be able \nto obtain the benefit of the credit this year. And they need to plan \nfor the future.\n  We need to pass an extenders package that allows American companies \nto take the credit as soon as possible.\n  American businesses need the R tax credit to compete in a global \neconomy. The R tax credit gives companies an incentive to begin or \ncontinue research here in America. These jobs pay well and result in \nthe creation of intellectual property.\n  We want these jobs. And we want the intellectual property to be \ncreated in our country.\n  American financial services companies successfully compete in world \nfinancial markets. We need to make sure, however, that the U.S. tax \nrules do not change that.\n  This legislation will extend the active financing exception to \nSubpart F. This provision preserves the international competitiveness \nof American-based financial services companies. This provision also \ncontains appropriate safeguards to ensure that only truly active \nbusinesses benefit.\n  The active financing exception applies to active financial service \nincome earned abroad by American financial services companies or \nAmerican manufacturing firms with a financial services operation. The \nexception makes sure that this income is not subject to U.S. tax until \nthat income is brought home to the U.S.\n  This provision will put the American financial services industry on \nan equal footing with foreign-based competitors who are not taxed on \nactive financial services income.\n  There are several other provisions in this bill that encourage \nbusinesses to invest in this country. There are provisions that will \nhelp American businesses compete in a global economy. We must extend \nthese provisions as soon as possible.\n  Finally, my bill will provide an AMT patch for 2008. The provision is \nnot offset, because we recognize the reality of the budget constraints \nwe face. We need to get this done. This is an important provision to \nthe American families.\n  The patch will hold the number of people subject to the AMT at 4.2 \nmillion. As a result, over 20 million taxpayers will avoid the AMT next \nyear.\n  The choice is easy. We should continue to support teachers, families \nand schools. We should continue to support the creation of jobs and \nintellectual property. That is why I urge my Colleagues to support this \nfully offset package.\n  Which is more important, Mr. President? 11 million families who take \nthe state and local tax deduction, or a few hundred hedge fund \nmanagers?\n  Which is more important? 3.5 million teachers who pay out of their \npocket for school supplies, or a few hundred hedge fund managers?\n  4.5 million families who struggle to pay for college tuition, or a \nfew hundred hedge fund managers?\n  It is time to reach a conclusion. You can lay all the extenders bills \nend to end. But I submit that the best conclusion is the extenders \npackage that I introduce today and that the Senate will try to get to \nnext week. I urge my Colleagues to support the motion to invoke cloture \non the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide a \nloan to the White Mountain Apache Tribe for use in planning, \nengineering, and designing a certain water system project; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the White \nMountain Apache Tribe Rural Water System Loan Authorization Act. This \nlegislation would authorize a Federal loan to the White Mountain Apache \nTribe for the planning, engineering, and design of a dam and reservoir, \nwhich will be used to provide drinking water to the tribe.\n  The White Mountain Apache Tribe, which is located on the Fort Apache \nIndian Reservation in eastern Arizona, has approximately 15,000 \nmembers. The majority of the reservation's residents are currently \nserved by a relative small well field. According to the tribe, well \nproduction has significantly decreased over the last few years, leading \nto summer drinking water shortages.\n  A small rural development funded diversion project on the North Fork \nof the White River on the tribe's reservation is planned for \nconstruction this year. The tribe indicates that when the project is \ncompleted it will replace most of the lost production from the existing \nwell field, but will not produce enough water to meet the demand of the \ntribe's growing population. Consequently, in order to meet the basic \ndrinking water needs of the tribe, a longer-term solution is needed. \nThe most likely and best solution is a relatively small dam and \nreservoir located on the tribe's reservation--the Miner Flat Dam.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would authorize the Secretary \nof the Interior to provide a Federal loan to the tribe for the \nplanning, engineering, and design of the Miner Flat Dam. A portion of \nthe funds set aside in the Arizona Water Settlements Act for future \nArizona Indian water settlements would be used to repay the loan. \nAlthough Congress specifically set aside money in the Arizona Water \nSettlements Act for this purpose, the money will not be available until \n2013. If the tribe were to wait until then to access these funds, the \ncost of Miner Flat Dam would increase $5 million to $7 million a year. \nTherefore, providing a loan to the tribe to expedite the planning of \nthe dam would ultimately decrease the project's costs.\n  Any Federal funding for the actual construction of the project would \nbe conditioned on the settlement of the tribe's water rights claims, \nwhich would have to be confirmed by Congress. The tribe is in the \nprocess of settling its water claims in the State of Arizona, and it is \nmy understanding that the parties involved in negotiating the tribe's \nwater claims will likely reach a settlement with the tribe this summer. \nOnce the parties reach an agreement, I intend to introduce legislation \nconfirming their settlement.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would bring the tribe one step \ncloser to having a reliable source of drinking water. Consequently, I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Dorgan, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3129. A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to prevent price \nmanipulation and excessive speculation and to increase transparency \nwith respect to energy trading on foreign exchanges conducted within \nthe United States; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senators \nFeinstein, Durbin, and Dorgan, the Close the London Loophole Act. This \nlegislation would ensure that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \nCFTC, has the same authority to detect, prevent, and punish \nmanipulation and excessive speculation for traders in the United States \nwho trade crude U.S. oil or other energy commodities on foreign \ncommodity exchanges as the CFTC has for traders who trade on U.S. \nexchanges.\n  Today, U.S. crude oil and gasoline futures are traded primarily on \nexchanges in New York and London. While the CFTC--our cop on the beat--\nhas clear authority to go after trading abuses on the New York \nexchange, its authority is less clear when it comes to U.S. energy \ncommodities traded on the London exchange. The bill we are introducing \ntoday would close the London loophole by ensuring the CFTC has all the \ninformation and authority it needs to stop price manipulation or \nexcessive speculation involving U.S. energy trades on foreign \nexchanges.\n  Under current law, the CFTC obtains the information it needs to \ndetect price manipulation and excessive speculation involving U.S. \nenergy trades on foreign exchanges only through voluntary data-sharing \nagreements it arranges with the relevant foreign regulators. In many \ninstances, the CFTC can take action against a U.S. trader on a foreign \nexchange to prevent manipulation or excessive speculation only with the \ncooperation and consent of the foreign regulator.\n  Our bill would strengthen CFTC oversight by providing the CFTC with \nclear legal authority, as well as a clear legal obligation, to obtain \ntrading data from foreign exchanges operating in the United States \nthrough direct trading terminals. In addition, the bill would enable \nthe CFTC to act on its own authority and initiative to prevent \nmanipulation or excessive speculation by U.S. traders directing trades \nthrough foreign exchanges. This new authority would ensure that our own \ngovernment has the information and ability to protect American markets \nfrom manipulation and excessive speculation, no matter where U.S. \nenergy commodities are traded. U.S. traders will no longer be able to \navoid the cop on the beat by routing their trades through a foreign \nexchange.\n  This legislation would complement a recent legislative initiative I \nhave long worked on to ensure that U.S. commodity markets are free from \nmanipulation and excessive speculation. Last month the Congress passed, \nover the President's veto, legislation to close the Enron loophole. \nThis loophole, enacted into law in 2000 at the behest of Enron and \nother commodity traders, had allowed large traders to buy and sell \nenergy commodities on U.S. electronic markets without CFTC oversight. \nThe legislation passed last month as part of the farm bill gave the \nCFTC the authority and mandate to police U.S. electronic exchanges to \nstop price manipulation and excessive speculation. No longer will these \nelectronic commodity exchanges be able to operate in the dark, as they \nhad under the Enron loophole.\n\n  Closing the Enron loophole is a major advance in U.S. energy market \noversight as a whole, and for our natural gas markets in particular, \nbut it is not enough. Because over the last two years, energy traders \nhave begun trading U.S. crude oil, gasoline, and home heating oil on \nthe London exchange, beyond the direct reach of U.S. regulators, we \nhave to address that second loophole too. I call it closing the London \nloophole.\n  There are currently two key energy commodity markets for U.S. crude \noil, gasoline, and heating oil trading. The first is the New York \nMercantile Exchange or NYMEX, located in New York City. The second is \nthe ICE Futures Europe exchange, located in London and regulated by the \nBritish agency called the Financial Services Authority.\n  British regulators do not oversee their energy markets the same way \nwe do. They don't place limits on speculation like we do, they don't \nmonitor trader positions like we do, and they do not require the same \ntype of data to be reported to regulatory authorities. That means that \ntraders can avoid U.S. crude oil speculation limits on the New York \nexchange by trading on the London exchange. It also makes the London \nexchange less transparent than the New York exchange. The legislation I \nintroduced last year to close the Enron loophole would have required \nU.S. traders on the London exchange to provide U.S. regulators with the \nsame type of trading information that they are already required to \nprovide when they trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \nUnfortunately, this provision was dropped from the close-the-Enron-\nloophole legislation in the farm bill.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act, S. 3044, which the Majority Leader and \nothers introduced recently to address high prices and reduce \nspeculation, included at my request a provision to curb rampant \nspeculation, increase our access to foreign exchange trading data, and \nstrengthen oversight of the trading of U.S. energy commodities no \nmatter where that trading occurs. This provision would require the \nCFTC, prior to allowing a foreign exchange to establish direct trading \nterminals located in this country, to obtain an agreement from that \nforeign exchange to impose speculative limits and reporting \nrequirements on traders of U.S. energy commodities comparable to the \nrequirements imposed by the CFTC on U.S. exchanges. This issue is so \nimportant that I introduced this section of the package as a separate \nbill, S. 2995, along with Senator Feinstein.\n  Following the introduction of our legislation, the CFTC finally moved \nto address some of the gaps in its ability to oversee foreign exchanges \noperating in the United States. Specifically, the CFTC, working with \nthe United Kingdom Financial Services Authority and the ICE Futures \nEurope exchange, announced that it will now obtain the following \ninformation about the trading of U.S. crude oil contracts on the London \nexchange: daily large trader reports on positions in West Texas \nIntermediate or WTI contracts traded on the London exchange; \ninformation on those large trader positions for all futures contracts, \nnot just a limited set of contracts due to expire in the near future; \nenhanced trader information to permit more detailed identification of \nend users; improved data formatting to facilitate integration of the \ndata with other CFTC data systems; and notification to the CFTC of when \na trader on ICE Futures Europe exceeds the position accountability \nlevels established by NYMEX for the trading of WTI crude oil contracts.\n\n  These new steps will strengthen the CFTC's ability to detect and \nprevent manipulation and excessive speculation in the oil and gasoline \nmarkets. It will ensure that the CFTC has the same type of information \nit receives from U.S. exchanges in order to detect and prevent \nmanipulation and excessive speculation on the London exchange.\n  However, in order to fully close the London loophole, better \ninformation is not enough. The CFTC must also have clear authority to \nact upon this information to stop manipulation and excessive \nspeculation.\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\n  That is why I have been working with the sponsors of the Consumer-\nFirst Energy Act to develop additional language to ensure that the CFTC \nhas the authority to act upon the information obtained from the London \nexchange to prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation. This \nnew provision would make it clear that the CFTC has the authority to \nprosecute and punish manipulation of the price of a commodity, \nregardless of whether the trader within the United States is trading on \na U.S. or on a foreign exchange. It would also make it clear that the \nCFTC has the authority to require traders in the United States to \nreduce their positions, no matter where the trading occurs--on a U.S. \nor foreign exchange--to prevent price manipulation or excessive \nspeculation in U.S. commodities. Finally, it would clarify that the \nCFTC has the authority to require all U.S. traders to keep records of \ntheir trades, regardless of which exchange the trader is using.\n  This new provision is included in the bill we are introducing today. \nI hope that it will also be included in the Consumer-First Energy Act \nwhen Senate debate is allowed to go forward on that bill.\n  In closing the London loophole, we will ensure there is a cop on the \nbeat for all U.S. energy commodity traders, no matter whether they are \ntrading on an exchange in New York or in London. It will ensure that \nour regulators have the information and the tools to detect, prevent, \nand punish manipulation and excessive speculation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Brown, Mr. Casey, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 3130. A bill to provide energy price relief by authorizing greater \nresources and authority for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor at the beginning of \nthis week to make a simple point: as oil prices have reached $139 per \nbarrel in recent days, the truth is that no one--not the oil industry, \nnot the futures exchanges, not the regulators, not even this United \nStates Senator--knows exactly what's going on here.\n  But with the economy in a tailspin and with the average price for a \ngallon of gas surpassing $4 and even higher across the country, it is \ntime to find out.\n  The chairman of the chief regulator of the futures markets, the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, doesn't seem to know either. In a \nrecent appropriations subcommittee hearing I chaired, Chairman Lukken \nstated that ``CFTC staff analysis indicates that the current higher \nfutures prices are generally not a result of manipulative forces.''\n  Yet last Thursday and Friday the futures price of a barrel of oil \nshot up $16. In 2 days. Unless there was a massive pipeline explosion \nlate last week that I somehow missed, there is simply no supply or \ndemand justification for that kind of price increase.\n  Something more is going on here.\n  Is it rampant speculation that is causing the rise in oil prices?\n  Is it illegal market manipulation?\n  Is it the fact that the stock markets are not providing investors \nwith decent returns at the moment, and so big investors are now pouring \nmoney into the futures markets instead?\n  Is it the hugely deflated dollar exchange rate that is behind this?\n  Is it that investors are worried about inflation and are using oil to \nhedge against that risk like they use to use gold?\n  Is it really the rising demand of emerging economies like China and \nIndia that is causing the price of oil to rise?\n  Is it the lack of true oversight into these markets that has \nencouraged institutional traders to take large speculative positions \nthrough overseas markets or over-the-counter trades, positions that \nthey can't take in other markets?\n  Is it the lack of portfolio caps that are in place for some futures \ncontracts but not for oil that has encouraged institutional traders to \ntake large speculative positions?\n  The questions go on and on. And the answers are scarce. Given the \nimportance of the price of gas to families in Illinois and across the \ncountry, I think that is scandalous.\n  That's why I'm introducing a bill today entitled the ``Increasing \nTransparency and Accountability in Oil Prices Act.'' This bill would \nprovide more people and better technology to the CFTC to help them \nbetter understand this situation. It also would give the CFTC far \ngreater visibility to the traders and the transactions that are \ninvolved here.\n  Specifically, this bill would:\n  Authorize the CFTC to hire an additional 100 FTEs, and express the \nSense of the Senate for the need for an emergency supplemental request \nfrom the President for this funding;\n  Close the ``London loophole'' by treating oil traders located in \nLondon as if they were trading in the U.S. for regulatory purposes, so \nthat the CFTC has access to oil trades on all exchanges rather than \njust the trades that take place physically in the U.S.;\n  Require more detailed reporting to the CFTC for index funds and swap \ndealers who typically take long positions that might drive up the price \nof oil;\n  Move the CFTC Inspector General out of the CFTC Chairman's office, to \nensure its objectivity; and\n  Initiate a GAO study of the existing international regulatory regime \nthat should be preventing excessive speculation and manipulation of oil \nprices.\n  Many of these ideas are not new. Senators Levin, Feinstein, Cantwell, \nand Dorgan have all been very active on these issues as have many \nothers, and of course Chairman Bingaman and Chairman Harkin have been \nleaders on these regulatory issues for years.\n  For my part, I intend to use my Chairmanship of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Financial Services and General Government to increase \nthe funding and capacity of the CFTC. We will expect the agency to use \nthese resources to get to the bottom of this.\n  Quickly.\n  These ideas--more regulatory resources and more market transparency--\nare ideas that many of my colleagues might agree with. I encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3130\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to ensure the \napplication of speculation limits to speculators in energy markets, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Oil \nSpeculation Control Act, a bill to reduce the impact of excessive \nspeculation in the oil markets.\n  The legislation is cosponsored by Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Last week the price of oil hit $138 per barrel. A commodity that used \nto be priced at $11 a barrel is now swinging $11 in a single day. \nYesterday it jumped $5--supposedly in response to a single Department \nof Energy report.\n  Gasoline prices now average more than $4.50 in California. Some gas \nstations have to charge by the half gallon. Their pumps cannot \ncalculate in prices this high.\n  There seems to be no relief in sight for consumers as we enter the \nsummer travel season.\n  In the Farm Bill Congress finally closed the ``Enron Loophole,'' and \nplaced all major electronic trades that could drive energy prices under \nthe watchful eye of the Commodity Futures Trading commission, CFTC.\n  Today I and Senator Levin introduced the Close the London Loophole \nAct to close another loophole. This bill would bring oversight to \nAmerican energy commodities being traded beyond our borders.\n  I also joined Senator Durbin in calling for the President to add 100 \nI enforcement professionals to the ranks of the CFTC.\n  However, these steps are not enough.\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\n  I believe we must do more to reduce the excessive speculation of \ninstitutional investors in oil markets.\n  So today I am introducing the Oil Speculation Control Act.\n  Let me explain what this bill would do.\n  First, it requires CFTC to review the trading practices of \ninstitutional investors and their dealers within 30 days:\n  It ensures that their trading is not adversely impacting the market \nprice.\n  It determines whether different regulations are necessary:\n  It proposes to Congress regulations and legislation necessary to \nprevent the dramatic increase of fuel costs in the futures markets.\n  Second, the bill establishes reporting requirements. It requires \ninstitutional investors, such as pension funds or endowments, to report \ntheir energy market positions to the CFTC, even when trades are \nexecuted by a third party broker.\n  To further increase transparency, it would force CFTC regulations and \nreports to begin distinguishing between the institutional investors and \nthe ``swaps dealers'' or ``index traders'' who broker their trades.\n  Third, the bill would force CFTC to limit institutional investor and \nindex trader positions, as CFTC limits the positions of more \ntraditional market speculators.\n  Fourth, it prevents CFTC from considering the positions of \ninstitutional investors or their brokers to be ``bone fide hedges'' \nthat would be exempt from speculative position limits.\n  Finally, it requires that the Office of the CFTC's Inspector General \nbe removed from the CFTC Chairman's Office and established as an \nindependent office.\n  This bill is necessary because I believe that speculation in oil \nfutures by large institutional investors and index funds is inflating \nthe price of oil.\n  The unconstrained and overwhelming entrance of these new commodity \ninvestors, who have bet more than 99 percent of their funds on prices \nrising, must be controlled.\n  Recent testimony before numerous Congressional Committees indicates \nthat between 2000 and 2002, major institutional investors began to view \ncommodity futures markets as a new ``asset class'' suitable to be used \nin large financial portfolios. Since 2000, investment fund managers \nhave come to believe that investing in commodities balances a stock \nportfolio.\n  As Daniel Yergin, one of the Nation's leading energy market experts \nput it: ``Oil has become the `new gold'--a financial asset in which \ninvestors seek refuge as inflation rises and the dollar weakens.''\n  Never before have so many institutional investors made large scale \ninvestments in commodity markets, but from 2003 to 2008, investments in \ncommodity index funds rose from $13 billion to $260 billion.\n  The implications for consumers of this shift are potentially \ndevastating. Unlike gold, energy and agricultural commodities meet \nessential needs in the everyday lives of average Americans, and the \npotential risk that investment strategies will push the price of these \ngoods higher during economic downturns presents a threat to the public \nwelfare. I do not believe this is in the best interest of the American \npublic.\n  Under the Commodity Exchange Act, the CFTC must impose speculation \nlimits on the size of energy trader positions. Crude oil speculative \npositions are limited to a total of 20 million barrels of oil and 3 \nmillion barrels of oil in the last three days of a contract.\n  However, it is CFTC's practice to exempt institutional investors from \nsuch limits when investors execute their trades through brokers or \ndealers.\n  This is a mistake.\n  They are not hedging against the risk of changing oil prices, as \nairlines or utilities frequently must do.\n  They never take delivery of the product.\n  They participate in the oil markets only on paper.\n  This bill will assure that the existing speculation limit powers will \nconstrain the market distortion resulting from this massive influx of \ncapital. It will ensure a regulatory system that limits the size and \ninfluence of institutional investor positions in energy markets.\n  Even CFTC has realized that its policy may be mistaken.\n  Last month it announced that it will review the trading practices for \nindex traders in the futures markets to ensure that this type of \ntrading activity is not adversely impacting the price discovery \nprocess. They also plan to determine whether different practices should \nbe employed.\n  Today's markets evolve quickly, and we need to make sure our market \noversight responds just as quickly.\n  We now know that over the last few years a whole new kind of investor \nhas entered oil markets. Institutional investors only bet that the \nprice will go up. No matter how high the price goes, they pour into the \nmarket to push it higher.\n  We have ways to control this. We have speculation limits. But we are \nnot using them. I am introducing this bill to make sure we use the \ntools we have.\n  As the markets continue to evolve, so must our regulation. I believe \nthe Oil Speculation Control Act takes this step, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish \nan annual production incentive fee with respect to Federal onshore and \noffshore land that is subject to a lease for production of oil or \nnatural gas under which production is not occurring, to authorize use \nof the fee for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Responsible \nOwnership of Public Land Act. I thank my friends Congressmen Rahm \nEmanuel, Ed Markey, Maurice Hinchey, and Nick Rahall for their \nleadership on this issue in the other chamber. With the issue of oil \nand gas prices at the forefront of our national consciousness, this \nbill is timely and critically needed.\n  As gas prices across the Nation soar to shocking, unprecedented \nlevels, we can all agree that the time has come to end our dependence \non oil. But that can't happen unless we also commit to something the \nBush administration and its allies in Congress have refused to:\n  End our dependence on the oil companies--on letting them hold the \nAmerican people and economy hostage to rising prices that have no end \nin sight.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, a gallon of regular unleaded \ngasoline today reached $4.36. That is an increase of 41 cents from just \na month ago--and $1.12 from only a year ago. For reasons that \neconomists seem at a loss to explain, my State today has the second-\nhighest gas prices in the Nation. It seems that every single day we \nturn on the television or open a newspaper, we hear about new records \nbeing set for the price of a barrel of oil or how much people are \npaying at the pump.\n  The rising price of gas only begins at the pump. It is also causing \nprices to rise at the grocery store and elsewhere. Wherever they go, \nfamilies are feeling economic pressure like never before--finding \nthemselves forced to make difficult decisions and cut down on spending \nin other areas simply so they can afford to commute to work or take \ntheir kids to school. Too often they are forced to choose between food, \ngas, utilities, and lifesaving medications.\n  In my view there are many things we need to do to address this \npressing issue. In the long term we need to develop clean, renewable \nenergy sources that will alleviate our dependence on foreign oil that \noften comes from unstable, hostile regimes and create new green jobs \nhere at home. But in the short term, we need to take steps to help out \nfamilies who are hurting and angry and need relief.\n  One idea we hear time and again from President Bush and his \nRepublican allies is that the answer to our energy problems is to open \nup environmentally fragile areas of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nto more drilling. In response, I would point out that there are already \n44 million offshore acres that have been leased by oil companies, who \nhave only put 10.5 million of those acres into production. Of the 47.5 \nmillion onshore acres under lease for oil and gas production, only 13 \nmillion are in production.\n  Combined, oil and gas companies hold leases to 68 million acres of \nFederal land and waters that they are not producing any oil and gas on. \nThis is compared to the 1.5 million acres that make up ANWR that \nproponents of drilling there would like to see opened up. Instead of \nputting pristine wilderness in grave peril, these companies should \nfirst be producing on acres already under lease. The vast majority of \noil and natural gas resources on Federal land are already open for \ndrilling and are not being tapped, and the oil and gas resources \navailable in the unused land under lease far outstrips what is \navailable in ANWR and other areas closed to drilling.\n  Therefore, I am offering this legislation as a solution to this \nproblem--a production incentive fee for acres under lease that are not \nin production. This fee would rise with the number of years the land \nhas been under lease but not used. The revenue raised by these fees \ncould be used to fund the development of clean, renewable energy, \nenergy efficiency, and programs such as LIHEAP that help families \nstruggling with sky-high energy prices.\n  Over the last 8 years, President Bush, Vice President Cheney and \ntheir allies in this body have done all they can to block any progress \ntoward energy independence. They have belittled and undermined policies \nand technologies that, had they been adopted, would have helped \nconsumers avoid the deplorable situation they find themselves in today.\n  As a result, American families are now at the mercy of foreign \ndictators, market speculators, and big oil companies reaping enormous \nprofits--the largest profits in corporate history.\n  As a result, every time the price of a gallon of gas reaches a new \nrecord, Americans are the ones paying the price of this \nadministration's inaction.\n  It is time to end our dependence on the oil companies. This bill \nwould start that process by saying the time has come to put the \nAmerican people first.\n  It is my hope that with the introduction of the Responsible Ownership \nof Public Land Act, we can begin again to work toward delivering the \nkind of change American families are desperate for. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in supporting this commonsense effort to responsibly \naddress the Nation's desperate energy needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\n  S. 3134. A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to require energy \ncommodities to be traded only on regulated markets, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, many experts have concluded \nthat the skyrocketing price of oil reflects not just the realities of \nsupply and demand but also the influence of speculators and futures \ntraders. Many of these speculators work for funds and investment banks \nwith no actual inventory of oil, and thus no business need to hedge \nagainst an increase in the price of oil. Put simply, they enter the \nenergy futures market to make a profit by gambling on the price per \nbarrel.\n  Last month, with passage of the Farm Bill, the Congress finally \nsucceeded in bringing a measure of oversight and transparency to this \nmarket, requiring the Commodities Future Trading Commission, CFTC, to \nreview all contracts to determine which ones should be regulated as \nthough traded on a major public exchange.\n  While this was a step in the right direction, and the result of much \nthoughtful discussion and debate, it could be improved upon and \nstrengthened. I am basing this on testimony heard by the Commerce \nCommittee on June 3 from Michael Greenberger, former director of CFTC's \nDivision of Trading and Markets. Mr. Greenberger has emerged as a \nleading expert on the current state of our Nation's energy markets.\n  In light of these developments and to add to the growing debate about \nhow to protect consumers and our economy from rampant speculation, I'm \nnow introducing a bill to shut down the unregulated oil futures markets \ncreated by the now-infamous ``Enron loophole.'' It also removes energy \nfrom the list of exempt commodities; requires energy to be traded on a \nregulated market, and creates a new definition of what constitutes an \nenergy commodity.\n  As the Senate continues to debate and ultimately consider proposals \nrelated to energy market speculation, the influence of large investors, \nregulated and unregulated exchanges, I would ask that my colleagues \nalso consider the ideas put forward in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nprovide for the establishment of a production incentive fee for \nnonproducing leases; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I have introduced \nlegislation which will impose a fee of no less than $5 per acre per \nyear for Federal lands leased in the Outer Continental Shelf, \nspecifically within the Gulf of Mexico.\n  It is my hope this legislation will improve the management of the \nnation's oil and gas leasing program, a program that has greatly \nexpanded in recent years. Since the 1990s, the federal government has \nconsistently encouraged the development of its oil and gas resources \nand drilling on federal lands has steadily increased during this time. \nThe number of drilling permits issued for lands on and offshore has \nexploded in recent years, going from 3,802 five years ago to 7,561 in \n2007.\n  Let me also share some statistics prepared by the House Resources \nCommittee regarding offshore energy resources. On the Outer Continental \nShelf, 82 percent of federal natural gas and 79 percent of Federal oil \nis located in areas that are currently open for leasing. Offshore, only \n10.5 million of the 44 million leased acres are currently producing oil \nor gas.\n  It is simply, unfair, dishonest, and disingenuous to try to persuade \nthe American people that all we need to do is drill. In fact, I have \nconcerns the oil companies are hoarding a resource that belongs to the \nUnited States of America and sitting upon it until the price is right \nfor them to drill. Before we open up more areas for leasing, we must \nfirst use what we have. That makes sense to me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 41. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act. This legislation continues the sanctions that are \nalready in place against the illegitimate\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\nruling Burmese regime, the State Peace and Development Council, or \nSPDC.\n  Last month, the whole world got a close look at the SPDC's contempt \nfor human life when a devastating cyclone hit Burma. No one can say \nwith certainty what the full toll of death and destruction is from the \nstorm--but we do know the junta greatly compounded matters through \ninaction and its utter disregard for the Burmese people.\n  The SPDC severely restricted the entry of relief workers into the \ncountry. Four U.S. Navy ships carrying much-needed supplies for the \nBurmese people were turned away time and again by the regime.\n  Estimates put as many as 135,000 people dead or missing after the \ncyclone hit on May 3, and many of those deaths must lie at the feet of \nthe SPDC for its outrageous acts of criminal neglect.\n  These sanctions, if enacted, would make clear to the SPDC that the \nUnited States continues to stand squarely with the long-suffering \npeople of Burma and against the morally bankrupt junta.\n  This bill is the same legislation the Senate has passed in prior \nyears. If enacted, it would extend import sanctions for another year \nunless the regime takes a number of tangible steps toward democracy and \nreconciliation.\n  I and many others believe these sanctions should be tightened even \nfurther, but those efforts will be pursued at a later date in separate \nlegislation.\n  I am joined, as always, by two colleagues who are both steadfast and \nlongtime advocates for the freedom of the Burmese people: Senator \nDianne Feinstein and Senator John McCain. I am proud to stand alongside \nthese two friends in support of this important legislation.\n  Before I close I want to clarify one important point for my \ncolleagues. This bill would in no way hinder or block America's \ncontinuing efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the people in Burma \nin the wake of the cyclone. This bill imposes sanctions on trade, not \nhumanitarian aid.\n  America is a friend to the people of Burma. That is why we stand \nagainst Burma's tyrannical ruling regime. I hope my colleagues will \ncontinue to support this bill and continue to send that message to the \nSPDC.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Res. 594\n\n       Whereas Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, genetic disorder that \n     causes destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal \n     cord due to the poor functioning of an enzyme called beta-\n     hexosaminidase A;\n       Whereas there is no proven treatment or cure for Tay-Sachs \n     disease and the disease is always fatal in children;\n       Whereas the disorder was named after Warren Tay, an \n     ophthalmologist from the United Kingdom, and Bernard Sachs, a \n     neurologist from the United States, both of whom contributed \n     to the discovery of the disease in 1881 and 1887, \n     respectively;\n       Whereas Tay-Sachs disease often affects families with no \n     prior history of the disease;\n       Whereas approximately 1 in 27 Ashkenazi Jews, 1 in 30 \n     Louisianan Cajuns, 1 in 30 French Canadians, 1 in 50 Irish \n     Americans, and 1 in every 250 people are carriers of Tay-\n     Sachs disease, which means approximately 1,200,000 Americans \n     are carriers;\n       Whereas these unaffected carriers of the disease possess \n     the recessive gene that can trigger the disease in future \n     generations;\n       Whereas, if both parents of a child are carriers of Tay-\n     Sachs disease, there is a 1 in 4 chance that the child will \n     develop Tay-Sachs disease;\n       Whereas a simple and inexpensive blood test can determine \n     if an individual is a carrier of Tay-Sachs disease, and all \n     people in the United States, especially those citizens who \n     are members of high-risk populations, should be screened; and\n       Whereas raising awareness of Tay-Sachs disease is the best \n     way to fight this horrific disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 2008 as \n     ``Tay-Sachs Awareness Month''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/12/senate-section/article/S5634-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 90--HONORING THE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED \n   STATES AIR FORCE WHO WERE KILLED IN THE JUNE 25, 1996, TERRORIST \n BOMBING OF THE KHOBAR TOWERS UNITED STATES MILITARY HOUSING COMPOUND \n                       NEAR DHAHRAN, SAUDI ARABIA\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nSununu, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Pryor) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nArmed Services:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 593, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 593) honoring the Detroit Red Wings \n     on winning the 2008 National Hockey League Stanley Cup \n     Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to submit this resolution \ntoday, along with my Michigan colleague, Senator Stabenow, \ncongratulating the Detroit Red Wings on a\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\nhard-fought victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2008 Stanley \nCup finals. Last Wednesday night, the Red Wings captured Lord Stanley's \nCup for the fourth time in 11 years, marking the 11th Stanley Cup \nChampionship in the Red Wings' storied 81-year history.\n  The 2008 Championship was secured through grit, and the strength of \nteam work. As Kris Draper said after the series clinching win, ``Once \nagain, our resolve came through.'' This resolve, and the winning \ntradition that spans every level of the Red Wings organization, has \nbeen fostered over the years by the Ilitch family, whose commitment to \nwinning championships and to the Detroit community are second to none.\n  The Red Wings season was defined by a physically dominating team that \nwas able to control play at both ends of the ice. After winning three \ndifficult playoff series on the road, the Red Wings followed up a \nheart-wrenching, triple-overtime loss at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, \nwith an equally epic 3-2 heart-stopping cup-clinching victory in \nPittsburgh. Moments after cutting Detroit's lead in half with a power-\nplay goal with just 1:27 remaining, Pittsburgh swiftly pushed the puck \nback deep into the Red Wings' zone. As time seemingly slowed, Red Wings \nfans tensely watched, hoping their team would be able to withstand this \nfinal onslaught. With the final seconds ticking away, a Pittsburgh \nplayer launched a backhander toward the goal, goalie Chris Osgood dove \nto the ice, stretching his pad to the post trying to block any rebound \nattempt. Another Penguin slapped at it, and almost unimaginably, the \npuck slithered all the way along the goal line, daring to throw the \ngame into yet another overtime inferno. And with that, the horn \nsounded, giving Red Wings fans everywhere the sweet taste of victory. I \nimmediately called my daughter Erica to share in her joy as a Red Wing \nfanatic. Knowing that for her, those last few seemed like an eternity.\n  This euphoria spilled out into the streets of Detroit last Friday, \nwhere over a million fans joined the Red Wings organization in \ncelebration. Unfazed by the 92-degree heat, the Red Wings faithful \nflaunted their red and white, swelling with pride over victoriously \nnavigating the difficult path to the cup.\n  Throughout the season, each member of the Red Wings organization \nworked tirelessly toward their ultimate goal to bring the Cup home to \nHockeytown. The members of the 2008 Red Wings include Andrea Lilja, \nKyle Quincey, Niklas Lidstrom, Justin Abdelkader, Dan Cleary, Pavel \nDatsyuk, Derek Meech, Dallas Drake, Kirk Maltby, Aaron Downey, Brett \nLebda, Brad Stuart, Chris Chelios, Darren McCarty, Jiri Hudler, Brian \nRafalski, Kris Draper, Mikael Samuelsson, Henrik Zetterberg, Mattias \nRitola, Darren Helm, Mark Hartigan, Jakub Kindl, Valtteri Flippula, \nJonathan Ericsson, Niklas Kronwall, Thomas Kopecky, Johan Franzen, \nThomas Holmstrom, Chris Osgood, Jimmy Howard, Dominik Hasek, Head Coach \nMike Babcock, and Assistant Coaches Paul McLean and Todd McLellan.\n  The Red Wings are one of the original six teams of the National \nHockey League, and since their inception in 1926, have been a constant \nsource of pride and inspiration for hockey fans throughout Michigan. \nThe Red Wings have won the third most Stanley Cup Championships in the \nNHL, earning the distinction as one of the NHL's most successful \nfranchises, and the most dominating over the past decade and a half. \nThe Red Wings excellence, along with the undying love and support of \nthe fans in Michigan and the enormous popularity of hockey in Michigan, \nmake it clear why Detroit is widely known as Hockeytown, U.S.A.\n  Veterans such as Nicklas Lidstrom, Chris Chelios, Darren McCarty, \nKris Draper and Kirk Maltby have remained integral figures on the ice \nand positive role models in the community for many years. Dearborn \nnative Brian Rafalski, and Northern Michigan Alum Dallas Drake further \ndeepen the team's Michigan roots. Drake returned this year to the team \nthat drafted him and can now add a Stanley Cup championship to the one \nhe earned as a member of the 1991 Northern Michigan University NCAA \nhockey championship team.\n  While this is first and foremost a team accomplishment, I would be \nremiss not to highlight a couple of individuals who contributed \nmightily to the team's overall success. Henrick Zetterberg, the Conn \nSmythe trophy winner, set a Red Wings playoff record with 27 points, \nincluding a remarkable six goal effort in the finals, the last of which \nproved to be the series clincher. In addition, Captain Nicklas \nLidstrom, with his calm demeanor and unshakable nerve, became the first \nEuropean born player to captain an NHL team to a Stanley Cup \nchampionship.\n  The Red Wings continue to set the standard for championship-caliber \nhockey and teamwork. From long-time members of the Red Wings \norganization, to veteran additions to the roster, to new, young talent \nthat helped to energize the team, the 2008 team united and won in \nclassic Red Wings fashion. In doing so, the Red Wings have once again \ntaken hockey fans across the country on a tremendous journey.\n  Let the record reflect a symbolic gesture as if to throw an octopus \nonto the floor of the Senate. Go Wings! I know my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating the players, owners, and fans of the Detroit Red Wings \non capturing the Stanley Cup once again.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
