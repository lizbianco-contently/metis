Mr. President, yesterday, the Acting Commissioner of \nthe Internal Revenue Service sent a letter to Congress warning about \nthe consequences of not addressing the AMT tax right away. She said \nthat if we don't do something about this middle class tax hike by \nDecember, as many as 50 million Americans, more than a third of all \nU.S. taxpayers, will either get hit by a tax that was never meant for \nthem or forced to wait months for a refund that many of them count on \nfor their family budgets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Acting \nCommissioner Linda Stiff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles B. Rangel,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter clarifying \n     your plans to enact legislation addressing the alternative \n     minimum tax\n\n[[Page S13648]]\n\n     (AMT) through an indexed exemption amount for 2007 and \n     allowance of personal credits against the AMT. We appreciate \n     your commitment to pass AMT legislation as quickly as \n     possible.\n       In anticipation of this legislation, the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) has been taking every step possible to prepare \n     for the upcoming filing season. Your letter provides \n     additional information that will allow us to continue our \n     planning and design based on your proposed solution. It \n     should be noted, however. that key systems can only \n     accommodate one programming option without introducing \n     excessive risk to the filing season. We must ensure that our \n     systems are prepared to process returns under the law as it \n     exists now. Therefore, until the legislation is passed and \n     signed into law, our systems cannot be fully programmed for \n     the proposed AMT patch.\n       We are committed to a successful filing season, which means \n     processing returns in a timely manner and issuing refunds to \n     the millions of Americans who expect and are entitled to \n     them. We are taking all steps and making every effort to be \n     prepared to implement legislation once it is passed and will \n     move swiftly upon enactment.\n       However, even with the planning and design that your letter \n     facilitates, we still estimate a timeframe of approximately \n     10 weeks after enactment before we can process affected tax \n     returns. Accordingly, as noted in Secretary Paulson's letter \n     of October 23, 2007, we estimate that enactment of an AMT \n     patch in December could delay processing of returns for as \n     many as 50 million taxpayers and could delay issuance of \n     approximately $75 billion in refunds.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you to deliver a \n     successful filing season. If you have any questions or need \n     additional information, please contact me at (202) 622-9511.\n                                                   Linda E. Stiff,\n                                              Acting Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when most people get a letter from the \nIRS, they get scared. But the Democrats didn't even blink. They don't \nseem all that concerned about forcing 50 million Americans to write an \ninterest-free loan to the Government in the form of unpaid tax returns \nworth about $75 billion--75 billion dollars. That is more than the \ngross domestic product of a hundred different countries--just sitting \nin the Treasury instead of the bank accounts and pockets of Americans \nwho earned it.\n  Now, if this were the only thing Senate Democrats were \nprocrastinating over, Americans would have reason enough to be angry. \nBut it is not. It is just the latest in a string of core duties they \npromised they would address before election day but put back on the \nshelf after all the votes were counted.\n  Instead of fulfilling their campaign promises, they launched into a \nseries of legislative misadventures that have put us 5 weeks into the \nnew fiscal year with the same number of appropriations bills we started \nwith, which is zero, a Justice Department with more empty offices than \nthe Dirksen building in August, and no indication from anyone on the \nother side that any of this will change.\n  Regarding appropriations, the President has already said he will veto \nspending bills that exceed the budget request. Yet Democrats will now \nknowingly pass a Labor/HHS bill that exceeds the President's budget by \nbillions of dollars and attach it to the MilCon/Veterans appropriations \nbill. We already know the result. These bills are coming right back to \nthe Senate for a do-over. This is a waste of time, and just more of the \nsame from a party that has been intent all year on using this Chamber \nas a stage for political theater rather than a workshop to actually get \nthings accomplished.\n  Over at the Justice Department, Democrats have been clamoring for new \nleadership all year. The senior Senator from New York was the loudest \nof them all. More than 5 months ago, he told us ``the Nation needs a \nnew Attorney General, and it can't afford to wait.'' The President \nresponded in good faith by nominating the very man the senior Senator \nfrom New York recommended for the job.\n  Yet America has now waited longer for a vote on Michael Mukasey than \non any other Attorney General nominee in decades. They have waited more \nthan 40 days now. Compare that to Janet Reno, whose confirmation came \nless than 2 weeks after she was named.\n  Democrats have found plenty of time for votes that didn't matter. Now \nit is time to turn to votes that do. They found time for midnight votes \non political Iraq resolutions. Now Americans are wondering when we will \nhave a midnight vote to fix an error in the Tax Code that promises to \nleave more than one-third of them high and dry come April.\n  They found time for a vote on how we felt about the last Attorney \nGeneral. Now people want to know when we will have the midnight vote on \nrestoring leadership at the Justice Department.\n  They had the time to vote again and again to cut off funds to our \ntroops in the field--voted on the Feingold amendment to cut off funds \nthree times. Now Americans want to know when they will have a midnight \nvote to send the rest of the money to the troops--or on any one of the \n12 appropriations bills in a form that we can expect the President to \nsign.\n  This fixation on political gamesmanship has come at a serious cost. \nWhat we are seeing here goes far beyond mismanagement. And the American \npeople have caught on. For the sake of the taxpayers, for the sake of \nthe justice system, for the sake of the men and women who wear the \nuniform, it is time to put politics aside and do the work of today.\n  No more gimmicks, no more games. Time is short. The stakes are high. \nLet's get on with it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13648-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13648-S13649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a lot to do, there is no question \nabout that. But I said to one of my friends on the Republican side \nseveral days ago, when he was lamenting the fact that the President's \nstanding was low and ours in Congress was low, I said to him: What do \nyou hope to accomplish by denigrating the place you work in? You work \nhere. What good is it to do that? He said: That is right, I will not do \nit anymore.\n  I say to my friend from Kentucky, it is easy to find fault with what \nanyone does anyplace in life, including the Senate of the United \nStates. But we have worked very hard these last 10 months to try to \nwork on a bipartisan basis, to accomplish things for the country. We \nhave done a pretty good job.\n  We passed the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. We passed \na budget--a pay-as-you-go budget. No more red ink; we are paying for \neverything. That is different than the last 7 years under a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress. We passed a law mandating how U.S. attorneys \nshould be appointed, as a result of the scandal in the Attorney \nGeneral's Office. We mandated, through legislation, equipment for the \nGuard and Reserve that they simply didn't have. We are the ones who \npushed the President to focus on having better equipment for our \ntroops, including MRAPS, these vehicles that were more mine resistant. \nWe passed that and it is in the form of a law. Because of the scandal \nat Walter Reed and other places, we have worked to protect veterans; \nhurricane recovery, Katrina. Our President made 22 trips down there, \nbut there was no money until we forced money into the supplemental \nappropriations bill; SCHIP, we passed a law extending health care that \n5.5 million children have to 10 million children. The President vetoed \nthat.\n  That is the matter before the Senate today. We are going to send that \nback to him, and I hope he will not veto it. We have made changes \nbecause Members on the other side wanted those changes made. Disaster \nrelief for ranchers and farmers, we passed that. It is 4 years overdue. \nWildfire relief, we have had these fires sweeping the West. We put $600 \nmillion in the supplemental so we can make up for some of the problems \nwe had.\n  As far as Iraq, we have had over 100 hearings on Iraq. That is 100 \nmore than were held during the first 5 years of this war. The hearings \nhave been good. It is true we have tried very hard to change course in \nthe war in Iraq, and we have changed course, indirectly, as a result of \nthe votes we have taken. It did not change it enough, but we have \nchanged course in the war in Iraq.\n  There will be other opportunities for us to do that in the near \nfuture. We have to do that. The President doesn't mind asking for \nanother $200 billion of totally red ink--that is, borrowed money--for \nthe war. But he is not willing to spend a few nonred dollars for \nchildren's health, paid for. Maybe the President is trying to protect \nthe tobacco industry. I think they have had\n\n[[Page S13649]]\n\nenough protection. A small increase in the tax on tobacco to pay for \nthe children certainly seems reasonable. Stem cell research, we passed \nthat. On ethics and lobbying, we passed the most significant reform in \nthe history of the country, which is now law. The 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, there was a lot of talk about those recommendations. \nThey were not put into law until we did it this year. We did it because \nit was the right thing to do. We reauthorized FDA. We passed WRDA--\nwhich is years and years past due--by a huge bipartisan vote.\n  Everything I have talked about has been bipartisan, even the votes on \nIraq. We could not get 60 votes, but we had bipartisan support on Iraq. \nWe all acknowledge we can do better. Certainly, we can do better. But I \ndon't think we should lament the fact that we have not been able to do \neverything everyone wants done.\n  With the Attorney General nominee, Judge Mukasey, a problem has \narisen with that nomination. It seems like we are in the ``Twilight \nZone.'' We are in the Senate talking about whether waterboarding is \ntorture, and this man cannot acknowledge whether waterboarding is \ntorture. I read this morning in the newspaper the reason he cannot do \nthat is he is afraid if he says waterboarding is torture, it may create \ncriminal or civil responsibilities for some of the people who did \ntorture people through waterboarding. We are the United States of \nAmerica, and we are concerned about talking openly about torture?\n  I read a book a couple of years ago. The name of the book is \n``1492.'' It talked about how our world changed in 1492. One of the \nreasons it changed is the Inquisition. It started in 1492, the same \ntime Columbus discovered this Nation, this world. In 1492, they also \ndiscovered waterboarding, how to torture people, mostly Jews but not \nall Jews. Some Christians who were not Christian enough were \nwaterboarded.\n  Maybe we will work our way through Mukasey, but no one should be \nconcerned about the fact that we have an obligation and a right to talk \nabout torture. Shouldn't we know where the chief legal officer of this \ncountry, the Attorney General of the United States, stands on \nwaterboarding, on torture generally?\n  I look forward to our having a good day today and accomplishing a \nlot. We don't have a lot of time left in this legislative session. We \nhave at the most about 6 weeks, but I hope during that period of time \nwe continue to work together for the American people. That is what the \nAmerican people want.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me briefly add, it is not too late \nfor this first session of Congress to achieve a better record. We need \nto get appropriations bills not just sent to the President but signed \nby the President. We need to get the AMT fixed so we don't \ninconvenience, to the tune of $75 billion, millions of American \ntaxpayers. We need to provide bridge funding for our troops that we all \nknow is needed. And we need to confirm an Attorney General. Our \ncolleagues on the other side have been saying we need a new Attorney \nGeneral all year long. Now it is time to do it.\n  The record of this first session of this Congress is not yet made. It \nis not too late, but it is getting very late, and hopefully we will \naccomplish a lot in the next 6 weeks, as the majority leader has \nindicated he would like to see done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader is \nabsolutely correct. We have to fix AMT, and we will do that. The reason \nwe have been a little slow in doing so is how we are going to pay for \nit. Being an appropriator for my years in Congress, I certainly want to \ndo that. We have struggled over the last several years doing \nappropriations bills.\n  The Republican leader and I believe appropriations bills should be \ndone, and we have to do them this year. I am going to devote a lot of \nmy energy--the meeting I had just before coming to the Chamber was \ndealing with appropriations bills. I had a good conversation with the \nRepublican leader yesterday about appropriations bills generally.\n  He is absolutely right. We can do better. I will certainly attempt to \ndo my share and do a better job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13649-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask for all of my colleagues to join me \nin support of Senate approval of the National Guard and Reservists \nFinancial Relief Act. This is a bipartisan effort to extend a critical \nbenefit to our National Guard and reservists, many of whom are serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Section 827 of the Pension Protection Act of \n2006 allows guardsmen and reservists called to active duty for at least \n6 months to make penalty-free early withdrawals from their IRA, 401(k), \nor 403(b) retirement accounts. This provision expires in less than 2 \nmonths, and my bill would make this benefit permanent for our \nservicemembers and their families.\n  Our guardsmen and reservists always stand ready to put their lives on \nhold and answer the call of duty. They can face lengthy deployments \nthat can cause major financial strains for their families, which only \nadds to the emotional stress these families face during extended \nseparation from a loved one. In fact, according to a GAO report, nearly \n41 percent of reservists are affected by a pay discrepancy between \ntheir military and civilian salaries.\n  National Guard and reservists account for approximately half of all \nU.S. military personnel. Since September 11, 2001, more than 443,000 \nguardsmen and reservists have been deployed in support of the global \nwar on terror, including nearly 93,000 currently deployed mainly to \nIraq and Afghanistan. Congress should take decisive action to ensure \nthat this benefit does not expire for these fine young men and women \nshould they find themselves in a deployment-related financial crunch.\n  The Reserve Officers Association strongly supports the continuation \nof this tax relief measure. I also thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, \nfor cosponsoring this legislation, and I add that a similar provision \nincluded in the Pension Protection Act received broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Shortly, Congress will adjourn for 2 weeks for the Thanksgiving \nrecess. This means there is limited opportunity to act to extend this \nassistance to those who have answered the call to serve. I ask every \nMember who I know cares about our Guard members, reservists, and their \nfamilies to support my legislation that this important benefit \ncontinues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13649-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13649-S13651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TAX FAIRNESS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Last week, I joined Senator Hutchison, who has been the \nleader on this issue, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Corker from my home \nState of Tennessee in introducing S. 2233. Our goal with that \nlegislation is to make the State and local sales tax deduction \npermanent.\n  As a former Governor, I know States and cities have many different \nways to raise revenues to support the services they provide. States \nusually provide about half the funding for elementary and secondary \neducation. They are the principal funder of community colleges and \nuniversities. They pay for a good part of the roads and all the \nprisons. So most States have pretty big bills to pay, and they have a \nvariety of taxes to raise the money to pay for those bills. Some States \nlevy an income tax. Some use a sales tax. Some use a combination of the \ntwo. Some use some other taxes.\n  In Tennessee, we have had a pretty good debate about this issue, and \nwe have decided we don't want an income tax. I looked at the options \nmyself when I was Governor in the mid-1980s and considered an income \ntax for Tennessee but decided it would be the\n\n[[Page S13650]]\n\nwrong thing to do, to put a tax on work. We have done pretty well with \nlow taxes and without an income tax.\n  Americans who pay State and local income taxes are able to claim a \ndeduction for those amounts on their Federal income tax, and before \n1986, taxpayers also had the ability to claim a deduction on their \nState and local sales taxes. But this deduction for State and local \nsales taxes was repealed in 1986.\n  Congress temporarily reinstated that State and local sales tax \ndeduction for 2004 and 2005 and then extended it again for 2006 and \n2007. I was a part of the effort in this Chamber to do that. It was a \nbipartisan effort. So taxpayers today who itemize on their Federal \nincome tax returns can deduct either State and local sales taxes or \nState income taxes. Yet, unless Congress takes further action, this \nsales tax deduction will expire at the end of December of this year.\n  This is not about cutting taxes; this is about tax fairness. It is \nnot fair for States without income taxes to subsidize tax deductions \nfor States with income taxes. Why is it our business in Washington, DC, \nto prefer an income tax in the various States?\n  Nine States, including Tennessee, do not impose a State income tax. \nThey are Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, \nTennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming--States from across the \ncountry, some big States, some middle-size States, some of our smallest \nStates. These States shouldn't be treated differently. If Congress \ndoesn't act, they will be by the end of December 2007.\n  I am here today to urge this body to make permanent the deduction for \nState and local sales tax. At the very least, we need to temporarily \nextend the deduction, as we have done in the last two Congresses, \nbefore it expires on December 31 so that taxpayers in those nine States \nare not forced to pay an unfair share of taxes.\n  We are talking about large amounts of money. Nearly 600,000 \nTennesseans itemized their taxes and claimed the State and local sales \ntax deduction last year. This benefit put an average of $400 in the \npockets of hard-working Tennesseans. Therefore, losing this deduction \nwould cost Tennesseans nearly a quarter of a billion dollars right out \nof their pockets each year.\n  Extending the State and local sales tax deduction is the fair thing \nto do, and it is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Cornyn, Senator Corker, and me in enacting \nS. 2233 before the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I also rise today to speak regarding S. \n2233. I am always honored to be in the presence of our senior Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I am honored to follow him today talking about the same \ntopic.\n  One of the great points about our country is that we are set up in a \nmanner that we allow States to choose how they govern on issues \nrelating to the way they tax their citizens. As Senator Alexander just \nstated, in the State of Tennessee, we have decided, after a tremendous \namount of debate over decades, that we like being taxed through a sales \ntax.\n  As you know and as was just stated, Americans all across the country \nwho are in States where they have an income tax or payroll tax are able \nto deduct that from their Federal income taxes. Again, in order to \ncontinue to support the fairness of the way we treat States, certainly \nthose who choose to use a sales tax to raise revenues for roads and \nschools and want to leave it in the hands of their citizens to decide \nhow much they pay in income tax, those States ought to be allowed to \ndeduct those taxes from their Federal income taxes.\n  This is an issue of fairness. This absolutely is an issue of \nfairness. I hope today--we have introduced a bill, as Senator Alexander \nstated--to convince other Senators that this is an issue of fairness \nand that they should support this bill which will permanently allow the \nnine States that today use a sales tax as a way of raising revenues for \ntheir States to be able to deduct those taxes.\n  As was mentioned, 11.2 million Americans across our country took a \nsales tax deduction last year. Mr. President, 600,000 Tennesseans took \nthat deduction, and it saves Tennesseans about $400 a year.\n  Since much has already been said, I close my comments again urging \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to support this bill which \nindicates fairness for all Americans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the leadership targeted November 16 for \nadjournment of this session of Congress, although I think we all \nbelieve that is a little overly optimistic. Regardless, I am concerned \nthat as of yet, we have not considered an annual tax-extender package \ncontaining an extension of a number of very beneficial tax provisions. \nI am pleased to join with my colleagues to discuss the need to address \nmany beneficial tax-extender provisions.\n  I wish to highlight two tax provisions of particular interest to me \nthat Congress has annually extended, one ever since 1991 and one since \n1993, and they particularly benefit oil and gas development from \nmarginal wells and depreciation. Specifically, these two tax provisions \nare the suspension of the net income limitation on percentage depletion \nallowance for marginal oil and gas proceedings and accelerated \ndepreciation for assets in Indian Country.\n  The United States has approximately 457,000 marginal wells. That is a \nhuge number. A marginal well is one that produces 15 barrels or less a \nday. A lot of these wells are located in my State of Oklahoma. They \ncollectively produce about 1.2 million barrels per day of annual \nproduction. These wells account for nearly 20 percent of the total oil \nproduction in the United States, about the amount we are importing from \nSaudi Arabia.\n  People do not understand the significance of marginal wells. They \ncost a lot more to produce--marginal wells. These are shallow wells. \nThey are not profitable like the deep wells in some parts of the \ncountry. But when you add them all up, it means this production equals \nas much as we are currently importing from Saudi Arabia. So it is very \nsignificant.\n\n  In my State of Oklahoma, it is the small independents--basically the \nmom-and-pop operators--that are producing the majority of oil and \nnatural gas, with 85 percent of Oklahoma's oil coming from marginal \nwells--again, that is 15 barrels or less a day. Because marginal wells \nsupply such a significant amount of our oil and gas, it is vital we \nkeep them in operation. However, according to the Department of Energy, \nbetween 1994 and 2003 the United States lost 110 million barrels of \ncrude oil due to the plugging of marginal wells.\n  A lot of people not familiar with the industry think you can always \nunplug a well. You can't unplug a well. Once you plug it, it is gone. \nThus, when we lose marginal well production, we become more dependent \nupon foreign sources of energy and more dependent at a time when I \nthink almost all of us in here agree that U.S. policy should encourage \nreliance upon domestic sources. Furthermore, we lose domestic jobs to \nforeign nations.\n  If the current suspension of the net income limitation on percentage \ndepletion allowance expires, U.S. production from our marginal wells \nwould be severely hampered. Percentage depletion is a form of cost \nrecovery for mineral and leasehold acquisition costs. The percentage \ndepletion rate for oil and gas is 15 percent of the taxpayer's gross \nincome from a producing property. It used to be closer to 30 percent. \nIt should be higher than 15 percent, but that is where it is today. \nOnly independent producers and royalty owners are able to utilize \npercentage depletion.\n  Under the net income limitation, percentage depletion is limited to \n100 percent of the net income from an individual producing property. In \nthe case of marginal wells, where total deductions and expenses often \nexceed gross income, this limitation discourages producers from \ninvesting in the continued production for marginal wells with high \noperating costs and low production yields.\n  Without the full utilization of the percentage depletion allowance, \nthe net income limitation actually encourages producers to plug and \nabandon production of marginal wells. Then, of course, as I said \nbefore, you have lost them forever.\n\n[[Page S13651]]\n\n  Congress has, on a temporary basis, suspended the net income \nlimitation since 1997. The current suspension expires at the end of \nthis year. The extension of the suspension of the net income limitation \nwill allow independents the necessary capital to continue to produce \nfrom these existing marginal wells, which is critical to the Nation's \noverall energy security.\n  Now, additionally, Congress made a special economic incentive \navailable to benefit Indian Country under the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993. It provides for special accelerated \ndepreciation for new and used assets acquired after December of 1993 on \nIndian reservations and former Indian reservations in Oklahoma and \nelsewhere. This depreciation incentive provides an approximately 40 \npercent shorter recovery period for most commercial property. This \naccelerated depreciation schedule has been successful in encouraging \ncapital-intensive businesses to locate and expand in Indian Country in \nOklahoma and throughout the Nation.\n  Both of these important provisions expire at the end of this year, \nand it is crucial that Congress act this year to extend each one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13651-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2184\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, just a few words to explain what just \nhappened.\n  On behalf of many Senators, I am calling for swift passage of a full \ntax extenders package, which contains many of the measures that have \nbeen referred to in the preceding 4 or 5 minutes. These measures are \ncalled tax extenders, and we will pass tax extender legislation later \nthis year.\n  I want quick action on them, including the college tuition deduction, \nthe sales tax deduction, as mentioned by two Senators, and also we must \nmove on provisions to prevent the alternative minimum tax from hitting \nmore taxpayers and the complete set of expiring tax provisions when the \nHouse sends that legislation to the Senate.\n  We are all working on this issue. Senator Grassley and I have talked \nwith Chairman Rangel on the other side of Capitol Hill, as well as \nthose on this side of Capitol Hill, to get these measures enacted. I, \nmyself, drafted many of these provisions in the first place. Senator \nGrassley and myself have advanced, as we always do in working together, \nin trying to get them all extended.\n  Mr. President, we want to get this done, and I am confident we will \nget it done, and I urge a little forbearance of my colleagues. We are \nworking expeditiously to get it done. It may not be tomorrow, on \nFriday, but we are working very expeditiously to get it done, and I am \nconfident it will be done later this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee objected this morning to a unanimous consent request offered \nby Senator Inhofe regarding legislation that would ensure that American \ntaxpayers would not pay higher taxes next year. The chairman of the \nFinance Committee indicated they are working on these provisions and he \ndoesn't want them taken up now; he wants to bring them up later.\n  It is important to talk about two taxpayer-friendly provisions in the \nIRS Code that will disappear in the next 60 days unless we do something \nabout it. The first is a provision that gives taxpayers the option of \ndeducting their State and local sales tax. My State of Texas, like a \nhandful of other States, does not believe it needs a State income tax. \nWe don't have one. We are not going to get one. What we do want is a \nlevel playing field when it comes to the Federal income tax code \nallowing the deduction of State and local sales tax, just as it allows \ncurrently a deduction of State income tax from one's Federal tax \nreturn.\n  State and local governments have a number of options for raising \nrevenue to pay for essential services they provide to their citizens. \nSome States raise revenues through an income tax. Some States, such as \nTexas, use a sales tax. Others use a combination of the two. In an \neffort to help protect people from overly burdensome taxation, the IRS \nCode has in the past allowed taxpayers to deduct all the State and \nlocal taxes they paid from their Federal taxes. Up until 1986, \ntaxpayers could deduct State and local sales taxes. Unfortunately, this \nwas unfairly eliminated. For 18 years, Texans and other States without \na State income tax did not have the same level playing field other \nStates had. I view this as a matter of gross discrimination against \nthose States that have a State sales tax rather than a State income \ntax. It is simply unfair and needs to end on a permanent basis.\n  That is why 3 years ago, I worked with several of my colleagues to \nreinstate the State and local sales tax deduction as part of the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Without quick Senate action, the \ncitizens of Texas will once again be treated unfairly by the IRS Code \nby disallowing the deduction of State and local taxes. Our State and \nlocal governments have to have the flexibility to collect taxes that \nfund essential services in a way they find most appropriate without \nputting our citizens at a disadvantage. Again, make no mistake about \nit, Texans don't want a State income tax. We are a low-tax, pro-growth \nState. That is why we have seen 3 million people move to Texas since \n2000, because it provides incentives for job creation by small \nbusinesses and big businesses alike. We are not asking for the Federal \nGovernment to somehow bless Texas adopting a State income tax. We don't \nwant it. What we do want is fundamental fairness.\n  If the Senate allows this provision to expire, it will be punishing \nthe citizens of my State based on geographic location and preference \nfor a different tax system. Extending the sales tax deduction \neffectively gives Texans $1 billion in tax relief every year. This \nmoney not only helps hard-working middle-\n\n[[Page S13653]]\n\nclass families save money--perhaps to invest in a small business or pay \nfor college tuition for their children--it helps spur economic and job \ngrowth as well.\n  Last week I introduced legislation, along with Senator Pat Roberts of \nKansas, that extends for 2 years the $4,000 above-the-line deduction \nfor taxpayers who pay for college tuition. We frequently talk about the \nimportance of education on the younger generation, from elementary \nschool through college and beyond. We talk about the importance of \ncontinuing education, literally lifetime learning, in order for us to \nmaintain and extend our global competitiveness. Aside from simply \nencouraging people to pursue a college education, we ought to do our \nbest to make college more affordable and accessible and less of a \nburden on working parents who want to send their kids to college. \nOriginally part of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2001, this deduction allows taxpayers to deduct up to $4,000 \nfrom their Federal income tax return regardless of whether they itemize \ndeductions or not. This deduction goes a long way to help families \nstruggling to put their children through college and benefits millions \nof taxpayers annually.\n  According to the College Board, this deduction, along with grants and \nother education incentives, has helped lower the cost for the average \nstudent who goes to a public university by $3,600 and $9,300 for those \nwho attend a private college. Both of these deductions keep money in \nthe pockets of taxpayers. In my State of Texas, they allow them to pay \nfor things such as health care, clothing and food, things they need and \nought to be able to use their hard-earned money to pay for, rather than \nwriting a bigger check to Uncle Sam. It is appropriate to use the IRS \nCode not only to provide for fundamental fairness when it comes to \nallowing the deduction of State and local sales tax from a Federal \nincome tax return; it is also appropriate to use the IRS Code to \nprovide for further educational opportunity.\n  Right now taxpayers have to work a total of 120 days, about a third \nof the year, to pay their tax burden, whether it is Federal, State, or \nlocal taxes. The last thing we should do is force taxpayers to work \nmore hours, longer days for Uncle Sam and not for their family. Rather \nthan waiting for some future bill to hopefully address this need, the \nSenate should extend these taxpayer-friendly provisions today. I hope \nwe will have another opportunity to come back to the floor, and I urge \nthe Senate to extend these two important provisions in the near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13653-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Martinez, to express outrage at the continued \ninjustice carried out by the Castro regime inside of Cuba and to \nhighlight that we are at a critical time for democracy inside of Cuba. \nThis past Monday, as many of us were sipping coffee and driving to \nwork, 70 young Cuban dissidents were arrested, detained, and \nharassed. Ten have been released but others remain detained.\n\n  What was their crime that got them arrested? Were they destroying \nproperty? Were they stealing food? Were they acting violently? No, none \nof that. They were walking down a street in Havana, and while they were \npeacefully walking down that street together, they had on their arms \nthis wristband--this wristband, a simple white wristband--that has one \nword written on it, ``cambio,'' which in Spanish means ``change.''\n  This one simple gesture was strong enough to have them thrown in \nprison. This one simple gesture was strong enough to have them detained \nand harassed. But I also hope this one gesture would be strong enough \nto inspire us and to inspire those who love freedom and democracy and \nhave respect for human rights around the globe.\n  This incident was not isolated. These youth knew the consequences \ntheir actions might very well bring them--this simple statement of \nwearing a white wristband that says ``change.'' Decades of repression \nhas led to decades of fear. But these young people did not show fear. \nThey showed courage and, I think, showed us where they want Cuba to go. \nThey want it to change.\n  Their courage must not fall on deaf ears. We are listening and \nwatching. From the Senate floor to the White House we are inspired by \nwhat these young people have shown us. They have shown us that Cuba can \nand will change, and this change will come from within Cuba, from the \nCuban people themselves, from its youth. But they need our help, and we \nmust continue to fight here to do what we can to empower them and to \nacknowledge them when they empower themselves.\n  We also have to build on this momentum. Just like last week, \nPresident Bush said:\n\n       The operative word in our future dealings with Cuba is not \n     stability. The operative word is freedom.\n\n  One of Cuba's most well-known dissidents, at least inside of Cuba \nsuffers, while unfortunately, the rest of the world remains largely \nsilent. It is interesting to me how American news stations go to Cuba \nand spend a lot of time with members of the regime but do not spend a \nlot of time focusing on those people inside of Cuba who are trying to \ncreate movements for freedom and democracy, as others did in other \nparts of the world at different times in our history, such as Lech \nWalesa did in Poland, such as Vaclav Havel did in the former \nCzechoslovakia, such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn did in Russia, and so \nmany others such as Nelson Mandela did in his own country.\n  There was international spotlight on these people as they were given \na chance by the world's acknowledgment to try to create movements for \nfreedom and democracy in peaceful ways within their own society. Yet in \nCuba, somehow, because there are those who have lived with the \nromanticism of the Castro regime and do not understand it is nothing \nless than an oppressive dictatorship, they somehow seem to look the \nother way.\n  I want to talk just briefly, before I yield the floor to my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, about one of those dissidents who \ngives inspiration to these young people who were arrested simply for \nwearing this plastic white bracelet that says ``change.''\n  Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, in his absence because he is in jail--\nlanguishing in Castro's jail--will be receiving the Presidential Medal \nof Freedom next week. Dr. Biscet may not be a household name in \nAmerica, but he is probably the best known political prisoner inside of \nCuba.\n  Let me read a little about him:\n\n       During the Black Spring of 2003, was sentenced to 25 years \n     in prison. The prosecution was the most severe of several \n     that Dr. Biscet had to endure since 1986, when he first \n     publicly declared himself an opponent of the dictatorship.\n       Barely a month before he was arrested, Dr. Biscet had \n     completed a 3-year prison sentence for, among other \n     ``crimes,'' displaying the Cuban flag upside down as a form \n     of protest. Before he was imprisoned, Dr. Biscet opposed the \n     regime on several fronts.\n       In 1986, a year after he graduated from medical school, he \n     protested the long hours Cuban doctors had to work without \n     pay. In 1997, he started the Lawton Foundation for Human \n     Rights and conducted a secret 10-month study of abortion \n     techniques that found, among other things, that many babies \n     were killed after they were born alive.\n       In February of 1998, Dr. Biscet was kicked out of the Cuban \n     national health care system, making it impossible for him to \n     work as a physician because of the principled positions he \n     took.\n\n[[Page S13654]]\n\n       During Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba in January of \n     1998, activists with the Lawton Foundation publicly \n     demonstrated for the release of Cuban political prisoners. \n     They went on a 40-day liquid fast to demand the release of \n     political prisoners and to draw attention to the human rights \n     situation on the island.\n       But by the end of 1999, the dictatorship had enough of Dr. \n     Biscet. On November 3, 1999, he was arrested and eventually \n     sentenced to 3 years in prison for the so-called crimes of \n     dishonoring national symbols--that is, displaying the Cuban \n     flag upside down--public disorder, and inciting delinquent \n     behavior. He finished his sentence in late 2002. But only 36 \n     days after finishing that sentence, he was rearrested again \n     while preparing to meet with a group of human rights \n     activists.\n       After several months in jail, he was formally charged with \n     being a threat to state security and sentenced to 25 years in \n     prison.\n\n  And he languishes there today. His crime? Seeking peaceful change in \nhis country. His crime? Talking about the death of young born children. \nHis crime? Fighting against a repressive regime. Yet in America, there \nis silence. There is silence.\n  It is amazing to me that such a person could write a letter like this \neven though he has gone through some of the worst things that someone \ncan go through in their life: constant harassment, imprisonment. \nEarlier this year he wrote an open letter from himself from the Kilo \n5.5 Prison in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, that got out. The letter says:\n\n       To my fellow Cubans, wherever you find yourselves, whether \n     in our enslaved island, or in exile in any part of the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAn open letter from Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet from the Kilo 5.5 Prison in \n                          Pinar del Rio Cuba.\n\n       To my fellow Cubans, wherever you find yourselves, whether \n     in our enslaved island, or in exile in any part of the world. \n     I include also those descendents of Cubans born in other \n     lands. To all of you I send my warmest and sincere greetings.\n       Our efforts to achieve the unconditional liberty of our \n     nation will soon become reality. I do not need to reveal \n     details to communicate what among Cubans is common knowledge. \n     We suffer not from division or fragmentation in our \n     principles, but rather in which methods to use. We do not \n     lack unity in ideals, but only in the methods to be applied \n     to obtain our liberty. Unfortunately, these insignificant \n     differences of opinion have given room for division among \n     exile leaders and dissidents inside Cuba. These differences \n     have given oxygen to the flames of the most recent and \n     dangerous obstacle that we confront.\n       I refer to the movement for complacency. A movement that \n     intends to make Cubans--faithful lovers of liberty--believe \n     that they should applaud and be content to receive only small \n     doses of liberty. A movement that suggests that Cubans do not \n     deserve full liberty, but only small dosages of it. This \n     movement of low expectations unites with speculation that \n     other fragments of liberty and democracy will automatically \n     follow. This thoughtless movement does not claim for Cubans \n     internationally recognized basic human rights, it only \n     suggests them. It does not claim the democratic rights of the \n     violated Constitution of 1940, but opts instead for the \n     framework of the illegitimate Communist constitution of 1976. \n     That constitution is nothing more than an instrument of \n     oppression, a malevolent document whose only purpose is to \n     justify the totalitarian and ill-formulated state. It is an \n     illegal aberration that has permitted and even encouraged the \n     imprisonment, torture and execution of political opponents \n     without even the minimal legal rights or a defense. An \n     atheist abomination that has only served those who enslave \n     our nation.\n       To those who feel exhausted after more than 40 years of \n     constant oppression and of unfruitful efforts. To those whose \n     frustrations and discontent have caused them to lose their \n     moral compass. To those who have concluded that we must \n     appease the oppressor. To them I ask:\n       Is it acceptable to the memory of the thousands of young \n     Cubans, our best sons, who were executed by firing squads for \n     the simple crime of defending our right to full liberty, to \n     now accept complacency? Do those tens of thousands of \n     compatriots who spent decades in prison, and who are still in \n     a prison system whose horrors we can only imagine, deserve \n     only partial liberty? Do those countless families who were \n     separated from their loved ones and destroyed in the process, \n     or those who have perished at sea, or who have died in exile \n     dreaming of returning to their country, deserve that we now \n     accept the crumbs that we are being offered? Shall we accept \n     defeat after nearly a half a century of patriotic heroism in \n     search of liberty and democracy, or shall we show the world \n     that the most brutal and longest lasting dictatorship in our \n     time could not extinguish the unbreakable spirit of liberty \n     of the Cubans?\n       I must tell you that we have reached a crossroad in our \n     history. Nearly a half a century ago we as a nation \n     confronted a similar historical decision. In those days many \n     accepted the fateful words that circulate again today: \n     ``anything would be better than what we already have.'' They \n     were mistaken then and they are mistaken now. Tragically, \n     more than forty years of our national nightmare have elapsed \n     to find ourselves again with the same question, and with the \n     opportunity to correct our mistakes and make ourselves truly \n     the owners of our own destiny.\n       I call for the unity of all my compatriots. There exists \n     only one path before us. A path that unites us and includes \n     all Cubans inside and outside the island of Cuba. A path that \n     claims the rights of the citizenry in its entirety. A path \n     that demands full democracy and the unconditional freedom of \n     the Cuban people under a multiparty system of government, \n     democratically elected through free general elections. A path \n     where the Rule of Law is established and which guarantees \n     equality under the law, without distinction of races, sex or \n     religious creed. A path that brings about an unconditional \n     and immediate amnesty to all political prisoners.\n       Fellow Cubans, let us take a step forward and let us do it \n     in a clear and decisive manner. The work awaiting us is \n     difficult but not impossible. Together we can achieve for our \n     country the genuine democracy deserved by Cuba's citizens.\n       Finally, to the leaders of the democratic states of the \n     world, to the American people, and in particular to the \n     President of the United States, George W. Bush, we ask only \n     one simple commitment: do not support or promote any solution \n     or accord regarding the future of the Cuban nation that you \n     would not consider acceptable for your own country.\n       May God illuminate us in our path for the liberty of Cuba.\n                                           Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I want to read only two paragraphs of it:\n\n       To those who feel exhausted after more than 40 years of \n     constant oppression and of unfruitful efforts. To those whose \n     frustrations and discontent have caused them to lose their \n     moral compass. To those who have concluded that we must \n     appease the oppressor. To them I ask:\n       Is it acceptable to the memory of the thousands of young \n     Cubans, our best sons, who were executed by firing squads for \n     the simple crime of defending our right to full liberty, to \n     now accept complacency? Do those tens of thousands of \n     compatriots who spent decades in prison, and who are still in \n     a prison system whose horrors we can only imagine, deserve \n     only partial liberty? Do those countless families who were \n     separated from their loved ones and destroyed in the process, \n     or those who have perished at sea, or who have died in exile \n     dreaming of returning to their country, deserve that we now \n     accept the crumbs that we are being offered? Shall we accept \n     defeat after nearly a half a century of patriotic heroism in \n     search of liberty and democracy, or shall we show the world \n     that the most brutal--\n\n  The most brutal--\n\n     brand longest lasting dictatorship in our time could not \n     extinguish the unbreakable spirit of [the] liberty of the \n     Cubans?\n\n  That is Dr. Biscet from jail. Those young people who marched on the \nstreet with a very simple message--with a very simple plastic bracelet: \n``cambio,'' ``change,'' they are inspired by the Dr. Biscet of Cuba and \nothers.\n  Finally, it is amazing to me that when the island of Cuba is engulfed \nby a tropical storm, instead of making preparations for the people of \nCuba to be safe, state security is making arrests of young people who \npeacefully walk down a street in Havana because of a simple bracelet \nbut also a powerful message of change. It speaks volumes about what \nthat regime is about.\n  I hope our colleagues use this tragic and other tragic sets of \ncircumstances inside of Cuba to think about what our policy should be \nto this regime. I am reminded, standing up here with my colleague from \nFlorida, of our successful fight to increase funds to our democracy \nassistance programs inside Cuba which help people create peaceful \nchange in their own country.\n  We are at a critical time for democracy in Cuba, and the Cuban people \nare the fuel. It is the Cuban people who have faced fear and repression \nfor decades. Yet they continue to fight for change. It starts and it \nwill finish with them. This is why my heart and support go out to them, \nfor what they do is more meaningful and powerful than most can imagine. \nThat is why we grieve for those arrested and harassed and incarcerated \nand languishing in Castro's jails.\n  We are also encouraged. We know they grow stronger. We come to the \nfloor of the Senate to make sure they understand they are not alone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S13655]]\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey, my \ndistinguished colleague, for his very passionate and correct and \nappropriate remarks. I think there is no higher moment for this body \nthan when we stand with those who are oppressed, as this country has, \nand as this Senate has over the history of our Nation. Standing with \nthose who are oppressed is our highest moment and our best calling.\n  I do find it ironic that something as simple as this simple little \nwhite band, with the word ``change'' on it, could be so threatening to \nthis illegitimate regime as to have to imprison 70 young people. Now, \ntoday, we hear that another 40 have been arrested. It is \nunconscionable. It is unthinkable that a regime would be so weak as to \nbe so threatened by something as simple as these wristbands we are \nwearing.\n  But it is also a sign of the continuing spirit of freedom that \ncontinues to be alive and well on that imprisoned island. There is no \nquestion about that. That is why I think it was so appropriate we came \ntogether to increase the funding for the dissident movement inside \nCuba--so they can have the simple resources, such as pens and paper, so \nthey can communicate with one another and they can add their message of \nfreedom and their message of hope.\n  I do not have any question these young people, whether they were \narrested for a few days or for a harsher sentence--and we do not know \nbecause there is no rule of law; there is no guidepost we can follow--\nare simply at the mercy of this regime that for now almost half a \ncentury has brutalized its people with totalitarian rule.\n  I am pleased my colleague from Texas is here, Senator Cornyn. I want \nto give him a moment of time if he cares to comment on this situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Briefly, Mr. President, I commend my distinguished \nfriends and colleagues from New Jersey and Florida for this statement \nof solidarity with the Cuban people.\n  I could not agree more that it is important--certainly now as much as \never--that we stand arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder, opposed to \noppressive regimes that really govern by fear.\n  I have to say, just briefly, to my friend from Florida, Senator \nMartinez, I know his personal history of being a refugee from Cuba when \nhe was 16 years old, being part of a Pedro Pan effort to bring young \nCubans to America so they could have a better life.\n  He also shared with me recently a movie which, while a work of \nfiction, I think, gave me a very emotional sense of what people in \nCuba, in Havana in particular, must have experienced with the Cuban \npeople being oppressed by Fidel Castro. I have to tell my colleagues, \nit is a bleak existence that these people, who are seeking nothing more \nthan the most basic of human rights, have under a heartless regime of a \ndictator such as Fidel Castro.\n\n  So I just wanted to express a few words of thanks and words of \nsolidarity for my colleagues from New Jersey and Florida and to \nreiterate that all of us, all of the American people stand in \nsolidarity with those in Cuba who seek change, who seek what we perhaps \ntoo often take for granted; that is, our freedom to speak, to live, to \nworship as we see fit. We ought to do everything we possibly can to \nsupport them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues, \nour two distinguished Members of the Senate who are of Cuban origin and \nwho proudly bear that moniker of ``Cuban American,'' one of the most \ndistinguished groups in our society in America today.\n  I wish to say that at the time Fidel Castro was beginning his \ntakeover on the island of Cuba, as a young boy I had the opportunity of \nrepresenting the youth of America and going to the Iron Curtain at the \nGerman-Czechoslovakian border and speaking over Radio Free Europe to \nthe young people behind the Iron Curtain. Of course, at age 17, what I \nsaw that day made a lasting impression, for standing there at the \nGerman-Czechoslovakian border in the little village of Tillyschantz, \nseeing the machine gun nests, the guard towers, the concrete dragon's \nteeth to prevent anyone from breaking through the fence, the mine \nfields, the ground raked very clean so that any footprints could be \nseen, seeing the dogs patrolling back and forth, that, of course, made \na significant impression upon a young mind that had some appreciation \nfor the enslavement of people.\n  Now, what happened to the Iron Curtain is happening to Cuba. That \niron curtain around Cuba is starting to fall, and it is for exactly \nthese same things that are happening now: 70 young people walking \naround with white wristbands that say ``cambio''--change--that the \ndying Communist, repressive, totalitarian regime is continuing to lash \nout and arrest them. It is the inevitable march of history that \nultimately freedom is going to win, just as it did in Eastern Europe \nwith the fall of the Iron Curtain that I saw at age 17. It has taken a \nlot longer in Cuba because of its island barrier, because of its \nextraordinary repressive regime.\n  So whenever we get a chance to speak out for change--``cambio''--we \nin this Senate need to do it. I am delighted to join my colleagues, \nSenator Martinez and Senator Menendez, in unifying our voices in \ncalling for cambio in Cuba.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \ncoming to the floor. Senator Menendez was so eloquent in his \ndescription of the situation today, and I wish to echo his comments \nregarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom Oscar Elias Biscet will be \nreceiving on Monday. It is a wonderful acknowledgment of this Afro-\nCuban doctor. He, in his quest for freedom, has chosen to follow Martin \nLuther King, Jr., the Dalai Lama, and Gandhi. This is a man of peace. \nHe is not a man of armed conflict, not a man of violence; he is a man \nof peace. He is in prison, as was mentioned by the Senator from New \nJersey, but I want us to understand that being in prison in Cuba isn't \nas simple as just being denied the opportunity to walk and move as you \nwill but it is to be in the most repressive gulag the world has ever \nseen.\n  President Bush last week was speaking eloquently about the situation \nin Cuba. He said: The day this regime ends, those who have supported it \nwill be embarrassed by the things that will be revealed, just like \nthose who supported the Eastern European gulag or the Nazis or the \nStalins of the past, who were embarrassed at a time when the full \nmeasure of their cruelty was seen and recognized.\n  As we approach the agricultural fair in Havana, I remember that as a \nyoung boy--my father was a veterinarian, and one of the biggest thrills \nfor me was to go from my small city to Havana to the fair. This was a \ntime when the cattle exposition was there, and my father, of course, \nbeing involved in this industry, was there doing business. I remember \nseeing my first rodeo there. It is a wonderful memory.\n  Well, this fair still goes on every year. I know there will be many \nfrom this country who believe the most appropriate thing to do is to \nmake a buck and go there and sell goods and participate in this fair. I \nhope when they are there, they might have the courage themselves to \nwear one of these little wristbands. I will be happy to supply them. I \nhave a few. It would be wonderful if they would show up at the fair \nwearing these wristbands that say ``cambio''--just a simple message of \nsolidarity with those who are oppressed.\n  We are a people of freedom. We enjoy our liberty, and we want it for \nothers. We understand that the time for the Cuban people is coming. The \nhour for the Cuban people is approaching. It is coming. So I thank my \ncolleagues for their solidarity, Senator Cornyn from Texas as well as \nmy colleague from Florida and Senator Menendez, all joining today in \none voice seeking ``cambio''--change--and standing together with these \nyoung people for their courage and their bravery, as well as \ncelebrating this wonderful award Dr. Biscet will be receiving on \nMonday, which is a good recognition of his long work in the area of \nhuman rights, and hoping that it might be an opportunity for the Cuban \nregime to perhaps consider whether it is the time to grant him his \nfreedom.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S13656]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 7 or 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, Members of the House and Senate have \nworked diligently over the last several months to write a bill to \nreauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. They worked hard \nand came to a solid bipartisan compromise. This is a bill that \nRepublicans and Democrats alike have championed. Almost 70 Members of \nthe Senate voted for the Children's Health Insurance Program, and about \n290 members of the House voted for it.\n  Despite the strong support nationwide from both parties in the House \nand both parties in the Senate and the strong support from groups such \nas the United Way to children's hospitals, to pediatricians, to medical \ngroups, to all kinds of children's advocates, the President still \nvetoed it.\n  Now we have an opportunity to save the bill. For our national leaders \nwho are still unsure, I wish they would meet the families benefiting \nfrom this program. I would love it if President Bush would meet \nfamilies such as the Coltmans of Conneaut, OH, which is not far from \nwhere my wife grew up, near the Pennsylvania border. The Coltmans are a \nlarge family with five children and two hard-working parents.\n  In July, their 7-year-old son Caleb was diagnosed with leukemia. The \ndoctors are optimistic, but treatment, of course, is very expensive. \nLast year, Kenna Coltman, Caleb's mother, left her job to work for her \nfamily business, a neighborhood grocery store. Unfortunately, this \nmeant she had to search for new health insurance. After a long search \nfor private insurance, the Coltman family found an affordable plan, but \nit wasn't scheduled to go into effect until August.\n  By that time, Caleb had been diagnosed with leukemia. Needless to \nsay, that was a deal breaker for the private insurer.\n  Uninsured, facing catastrophic illness--a parent's worse nightmare--\nthe Coltmans ran out of options. Caleb's mother recounted the \nexperience this way:\n\n       If there was absolutely any other way to get our son the \n     care and medication he needs without totally impoverishing \n     our family, we would do it.\n\n  Instead, the Coltmans turned to Ohio's Healthy Start/Healthy Families \nprogram, a Medicaid-CHIP joint initiative.\n  Mrs. Coltman said:\n\n       We were lucky in the fact that last year was a really bad \n     year for us financially, or we may not have even qualified \n     for Medicaid.\n\n  Hear that again:\n\n       We were lucky in the fact that last year was a really bad \n     year for us financially, or we may not have even qualified \n     for Medicaid.\n\n  It seems wrong to me that a family should be feeling ``lucky'' \nbecause they earned so little money in 1 year that they were able to \nqualify for Medicaid to take care of their son who was diagnosed with \nleukemia.\n  But Mrs. Coltman does feel lucky and they qualified--falling below \n200 percent of poverty even after exhausting all their savings.\n  Caleb's treatment is now covered. Thankfully, his current prognosis \nis good, and the family business seems to be turning the corner. \nAlthough the Coltman parents are still without health insurance, the \nchildren remain covered through SCHIP--a bona fide lifesaver, a real \nlifesaver.\n  Let's make sure other families--in Ohio and elsewhere--have access to \nthis critical health insurance safety net by sending the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program bill to the President's desk.\n  Let's provide children in Ohio, in Missouri, and elsewhere, such as \nCaleb, the start in life that will help them to achieve their goals and \ndevelop to their fullest potential.\n  Ten years ago, a Democratic President and Republican Congress made a \npromise to low-income children and their parents. We told them they \nwould be able to insure their children. We wrote it into law and the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program has worked for 6 million children. \nNow, this bill will help us follow through on that promise for 4 \nmillion additional children.\n  There are millions of low-income American children who are eligible \nbut not now enrolled. This bill enables our country to follow through \nfor more children who are already standing at the door. This bill lets \nthem in. We have an insurance program that works, a bipartisan \nconsensus that is firm, and a goal that is above politics. Our goal is \nto provide health insurance for our children. Let us move forward.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have had a number of conversations this \nmorning with Democratic and Republican Senators. They are attempting to \nwork out a compromise with respect to the CHIP bill, the children's \nhealth program. They think if they have more time, they can do that. I \nbelieve they are acting in all sincerity. They have tried very hard. \nThey have even had individual meetings with House Members; Democratic \nSenators have met with Republican House Members; Democratic and \nRepublican Senators have met with Republican House Members. They have \ntried to work something out.\n  It is an unusual situation. They have even been calling the Speaker. \nA number of the prime negotiators have talked to her numerous times on \nthe telephone and met with her personally.\n  Having said that, this is an effort to try to work something out. I \nask unanimous consent the motion to proceed to H.R. 3963 be agreed to, \nthat the bill be laid aside until 4 p.m. this coming Monday, November \n5; that on that day, Monday, November 5, the Senate vote on cloture on \nthe bill at 5 p.m.; if cloture is invoked, there be 2 hours for debate \non the bill and any possible germane amendments thereto, and at the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote under \nthe provisions of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on behalf of one of the Members on my \nside of the aisle, I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in an effort to try to be cooperative in \nthis matter, I ask consent to allow these individuals more time to deal \nwith this, and therefore I ask unanimous consent to proceed to this \nlegislation, H.R. 3963, and that it be adopted and the bill be laid \naside until the disposition of the farm bill, H.R. 2419. That would \nprobably not be until, at the earliest, somewhere in the middle of \nNovember sometime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, once again there is an objection on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, of course, I am disappointed. I have tried \nto keep the Republican leader advised. I have done my best to balance \nthe requests. I usually do not get in this position of Democratic and \nRepublican Senators, but I have been happy to do that. This is my \neffort to try to do that.\n  I hope there can be some way, sometime, that we can send a bill to \nthe President that he will not veto. Hopefully, this one he will not. \nWe have made some changes in it, as I have indicated. We changed to no \nwaivers over 300 percent. We have locked in more tightly anything \ndealing with undocumented children. We have cut the time for adults. \nAny adults who are on the program, with no children, they were to have \n2 years, now it is 1 year. We have moved the best we can.\n  Having done that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of the children's health insurance bill, \nH.R. 3963, the time between now and 4:45 p.m. today be equally divided \nbetween\n\n[[Page S13657]]\n\nthe two leaders or their designees, and no amendments or motions be in \norder to the bill; that at 4:45 p.m. the Senate vote on cloture to the \nbill and that motion to be filed upon reporting of the bill; if cloture \nis invoked, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote without \nany intervening action or debate on passage of the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, let me echo the observations of the majority leader \nabout how important the children's health insurance issue is.\n  This was a measure that originated with a Republican Congress back in \nthe 1990s. I think we are going to be able to get this worked out after \nthis skirmish that has been going on over the last few weeks in a way \nthat will guarantee additional poor children receive the health \ninsurance they certainly richly deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? The chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13657-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13657-S13676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Dorgan, \n           Debbie Stabenow, Bill Nelson, Robert P. Casey, Jr.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, earlier today I joined with several of \nmy colleagues--the good Senator McCaskill and Senator Casey and a \ndistinguished leader on children's health, Dr. Woodie Kessel--to speak \nout on the children's health legislation we are considering in the \nSenate.\n  Dr. Kessel is an extraordinary public health official, a pediatrician \nwho has been widely acclaimed and recognized by virtually all the \nmedical societies for his lifetime commitment to children. He worked in \nRepublican and Democratic administrations and feels passionately about \nthe importance of the passage of this CHIP legislation.\n  Dr. Kessel spoke of a recent presentation of the American Academy of \nPediatrics on the value of investing in children's health provided by \nDr. James Heckman, the Nobel laureate in Economics. I wish to share his \nwords with the Senate today, as they make a persuasive case for the \nbill that is before us. This is a direct quote from the Nobel laureate.\n\n       It is a rare public policy initiative that promotes \n     fairness and social justice and at the same time promotes \n     productivity in the economy and in society at large. \n     Investing in disadvantaged young children is such a policy. \n     Early interventions for disadvantaged children promotes \n     schooling, raises the quality of the workforce, enhance the \n     productivity of schools and reduce crime, teenage pregnancy \n     and welfare dependency. A large body of research shows that \n     skill begets skill; that learning begets learning. The \n     earlier the seed is planted and watered, the faster and \n     larger it grows.\n\n  That is what our bill is all about. Investing in America's future, \ninvesting in our children. If we give them the chance for a healthy \nstart to life, we will reap the rewards for decades to come in terms of \nbetter education and a more productive workforce. If, instead, we \nsuccumb to the politics of fear and division coming from the White \nHouse, we consign 10 million American children to a dimmer future.\n  The CHIP program is an education issue because we know children who \nare sick--unable to see the blackboard, unable to hear the teacher, \nunable to read the book or understand the homework--are not going to \nlearn. So this is a health issue and it is a children's issue. It is a \nchildren's issue because it affects the 10 million children.\n  It is a working families issue because this is targeted to the \nchildren of working families, more than 92 percent for those families \nearning under 200 percent of poverty, about $42,000 for a family of \nfour. So it is a working families issue.\n  It is a fairness issue. Particularly in the Senate, when we cast our \nvotes this afternoon--we are getting paid $160,000. Our health \ninsurance for all the Members of the Senate--with the exception of one \nindividual--for all the Members, is paid for by the American taxpayers, \n72 percent: 72 percent of our health insurance; every Member. We have \nthe best. I have believed that since I have been involved in the health \nissue since arriving in the Senate, and I was reassured of that in the \nlast couple weeks when I needed medical attention. We have the very \nbest. We can go down to the dispensary in the Capitol of the United \nStates and see some of the finest medical personnel in our country. We \ncan go to Walter Reed, we can go to Bethesda Naval Hospital, places \nwhere the President and the Vice President and Cabinet and other \nMembers of Congress have gone, and we get our health care paid for, \neffectively, in full.\n  Yet we are going to vote to deny the working families of this \ncountry, people who are making 200 percent of poverty--$40,000, these \nare working families in this country--the opportunity to have their \nchildren covered?\n  That is the issue, that is the fairness issue, that is the values \nissue, and that is the issue before the Senate this afternoon.\n  We know when these children get the healthy start, as the Nobel \nlaureate pointed out, they are more productive, they are more \neffective. They are going to be more effective and more productive and \nhealthier for their lives. They are going to be more lively, in terms \nof the world economy and the knowledge-based competition we are going \nto be facing in a world economy. They are going to be more effective as \nleaders, in terms of our national security. They are going to be more \ngifted and talented, in terms of implementing rights and liberties and \nhaving our democratic institutions function and work the way our \nFounding Fathers wanted them to work.\n  This is an enormously important bill that reaches the heart and soul \nof what this country is all about. I am hopeful we will have a strong, \noverwhelming vote in favor of moving ahead and achieving our objective.\n\n\n                    nomination of michael b. Mukasey\n\n  Madam President, I intend to oppose the nomination of Michael B. \nMukasey to be the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  This is a nomination I had hoped to support. There is no doubt the \nDepartment of Justice is in desperate need of new leadership. Under \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales, the Department was transformed from \na genuine force for justice into a rubber stamp for others in the \nadministration who cared little for the rule of law.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel, and the Attorney General himself, \nrepeatedly authorized programs of torturing detainees and wiretapping \nAmericans that were both illegal and immoral.\n  Career attorneys who spoke up were marginalized or transferred to \ndead-end jobs. U.S. attorneys were fired if they refused to take orders \nfrom the White House as to who should be prosecuted.\n  The Civil Rights Division turned its back on its historic mission, \nand failed to vigorously enforce our civil rights laws. Instead of \nprotecting the rights of all Americans, it spent time approving voter-\nidentification laws that keep the poor, the elderly, and minorities \naway from the polls, and investigating phantom allegations of ``voter \nfraud.''\n  There has never been a time when the Department of Justice was more \nin need of a new direction, away from partisanship and back to its \ncritical responsibility of protecting our rights and enforcing our \nlaws.\n  We all hoped that Michael Mukasey could provide that needed \nleadership.\n\n[[Page S13658]]\n\nHe had served with distinction as a Federal judge for almost 19 years. \nBy all accounts, he was smart, fair, and conscientious in the \ncourtroom. In some cases, he showed admirable independence, rejecting \nsome of the administration's most extreme legal arguments. He has the \ncredentials and many of the capabilities to be a strong Attorney \nGeneral.\n  But talent and experience are not all that is required for the job. \nThe Attorney General of the United States must also be a person with an \nunbending commitment to justice, fairness, and equality, who will stand \nup for America's laws and values, even when the White House tries to \nsteer the Department in the other direction.\n  I have had the chance to meet with Judge Mukasey, to listen to his \ntestimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and to read through his \nanswers to written questions submitted by committee members. I cannot \nin good conscience support his nomination.\n  My concerns begin with Judge Mukasey's answers to our questions about \nwaterboarding. Waterboarding is a barbaric practice in which water is \npoured down the mouth and nose of the detainee to simulate drowning. \nThe Nation's top military lawyers and legal experts from across the \npolitical spectrum have condemned this technique as a violation of U.S. \nlaw and a crime against humanity. Following World War II, the United \nStates prosecuted a Japanese officer for engaging in this very \npractice, and that officer was convicted and sentenced to 15 years of \nhard labor.\n  Waterboarding is torture. Period. Yet Judge Mukasey refuses to say \nso.\n  His refusal was so extraordinary and unexpected that we asked the \nJudge a series of further questions to help us understand why an able, \nexperienced lawyer would find it so difficult to agree that a practice \nused in the Spanish Inquisition was torture. But our questions were met \nwith equivocation and evasion. Judge Mukasey told me that my questions \nabout the legality of waterboarding were the kind of hypothetical \nquestions that judges commonly refuse to address. But he has been \nnominated to be Attorney General, and an Attorney General, unlike a \njudge, is often called upon to determine whether an action would be \nlegal before such an action is taken.\n  However, it is not just his remarks on waterboarding that trouble me. \nJudge Mukasey also evaded a wide range of questions on torture. He \nrefused to commit to sharing with Congress the legal opinions of the \nOffice of Legal Counsel that have authorized coercive interrogation \ntechniques. He suggested that Common Article III of the Geneva \nConventions, the basic international standard for humane treatment, may \nnot always apply to the treatment of enemies we capture, even though \nthe Supreme Court has rejected that view. He would not even say whether \nit would be unlawful for enemy forces to subject Americans to ``painful \nstress positions, threatening detainees with dogs, forced nudity, \nwaterboarding and mock execution.''\n  These extreme views are not only immoral and legally flawed, they \nalso increase the risk that our own troops will be subjected to \nbarbaric treatment.\n  Judge Mukasey could not even bring himself to reject the legal \nreasoning behind the infamous Bybee ``torture memo.'' That memo stated \nthat physical pain amounted to torture only if it was ``equivalent in \nintensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as \norgan failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'' Anything \nthat fell short of this standard would not be torture, according to the \nmemo.\n  CIA interrogators called this memo their ``golden shield,'' because \nit allowed them to use virtually any interrogation method they wished. \nWhen the memo finally became public, however, the country was appalled \nand the memo's flaws were quickly exposed. Dean Harold Koh of Yale Law \nSchool wrote, ``in my professional opinion as a law professor and a law \ndean, the Bybee memorandum is perhaps the most clearly legally \nerroneous opinion I have ever read.'' The Bush administration was so \nembarrassed that it withdrew the memo.\n  When I said to Judge Mukasey that his testimony left ``the alarming \nimpression that you may agree with [the memo's] legal reasoning,'' he \ndid nothing to remove that impression. He said that the memo was ``a \nmistake,'' but he could not bring himself to reject its flawed \nreasoning.\n  There are only two possible explanations for Judge Mukasey's \ntestimony on this issue. The first is that he genuinely believes that \nwaterboarding may not always be torture, that international law does \nnot fully protect American POWs, and that the withdrawn Bybee \nmemorandum was not deeply flawed. If those are his beliefs, he is so \nfar out of the mainstream of legal thought in this country that he \nshould not serve as Attorney General.\n  The second explanation is that Judge Mukasey has already begun \ndefending President Bush's administration, instead of standing up to it \nwhen the rule of law requires it. It is quite possible that Judge \nMukasey knows that waterboarding is torture, that international law \nprotects American POWs, and that the Bybee memorandum was a moral and \nlegal abomination. But he refuses to say so, because such answers would \nbe deeply inconvenient to the Bush administration.\n  Time and again, Judge Mukasey told us that he would be independent of \nthe White House, that he understands that the Attorney General is not \nsimply the President's lawyer, but is the guardian of the law for all \nAmericans. I would like to believe Judge Mukasey. But if this issue was \nthe first test of his independence, he has failed it.\n  Judge Mukasey's answers to our questions on torture remind me of \nnothing so much as the responses to the Senate on these issues by \nAttorney General Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales adopted an absurdly narrow \ndefinition of torture in order to permit extreme interrogation \npractices. He ignored the plain language of the Geneva Conventions \nprohibiting cruel and humiliating treatment.\n  He withheld his views on how to interpret and enforce our laws \nagainst torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading acts. He refused to \ndiscuss specific interrogation techniques or to repudiate the Bybee \nmemo. He refused to take any firm positions.\n  Judge Mukasey may have dressed up his responses in more skilled legal \nrhetoric, but the difference between his answers and those of Mr. \nGonzales is disappointingly small.\n  Judge Mukasey's answers make clear that this administration simply \ncannot be trusted ever to renounce torture. Congress, therefore, must \nact now to strengthen our ban on torture. I have already introduced a \nbill to do that: The Torture Prevention and Effective Interrogation \nAct. It will apply the standards of the Army Field Manual to all U.S. \ngovernment interrogations, not just Department of Defense \ninterrogations. This basic reform will ensure that our government \nhonors its commitment to the rights enshrined in the Geneva \nConventions, which protect the values we cherish as a free society and \nthe lives of our men and women overseas. I intend to move that \nlegislation at the earliest possible time. Congress needs to pass it \npromptly.\n  While Judge Mukasey's views on torture are reason enough to oppose \nhis nomination, I found little comfort in other areas as well.\n  For instance, Judge Mukasey argued that the President has substantial \nspheres of exclusive powers over which the other branches of government \nhave no control whatever. He indicated that the President may \nindefinitely imprison a U.S. citizen, seized on U.S. soil, without \ncharges, solely on the President's determination that the person is an \n``enemy combatant.'' He ridiculed critics of the PATRIOT Act. He stated \nthat the President may sometimes violate or disregard the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, despite that law's clear statement to \nthe contrary.\n  Judge Mukasey also argued that the Authorization for Use of Military \nForce, passed by Congress immediately after the 9/11 attacks, may have \nauthorized the President's warrantless surveillance program that was \nused to spy on millions of Americans for over 5 years. That is a \nridiculous legal argument, which legal experts have debunked time and \ntime again. In these statements and others, Judge Mukasey left the \ntroubling impression that the executive branch can run roughshod over \nthe constitutional role of the other branches and the civil liberties \nof Americans.\n\n[[Page S13659]]\n\n  When I met with Judge Mukasey, I made clear that the Civil Rights \nDivision is failing in its historic mission. As civil rights legend \nJohn Lewis recently testified, the division has ``lost it's way.'' It \nwill take clear, strong leadership to ensure that the division once \nagain vigorously enforces the Nation's civil rights laws. When we met, \nI suggested specific reforms, and I mentioned published studies that \nhave done the same. Yet when I asked Judge Mukasey about his specific \nplan for the Civil Rights Division, he gave only vague answers. He \nnever acknowledged that the division is in need of reform, and he never \nprovided any concrete ideas on how he would revitalize the division. \nThere was nothing in his answers to suggest that as Attorney General, \nhe would enforce our civil rights laws with the skill and vigor that \nare necessary to guarantee equal justice and equal opportunity for all \nAmericans.\n  I therefore intend to oppose this nomination. Judge Mukasey appears \nto be a careful, conscientious and intelligent lawyer, and he has \nserved our country honorably for many years. But those qualities are \nnot enough for this critical position at this critical time. Over the \npast 6 years, the Bush administration has run roughshod over the rule \nof law, and has taken the Department of Justice along for the ride. In \nlight of that history, the Senate must demand an Attorney General who \nwill speak truth to power, and follow the law, no matter what the \nconsequences.\n  Judge Mukasey's equivocations and evasions on critical issues give me \nno confidence that he will fulfill this vital role. After 6 long years \nof reckless disregard for the rule of law by this administration, we \ncannot afford to take our chances on the judgment of someone who either \ndoes not know torture when he sees it or is willing to pretend so to \nsuit the President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when the Senate goes into a \nquorum call, the time be equally divided between the parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Product Safety\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Halloween has come and gone. Yet there are \ntoo many parents I have talked to in the last couple weeks who have \nsome fear, who have been scared about some of the toys that have come \ninto our country; where they see ``Made in China'' and they have seen \nnews reports and have seen and heard about products tested that have \nlead content.\n  A professor at the University of Ashland, in Ashland, OH, about 15 \nmiles from where I grew up in Mansfield, OH, has been a leader, with \nhis chemistry students at Ashland University, in testing for lead in \ntoys.\n  I asked him if he would test some Halloween products, if you will, \nsome Halloween toys and various paraphernalia. He found out of 22 \nproducts he tested, 3 of them had high levels of lead. In fact, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission has said that anything over 600 \nparts per million of lead is dangerous for adults, and any lead at all \nis dangerous for children.\n  He found in a Frankenstein mug he bought locally at a store in \nAshland--and they are sold all over the country, I am sure--he found a \nFrankenstein mug that had 39,000 parts per million of lead--39,000--\nwhen the level of safety for adults is 600, and the level for children \nis zero. He found a Halloween cup that was 39,000 parts per million.\n\n  We have read all about the Consumer Product Safety Commission and how \nthey have failed the American people and how the chairwoman is lobbying \nagainst the legislation of Senator Pryor to make the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission work better; how she has supported the Bush \nadministration, as an appointee of them, in cutting funding for \ninspections and cutting funding for enforcing consumer product safety.\n  But this shouldn't surprise us when we buy $288 billion worth of \nproducts from China, as we did last year, not to mention hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of products from other countries, and tens of \nbillions of dollars of those products are consumer items certainly--\ntens of billions of dollars worth of tires, vitamins, toys--all kinds \nof things. Those products are made in a country where they have weak \nworker safety standards, they have almost nonexistent consumer \nprotection laws and rules, they have very weak food safety standards, \nvery weak environmental safe drinking water and clean air standards.\n  So we shouldn't be surprised when we buy products from a country \nwhere these products are produced doesn't have any kinds of protections \nthemselves for their own workers and for their own consuming public. \nThat is compounded by the fact that American companies such as Mattel, \ntoy companies and other companies, when they go to China, they hire \nChinese subcontractors and they push these Chinese subcontractors to \ncut costs: You have to cut costs and cut corners and make these \nproducts cheaper. So what logically will they do? They will use lead-\nbased paint because it is cheaper, easier to apply, dries faster, and \nit is shinier. They will put contaminants in vitamins because it is \nless expensive than using the pure, real ingredients that should be in \nthem. As the New York Times pointed out yesterday in a frontpage story, \nthey will sell pharmaceuticals out of China that are contaminated and \nunsafe for consumers in China and all over the world.\n  So you have a situation where we open our borders, as we should, to \ntrade. I want trade. I want more of it. I want plenty of it. But I want \nit under a different set of rules, most importantly to protect the \nAmerican public and our families and our children. But we open up our \nborders to $288 billion of Chinese products. They don't make these \nproducts safe for their own people, let alone for the United States. \nThey cut costs to export those products here, and then when these \nimporters bring them in, Mattel or anybody else, they are not held \naccountable. If Mattel is going to bring toys in, then they are \nresponsible for those toys being safe--any importer that brings \nproducts in, whether it is apple juice, whether it is vitamins, whether \nit is toothpaste, whether it is dog food, whether it is toys, whether \nit is tires. Every one of those products has had a major problem, and \nevery one of those products I mentioned was imported from China and \nfrom Southeast Asia.\n  At the same time, then, we have a complicit or a compliant--I am not \nsure which--Bush administration which has weakened consumer protection \nlaws, food safety laws, clean air laws, safe drinking water laws, and \nit has weakened drug safety laws. We have a Bush administration which \nhas weakened those laws and then underfunds and cuts back on the number \nof inspections. So the products are made in a country where they are \nnot likely to be safe, they are brought in by an American contractor \nwho has pushed those subcontractors to do it more cheaply; they are \nthen brought in with no personal or corporate responsibility by the \nimporter, and then we have a government which doesn't protect us. For \n50 years, in some cases more than 50 years, and in others slightly \nfewer than 50 years, we have had an FDA, Food and Drug Administration, \nan EPA, a Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, we have had these agencies which have protected the \nair, the water, the food, the medicine, the toys our consumers buy.\n  What has happened over the last 5 years is that they have weakened \nthe standards and cut back the number of inspectors, even though 20 \nyears ago when the Environmental Protection Agency was much larger and \ndid many more inspections, we are now importing all kinds of toys and \nfood products that we weren't importing back then. So we have set \nourselves up--because of the Bush administration's closeness to the toy \ncompanies and other corporations, the Bush administration has sided \nwith the drug companies over the consuming, medicine-taking public, the \nBush administration has sided with\n\n[[Page S13660]]\n\nthe big polluters and they weakened the EPA; they sided with the big \ntoy companies and weakened the Consumer Product Safety Commission. So \nit is no surprise our children are not as safe and our food supply is \nnot as pure as it should be. It doesn't matter to point fingers, but \nthe fact is we have set this system up, in part because of trade policy \nthat is written by the largest corporations in the country to serve \ntheir shareholders and to serve their executives at the expense of \nworkers overseas, at the expense of workers in our country, and at the \nexpense of the consuming public: our children and their toys in their \nbedrooms and our families in the food they buy for their kitchen \ntables.\n  Yet Congress--the House and Senate--perhaps is about to pass another \ntrade agreement. We have seen these trade agreements with China, with \nMexico--the Central American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR \nwith China--we have seen these trade agreements weaken our safety \nregulatory structure. These trade agreements in part are responsible \nfor weaker environmental standards, for weaker food safety standards, \nfor weaker consumer protection laws, for weaker food and drug safety \nrules. Yet Congress is about to pass, it looks like, a trade agreement \nwith Peru, with some of the same problems. It is a better trade \nagreement. It has some labor and environmental standards, but it \ndoesn't have the kinds of protection for food safety, the kinds of \nprotections for drug safety, the kinds of protections for consumer \nproducts as it should.\n  Instead of passing another trade agreement, Congress should simply \nstop. We should reexamine our consumer protection laws, our food safety \nlaws, our safe drinking water and clean air laws, our drug safety laws. \nWe should stop and examine them. We should stop and not pass any more \ntrade agreements until we have reexamined what NAFTA has meant, what \nCAFTA has meant, what PNTR with China has meant, and a whole host of \nother trade agreements. Then we can move forward and write trade \nagreements that don't just serve the interests of the largest companies \nin the world, as they have in the past, but trade agreements that work \nfor workers, trade agreements that protect the public, protect our \njobs, protect our food supply, and protect our children from dangerous \ntoys. If these trade agreements are done right, they will lift up \nstandards not just in Mexico and Central America and China, but lift up \nstandards in this country so we know we will have pure food and safe \ndrinking water.\n  We know from these trade agreements that we will have safe toys with \nno lead in them, and we know it will be better for our communities, \nfrom Galion to Gallipolis to Ashtabula to Middletown in my great State \nof Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time on the quorum call be evenly divided between the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, quite frankly, I don't understand the \nobjections of the President of the United States to the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program we are considering here today. I hope we all \nunderstand the importance of this program and how important it is for \nchildren in America to have health insurance. We know, and we have a \nlot of studies which show, that children who have health insurance are \nfar more likely to be immunized against diseases, far more likely to \nhave the benefits of preventive health care, are far more likely to get \nthe type of health care intervention that will lead to healthier lives. \nQuite frankly, that will save us money because they are going to be \nhealthier and need less health care during their lifetime. We also know \nthat children who have health insurance are far more likely to have \nbetter attendance records at school. The list goes on and on and on. So \nit makes sense for children to have health insurance.\n  The legislation we are considering is aimed at working families--\nworking families that cannot afford the cost of health insurance. These \nare families playing according to the rules. They are doing everything \nright, but they can't afford the cost of insuring the family with \nhealth insurance.\n  A family from Baltimore came and testified before the Presiding \nOfficer's committee for the reauthorization of the CHIP program. The \nmother explained that having children's health insurance--having the \nMaryland program--that mother no longer has to wake up in the morning \nand decide whether the child is sick enough to see a doctor. She \ndoesn't have to worry that if her child is playing on a playground and \ngets hurt, how they will be able to afford that bill.\n  Our children are the innocent casualties of the failure of our \ncountry to have universal health coverage--universal health insurance. \nThey are the innocent casualties. The bill we have before us tries to \ndo something about it.\n  This is a bill that is not a Democratic bill or a Republican bill; it \nis a bill that has been compromised in the best sense of the \nlegislative process: Democrats and Republicans working together to \nproduce a bill that could be supported not just for 1 year but \nsupported now for a decade. It is a bill that builds upon private \ninsurance. That was important to get the consensus among Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is a bill that is administered by our States; it is not \nadministered in Washington. This is a program that our States \nadminister. I am proud of the State of Maryland MCHIP program, the \nMaryland Children's Health Insurance Program. It is designed in \nMaryland to meet the needs of our children, and the Federal Government \nis a partner in helping to pay for the program. This is a bill that has \nbeen worked in the best sense of the legislative process, by Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  It is an affordable program. I have heard the President of the United \nStates talk about the affordability. This program is affordable. First, \nas I mentioned earlier, it saves health care dollars. Children who have \naccess to preventive health care are going to save us money over the \nlong term in health care expenditures. Secondly, this bill is paid for. \nI know that is not always the case with legislation we pass, but this \nbill will not add a penny to the deficit. In fact, I would argue that \nthis bill will actually help us in balancing the Federal budget. It is \nfully paid for by an increase in the cigarette tax, but economists tell \nus that as a result of the increase in the cigarette tax, there are \ngoing to be millions of people who will either stop smoking or will \nnever start smoking--particularly young people who won't start smoking \nnow because of the extra cost in buying a pack of cigarettes. The \nPresiding Officer and I know how much that will save in our health care \nsystem for someone who doesn't smoke. That is not figured into the cost \nestimates here, the savings we will have to our health care system \nbecause of the number of children who will never start smoking.\n  In Maryland, this bill will mean that Maryland will not only be able \nto continue the 100,000 children who are currently enrolled in the \nprogram--because if we don't pass this bill, we can't continue our \ncurrent commitment--but will add 40,000 more children to the Maryland \nChildren's Health Care Program.\n  That is good. We need to do that. Let me remind you that, in \nMaryland, we have 800,000 people without health insurance. That is not \njust children, that is the whole community that has no health \ninsurance. Obviously, we want to reduce that number. This bill makes a \nsmall step in dealing with the gap we have in America where people have \nno health insurance, but it is an important step because it deals with \nchildren. We can certainly do that.\n  I wish to talk about one part of the program that, quite frankly, \nhasn't gotten a lot of attention, and it is a very important part, \nwhich is the reason we need a reauthorization bill. In a \nreauthorization bill, we can expand the program to deal with the needs \nin our communities. This bill covers required dental services, so all \nthe children in the Children's Health Insurance Program will receive \ndental insurance coverage.\n  C. Everett Koop, a former Surgeon General of the United States, says,\n\n[[Page S13661]]\n\n``There is no health without oral health.'' Again, he is a former \nSurgeon General. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry said \ndental decay is the most chronic childhood disease among children in \nthe United States--five times more likely than asthma. Regarding the \nvulnerability of our children, of those children between the ages of 6 \nto 8, 50 percent have tooth decay. If you are poor and live in poverty, \nyou are two times more likely to have a problem with your teeth. If you \nhappen to be a minority--if you are an African American, 39 percent of \nthem have untreated tooth decay. If you live in a rural part of your \nState--Mr. President, I know your State and my State have rural \ncommunities--only 11 percent of our population ever visit a dentist. We \nhave a problem with dental care in this country. Twenty-five million \nAmericans live today in areas that have inadequate dental care \nservices. So we can do better, and this bill moves us in the right \ndirection. There is a direct relationship between general health and \noral health. We know that. One example: Plaque has been directly \nrelated to problems with heart disease. We know there is a relationship \nthere, and there is a lot to be learned.\n  I am going to try to put a face on this issue because we talk about \nwhat it means to have 25 million people who don't have access to dental \nservices. I will tell you about one child, Deamonte Driver. He lived in \nPrince George's County in my State, which is about 6 miles from here. \nHe was a 12-year-old who had problems with his teeth. His mom tried to \nget him to see a dentist and could not find one who would treat him. He \nsort of fell through the cracks.\n  Finally, he was suffering from horrible headaches, so his mother did \nwhat many parents do with children who don't have health insurance--\ntook the child to the emergency room. One of the reasons we want to see \nthe CHIP bill passed is to get children less expensive preventive \nhealth care so they don't have to use emergency rooms as primary care \nfacilities. He went to the emergency room, and he was admitted. It \nseemed as if he didn't just have tooth decay, he had an abscessed tooth \nthat went untreated. No dentist would see him. He had no insurance. \nThey performed an operation and tried to alleviate his pain and save \nhis life. They performed a second operation and spent a quarter of a \nmillion dollars, which we paid for because it was uncompensated care. \nThat boy died because, in 2007, we have no program in this country to \nprovide that child an $80 tooth extraction and for children to be able \nto see dentists.\n  Mr. President, one of the really good things about this bill before \nus--our reauthorization bill--is we have a chance to do something about \nthat. We have a chance to do something about the Deamonte Drivers of \nour communities, to make sure our innocent children get the type of \nattention they so much deserve.\n  What does this bill do for dental care? It has a guaranteed dental \nbenefit, coverage of dental services necessary to prevent diseases, \npromote oral health, restore oral structure to health and function, and \ntreat emergency conditions. That is what is covered in this legislation \nwhich we will vote on in a few hours. How do you meet that? It is \ninteresting. The States are giving benchmarks. You can do it if you \nhave a benefit like ours, our Federal plan, in which dental benefits \nare included. The State can meet the requirements by providing the \nbenefits Federal employees get. They can take the dental benefits in \ntheir State employees' plan and use that as a model or they can take \nthe most popular commercial plan in their State for enrollment for \nMedicaid enrollees and use that as their benchmark.\n  So when you are using commercial insurance as the benchmark for what \nchildren should be able to have insurance to deal with their dental \nneeds, to me, that is the way we should be going. It is in this bill.\n  This is even more important. The bill provides for dental education \nfor parents of newborns. When babies are born, they don't have teeth, \nso why is that important? One out of every five children between the \nages of 2 and 4 has tooth decay in their baby teeth. This bill provides \nfor education so that parents know about the risks of oral health and \nknow how to deal with oral health as their babies grow up. It also \nmakes it easier to locate a participating provider.\n  Let me go back to Deamonte Driver again, from Prince George's County. \nHis parents sought the help of a social worker, Laurie Norris, who \ntried to find a dentist who would treat Deamonte Driver. That social \nworker made over 20 phone calls to try to find a dentist who would \ntreat Deamonte Driver--without success. Think about the time that went \ninto that. Think about how many parents must be so discouraged in \ntrying to get help for their children.\n  Well, this legislation before us today, which we will vote on in a \ncouple of hours, does something about that. It requires that the Web \npage on the Children's Health Insurance Program list the coverage \navailable by State for dental benefits under the CHIP program, plus the \nlist of providers who will provide that care. So if this bill becomes \nlaw, with one phone call or one click of the mouse, a parent will be \nable to know exactly what the benefits are and exactly which dentist \nthat parent can contact in order to get his or her child the type of \ncare they need.\n  I have heard my colleagues talk a lot about this Children's Health \nInsurance Program, how important it is to the health of the people in \nour communities. I know how important it is in Maryland. I am proud of \nour program at the State level, which has the cooperation and help of \nthe Federal Government as a partner. It is a bipartisan bill, developed \nby Democrats and Republicans, and the bill makes sense from the point \nof view of proper allocation of money in our health care system and \nwill save us money--all of those things.\n\n  At the end of the day, it does speak about priorities. What is \nimportant? Where are our priorities? What do we want to be known for? \nWhom did we stand up for?\n  This bill spends $35 billion over a 5-year period, and it is fully \npaid for. We can all make our own comparisons, but I think about the \ncost in Iraq, which, over a 3-month period, is costing more than this \nbill, and it is not paid for, but we seem to always have the money for \nthat. And we come up with excuses to oppose this legislation.\n  I thank the leaders who were responsible for bringing this \nlegislation forward. I urge my colleagues to support it. I hope we can \nget the type of support we need to pass this, notwithstanding the \nobjections of the President. I always hold out hope that President Bush \nwill sign a bill--a bill that will allow the people of Maryland and \nthroughout this country to have adequate care so that we don't have to \nagain see a story such as Deamonte Driver's--a child who died because \nwe could not find a way to get him basic dental care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                             Iraq War Costs\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak once again about the \ncost of the war in Iraq here at home. This is the third speech I have \nstood up to give in the series that I intend to continue to give about \nwhat the Iraq war is costing us here at home, beyond the immeasurable \ncost of lives. Over 3,839 American lives have been lost--those are \npriceless--and 28,327 Americans have been seriously injured in the \nservice of their country.\n  Since I started giving these speeches 2 weeks ago, $5 billion more \nhas gone from the Treasury and has been spent in Iraq. It brings the \ntotal amount taken from the American people's pockets to $455 billion. \nNext month, another $10 billion will be sent over to Iraq, and it will \nbe gone forever.\n  Americans trusted the Government with that money. When the numbers \nare that outrageously high, we all have to constantly be asking \nourselves a simple question: What is going to make a bigger difference \nin our lives--using the money to fix the major problems we have facing \nthe Nation every day or fighting a war that has achieved nothing for \nany of us? Could America have achieved more out of that money spending \nit on hospitals or lifesaving cancer research, schools and \nuniversities, food for the needy, roads, train tracks, bridges and \nairports, or the catastrophe that is the war in Iraq?\n  President Bush likes to use the line that ``we are fighting them over \nthere\n\n[[Page S13662]]\n\nso that we don't have to fight them here.'' I think Americans have \nfigured out that what he really means is we are spending all of our \nmoney over there, and therefore we have none to spend here.\n  I have already spoken out about the massive holes in our homeland \nsecurity that the war funding in Iraq could have closed being used here \nat home. I have spoken about the difference that funding could have \nmade for millions of Americans who have to play Russian roulette with \ntheir lives because they simply don't have health insurance, including \nmillions of children who would be covered under the bill which is \ncurrently before the Senate, a bill the President threatens once again \nto veto while asking for $200 billion more in war funds this year \nalone--funds which, by the way, he doesn't even pay for. He wants to \nmake his fiscal bones on the backs of children who have no health care \ncoverage. They are the most important asset we have in our Nation and \nalso the most fragile asset we have in our Nation. He says: Well, this \nbill is not fiscally acceptable. Yet he can, at the same time, send a \nrequest to us for $200 billion, which he doesn't pay for. Not only does \nhe not give children their health insurance, he adds a mountain of debt \non their backs for the future. That is totally irresponsible.\n\n  I have talked many times about children's health insurance. I note, \ntoo, as we move to this vote, I don't know why there are still some \nadvocating knocking parents off children's health insurance. Children \nand parents together successfully brought in more children to the \nprogram. Why is it that there are those Members of Congress who want to \npush more Americans into the vast number of the uninsured in this \ncountry? Because that is what they are advocating at the end of the \nday.\n  Today I wish to talk about what America would look like if we spent \nthe money George Bush is spending on failing to rebuild Iraq to repair \nour own battered infrastructure at home. Yes, we are spending a lot of \nmoney, billions of dollars in Iraq, with which we fail even to rebuild \nIraq. Not only are we failing to rebuild Iraq, we certainly do not have \nthe resources at home.\n  Is it the Iraq war or better transportation in our country? There is \nno way to put a price tag on the immense frustration we feel with our \nsystems of transportation. If you have ever slammed your hands on the \nsteering wheel because traffic is unbearable so you are going to miss \nyour meeting or be late to pick up your child at school, if you ever \nhad your train delayed or have been jammed inside a subway car that was \nnot built to carry the number of people who are stuffed in there, if \nyou have ever been stuck waiting in an airport terminal or trapped on a \nplane sitting on a tarmac waiting to take off hour after hour, then you \nknow our transportation systems are stretched to the limit, and \nsometimes they break.\n  Thirteen people paid the ultimate price and 100 more were injured at \nthe terrible, tragic collapse of the bridge in Minnesota a few months \nago. It is scary how easily that could happen again. Here is a truly \nshocking statistic. The number of bridges that are either structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete in this country is enormous. It is \nabout 160,000 bridges, 25 percent of all the bridges in the country. \nThat means if you have driven over four bridges, the odds are that one \nof them is not in particularly great shape, and that is incredibly \nscary.\n  What does it cost to stop another tragedy such as the one in \nMinneapolis from happening? The American Society of Civil Engineers \nestimates that the cost of maintaining and replacing obsolete or \ndeteriorating bridges is about $7.4 billion a year. That is the cost of \nstaying even, not allowing the overall quality of our bridges to \nfurther deteriorate.\n  If we spent on transportation what we spend on the Iraq war, we could \npay off the entire cost of what the Society of Civil Engineers \nestimates would be the cost of maintaining and replacing all those \nobsolete or deteriorating bridges in 22 days. We could take care of \nevery bridge in America and make everybody safer in 22 days for the \ncost of the war in Iraq--22 days. That is another example of what the \nwar costs: bridges you can feel confident about, that you will get home \nsafely to your family versus less than a month in Iraq.\n  Today construction is beginning on the Minneapolis bridge that will \nreplace the one that collapsed. The cost: $234 million. We spend that \nmoney in Iraq in less than 1 day.\n  Americans are also feeling the hassle of commuting by car or plane, \nespecially for long distances. Oil prices are hitting record highs. \nMany feel that petroleum production is reaching a peak. Burning oil \nthickens our air with smog and stokes the fires of the global climate \ncrisis, threatening to drown buildings on our coastlines under water \nand create massive droughts inland. If we don't create viable \ntransportation options that will end our dependence on oil, America is \ngoing to be in big trouble.\n  With all this in mind, yesterday the Senate passed a bill to boost \nfunding for Amtrak. We passed that bill so the great American \nrelationship with the railroad could be restored and brought to new \npeaks of excellence. Funding for the Amtrak bill will be $19.2 billion \nover 6 years. That money would make passenger transportation easier, it \nwould improve rail security, it would make our air cleaner, and it \nwould be a boost to the economy. But like every appropriations bill \nthat has come or is on its way to the President's desk under the \nDemocratic Congress, the administration has argued that we don't have \nmoney for good public transportation systems.\n  While President Bush's mouth is moving, his hand is signing checks \nfor other items. What the Amtrak bill would spend in 6 years, the \nPresident spends in Iraq in 2 months while we are trying to have a \nnational rail transportation system that gets sales forces from small \nand mid-size companies to work with intercity travel to sell their \nproducts or services, to get people to great institutions of research \nand also great institutions of healing and hospitals, to get people \nmaybe to the Nation's Capital or to other major cities along the \nNortheast corridor, to have the opportunity after a post-September 11 \nworld to understand that multiple modes of transportation are \ncritical--if we have a terrorist incident in one part of the country, \nwe can move people along, as on that fateful day. What was open for \nintercity travel when every airplane was grounded? It was Amtrak. Yet \nthe President says: Oh, no, I am going to veto that bill.\n  What we are going to spend in 6 years to make Amtrak a world-class \nrail system, the President spends in Iraq in under 2 months. That is \nwhat the war costs: vastly improved American railroads versus 2 months \nof bloody chaos in Iraq.\n  The costs of this war, in my mind, are unimaginable. The \nCongressional Budget Office put out a report projecting that the Iraq \nwar will cost, at the rate we are going, $1.9 trillion, nearly $2 \ntrillion. It is incredibly hard to put that money into perspective, but \nso we can get an idea of how vast that sum is, paving the entire \nInterstate Highway System over the course of 3\\1/2\\ decades only costs \n$425 billion. Some estimates say the Interstate Highway System returns \n$6 for every $1 we spend in economic opportunity and growth. The Iraq \nwar has returned zero dollars for every billion dollars spent.\n  So we can get an idea of how vast that sum is with the money spent in \nIraq, we could pave a four-lane American highway from Chicago to \nMilwaukee with an entire inch of solid gold. We could pave a four-lane \nAmerican highway from Chicago to Milwaukee with an entire inch of solid \ngold. And if you made the thickness less than an inch of solid gold, \nyou could easily gild a highway from sea to shining sea. That is what \nthe war costs. It costs so much, the amount of money starts to exceed \nwhat it would cost to pay even for our most ludicrous dreams.\n\n  We have to use our imaginations as to where that money could go \nbecause for a lot of it, we don't know where it is going. Billions of \ndollars have gone missing in Iraq. According to a report released by \nthe special inspector general for Iraq earlier this week, the rest has \nlargely failed to build Iraq's infrastructure. Meanwhile, \ninfrastructure in America still needs serious help. We don't have money \naccounted for in Iraq that we are sending to rebuild the Iraq \ninfrastructure. The rest that we do account for, the inspector general \nsays it\n\n[[Page S13663]]\n\nis largely failing to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, and we don't have \nthe resources to meet our challenges at home.\n  It is time for us to make a choice: Will we put this country on a \ntrack to recovery or watch it barrel down the rails to deterioration? \nWill we pave the highway to success for our people or leave that road \nto rust and rot? Will we watch our economy take off, the aspirations \nand dreams of our people soar to new heights, or will we ground our \nNation, leaving thousands to face the congestion that gridlocks so many \nforms of transportation in so many places, leaving thousands waiting in \nthe terminals of frustration, waiting for something to change, for \nsomething finally to change?\n  Thinking about our transportation needs is another way to think about \nwhat we want the United States of America to look like as a nation. As \nsomeone who travels quite a bit across the landscape of the country, I \nhave experienced all these frustrations with all of these different \nmodes of transportation. And transportation is about more than getting \nfrom one place to another. It is about economic opportunity and \ncommerce. It is about getting products to market. It is about getting \npeople to service. It is about getting people to important institutions \nso they can be healed. It is about creating economic opportunity. It is \nabout uniting families from coast to coast. It is about the quality of \nair and the environment we collectively enjoy by getting more people \nout of cars. It is about, by the same token, the opportunity to have \nmultiple modes of security. It has so many dimensions to it, but all \nthose dimensions go unresponded to because we are spending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on the war in Iraq.\n  Those needs are yet another reason it is time to end this war because \nwhen it comes to the failed war in Iraq, American families are being \ntaken for a ride.\n  It is time to soar again, it is time to reinforce with the strongest \niron and steel the bridges to safety and success, time to clear off the \nbarricades of the road to opportunity, time to put America on the \nhighest speed track we can, and to make sure we are always first in \nflight high above the clouds. Those goals are not imaginary or \nunattainable. They are very much within our reach. But for that, we \nhave to change the course in Iraq and invest in America at home.\n  I will continue to come to the floor to speak about different \ndimensions of the cost of this war in Iraq. It is a cost the American \npeople can no longer suffer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Michael Mukasey\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words this afternoon \non some of the issues with which the Senate is dealing.\n  Last week, I believe I was the first Member of the Senate to suggest \nvery strongly that Michael Mukasey should not become the next Attorney \nGeneral, and I am very pleased that in the last week, more and more of \nmy colleagues are coming to that same conclusion.\n  The Attorney General of the United States must be a defender of our \nconstitutional rights. Because President Bush thinks he can do whatever \nhe wants whenever he wants in the name of fighting terrorism, we need \nan Attorney General who can explain to the President what the \nConstitution of this country is all about. We need an Attorney General \nwho does not believe the President has unlimited power. We need an \nAttorney General who will tell President Bush he is not above the law. \nWe need an Attorney General who clearly understands the separation of \npowers inherent in our Constitution.\n  Regretfully, I have concluded that Michael Mukasey would not be that \nkind of Attorney General. I am gratified that more and more of my \ncolleagues are coming to that same conclusion.\n  Let me be very clear. It goes without saying that the U.S. Government \nmust do everything it can to protect the American people from the very \ndangerous threats of international terrorism, but we can do that in \nways that are effective and are consistent with the Constitution of our \ncountry and the civil liberties it guarantees. We do not have to give \nup our basic freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism.\n  The Bush administration and the lawyers who have enabled it for the \npast 7 years cannot be bothered, it appears, with such technical legal \nniceties as the Bill of Rights. This administration thinks it can \neavesdrop on telephone conversations without warrants, suspend due \nprocess for people classified as ``enemy combatants,'' and thumb its \nnose when Congress exercises its oversight responsibility. That is why \nI called on Roberto Gonzales to resign. I had hoped that the \nconfirmation process for a new Attorney General would give the \nPresident and the Senate an important opportunity to refocus on the \ncore American principles embodied in our Constitution.\n\n  Unfortunately, it appears Judge Mukasey doesn't get it. At his 2-day \nconfirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he \nsuggested that eavesdropping without warrants and using ``enhanced'' \ninterrogation techniques for terrorism suspects might be \nconstitutional, even if they exceeded what the law technically allowed. \nMr. Mukasey said Congress might not have the power to stop the \nPresident from conducting some surveillance without warrants. He even, \nincredibly, claimed to be unfamiliar with the technique known as \nwaterboarding.\n  ``If Judge Mukasey cannot say plainly that the President must obey a \nvalid statute, he ought not to be the Nation's next attorney general,'' \nwrote Jeb Rubenfeld, a professor of constitutional law at Yale Law \nSchool, who had appeared before Judge Mukasey as a prosecutor. And he \nhas that right. It has become an American aphorism that ours is a \ngovernment of laws, not men. We need an Attorney General who \nunderstands that so, unfortunately, he can explain it to a President \nwho does not.\n\n\n                            Control in Basra\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article that appeared in the Los Angeles Times today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 1, 2007]\n\n Britain To Hand Over Control in Basra--British Defense Secretary Says \n      Iraqis Are Ready To Address the South's Persistent Violence\n\n                     (By Doug Smith and Said Rifai)\n\n       Baghdad.--Saying that Iraqi forces are now capable of \n     dealing with the violence that persists in the south, \n     Britain's defense secretary said Wednesday that his \n     government intended to hand over security for the area by \n     mid-December.\n       Defense Secretary Des Browne acknowledged that sectarian \n     power struggles and gangsterism continue in oil-rich Basra \n     province, but said Iraqi forces were best able to address \n     them now.\n       Browne, who spoke to reporters in Baghdad a day after \n     reviewing the security situation in Basra, said he saw \n     increasing evidence that Iraqi security forces, particularly \n     the army but increasingly the police as well, were improving \n     in their response to the infighting and violence.\n       ``Unequivocally. I can see progress,'' Browne said.\n       British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced last month \n     that his government, the main U.S. foreign partner in Iraq, \n     would pull out half its remaining troops by June, leaving \n     2,500 soldiers stationed outside Basra.\n       Browne said that contingent would be adequate to fulfill \n     its primary responsibility of guarding the lone British base \n     and would be capable of providing support to Iraqi forces.\n       In meetings with Iraqi officials Wednesday, Browne pledged \n     Britain's continuing assistance in the economic development \n     of the south.\n       Also Wednesday, Iraq's foreign minister said Baghdad was \n     holding indirect talks with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or \n     PKK, that would soon lead to the release of several Turkish \n     soldiers the group seized in recent border clashes with \n     Turkey. The PKK, fighting for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey, \n     has bases in the far north of Iraq.\n       Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, an ethnic Kurd, made \n     the comments after conferring with Iranian Foreign Minister \n     Manouchehr Mottaki before this weekend's regional security \n     conference in Istanbul.\n       In contrast to the tension surrounding a visit to Baghdad \n     by Turkey's foreign minister, Ali Babacan, the atmosphere was \n     cordial at a joint appearance after their talks. Both \n     diplomats said the border disputes between Turkey and the PKK \n     should not be allowed to destabilize the region.\n       Meanwhile, a car bomb exploded in the Alawi neighborhood \n     near Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, killing one person and \n     injuring four. The bodies of six unidentified victims of \n     violence were found in the capital.\n       In the north, a policeman was killed and two others injured \n     in an attack on a checkpoint about 12 miles south of the city \n     of Kirkuk, police Brig. Gen. Sarhad Qadir said.\n\n[[Page S13664]]\n\n       Iwo Iraqi army soldiers were killed in Tuz Khumatu, 110 \n     miles north of Baghdad, when a bomb went off under their \n     patrol vehicle, Qadir said.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, what that article talks about is the fact \nthat every day our main ally in Iraq, the United Kingdom, is \nwithdrawing more and more of its troops. In the first paragraph of the \narticle in the L.A. Times today, it states:\n\n       Saying that Iraqi forces are now capable of dealing with \n     the violence that persists in the south, Britain's Defense \n     Secretary said Wednesday that his government intended to hand \n     over security for the area by mid December.\n\n  And later on in the article it says:\n\n       British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced last month \n     that his government, the main U.S. foreign partner in Iraq, \n     would pull out half its remaining troops by June, leaving \n     2,500 soldiers stationed outside Basra.\n\n  In other words, it is the United States of America, more or less \nalone, that is continuing this war in Iraq. We have some 140,000 \nsoldiers in Iraq. There are tens and tens of thousands of private \ncontractors in Iraq. It seems to me time is long overdue for us to \nlearn from our ally, the United Kingdom, that we have to begin bringing \nhome our troops, as they are, as soon as we possibly can.\n  Senator Menendez made the case, I thought very impressively, about \nwhat this war is costing us in terms of human life, what it is costing \nus in terms of the tens of thousands of soldiers who are going to \nreturn home with traumatic brain injury, with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, without arms and without legs. This war has cost the Iraqi \npeople almost beyond comprehension. No one knows exactly how many \nhundreds of thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children are dead, but \nthere are estimates that go way up to close to 1 million. There are 2 \nmillion Iraqis who have been forced to flee their own country, and \nthere are 2 million who have been displaced internally who have had to \nleave their homes because of ethnic cleansing and because of the \nviolence that existed in their neighborhoods.\n  This war has resulted, tragically, in the standing of the United \nStates of America being diminished all over the world. Some of us \nremember years back, when a President of the United States would go to \nEurope, would go abroad, and hundreds of thousands of people, if not \nmillions of people, would be lining streets with American flags, \nlooking up to Americans saying: America, you are the kind of country we \nwant to be. Now, when this President goes abroad, there are thousands \nand thousands of people who are coming out, but invariably they are \ndemonstrating against the United States.\n  What poll after poll shows, to our great loss, to our capability in \nfighting international terrorism, is we have lost the moral high \nground; that our standing throughout the world is significantly \ndiminished. And certainly one of the challenges we face as a Senate is \nto restore the confidence the entire world used to have in the United \nStates and restore that once again, so when our kids go visit in Europe \nand somebody says to them: What country do you come from, they do not \nhave to say they come from Canada. They can say proudly they come from \nthe United States of America, a country that, once again, we hope, will \nbe respected throughout the entire world.\n  I hope very much we will follow the lead of our friends in the United \nKingdom, who are now down to 2,500 troops. I suspect in the not-too-\ndistant future those troops will probably be withdrawn. We should be \nbringing our troops home as soon as we possibly can.\n\n\n                           Abolishing Hunger\n\n  The last point I wish to make is that fairly soon, as I understand \nit, the agriculture bill will come to the floor of the Senate. In that \nbill, I think under Senator Harkin's leadership, there have been some \nvery positive changes being made. But I think, because of the lack of \nfunding, that bill does not go anywhere near as far as it should in \naddressing some of the very serious problems we face in our country in \nterms of nutrition and in terms of hunger.\n  At the same time this country is spending $10 billion a month on the \nwar in Iraq, it has the dubious distinction of having, by far, the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, with \nalmost one-fifth--almost one out of five--of the kids in this country \nliving in poverty. Compare that with Scandinavia, where it is maybe 3 \npercent or 4 percent. And the rate of poverty in America is growing.\n  Last year, as you may recall, the Department of Agriculture, in the \nmidst of this increase in poverty in our country, reported that 12 \npercent of Americans--35 million people--could not put food on their \ntable at least part of the year. Thirty-five million of our fellow \nAmericans could not put food on the table for at least part of the \nyear. That is not what should be happening in our country.\n  When the Senate deals with the agriculture bill, I will be offering \nan amendment which will ask for a commitment from the Senate that says, \nat a time when the wealthiest people are becoming wealthier, when the \npoorest are becoming poorer, when hunger in America is increasing, this \nSenate, this Congress will make a moral commitment to abolish hunger in \nthis country in the next 5 years. That is not asking too much for our \ncountry.\n  We have to fundamentally change the priorities of our Nation. When \nbillionaires want tax breaks, we have money for them. We have money for \nwar. But when children go hungry, I guess there is no money available. \nSo I look forward to working with my colleagues to change the \npriorities of this Senate so we start paying attention to the vast \nmajority of our people rather than the few and the wealthy who have so \nmuch power.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in a little over 2 hours, we are going to be \nhaving two votes on this floor. Under rules of the Senate, technically, \nthe time is reserved for the debate on that, so I thought I ought to \ncome to the floor and assure people that vote isn't going to be on the \nAttorney General and it is not going to be on the farm bill. It is \ngoing to be about health.\n  I thought somebody probably ought to come and talk a little about \nhealth, so I am going to do that. Yesterday, we voted to invoke cloture \non the motion to proceed to H.R. 3963, which is the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, or what folks on Capitol Hill are calling \nSCHIP. Now, I spoke on the floor last night about how this so-called \nnew bill isn't new at all. It is about the same old flawed plan, only \nwith new rhetoric.\n  I had a lot of hope for what was going to happen because both sides \nwere talking. They were looking at some of the proposals I and others \nhad made, and I even thought the House was going to have those included \nin their bill. When it went to the floor, it turned out to be kind of \nthe same old thing again, with new sound bites and political posturing. \nThat isn't what it is supposed to be about. We are supposed to be \nmaking decisions on health for the children of this country and, \nhopefully, for every American. But we choose to make political points, \nwhich holds up the system and doesn't get the job done.\n  With those new sound bites and political posturing, we are not \nensuring that low-income children have the health care they need. We \nowe it to these children to work with the President to reauthorize this \ncritical program in a way that gets every single low-income child who \nneeds insurance. This body hasn't been able to do that, and we have \nbeen working on this bill for many months. I know if it were not for \npolitics, this bill would have been done weeks ago. Actually, it would \nhave been done months ago.\n  The longer we work on this issue, the more political it becomes, to \nthe point where we don't even debate it any more. We wait for the votes \nto roll around and we talk about Attorneys General and farm bills and \nthe war and we avoid the issue we ought to be talking about, which is \nhow to come together to take care of children's health.\n  Now, I worry that some Members in this Chamber have lost sight of the \ngoal, and that goal was making sure all low-income children in this \ncountry have health care. The press has been reporting, and some \nMembers of this body have claimed, all concerns were addressed in the \nlast version of the bill that the House voted on last week--the one \nthat is before us now--but that is\n\n[[Page S13665]]\n\nnot correct. The concerns weren't addressed. We have to put low-income \nkids first, and this bill doesn't do that.\n  Now, I detailed in my speech last night the concerns I have with this \nbill. I also mentioned I am a cosponsor of the Kids First Act, S. 2152, \nthe bill that would provide Federal funding for children in need and \nrequire that the money actually be spent on children from families with \nlower incomes. This bill is a good step in the direction of compromise, \nand I hope the majority will see that and start working with the \nminority to pass something the President can sign, rather than \ncontinuing to play politics.\n  I would suggest the politics haven't worked. I noticed when it went \nto the floor on the House side there were more people opposed to this \nversion than there were to the previous version. I noticed on the \ncloture vote there were more people opposed to this version than there \nwere to the last version. That doesn't sound like progress to me; that \nsounds like more of the same, where it allows people to run political \nads one way or the other against people. That is not what we are \nsupposed to be about.\n  SCHIP is important, and I wish to be crystal clear about my position: \nI support the SCHIP program 1,000 percent; that is, the SCHIP program \nwe can have, not the one that one side or the other is trying to force \ndown the throat saying we are doing it for kids. But more than that, it \nis important this body be thinking bigger. We need to think bigger \nabout fixing the entire health care system and helping all Americans.\n  I do have a bill that does just that. It is not my bill; it is our \nbill. I spent months collecting ideas from both sides of the aisle. I \nhave looked at every health care provision that anybody has to see if \nthere is not some common ground--and there is. There is. I don't have \neverything in this because I found that legislation works best if it is \nevolutionary, not revolutionary. You have to take steps to get from \nhere to there. But if you take steps and you get started with a step, \nyou can actually wind up at your destination. So I put together a bill \non behalf of everybody which can do just that--one part of it or all of \nit; it doesn't matter. For the next few minutes, I would like to \nexplain my plan to this body.\n  When our constituents look off to the distance, they do see dark \nclouds and an explosion of health care costs, and they see it rapidly \ndrifting across the country. I know this from the town meetings I have \nbeen having. I mention that again. Every day many of our constituents \nare going to jobs they do not like, but they are afraid that if they \nchange, the change in employment will mean their loved ones will lose \ntheir health insurance and they will face a future without the \nprotection a good policy affords. They cannot change from one job to \nanother because a family member would have preexisting conditions that \nwould not be covered at the next one. That is not fair.\n  How do I know these things are happening? I know because I go home \nalmost every weekend. I travel around Wyoming. It is a very big State. \nI hope all of you will take a look at that. It has a very small \npopulation. But I get to talk to almost all of my constituents. I do \nthat partly at town meetings and partly at individual meetings. I also \nread their letters. I listen to them at all kinds of events when I am \nback home. I know they are telling me these things. I can also tell \nthat they are telling me the same things. Why aren't we listening? Why \nare we taking so much time to finally do something about it?\n  When we are home, one thing we all like to do is visit our local \nvideo store. They have a lot of movies we can listen to and watch in \nthe quiet and comfort of our own home. There are different sections for \neach category, and we can help ourselves to the latest in action or \ndrama or comedy. If health care were a new release and you wanted to \ncheck it out at your local video store, you certainly wouldn't find it \nunder ``action'' because there hasn't been any. You wouldn't find it \nunder ``comedy'' either, because there is more tragedy than there is \ncomedy in this whole thing. Most likely you would find it under \n``horror,'' ``science fiction,'' or ``fantasy.'' Unfortunately, I am \nnot talking about movies and the land of make-believe; I am talking \nabout real life and the need for real action to solve real problems.\n  Take the fact that health care is one of the biggest concerns of \nevery American. Combine that with the fact that those who were elected \nand are now in charge have refused to put forth for debate a \nsubstantial proposal that has a real shot at working. There is already \ntalk among top Democrats that next year will be the health care year. \nIt is funny how it always seems to be that when Congress is faced with \na heavy lift, it starts talking about next year--as if that is the \npresent tense.\n  What do you have? You have the answer to why Congress's approval \nratings are so low. The solution is clear: The best way to solve \nsagging poll numbers is to actually do something, stop playing around \non the fringe of the issue and get right to the heart of the matter. \nOur friends on the other side of the aisle know what they should do, \nbut what are they waiting for? We need to do what the American people \nsay they want us most to do. And then--this is the real rub--they want \nus to work together and avoid the partisan fear that we might have to \nshare the credit. I have always believed you can get anything done if \nyou don't care who gets the credit, and that is the path we ought to be \ntaking. We have a real opportunity to do something now, to get \nlegislation passed that will mean real solutions for our constituents.\n  I have collected this plan. Over the next few months, I will share \neach step with my colleagues, as I have been doing, and would remind \nyou that the longest journey in the world begins with a single step, \nand I am willing to take the first ones. If anyone has a better idea, I \nam more than willing to put our ideas together until we have something \nwe can all accept.\n  I know from other pieces of legislation that I have worked on that is \nthe only way to get something done. We can agree on a lot. We can agree \non about 80 percent of all of the issues. Health care is one of the \nissues on which we can agree. I found on any particular issue you can \nusually agree on 80 percent of it. Eighty percent would be a lot more \nthan what we have now. It is that pesky 20 percent that always proves \nto be a problem. Sometimes you get things done by what you leave out.\n  When I mention 10 steps that would get us to this goal--if we only do \n8 of them, it is still a lot of health care for people. If we do all 10 \nof them, it is a solution. If we concentrate on that 80 percent, we can \nget something done right away to make our health care system better, \nsafer, more efficient, and less expensive. We owe it to our mothers, \nfathers, sisters, children everywhere to take those steps. One by one, \nwe can get where we need to be.\n  I think we have all had enough of the ``rush and whine'' bottle of \nlegislating, the ones who rush out from a meeting to hold a press \nconference so they can whine about a problem. That approach generates a \nlot of noise, but it has never resulted in action.\n  We need to work together, the majority and the minority, to build a \nlegacy our children and our grandchildren will benefit from, a fair and \neffective health care system that will ensure more Americans have \naccess to the health care they need to lead full and productive lives \nand that those who have it will not lose it.\n  Forget there is an election coming up for just a few seconds. That, \ntechnically, is next November, not this November. That should give us a \nlittle bit of time to work on something. But I do know that election \nfor some of us is a barrier to progress. Let's not let it be that way. \nThere is plenty of room for agreement. We do not need a massive bill, \njust a genuine effort to work together. We do not need a new big \nGovernment bureaucracy. We do not need to bankrupt the country. It is \nnot rocket science. We can do it a single step at a time, and I am \ndiscouraged that those in charge have not put a single step into play. \nBut I am hopeful that this call to arms--actually, it is a call to work \ntogether as comrades in arms--will remind us all that we need to do \nsomething about this issue now. Election year politicking should not \nstand in the way of real reform for health care. There is much we can \ndo today that will give people the confidence they need in their \nability to face the challenges of tomorrow. What we can do right now \ncan help people improve their health coverage for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S13666]]\n\n  All I ask is that you walk with me as we take the steps that are \nneeded to solve this problem. I call it a 10-step approach, and it \nwould bring clarity to our health insurance maze and put the focus \nwhere it belongs--on patients. Enacting one of the 10 steps would keep \nour health insurance system strong and off life support for awhile.\n  The first step gives small businesses greater purchasing power to \nreduce the costs of insurance plans. Those of you who know me will \nrecognize how central this would have to be to any health care reform \nproposal of mine. The Chair and I have worked together to bring \ntogether an idea that had failed for 12 years because people would not \ncompromise. We worked with all of the stakeholders--which are the \nproviders and the patients and the insurance companies and the \ninsurance commissioners and anybody else with an interest in \ninsurance--and we put together a plan that would effectively allow \nsmall businesses to work across State lines to combine to get a big \nenough pool that they could effectively negotiate with the insurance \ncompanies. That still needs to be done. It is still a key to getting \nmore people insured and seeing that people who have insurance get to \nkeep their insurance. In administrative costs alone, it could drive the \nprice down by 23 percent. That is a huge savings for small businesses. \nIt would bring many small businesses back into the market. We need to \ndo that.\n  A second step focuses our investment on health information technology \nto cut costs and to save lives. Mr. President, 100,000 Americans die \nevery year because of medical errors that result from messy handwriting \nand mixups with drugs and treatment. The Senate needs real leadership \nto bring the health industry into the 21st century. Electronic access \nto health records could save billions of dollars and save thousands of \nlives.\n  People's health records should travel with them so they can share \nthem with their doctors. Informed decisions are better decisions, and \npatient access to their records can help their doctors do a better job \nof making sure the patients get the care they need without duplicate \ntesting. How many people have been to the doctor's office and when you \nget there, what they do is hand you a clipboard and they say: Write \ndown everything you can remember about your health. I used to be able \nto remember a lot more about my health than I can because I had more of \nit. But it would really be helpful just to have a little card I can \nhand them and say: Here, swipe that through your computer, and I will \nput in a code that will release some of the information. And when I get \na test done at a hospital and then go to the doctor, the doctor won't \nsay: It hasn't gotten here yet, so we are going to have to run the test \nagain. Some of those test are $5,000, $10,000--duplicative. But it will \nbe on the little card, you have it right there, you have the \ninformation, and you can use it. The Rand Corporation estimates those \nduplicative tests are costing us $140 billion a year. That is real \nmoney, in my book. So an electronic record would go a long way toward \neliminating the problems caused by a prescription that can't be read or \na drug interaction that could be dangerous or duplicative tests.\n  The next step would be to correct a flawed Tax Code to make it easier \nfor working Americans to buy health insurance. Jobs don't need health \ninsurance; people need health insurance. Members of American families \nwho are not insured through their employers should have the same access \nto care. They should have the same access to the Tax Code. We want \nhealth care fairness, even if you don't work for a big company. We \ncould do that.\n  Other steps will fix the medical justice system to cut down on the \njunk lawsuits that are driving up health care costs. The medical \nliability system in this country does not work the way it should. The \n10 steps would include a mechanism to promote real medical justice \nreform that will focus on helping both patients and doctors, not trial \nlawyers. We want medical justice so the people who are injured get paid \nquickly and fairly, so we are not spending more in preventing lawsuits \nthan we are in preventing illnesses.\n  I have to say, Senator Baucus has been working with me on that bill. \nWe have introduced a bill that can do exactly that. It will be \nbipartisan. It can be more bipartisan. We need more people to help out.\n  Americans should not have to live in fear that if they change jobs \nthey will lose health insurance. This 10-step bill will give them \nsecurity in their health insurance. When you change jobs, you will be \nable to take your health care with you. You will not have to worry \nabout the insurance company saying: That already existed before you \nbought our insurance, so that is going to be a surprise discovery, that \nit was a previous ailment, and we are not going to cover it.\n  We don't want that to happen. The system we have today is not about \npatients and making them healthy. We need to put the focus back on \nhealth care, not sick care.\n  We also need to set our sights on prevention. Ben Franklin said it \nbest:\n\n       An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\n  Those are a few of the things we can do now. I hope you will check \nout my Web site, where I have a lot more detail on this plan that I \nhave collected from everybody, everybody who is interested in it. Check \nout that Web site and join me in getting something done in health care \nfor every American. It is not a big concept, but it can be a big \nimprovement.\n  I encourage others to bring their ideas out for discussion. I never \nconsider anything I have collected or worked on to be the final answer. \nThe way I get legislation done around here is to listen to all of the \ndifferent proposals, see what works together, and out of that usually \nsprings some surprise inventions, new ways of doing it that reach the \ngoal we are looking at. That is where we are trying to go.\n  Our constituents are not asking for more politicking. They consider \nhealth to be a real problem.\n  They want a real answer, so we can bring the focus back to health \ncare and not ``sick'' care. We all know what we should be doing in our \nown lives to help prevent chronic illness so we can stay strong and \nhealthy. When it comes to health care, it is clear there is a lot that \nshould be happening but is not. We need to replace those ``shoulds'' \nwith a simple word ``will.'' We need to replace the call to do \nsomething from ``next year'' to ``now.''\n  Those changes should happen, and we can make them happen. It is a \nsimple thing. We just need the will to do it. We need to take the \npolitics out of it. I know this is a political body, but we have done \nmuch in the past that was not based on politics. It was based on \nsolutions for America. And that is the only way the people of this \ncountry are going to have confidence in Congress again.\n  We can do it. We can do it one step at a time but only if we work \ntogether. We have done it. We did it on the mine safety bill a little \nover a year ago. It used to take about 6 years to get a bill through. \nWe did it in 6 weeks because people listened, found out what the \nproblem was, and put down solutions.\n  No, it did not solve every problem, but at least it is 80 percent \nbetter than it was. Eighty percent is better than nothing. We can reach \nsolutions but only if we listen to each other, find the 80 percent, and \nbe willing to throw out the other 20 percent.\n  I thought we were at that point on SCHIP. I was disappointed that we \nwent pretty much back to the same old story again because it evidently \nmakes good ads because, as I mentioned before, the number in the House \nwho voted for it was fewer, and the number of people in the Senate who \nvoted for it was fewer. So we are not there. I hope we do something \nthat gets us there, not just for the children but for everybody.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nSCHIP bill, but also to say we should not be voting on this legislation \nright now. This is a time and an issue on which our bipartisan \nCongress, with a bipartisan consensus, can sit down with the\n\n[[Page S13667]]\n\nPresident and his staff and come to a conclusion that will continue a \nprogram that has been very effective. However, that is not what we are \nfaced with today. Today we are faced with voting on the exact same \nbill--not the exact same bill, almost the exact same bill--that we \nvoted on and the President vetoed only 2 weeks ago.\n  Now, I voted for the first bill. I think it was a good bill. It had \nmany good features. But I expected, when the President's veto was \nsustained in the House, the House leadership would take a step back, \nmeet with the President's staff, work something out, and go forward \nwith something new--a new try.\n  That is not what we have in this bill before us. That is why I voted \nagainst the motion to proceed. I believe we needed more time to craft a \nbill that would be more acceptable to the President and could have the \nbipartisan consensus to pass and go to the President for signature. \nThat is not what happened.\n  Instead, the House turned around and very shortly passed almost the \nsame bill. Eighteen Republicans voted for virtually this bill. We also \nsigned a letter saying to our Senate and House leadership: Please work \nwith the President to come up with a compromise.\n  The President has said he would like a compromise. He has said he \nwould like to move forward. I think there is a very strong middle \nground because the bill that is before us is a vast step beyond the \nprogram as it has been in place, and I think we could still do a lot \nmore coverage. We could cover more children; we could cover more \nfamilies with a bill that is not quite as far reaching as the one that \nis before us today. Even though I support the one that is before us \ntoday--and I will continue to do so--I do want a good-faith effort to \ncome to a compromise that everyone can support.\n  The bill does continue the program we have started. It provides, \ntoday, insurance for over 300,000 children in Texas. It also includes \nan important provision that protects Texas's ability to cover more \nchildren with health insurance. During the SCHIP debate, I worked with \nmembers of the Senate Finance Committee to ensure the legislative \nchanges did not harm Texas's ability to fund the program, and we were \nsuccessful. That language was in the original bill, and it is in the \nbill that is before us today.\n  However, I do think it is important we move forward in a way that \nwill achieve success. I want to make sure a fast-growing State such as \nTexas does not lose the money it does not use in any 1 year in the next \nyear and the following year. That was my concern because many of the \nfast-growing States do not use their money this year, but they will \nneed it next year or the year after because there is a stronger effort \nto sign up the children who are eligible. That was accomplished in this \nbill. That is one of the key reasons I support it because I do think it \nis an efficient use of our taxpayer dollars to cover children so they \nare not going to be more seriously ill because they have not had the \npreventive medicine that coverage in Medicaid or SCHIP--which is the \nnext step above Medicaid--can provide. That is a worthy goal for our \nCongress.\n  I am going to vote for the bill today. But I do hope this signal is \nheard; that is, we would ask the leadership in the House and the \nleadership in the Senate to sit down with the President's staff to work \nout an agreement where we can all support this bill that will continue \nthe very important mission of SCHIP to give a safety net to children \nwho are above the Medicaid level but still 200 percent or 300 percent \nat most above poverty and give them an opportunity.\n  I think some of what has been talked about as compromise is quite \ngood, quite sound, quite creative, such as you go to 250 percent above \nthe poverty level, but between 250 percent and 350 percent you give tax \ncredits for families to cover themselves with private insurance. You \nhelp them. You subsidize their ability to stay in the private market.\n  We do not want a big government program. We do want to cover SCHIP \nand Medicaid through government auspices, but we want to not supplant \nthe private insurance that many people in the 250 percent to 350 \npercent above poverty level already have access to. But if those people \nwho do have access to health care because they work in a company that \nprovides this opportunity choose not to take it because they are going \nto get a free government program, that does not do anyone any good. It \nis not going to increase the number of children who are covered by \ninsurance because they would have given up health insurance in order to \ngo on a government program. That is not what we are after. We are after \nincreasing the number of children covered. We are after, also, keeping \nthe basis of our private health insurance healthy in our country.\n  So, Madam President, I thank you for allowing this debate to go \nforward. I thought we should have negotiated a little longer, but we \nare not. So we are now going to have cloture on the bill itself. I will \nsupport that cloture, and I will support the bill. But I do not want \nthe same bill to come back a third time. I expect sincerity on the part \nof Congress and the President to come forward with something new that \nwould be closer to a bipartisan agreement where we can all declare \nsuccess, and the beneficiaries of this success will be the poorer \nchildren of our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I was looking at the most recent public opinion \npolls on the Congress, and let me report what they say. It says just 16 \npercent of likely voters think Congress is doing an ``excellent'' job \nor a ``good'' job, while 36 percent are willing to call the \nlegislature's performance ``fair.'' A plurality of 47 percent say \nCongress is doing a ``poor'' job.\n  Now, I do not know about you, but if my kids brought home a report \ncard that said only 16 percent of their work was either ``excellent'' \nor ``good,'' 36 percent ``fair,'' and 47 percent ``poor,'' I think \nthere would be a little trouble at home until we got their priorities \nstraightened out.\n  This Congress, this Senate, has lost a sense of its priorities. Our \npriorities should be working together across the aisle to try to solve \nour Nation's challenges. That is the reason I came to the Senate. I \nhonestly believe regardless of whether we call ourselves Republicans or \nDemocrats or Independents, that is what motivated virtually every \nMember of Congress to come here: to try to do something for our \nconstituents, for our States, for our Nation, and for our future.\n  But, unfortunately--I do not know whether it is the water we drink in \nWashington, DC, or somehow just the environment we encounter here--once \npeople come to Washington they seem to get locked into these partisan \nbattles and lose sight of that objective, which is to do something good \nfor the American people, to help them solve some of their problems, to \ndeliver results. I know many of our colleagues--whether they are \nRepublicans or Democrats--are frustrated by our inability to do that.\n\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we have weekly meetings, bipartisan \nmeetings, trying to figure out--it is almost like group therapy \nsessions: How can we get out of the rut we are in? How can we solve \nsome of the problems that confront us? But here we are again. My \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Texas, talked about her concerns \nthat the SCHIP debate--the State Children's Health Insurance Program \ndebate--had become not a problem to be solved but, rather, a political \nfootball.\n  I am afraid I have to agree with her that we have been through this \ndebate over the last few weeks, and nothing--not even the rhetoric--has \nchanged. It seems as if all we have had is people dusting off their old \nspeeches they delivered a few days or a few weeks ago, and not \nlistening to one another, not actually rolling up their sleeves and \ngetting to work to try to resolve the differences.\n  The truth is, as we have said over and over again, what is wrong with \nthis bill is we simply do not seem to have a consensus that we ought to \nenact a solution. The fact is, we know there is bipartisan agreement \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program--designed to help low-\nincome kids whose\n\n[[Page S13668]]\n\nfamilies make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to \nbuy private health insurance--that they need a little help in order to \nget access to good quality health care. There is broad bipartisan, \nperhaps unanimous, agreement we ought to get that done.\n  But, unfortunately, what we have seen is a program proposed that \nlittle resembles the original program, which was designed to help low-\nincome kids. We see a bill that has grown by 140 percent, a $35 billion \ntax increase in order to cover who? Low-income kids? Well, no. In 14 \nStates we know it is used to cover adults. We know proposals had \ninitially been made that would have allowed waivers to be used to cover \nfamilies making up to $80,000 and more--bearing little resemblance to \nits original goal.\n  Now we see a new bill that is before the Senate that represents the \nold bill except--if this is possible--it is even worse. It is amazing \nto me the authors of this new bill would come back with this so-called \ncompromise, spending $500 million more than the last bill, yet covering \n400,000 fewer children. You heard me correctly--spending almost a half \nbillion dollars more and covering 400,000 less children. And, still, \ndespite my pleas and the pleas of many of our colleagues to the \ncontrary, this bill does not put the health and welfare of the lowest \nincome children first.\n  I have said it time and time again, but let me say it one more time: \nRight now, in my home State of Texas, there are roughly 700,000 \nuninsured low-income children who qualify for Medicaid, who qualify for \nthe SCHIP program, but we have not made the effort to reach out to them \nto get them to sign up for a benefit for which they are already legally \nqualified and for which there are funds already available to pay for \ntheir health care.\n  These 700,000 children in Texas who qualify for SCHIP or the Medicaid \nProgram do not know about the programs or do not know how to apply. I \nhave to tell you, I was recently in Houston, TX, at a place called the \nRipley House, which is a neighborhood program run by the Texas \nChildren's Hospital, where I saw a copy of the application form for \nMedicaid and SCHIP. It reminded me of a financial statement that a \nbusiness man or woman would have to fill out in order to apply for a \nline of credit or even maybe a financial application you would have to \nfill out to buy a home. It was enormously complicated and, I am sure, \nintimidating to many low-income parents who would like to sign up their \nchildren.\n  But we have to refocus our efforts not on growing the size of the \nprogram beyond recognition to cover the middle class and to cover \nadults; we need to return our focus to low-income kids and figure out \nhow we can get those families who are the intended beneficiaries of \nthis program signed up on the program so we can get more kids out of \nthe emergency rooms and on to some form of health insurance which will \nallow them to get preventive care and to keep them healthy and \nproductive as young Americans. But here we go again. Here we go again. \nWe are going to have another meaningless vote in the sense that while \nit no doubt will pass, the President said he is going to veto it, and \nwe will be right back in the soup again. The second veto, roughly the \nsame bill, except for the fact that this bill spends more money, covers \nfewer kids, and we are not solving the problems the American people \nsent us here to solve.\n\n  I think it is regrettable. It is not why I came here, and I doubt it \nis the reason why the vast majority of our colleagues come here. But \nhere we are stuck in a rut again, playing the same sort of political \ngames, more concerned about scoring points on some imaginary \nscoreboard, according to arbitrary rules that nobody knows, other than \nit seems like these poor, low-income kids are the ones who are losing \nin the end.\n\n\n                           Mukasey Nomination\n\n  I also come to the floor to talk about another disappointment I have \nwith regard to the confirmation proceedings of the new nominee for \nAttorney General of the United States, Judge Michael Mukasey. I serve \nas a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I am grateful to \nChairman Leahy that on Tuesday we will finally have this nomination on \nthe Judiciary Committee markup so we can vote up or down in the \nJudiciary Committee on this nominee. But it seems that Judge Mukasey--\njust when we thought, here is somebody who is a respected Federal \ndistrict judge and who has served with great distinction in that \ncapacity, who has been the presiding judge of both the Jose Padilla \ncase--do my colleagues remember that? He was an individual accused of \nterrorism and where there were many extensive legal challenges to his \ndetention. Judge Mukasey handled that case, at least in part. He also \ntried and presided over the 10 individuals who were convicted for their \ninvolvement in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, one of the \nfirst incidents of terrorism on our soil back in 1993, before we \nrealized al-Qaida had declared war against the United States and we \nfinally woke up on September 11 and acknowledged that.\n  But throughout his career as a judge, Judge Mukasey has proven to be \nan independent voice of reason, justice, and a strong advocate for the \nU.S. Constitution and the rule of law. For 18 years, he served on the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, one of this \ncountry's most important and prestigious Federal courts. For 6 of those \nyears, he served also as the chief judge.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, wrote of Judge Mukasey's \nwork presiding over the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, saying that \nhe:\n\n       Presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring \n     fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and \n     helpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement \n     in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured \n     by a trial judge.\n\n  In short, Judge Mukasey's qualifications as a lawyer, as a judge, as \na dedicated advocate for the rule of law are unimpeachable and \nundeniable.\n  Well, it looked like things were going pretty well. There were 2 days \nof hearings for Judge Mukasey in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge \nMukasey was doing well when he said: You know what. I am not afraid to \ntell the President of the United States when he steps over the line and \nviolates the law. If that were to happen, he said, it is my job as \nAttorney General to tell him: Here are the parameters for your actions, \nMr. President, and you, just like the lowest of the low, the highest of \nthe high, are subject to the law of the United States under the \nConstitution. Believing as he does in the concept of equal justice \nunder the law, Judge Mukasey showed no fear and no favor in terms of \nthe way he would interpret and apply the law were he confirmed as \nAttorney General.\n  But now we see some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have \nsent Judge Mukasey a letter asking him about his legal conclusion and \nopinion about an interrogation technique that is allegedly used against \nsome of the worst enemies of the United States--terrorists--in order to \nget information from them--consistent with our laws and the \nConstitution and our treaty obligations--that will allow us to save \nAmerican lives and prevent future terrorist attacks. They complain \nabout Judge Mukasey's answer, not because he doesn't acknowledge what \nthe law is--our international treaties banning torture, our domestic \nlaws that ban torture--but because, he says: I have not been briefed on \nthis particular interrogation technique that you are asking me about, \nand because it is a classified procedure, I don't know the facts. So \nlet me tell you what the law is. Let me reassure you I will steadfastly \nenforce the law. I don't care whether it is the President of the United \nStates I have to tell no or anybody else. But you know what. Being a \nresponsible lawyer, being a responsible former Federal district judge, \nlet me say that while I can tell you what the law is, I can't give you \na conclusion that you are asking for as to whether this particular \ntechnique is legal or not because I haven't been briefed on it. I don't \nknow what the facts are.\n  Now, that is a responsible answer. As a matter of fact, that is the \nonly responsible answer for a careful lawyer, a judge such as Judge \nMukasey. Frankly, if he had answered the question without knowing what \nthe facts were in some conclusive way, I would doubt his qualifications \nand his temperament. I would wonder: Maybe this person wants to be \nAttorney General too badly, that he is willing to make rash decisions \nwithout knowing what the facts are in order to get confirmed. But\n\n[[Page S13669]]\n\ninstead, Judge Mukasey said: You know, I need to know what the facts \nare. I can't answer your question conclusively, even though I reassure \nyou I will steadfastly enforce the law. I oppose torture as abhorrent \nto our values, personally repugnant to me. I would tell the President \nof the United States, if I concluded that some particular interrogation \ntechnique stepped across that legal threshold.\n  Once again, we find the facts apparently don't matter, that this \nresponsible answer which Judge Mukasey has given has been offered as a \npretext to oppose his nomination. I think it is a shame.\n  As the New York Times today reported, if Judge Mukasey, who I am \nconfident will ultimately be confirmed as the next Attorney General of \nthe United States, were to say--Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if, as the New York Times reported \ntoday, Judge Mukasey were to state a conclusive opinion on the legality \nof certain interrogation techniques which he has not been briefed upon, \nit would potentially prejudice and put in jeopardy intelligence \nofficials who may have engaged in interrogation techniques that now, \nwithout knowing the facts, this nominee would conclude had stepped \nacross a legal threshold. That would not be the responsible thing to \ndo. Indeed, Judge Mukasey has done the only responsible thing a careful \nperson and a person who understands the ramifications of his decision \nmay extend far beyond a confirmation hearing and potentially put in \njeopardy America's patriots who are trying to protect and save the \nlives of other Americans and other people around the world.\n  So I hope we would try to do better. I hope we would do what we all \ncame here to do as Senators representing our States and try to solve \nreal problems, not to create artificial barriers and pretexts for \nmaking what turn out to be naked political judgments about some of \nthese important issues that confront us.\n\n  I thank the Chair for her indulgence, I thank my colleagues for their \npatience, and I hope we get on with the business of passing a \nchildren's health insurance bill and have a speedy confirmation for \nJudge Mukasey as the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            2007 Fire Season\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, while I know that on the floor of the \nSenate this afternoon SCHIP, or the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, is the topic of the moment, something else is near conclusion \nacross America at this time that I thought it would be appropriate for \nme to speak to. I am speaking of the 2007 fire season. Of course, we--\nyou and I--have been riveted to our television sets over the last \nseveral weeks as we literally watched the Los Angeles basin burn. Well, \nwhile the smoke is starting to clear in California and the losses are \nbeing assessed, I thought it would be time to come and speak to one of \nthe worst fire seasons America has experienced in decades. First, in \ndoing so, I must say--and we have all watched it--thank you to the \nliterally thousands of courageous firefighters, men and women out on \nthe line every day, facing almost impossible odds. We saw it in \nCalifornia. We saw it in my State of Idaho. We saw it across America \nthis year, during that wildfire season period, where flames were as \nhigh as buildings, and men and women were scurrying to stop them and to \nprotect both habitat and watershed and homes. They were putting \nthemselves at risk. So I say to all of those marvelous firefighters who \nstood in harm's way throughout the early summer, summer and fall, and \nnow into the late fall in California, thank you. Thank you for the \nphenomenal work you do, the selflessness you put yourselves into, on \nbehalf of America, on behalf of people's property, on behalf of our \nnatural resources.\n  In California as we speak, 14 people lost their lives, 2,100 homes \nwere destroyed as that week-long blaze roared across the greater Los \nAngeles basin. Over 809 square miles of land was charred, and now, \nabout the time the fires are to die down, we hear rumors that the Santa \nAna winds are expected to pick up again and we could possibly find \nourselves back in flames in California.\n  The 2007 fire season: 77,000 fires. Stop and think about that; 77,000 \nfires, 9.2 million acres of land, and as I have said California may \ncontinue to burn.\n  In my home State of Idaho, we went through one of the worst fire \nseasons we have ever experienced. Of that 77,000 fires I talked about, \n1,775 of them were in the State of Idaho. Of the 9.2 million acres of \nland charred that I talked about, over 2.2 million acres of that, \nnearly 25 percent of the whole burn, occurred in my State of Idaho.\n  Thankfully, in Idaho, no great structures were lost because it \nhappened to be out in the back country or on our foothill grazing land. \nFinally, as the snow began to fall in the high country of my great \nState a few weeks ago, the fires were put out because some of those \nfires were simply impossible to corral and to put out by man's efforts.\n  So here is an interesting statistic. This chart shows us the \nphenomenal escalation and the cost of firefighting at the Federal level \nand what has transpired. In 2005, nearly $1.6 billion was spent. Let me \nshow you what happened this year. Here is what happened this year. So \nwe go from $1.6 billion, and let's go to $1.87 billion. Those are the \nfigures we are talking about now, and that doesn't even include \nCalifornia. So we will probably hit well over the $2 billion price tag \nin fighting America's fires this year, and that, in itself, is \nphenomenal, a phenomenal cost.\n  So let's remember it: 77 million, 1,000 fires, 9.2 million acres \nburned, and now we are bumping up over $2 billion worth of tax dollars \nspent in protecting America's marvelous wildlands and in protecting \nproperties and all of that.\n  Let me give an example of what happened in Idaho, where 25 percent of \nthat acreage burned. On one fire alone, in size as big as the Los \nAngeles fires--we called it the Murphy Complex fires. Well, there were \n50,000 AUMs--or animal unit months--of grazing, because the public \nlands in Idaho are very valuable for grazing. Six ranchers were 100 \npercent burned out. Seventeen others were partially burned. Now that \nthe fire is over, now that the fall has come and we have had a few \nrainstorms and things have settled down, this is Federal land, what do \nwe do?\n  Here is what we are doing, because the cost is not over. The figure I \nhave given you of nearly $2 billion, that is to put out the fires. Now, \nwhat are you going to do with the land? You start rehabilitating the \nland. You start trying to stop it from eroding and doing all of that. \nWe are going to spend $10 million in 2007, and $22 million is already \nrequested for the next 3 years. That is for one fire in Idaho, \nestimated at 128,000 acres to be rehabbed, and currently 66,000 have \nbeen rehabbed. I flew over that fire. It is very hard to understand \nwhat 600 square miles of fire looks like. I was in a military \nhelicopter. I flew for 35 minutes and never saw unburned land. That is \nthe expanse of the size of the fires, and that fire was a little \nsmaller than the collective size of the Los Angeles, or the greater \nCalifornia fires.\n  So it is phenomenally important that we put these fires into context \nand understand what they are all about. Some of you watched on national \ntelevision as the great ski resort, Sun Valley, near Ketchum, ID, \nnearly burned this year. We spent well over $150 million saving the \ncommunity of Ketchum and saving the great Sun Valley Ski Resort from \nthe Castle Rock fire. I was up there two different days on that fire. \nAs the community came around and helped and tried to protect themselves \nand as our Government poured in resources in a class one fire, there \nwas a great lady up there who was the fire boss. They brought her out \nof California. She was fearless in her effort to stop that fire, and \nshe did so very successfully.\n  There are a lot of other stories to be told. The Salmon River, the \ngreat ``river of no return'' in Idaho, one of the No. 1 whitewater \nrafting rivers in the world, shut down 27 days this summer because of \nthe smoke and risk of fire. Millions of dollars from recreation\n\n[[Page S13670]]\n\nwere lost in my State from fire or the risk of fire. Oh, yes, there \nwere millions lost in resources, but when you live off the economy of \ntourism and recreation, fire becomes a very real problem. I don't think \nwe have drawn a bottom line yet to determine the losses in Idaho. But I \nwill tell you they literally are in the millions of dollars. Sun Valley \nitself had to cancel a great event it has every Labor Day called Wagon \nDays; they had to cancel altogether, telling people not to come, and \ntens of thousands of people did not come and spend their money. That \ncommunity lost millions as a result.\n  When you see a fire being fought and you know there are millions of \ndollars being spent to put it out, that is one phase of the great cost \nof fires in America. As you know, in California, with 2,100 homes \nburned, many of those homes will be rebuilt, the communities will be \nrebuilt, to the tune of well over a billion dollars. Someone is going \nto pay for that--State money, insurance money, private money--a \ntremendous expense. In many of the areas of the State of Idaho, in that \n2.2 million acres that burned, campgrounds will not be able to be used \nfor several years; trail heads will be canceled because it is charred, \nit is gone; the wildlife habitat, the watershed--all of that, as a \nresult of the great ineffective management of public lands, has been \nwiped out.\n  The reason I am telling you all of this is because there is a very \nimportant message that has to be brought into context as we look at \nAmerica burning--and America burns. Last year, it was nearly 10 million \nacres; this year, it is 9-some-odd million acres. We are burning \nunprecedented acres in our Nation and somebody ought to ask why. Why is \nit greater today than it has been in decades?\n  There are reasons, I believe, and in the next few minutes I will try \nto explain those to you because not only is our attitude about fire \ndifferent, our attitude about how we manage our public lands and reduce \nthe overall fuel loads that feed these fires is out there; and the \nSenator who is chairing at the moment, concluded the drafting and \nmarkup of a climate change bill. Our climate has changed. We are, in \nsome areas, getting hotter and in some areas getting drier. But the \nmanagement of the lands in response to the change of the climate isn't \nthere, or we are not giving the management agencies the resources to \nchange management practices to reflect the kinds of changes that are \ngoing on in our public lands.\n  So, for Idaho, not only was the loss real this summer in millions of \nacres of beautiful wildlands, but it is now wildlife habitat that is \ngone; it is watershed that, in the wet season, could come tumbling down \nand bring sediment to our streams and damage fisheries, and much of the \nrecreation that was there is gone, potentially, for years to come.\n  As I mentioned a few moments ago, the seeding, the stabilization, all \nof the things that have to go on in the urban watersheds to protect \nthem and bring water quality back--all of that is going to be the \nadditional expenses of the Forest Service and BLM and many of our \nmanagement agencies that have the responsibility over those lands.\n  The firefighters are gone from Idaho. The smoke is gone and the skies \nare clear once again. At the same time, the damage is real, and the \ndamage will be there for years to come.\n  The skies will clear in California one of these days, but in \nCalifornia, the wet season will come. As we watched 2,100 homes burn, \nnow we will watch the land grow wet and begin to slide, because there \nis no vegetation on it to hold it and protect it and to save it from \nthe kind of slippage to which that region of the country is very prone.\n  The reason I mentioned Senator Lieberman is because he is on the \nfloor today, leading a charge on climate change. Here is another aspect \nof what we have done this year, but nobody registers it and few account \nfor it. On average, 6 tons of CO2 are released for every \nacre burned in the United States. Up to 100 tons of CO2 per \nacre can be released. Now, last year alone--we have not calculated this \nyear yet--10 million acres of forest lands burned. By conservative \nestimates, that means 60 million tons of CO2--carbon--was \nspewed into the atmosphere, not to mention greenhouse gases and air \npollutants as a product of our fires.\n  Can we do something about it? Should we do something about it? We are \nproposing changing our whole energy structure to try to effect climate \nchange and reduce our greenhouse gases, but few are focused on our \npublic lands and our policies of managing them and what results from \nthat when they burn.\n  Here is an interesting fact. When I talk about the 60 million tons of \nCO2 spewed into the atmosphere, that is roughly equivalent--\nunderstand this figure--to taking 12 million vehicles off the roads for \n1 year; in other words, turning off their motors, stopping their \npollution, 12 million vehicles for 1 year. That is equivalent to about \nhalf the automobile fleet in California. That is a pretty significant \npicture.\n  One of the things our forests do so very well when they are young and \nyouthful, and when the matrix of our forests old and new are different \nin their changes, they do something that only a green-growing plant can \ndo: sequester carbon, take it from the atmosphere. When they burn, it \nreleases carbon back into the atmosphere. Our management practices \nought to be to keep our forests as young and vibrant and alive as they \ncan be, so they become a tool, an asset, in climate change, to pull the \ncarbon out of the atmosphere that man produces and store it in trees. \nThe great secret that lots of people who don't understand our forests \ndo not understand is they are the greatest captor and storer of carbon \nin a forest. When they burn and when you see smoke on the horizon, it \nis just that--the release of carbon into the atmosphere.\n  Let me conclude by saying what I think is critically important for \nour future. Active management of our forests, recognizing not only \ntheir contribution to our great Nation, as it relates to all they bring \nin water quality and wildlife habitat and the producing of fiber to \nbuild homes, is what keeps a forest healthy. To simply lock them up and \nwatch them and watch Mother Nature move in with her bugs and kill them \nand burn them and do what happened this year is, in itself, a statement \nof mismanagement.\n  This year, and last year, we saw record examples of mismanagement: 10 \nmillion acres last year, 9.2 million acres this year, and billions of \ndollars of tax money spent and thousands of homes lost. Our public \nresource agencies spend more time protecting homes nowadays than the \nresource itself. We sit idly by while the courts are in suit to keep us \nout of our forests so we cannot manage them to clean them up, to reduce \nthe fuel loads, to adhere to the laws that have been passed, such as \nHealthy Forests and others.\n  I will be back to talk more about this in detail in the coming \nmonths. We are now off the chart. We are now literally, in spending, \noff the chart. This is only phase I. This is fighting fires, trying to \nput out fires. This is trying to protect habitat or to protect homes. \nThis has nothing to do with the rehabilitation and the seeding and \nmanagement that may come afterwards or all of the dollars that have \nbeen lost in California because business would not be conducted, or all \nof the dollars lost in Idaho and other States because people could not \ncome there to enjoy it and recreate.\n  There are a lot of other consequences, let alone the phenomenal \nbleeding in the atmosphere of carbon and greenhouse gases, that come \nfrom a wildfire season. America burned this year. The 2007 fire season \nwas one of the worst we have had in decades. This is part of the story \nof what it was all about. There is more to be told. It must be told, \nand Congress should act in concert with climate change and everything \nelse to make sure that part of what we do sequesters our carbon, keeps \nour forests healthy, young, and vibrant as a part of the total picture \nof a great Nation that manages a great resource instead of simply \nwatching it burn.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, with the debate coming to a conclusion \nthe way that it has today, I am really starting to wonder if Congress \nreally wants to reauthorize the SCHIP program.\n  I worked with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle Senators \nBaucus and Rockefeller and my good friend Senator Hatch to come up with \na bipartisan compromise.\n  We passed a bill in the Senate with a remarkable 68 votes. Who would \nhave predicted that when this session began?\n\n[[Page S13671]]\n\n  We sat down with our House colleagues and hammered out a compromise \nthat very closely followed the Senate bill. That compromise bill again \npassed the Senate by a wide bipartisan margin and received 265 votes in \nthe House.\n  As we all know that bill was vetoed, and 2 weeks ago, the veto was \nsustained in the House.\n  In the 2 weeks since that vote, I have seen some of the strangest \ntwists and turns I have seen in all my years in politics.\n  First, I sat down with Democratic leadership in both Houses. We \nagreed on the compromises we thought we could make to get the final \nvotes we needed to pass the House.\n  At the same time, the minority leader of the House released a letter \nwith the conditions his Members needed to vote for a bill.\n  Seeing as the compromises we were willing to make seemed to resemble \nthe conditions in the leader's letter, we began meeting with House \nRepublicans to see if we could bridge the final gap.\n  We started a process and made some real progress. Then all of the \nsudden House Democratic leadership decided it was time for a vote. No \nmatter that we hadn't successfully concluded negotiations with House \nRepublicans, it was time to vote.\n  That bill passed and it is the bill we are voting on here in a few \nminutes.\n  Moving ahead like that in the House created tremendous mistrust. But \nundaunted, we picked up the pieces and tried again to get a deal with \nHouse Republicans.\n  The minority leader in the House released another letter with the \nconditions his Members needed to support a bill. Of course, the \ngoalposts moved from the original letter. But we still felt a deal was \npossible and forged ahead.\n  The majority leader of the Senate started the clock ticking on the \nbill here in the Senate. Again we were making progress with House \nRepublicans.\n  So when the majority leader saw we were making progress, he asked for \nmore time here in the Senate.\n  Incredibly, Senate Republicans objected. In the House, Republicans \nobjected because we moved too fast. In the Senate, Republicans objected \nbecause we wanted to move more slowly.\n  Yes, you should note the incredible irony.\n  So today faced with continued objections, a decision was made to move \nforward with a vote this afternoon.\n  I ask all my colleagues. Why?\n  To my colleagues on the Democrat side; the President will veto this \nbill and the House has the votes to stop an override. Why go through \nwith this?\n  To my colleagues on the Republican side; we have the votes to pass \nthe bill and were quite close to having a deal to satisfy House \nRepublicans. Did you force the vote today to keep us from reaching a \ndeal?\n  What the heck is going on around here?\n  My patience is a little thin right now. But come tomorrow, I will go \nback to working with the folks who want a bill that we can get enacted \ninto law.\n  This bill actually improves upon the bill that was vetoed by the \nPresident. All my colleagues who supported the bill before should \ncertainly support the bill today.\n  But as we all know, this bill is getting vetoed and there aren't the \nvotes to override in the House.\n  That is really too bad, because this is a very good bill.\n  It is really too bad for the more than 3 million children who don't \nhave health care coverage today that would get coverage under this \nbill.\n  It is for those kids that I will pick up the pieces tomorrow and try \nto move forward. It is my hope that leadership on both sides of \nCongress and both sides of the aisle will set the gamesmanship aside so \nwe can finally finish this bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, once again, I support the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program Reauthorization Act.\n  I am frustrated that the President continues to oppose legislation \nthat will expand access to health care for our Nation's children. The \nPresident's veto of the previous bill shows that this administration \nfails to understand the domestic needs of our country.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is a successful program that \nhas improved the quality of life for our Nation's children. Since its \nenactment in 1997, the number of uninsured children have been reduced \nby one-third, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act will \npreserve access to health care for the 6.6 million children currently \nenrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. In addition, this \nbill expands access for approximately 4 million more children.\n  Approximately 16,000 children in Hawaii lack health insurance. I am \nproud that my home State of Hawaii has continued to develop innovative \nprograms to help provide access to health care for children. This year, \nthe Hawaii State Legislature established the Keiki Care program, a \npublic-private partnership intended to ensure that every child in \nHawaii has access to health care.\n  This administration is being irresponsible by denying resources to \nstates for children's health care. Without access to insurance, \nchildren cannot learn, be active, and grow into healthy adults.\n  I continue to appreciate the inclusion of a provision to restore \nMedicaid disproportionate share hospital, DSH, allotments for Hawaii \nand Tennessee. Medicaid DSH payments are designed to provide additional \nsupport to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured \npatients.\n  I developed this provision as an amendment with my colleagues--\nSenators Alexander, Inouye, and Corker, that provide both states with \nDSH allotments. Hawaii would be provided with a $10 million Medicaid \nDSH allotment for fiscal year 2008. For fiscal year 2009 and beyond, \nHawaii's allotment would increase with annual inflation updates just \nlike other low DSH States.\n  Hawaii and Tennessee are the only two States that do not have DSH \nallotments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created specific DSH \nallotments for each State based on their actual DSH expenditures for \nfiscal year 1995. In 1994, Hawaii implemented the QUEST demonstration \nprogram that was designed to reduce the number of uninsured and improve \naccess to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH program was incorporated \ninto QUEST. As a result of the demonstration program, Hawaii did not \nhave DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not provided a DSH allotment.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the \nestablishment of a floor for DSH allotments. However, States without \nallotments were again left out.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003 made additional changes in the DSH program. This included an \nincrease in DSH allotments for low DSH states. Again, States without \nallotments were left out.\n  Hawaii and Tennessee should be treated like other extremely low DSH \nStates and be provided with Medicaid DSH allotments every year. Other \nstates that have obtained waivers similar to Hawaii's have retained \ntheir DSH allotments.\n  Hospitals in Hawaii are having a difficult time trying to meet the \nelevated demands placed on them by the increasing number of uninsured \npeople. DSH payments will help our hospitals continue to provide \nessential health care services to people in need. All States must have \naccess to resources to ensure that hospitals can continue to provide \nservices for uninsured and low-income residents.\n  This administration fails to adequately understand the importance of \nthis legislation. This bill helps the State of Hawaii provide essential \nhealth care access to children that currently lack health insurance. It \nwill also provide vital support to our hospitals that care for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries and uninsured patients.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n3963, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. This \nbipartisan agreement is our second attempt to do what is right for our \nNation's children. There are few more important issues facing the \nSenate than the\n\n[[Page S13672]]\n\nhealth and well-being of our Nation's youth. The vote to pass this \nlegislation is a vote for children.\n  As the father of two young daughters, I clearly understand how \nimportant it is to know that if one of them gets sick that they have \nthe health insurance coverage that will provide for their care. For \nmillions of parents, every slight sniffle or aching tooth could mean \nthe difference between paying the rent and paying for medical care. \nToday we have an opportunity to help give those parents peace of mind \nabout their children's health.\n  Despite the broad bipartisan support that already exists for this \nbill, Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, among others, have worked \ntirelessly to build more support and accommodate the bill's critics. \nThey should be commended for their work and dedication. Thanks to them \nand many others, this legislation represents an even more thorough \ncompromise while still covering 10 million children. There are explicit \nchanges designed to address criticisms by the bill's opponents. H.R. \n3963 makes it even more clear that States must cover the poorest \nchildren before expanding their programs. And it ensures that illegal \nimmigrants cannot get benefits.\n  But even with these changes the bill continues providing coverage for \n6.6 million children currently enrolled in CHIP and provides coverage \nfor 3.1 million children who are currently uninsured today. It gives \nStates the resources they need to keep up with the growing numbers of \nuninsured children. It provides tools and incentives to cover children \nwho have fallen through the cracks of current programs. And it will \nprevent the President from unfairly and shortsightedly limiting States' \nefforts to expand their CHIP programs to cover even more children. All \ntogether these efforts will reduce the number of uninsured children by \none third over the next 5 years.\n  I am additionally very pleased that my Support for Injured \nServicemembers Act amendment was included in the final SCHIP bill. This \namendment provides up to 6 months of Family and Medical Leave Act, \nFMLA, leave for family members of military personnel who suffer from a \ncombat-related injury or illness. FMLA currently allows 3 months of \nunpaid leave. Fourteen years ago, FMLA declared the principle that \nworkers should never be forced to choose between the jobs they need and \nthe families they love.\n  If ordinary Americans deserve those rights, how much more do they \napply to those who risk their lives in the service of our country? \nSoldiers who have been wounded in our service deserve everything \nAmerica can give to speed their recoveries--but most of all, they \ndeserve the care of their closest loved ones.\n  The President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded \nWarriors, ably led by Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, Donna Shalala, has been instrumental in efforts to \nprovide needed care for our returning heroes. It is not surprising that \nthe Commission found that family members play a critical role in the \nrecovery of our wounded servicemembers. Although the President has \nlauded the recommendations of the Commission and recently sent \nlegislation to Congress to implement its recommendations, he continues \nto hold up the passage of this provision.\n  I am pleased that Senator Clinton is the lead cosponsor of my \namendment. In addition, I am pleased that Senators Dole, Graham, \nKennedy, Chambliss, Reed, Mikulski, Murray, Salazar, Lieberman, \nMenendez, Brown, Nelson of Nebraska, Cardin, and Obama are cosponsoring \nthis amendment. I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for \naccepting this important amendment and appreciate the support of all of \nmy colleagues in this effort.\n  Unfortunately the President still stands in the way. He continues to \nthreaten to veto this important legislation. I am fearful that he will \nblock yet another bipartisan compromise to cover children who need \nhealth care. This legislation is vital to the health and well-being of \nour children. It represents the hard work and agreement of an \noverwhelming majority of Members on both sides of the aisle. It is a \ntestament to how important issues like children's health care can be \naddressed in a bipartisan manner by a united Congress. The President's \npolicy of block and delay would mean Connecticut and other States would \nhave to take away existing health coverage for hundreds of thousands of \nchildren when they should be covering more kids.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation, and I urge \nPresident Bush to do what is right and sign it into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss my \namendment to codify the unborn child rule in the pending SCHIP \nlegislation. This needs to be done, and it needs to be done in this \nreauthorization.\n  The unborn child rule is a regulation that, since 2002, has allowed \nStates to provide prenatal care to unborn children and their mothers. \nIt recognizes the basic fact that the child in the womb is a child. \nWhen a pregnancy is involved, there are at least two patients--mother \nand baby. It only makes sense to cover the unborn child under a \nchildren's health program. The bill before us modifies the SCHIP \nstatute to allow States to cover ``pregnant women'' of any age. It also \ncontains language that asserts that the bill does not affirm either the \nlegality or illegality of the 2002 ``unborn child'' rule.\n  My amendment would codify the principle of the rule by amending the \nSCHIP law to clarify that a covered child ``includes, at the option of \na State, an unborn child.'' The amendment further defines ``unborn \nchild'' with a definition drawn verbatim from Public Law 108-212, the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act. My amendment would also clarify that \nthe coverage for the unborn child may include services to benefit \neither the mother or unborn child consistent with the health of both. \nIn addition, the amendment clarifies that States may provide mothers \nwith postpartum services for 60 days after they give birth.\n  Many States' definition of coverage for a pregnant woman leads to the \nstrange legal fiction that the adult pregnant woman is a ``child.'' \nSurely it was not the intent of anyone who developed the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to allow a loophole for States to \ndefine a woman as a child. Surely we can agree that the child who \nreceives health care in the womb is a child receiving care along with \nhis or her mother.\n  My amendment will also allow for coverage of the mother, whereas the \npending legislation only allows for pregnancy-related services. There \nare many conditions that can affect a mother's health during pregnancy \nthat are not related to her pregnancy. Under the pending legislation, a \npregnant mother could not get coverage for any condition that isn't \nrelated to her pregnancy.\n  We should be allowing mothers to stay healthy so that they will have \nhealthy babies. This also leads to reduced costs associated with \npremature or low-birth weight babies. Eleven States are already using \nthis option to provide such care through the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. If the intent of the sponsors is to provide coverage \nfor the pregnant woman and her unborn child, then they should have no \nproblem supporting my amendment.\n  We should ensure that pregnant women and their unborn child are both \ntreated as patients. This is a matter of common sense. Every \nobstetrician knows that in treating a pregnant woman, he is treating \ntwo patients--the mother and her unborn child. Keeping this coverage in \nthe name of the adult pregnant woman alone is bad for the integrity of \na children's health program, bad for the child, and even bad for some \nof the neediest of pregnant women.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2007 would help ensure that millions of the \nNation's uninsured children can receive access to health care.\n  Last month, the House and Senate passed legislation reauthorizing the \npopular children's health insurance program. In the Senate, this \nbipartisan bill passed with a veto-proof majority of 67 votes. Since \nthen, the President has vetoed this legislation and Congress has worked \nhard to create a new bipartisan bill that addresses items President \nBush objected to. Despite\n\n[[Page S13673]]\n\nthis, the President continues to threaten a veto on this strengthened \nbill that focuses on ensuring children from low-income working families \nreceive access to necessary health care.\n  I hope that the President will listen to the majority of the Nation \nthat supports the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization \nAct and signs this bill when it reaches his desk.\n  Currently, 6.6 million children are enrolled in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP. There are still 9 million uninsured \nchildren nationwide, 6 million of which are eligible for either \nMedicaid or CHIP. The Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act would provide more than 3 million uninsured \nchildren from low-income families with health insurance. This means, \nthat in my home state of Michigan, 80,900 more uninsured children will \nreceive access to much needed health care.\n  I believe that we have a moral obligation to provide all Americans \naccess to affordable and high quality health care. I do not understand \nhow the United States is one of the most developed and wealthiest \nnations in the world, but we continually send the message that an \nadditional $35 billion to provide American children from low-income \nfamilies with access to health care is too large an investment for \nthose that represent our future.\n  I firmly believe no person, young or old, should be denied access to \nadequate health care, and the expanded and improved Children's Health \nInsurance Program is an important step toward achieving that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I have been waiting on the floor for \na while. May I speak in morning business?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 14 minutes and the \nRepublicans control 20 minutes before the cloture vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We have 14 minutes remaining and we are going to have to \nuse it, unless the Senator can use 1 or 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I understand. I will wait and either return after the \nvote or at another time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is possible the Republicans might yield the Senator \nsome time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 20 \nminutes immediately prior to the cloture vote at 4:45 be equally \ndivided and controlled between the leaders, or their designees, and \nthat the majority leader will control the final 10 minutes prior to the \nvote; further, that the mandatory quorum required under rule XXII be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, in 1997, Congress enacted the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program--10 years ago. From the beginning, it has been \nabout kids. It has been about trying to give the parents of low-income \nworking families the peace of mind that comes from knowing that health \ncare is there for their children. That is all this is, it is about \nhealth care for kids. These are kids in working families, not kids in \nwealthy families, not kids in middle-income families--kids in working \nfamilies.\n  These are kids who, through no fault of their own, were born into \nfamilies having had a hard time buying medical insurance in America, \nand we are trying to help these kids.\n  A large number of Senators on both sides of the aisle have worked \ntogether to try to reach a consensus. Both sides of the aisle--Senator \nGrassley, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hatch, and I--met together and \nworked things out. And when the House failed to muster enough votes to \noverride the President's veto, we worked together with House \nRepublicans to help kids. All four of us--Senator Grassley, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Hatch, and I--met repeatedly with moderate House \nRepublicans to try to find a middle ground.\n  We have made progress. We made a lot of progress, and I believe a \ncompromise is very close, is within reach. I believe given a little \nmore time, Congress could pass a CHIP bill that could achieve the \nsupport of more than two-thirds of both Houses of Congress. \nUnfortunately, today some objected to giving us that time, and I regret \nthat objection.\n  But we met again, all of us--that is, Senator Hatch, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Grassley, and I--with House Republicans at 2 \no'clock. We agreed to continue meeting. We will meet again next \nTuesday. We will reach an agreement soon. I don't think I will be \ntelling tales out of school to say that the majority leader visited our \nmeeting and he said: If we get a deal, the Senate will take it up. I \nthink we are close to getting that deal. There are only a couple of \nissues that are outstanding, and we will work through those issues.\n  I regret that the opponents of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--and let us be clear, they are truly fighting not just the bill \nbut the Children's Health Insurance Program--that those opponents of \nCHIP have made it impossible for us to offer an amendment to the bill \nbefore us today to get this done. They have succeeded in stopping us \ntoday. I am disappointed. I am not discouraged, I am disappointed. We \nwill keep working. Even if the President once again vetoes health care \nfor kids, we will work to get it done.\n  We are still left with a good bill before us. It is a better bill \nthan the one the President vetoed. Before us today is a bill that \naddresses many of the concerns Senators expressed with the first CHIP \nbill. The bill before us today focuses more on kids. It focuses more on \nlow-income families. It is a good bill.\n  There is no reason why anyone who supported the first bill on \nSeptember 27 would not do so again today. It is improved. There is \nevery reason why those who objected to the first bill would support \nthis bill today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in voting for cloture and then voting \nfor the bill. I urge them to do so because this is still about health \ncare for kids. That is what this is all about, it is for kids. We have \na lot of peripheral issues, but they are peripheral; it is noise. We \nsay: Keep our eyes on the ball. It is about helping low-income kids, \nhealth care for kids and working families. Measures such as this are \nwhy we came to work in public service. Measures such as this are why \npeople for whom we work sent us here. Let us not let them down.\n  Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Montana, \nthat is good of him. I may not have to ask for it--I believe the \nminority will yield me such time as I need, but if I need more time, I \nwill come back. I thank my friend for his graciousness.\n  Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Michael Mukasey\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending \nnomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. I rise to urge my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \nto favorably consider this nomination because I fear we are in danger \nof treating this judge very unjustly, of doing something that is not \nfair to him personally.\n  I wish to state at the outset that I did not just meet Judge Mukasey \nsince he was nominated for Attorney General by the President; I \nactually met him 43 years ago this fall when we both entered Yale Law \nSchool together. We were in the same small group in contracts. The \noccupant of the chair will appreciate the intimacy and how well you get \nto know somebody when you are in a small group together with a \ndemanding contracts professor.\n  The Mike Mukasey I met 43 years ago was honorable, he was bright, he \nwas not presumptuous, he had a great sense of humor, and he had a \nstrong sense of values--what I would call honor--to him. I have kept in \ntouch with Mike over the years. I can't say we have seen each other a \nlot, but I have watched his career grow with great pride. He was a \nprivate practitioner, a distinguished and successful assistant U.S. \nattorney, a judge who has been extremely well regarded by all who have \ncome before him, as was testified to before the Judiciary Committee on \nhis nomination. He handled some very difficult cases, ruled in cases \nregarding alleged terrorists and did so to his own personal risk. He \nhad a security detail with him for\n\n[[Page S13674]]\n\nsome period of time because of the threats he received after one of \nthese cases.\n\n  I am honored to say Judge Mukasey asked me to introduce him to the \nJudiciary Committee, alongside Senator Schumer of New York. I said then \nwhat I will say here. The man I met 43 years ago is today essentially \nthe same man--honorable, intelligent, with a real sense of values, a \ncommitment to public service, a man of the law, not a man of politics, \nexactly the kind of person America always needs as Attorney General, \nbut particularly needs at this moment.\n  I thought he handled his nomination hearing extremely well. Now there \nis rising opposition to this nomination based on Judge Mukasey's answer \nto a single question, which is whether he would say that waterboarding \ntechnique of interrogation is torture. Judge Mukasey has preferred to \ngive the easy, I might say politically correct, answer--and he has \nargued with us, he has educated us, I add, to understand that his \nanswer is not about whether we are for or against waterboarding.\n  He says, to himself the technique described--I am reading from a \nletter of October 30, 2007, from Judge Mukasey to members of the \nJudiciary Committee who had written to him:\n\n       I was asked at the hearing and in your letter questions \n     about the hypothetical use of certain coercive interrogation \n     techniques. As described in your letter, these techniques \n     seem over the line or, on a personal basis, repugnant to me. \n     . . .\n\n  This is not to say Judge Mukasey is for waterboarding. That is not \nwhat is at issue, and we should not allow it to become so. He is \nresponding as a man of the law, as a judge, as a man who would be, if \nwe allow him, exactly the kind of Attorney General we need. He says:\n\n       But hypotheticals are different from real life, and in any \n     legal opinion the actual facts and circumstances are \n     critical. As a judge, I tried to be objective in my decision-\n     making and to put aside even strongly held personal beliefs \n     when assessing a legal question because legal questions must \n     be answered based solely on the actual facts, circumstances, \n     and legal standards presented. A legal opinion based on \n     hypothetical facts and circumstances may be of some limited \n     academic appeal but has scant practical effect or value.\n\n  Bottom line, the judge is saying waterboarding is repugnant but I \ncannot say as a matter of law that it is torture under the law because \nI don't know exactly what waterboarding is and how it is used, and I \nhave not seen the prevailing legal memos that have governed, because \nthey are classified interrogations by employees of our Government.\n  He says in the letter of October 30:\n\n       I have not been briefed on techniques used in any \n     classified interrogation program conducted by any government \n     agency.\n\n  He is saying: How can you expect me to essentially issue a legal \nopinion when I don't know the facts and I can't know the facts until \nand unless you allow me to be Attorney General?\n  Then he says something I think is very important in his letter. He \nwrites to the Judiciary Committee members:\n\n       I do know, however, that ``waterboarding'' cannot be used \n     by the United States military because its use by the military \n     would be a clear violation of the Detainee Treatment Act. \n     That is because ``waterboarding'' and certain other coercive \n     interrogation techniques are expressly prohibited by the Army \n     Field Manual on Intelligence and Interrogation, and Congress \n     specifically legislated in the [Detainee Treatment Act of \n     2005] that no person in the custody or control of the \n     Department of Defense or held in a DOD facility may be \n     subject to any interrogation techniques not authorized and \n     listed in the Manual.\n\n  So there is a law and he has made clear that because there is a law, \nhe definitely believes waterboarding cannot be used by Department of \nDefense personnel.\n  The fact is that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 did not \nexplicitly ban waterboarding or other specific techniques of \ninterrogation as used by other employees of the Federal Government, \nincluding presumably and particularly employees of our intelligence \nagencies.\n  The Detainee Treatment Act banned ``cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment.'' Judge Mukasey says in his letter:\n\n       In the absence of legislation expressly banning certain \n     interrogation techniques in all circumstances, one must \n     consider whether a particular technique complies with \n     relevant legal standards.\n\n  He simply cannot do this in the absence of a clear legislative \nexpression by Congress that waterboarding constitutes torture without \nseeing the documents, without understanding the definition of \nwaterboarding, as applied in particular cases. He is a man of the law. \nHe is saying, as he said in his testimony and in this letter, no one, \nincluding the President, is above the law.\n  It would be very easy to remove any doubts and opposition to his \nconfirmation if he just said in his letter: Waterboarding is torture. \nBut he responds to a higher authority. It is the law in a nation that \nclaims to be governed by the rule of law.\n  In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, he was repeatedly \nquestioned in regard to his independence, and following Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales's close relationship with the White House, members of \nthe committee were clearly interested in whether Judge Mukasey would be \nindependent of the White House, of the President. He said he would do \nwhat the law required him to do. No one is above the law, including the \nPresident.\n  In refusing to tell questioning members of the Judiciary Committee, \ncolleagues of ours, what they want to hear in this case, he is also \nshowing his independence. He is saying he will not be pressured by \nMembers of the Senate, including those who will determine whether he is \nconfirmed. He will not simply tell them what they want to hear if he \nthinks it is not the legally responsible thing to do. That is exactly \nthe kind of man I want and I believe we all should want as Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  So he is putting his confirmation as Attorney General at risk because \nhe believes it would not be justified as a matter of law for him to \nconclude, without benefit of documents that he cannot see now, that \nwaterboarding is torture. And for this will we reward this good man, \nthis public servant, this distinguished judge, this man of the law, by \nrejecting his nomination?\n  Here is the kind of independence, the kind of allegiance to the \npublic interest and the rule of law the American people want to see \nmore of and not less in Washington. It is why I repeat what I said at \nthe beginning. To reject the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey \nbecause he refuses to say what some Members want him to say on this \nquestion and he refuses as a matter of sincerely held legal belief what \nhis legal responsibility is would be grossly unfair and an unjust act \nto this judge.\n  May I suggest an alternative course to my friends on the Judiciary \nCommittee and Members of the Senate who hopefully will get to consider \nthis nomination? Confirm Judge Mukasey based on his overall record of \nservice, his obvious intelligence, honor and integrity, the extent to \nwhich he will raise the morale of the Department of Justice. Look at \nhis entire record. Don't turn him down and deprive the Nation of his \nservice as our chief law enforcer because of one legal opinion he has \nreached that is different from yours.\n\n  Confirm him. And then, as Attorney General, he will have access to \nthe documents about waterboarding. He will have access to the people \nwho may or may not have been involved in it. He will have access to the \nprevailing legal memos, and then demand he issue a legal opinion and \nrespond to your question. But don't reject a man of the law, exactly \nthe kind of man America needs today, as our Attorney General.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have tried hard to arrive at another \ncompromise. I do not know how--it would be physically impossible for \nus--to do any more than what I have suggested. I have said, when told \nthat the negotiators needed more time, we will wait until after the \nfarm bill and go after this issue. Objected to. I was called by my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle yesterday, who said: Can we have \na little more time? I said: Sure.\n\n[[Page S13675]]\n\n  I came today and said let's finish this matter this coming Monday. \nLet's finish it after the farm bill. And both times there was an \nobjection.\n  I have met with Senators Hatch and Grassley on many occasions. On \nevery occasion I can think of Senator Baucus has been there, and in \nsome of those meetings Senator Rockefeller has been present. The four \nof us have had a significant number of meetings with the Speaker, with \nChairman Dingell, and Chairman Rangel.\n  I went down at 20 after 2 today and met with a number of Republican \nHouse Members, relaying to them--and I have no doubt that they would \nacknowledge this--that we have tried to work with them in coming up \nwith something.\n  Now, I explained to them the Senate rules. If I wanted to not have \nthis cloture vote, I couldn't stop it. It takes unanimous consent to \nmove from our doing this. I explained that to them. But I did tell them \nthis, and I will say to you and those within the sound of my voice what \nI told those freshmen. I believe the negotiations that have taken place \nin this matter have been in good faith. There has been no bad faith by \nthe participants.\n  The burden has been borne by the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, and the ranking member, Senator Grassley. Senator \nHatch, who was the original sponsor of this bill, with Senator Kennedy, \nhas been involved from the very beginning. Senator Hatch was at the \nmeeting where I met with House Republicans. Senator Baucus was there, \nand I repeat what I told them. If we can't do something now, and we \nsend the bill to the President and he vetoes it, I don't think we \nshould rush forward and try to override his veto. I think we should \njust let things simmer a little while.\n  I told them if they could come up with something that we can work \nwith--I spoke to the Speaker this morning, and I said: I am not sure we \ncan move much further.\n  She said: You should see the changes they want to make. There is very \nlittle. There isn't much that they want--which was comforting to me. \nAnd that is what the House Members told me today when I met with them \nthis afternoon.\n  So I would hope people understand that good-faith negotiations have \ntaken place on a bipartisan, bicameral basis on this most important \npiece of legislation. I am not happy with the President on this issue. \nI think he is making a big mistake. I think he is hurting some of his \nHouse Members, who could be in a very precarious position as a result \nof voting no to overriding his veto, but that is the decision they have \nmade. And I am willing to try to get them out of the hole I think some \nof them are in.\n  Yesterday the President came from left field. Talk about a sucker \npunch. He suddenly said: I don't like the way this is paid for.\n  We are paying for it. It is not deficit spending. We are taking care \nof this with a relatively small tax on cigarettes and cigars. That \nsurprised everybody. It surprised everybody that the President now, \nwhen he learned that we had changed things--got adults off the program, \nchanged its to limit waivers, tightened down the immigration issue. We \ndid everything he asked us to do, and now he changes the program again.\n  We are at a point now where the President does not become relevant to \nthis issue because in the bipartisan, bicameral work that we have done \nbetween the House and the Senate, we want to do this ourselves, so that \nwhen we come to a decision on what we can do, and I think we are within \ndays of doing that, we will bring this bill back. The Speaker said she \nwould do it; I said I would do it.\n  I express my appreciation to the courtesies extended to me by \nSenators Grassley and Hatch on the Republican side and the extreme \npatience of Senator Baucus for allowing the many different diversions \nthat we have had in getting to the point where we are today. With the \nunderstanding and the hope that we can move forward on this bill, and \neven though some of these programs are going to change drastically by \nMarch because there will be as many as 11 States that will run out of \nmoney, hopefully in the next few weeks we can change this legislation \nand still insure 10 million children and maintain a program that is \nreasonable for the States and certainly the children we are trying to \nprotect.\n  So I again express my appreciation to the participants of the many \ninvolved in the negotiations, and I want to also reach out my hand in \nfriendship to the Speaker. There isn't a Democrat or Republican, \nincluding Senators Grassley and Hatch, who would not say publicly how \nwilling she has been to try to work to come to some reasonable \nconclusion of this legislation. She has been great, as has Chairman \nRangel and Chairman Dingell.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. Is there anyone on the floor who \nwants to take the remaining time? Good.\n  I yield to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I commend our leadership for working out the fact \nthat we can start to bring some closure on children's health insurance. \nWe have had experience in Florida of doing a health insurance program \nbefore the Federal program ever started, 10 years ago, and it was \ntremendously successful and popular in getting to families who were \njust over the income level of Medicaid but who were still too limited \nin their income to provide health insurance for their children.\n  As a result, thousands of children in Florida, before CHIP ever came \nalong, were provided for. But then the Federal program came along and \nmade it available to so many more. Yet even today, with Florida's \nprogram and the Federal program, there are still 700,000 children in \nthe State of Florida who do not have health insurance. What we are \nhoping is that with the expansion of the CHIP program, we will be able \nto include 400,000 of those 700,000 who do not have health insurance.\n  (The remarks of Senator Nelson of Florida pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2295 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. Nelson of Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     450, H.R. 3963, Childrens' Health Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007.\n         Max Baucus, Harry Reid, Benjamin L.

The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that \ndebate on H.R. 3963, an act to amend title XII of the Social Security \nAct to extend and improve the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nshall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the \nrule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 65, the nays are \n30. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to have a vote in just a few \nminutes. I know people have things to do. This will be the last vote \nthis week. But I alert all Members, we have had a number of meetings \ntoday with Senator McConnell. We are trying to work it out so we do not \nhave to have cloture on the motion to proceed to the farm bill.\n  I understand that the minority has to take a look at the amendment to \nthe bill that has come out of the committee and was all ready to go and \nthe Finance Committee needed to make some changes on it. That should be \nback from Legislative Counsel in just a matter of minutes--at least we \nhope that is the case.\n  If we do not have to do cloture on the motion to proceed, there will \nbe no votes on Monday. If we do have to do a vote on the motion to \nproceed, there will be a noon vote on the motion to proceed on Monday, \nand we will have to do that; otherwise, we will come in and go to the \nfarm bill Tuesday around 2 o'clock in the afternoon so the managers can \ngive their opening statements, and anyone who wants to speak on the \nbill. There are going to be lots of opening statements on the farm \nbill, so I would hope people would come early and get those out of the \nway.\n  There are a number of people who have expressed to me--who have \nwarned me that there are going to be some amendments on that bill. We \nare going to have to make sure we do this the right way. We want to \nmake sure there are amendments that are offered. We will have to take a \nlook at them because it is late in the session and the farm bill is a \ntax bill. So we have to make sure we do not get into any issues we do \nnot need to get into. But we will be as fair as we can possibly be on \nthe farm bill. It is a bill we have to complete.\n  Also during the next 2 weeks, we have to get the first appropriations \nbill to the President. I had a very constructive conversation with Josh \nBolton today regarding what will happen when we get that bill to him. \nWe also have other important business to do, such as making sure the \nGovernment is funded after November 16.\n  So we have a very busy week. The President has indicated that \nprobably tomorrow he is going to veto WRDA. We will have to take a look \nat that.\n  If there is no cloture vote, we will be on the bill Monday for \nopening statements, as I indicated. We have a productive farm bill.\n  I wish to express my appreciation to everyone for the work on the \nchildren's health bill. I will repeat what I said before the vote: \nThere has been bicameral, bipartisan work on the CHIP bill--bicameral, \nbipartisan work. At 2:20 today, I went and met with a number of House \nRepublicans trying to move forward on the children's health initiative. \nIt is my recommendation that this bill will be sent to the President. \nIf he vetoes the bill, it is my recommendation--I will express my \nfeelings to the Speaker--that we not even attempt a veto override.\n  My Republican colleagues--this is difficult for me to be talking \nabout: I should not say ``difficult.'' It is unusual for me to be \ntalking about my Republican House colleagues. But they indicated that \nwould be the very best step forward. We are very close to being able to \ndo a bipartisan, bicameral children's health bill. I think we can \nreally do that. I have spoken to the Speaker. She believes that is the \ncase, also. If we can do that, at the earliest opportunity, we will \nbring that back for consideration of the Senators.\n  I express my appreciation to Senator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and many others. This has been a very \ndifficult but rewarding process for me. It indicates to me that there \nis the ability of this Congress to work on a bipartisan, bicameral \nbasis, and until we accept that as a truth, we are going to have \ntrouble moving these many bills we have bouncing around here to \ncompletion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, with regard to the schedule for \nMonday, the farm bill has not been printed yet but, as the majority \nleader indicated, we expect it momentarily. I am optimistic we will not \nend up having to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed Monday and \nthat we will, as the majority leader suggested, not have to be back \nuntil Tuesday morning. I can't announce that right now, but I am \noptimistic we will be able to get that cleared up in the very near \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will read \nthe bill for the third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \npassage of the bill.\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nObama), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I will not take that much time, but I \ndo want to draw my colleagues' attention to an issue that is going to \nbe in front of the Judiciary Committee and my colleague, the Presiding \nOfficer, this next week, and that is the nomination of Judge Michael \nMukasey to be Attorney General of the United States.\n\n[[Page S13677]]\n\n  Judge Mukasey is an outstanding nominee, highly qualified by \nanybody's definition, a consensus nominee who has now drawn fire. It \nstrikes me as a situation of ignoring the forest for a tree. I want to \ntalk about the specific tree that is here in the way, but I want to \nalso point out the forest we have.\n  Judge Mukasey is an outstanding, qualified nominee, strongly \nsupported, warmly put forward by Republicans and Democrats alike. He is \nnot an ideologue by any means.\n  Senator Schumer said, at the outset:\n\n       [H]e could get a unanimous vote out of this committee.\n\n  Senator Schumer had previously discussed Judge Mukasey as a possible \nappointee to the U.S. Supreme Court--a lifetime appointment to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Here again, Senator Schumer's words:\n\n       Let me say, if the president were to nominate somebody, \n     albeit a conservative, but somebody who put the rule of law \n     first, someone like a . . . Mike Mukasey, my guess is that \n     they would get through the Senate very, very quickly.\n\n  Well, it has now been 41 days that the nomination has been pending. \nThat is longer than any other nominee for Attorney General in over 20 \nyears. He is a consensus nominee.\n  I have my problems with Judge Mukasey on narrow issues. But if we \nlook at the central issue of our day, which is the war on terrorism, \nthe war we are having with militant Islamists that we are likely to be \nin for a generation, you could not ask for a more qualified Attorney \nGeneral nominee than Judge Mukasey.\n  He is a gentleman who, as a judge, has handled some of the most \ndifficult terrorism cases we have had in the country. He is an \noutstanding jurist. He is highly qualified. He handled the blind sheik \ncase that came in front of his court. He has handled others. This is a \nnominee who is going to be in position for, well, the rest of this year \nand next year, and that is it, as Attorney General. I think he is so \nhighly qualified he could well proceed into a next administration if he \ncould get in in this administration. Yet he is not being put forward.\n  I want to quote--and this is an extraordinary quote. This is the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals praising his work as a trial court \njudge in some of these difficult cases. I have not read before where a \ncircuit court has praised the work of a trial court judge to such an \nextraordinary degree as they did of Judge Mukasey where they noted \nthis. This is the Second Circuit saying this about him: ``extraordinary \nskill and patience.'' Further continuing to quote: ``outstanding \nachievement in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured \nby a trial judge.'' That is the Second Circuit Court of Appeals about \nJudge Mukasey. This is an outstanding individual.\n  Now, he was sailing along, doing well as a nominee, going through a \ntough confirmation process, handling the hearings well, dealing with \nthe issues, and then an issue came up about torture, and waterboarding \nin particular. Then there seemed to be some confusion being declared \nabout this, so he has cleared up the record on that issue.\n  I want to read what he has stated on the record about this particular \nissue. And I want to say at the outset, it cannot be clearer that Judge \nMukasey does not approve of waterboarding. He does not approve of it. \nHe has called the procedure ``repugnant to me.'' He wrote to the \nJudiciary Committee Democrats that ``nothing . . . in my testimony \nshould be read as an approval of the interrogation techniques presented \nto me at the hearing or in your letter, or any comparable technique.''\n  ``[N]othing . . . in my testimony should be read as an approval of \n[this] interrogation technique. . . .''\n  He has pledged, if confirmed, he will examine interrogation programs \nthoroughly, and he has promised that ``if, after such a review, [he] \ndetermine[s] that any technique is unlawful, [he] will not hesitate to \nso advise the President and . . . rescind or correct any legal opinion \nof the Department of Justice that supports use of the technique.''\n  Now, do my colleagues doubt Judge Mukasey, whom they roundly praised \njust weeks ago, is a man of his word? Do they believe he would permit \nan illegal program to go forward? I do not think so. He will not. This \nis a straight-shooter. He is not a yes-man. He is not a yes-man to \nanybody. He has been on the bench for years. He has handled tough \nterrorism cases. He recognizes the threat terrorism is to this country. \nHe also recognizes that the United States must stand for what is right. \nIf we don't, that will be used against us in other places around the \nworld, and it doesn't flow to the best image and it doesn't flow to the \nheart of what America is: a rule-of-law nation that stands up for what \nis right. He is going to do that. He has done that. He will do that.\n\n  He is not a yes-man to anybody. He is not a yes-man to people who \nwould oppose him in this body. He is not a yes-man to the President. He \nhas far too distinguished a career to be a yes-man, with less than 14 \nmonths left in an administration, for him to say: OK, I am just going \nto roll over and approve something I disagree with, in the final 14 \nmonths of an administration.\n  We need an Attorney General. We need an Attorney General in this \ncountry. This one has been pending far too long. I ask my colleagues \nwho are seeking to oppose him--I think primarily on the grounds that \nthey just want to oppose the Attorney General nominee of the United \nStates or oppose the President--to back up and to take a second look at \nthis gentleman and his great qualifications, his integrity he has \nconducted his entire life with, what he has specifically said about \nwaterboarding, and find it in themselves to do the right thing and \nsupport him. This is an outstanding nominee who doesn't deserve this \nsort of treatment. We need to get this vote up and approved.\n  I believe the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, whom I have worked \nwith a great deal and whom I have a great deal of respect and \nadmiration for, is going to hold hearings on Judge Mukasey on Tuesday, \nand a vote. I am hopeful we can vote him out of committee and vote him \nthrough the Senate, clearly before the Thanksgiving Day break. We need \nto. We need an Attorney General. This is the right man at the right \ntime for this job.\n  I thank you very much, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation that reauthorizes the State Children's Health\n\n[[Page S13678]]\n\nInsurance Program, SCHIP. Section 301 authorizes the revisions provided \nthat certain conditions are met, including that the legislation not \nresult in more than $50 billion in outlays for SCHIP over the period of \nfiscal years 2007 through 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the \ndeficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 \nor the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that H.R. 3963, the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2007, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-\nneutral reserve fund for SCHIP legislation. Therefore, pursuant to \nsection 301, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget \nresolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Rougle\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in remembrance of SSG Larry I. \nRougle of West Valley City. It is my privilege to speak regarding the \ntremendous sacrifice of this honored soldier.\n  On October 23, 2007, in the Kunar Province in Afghanistan, Sergeant \nRougle died when his battalion encountered enemy fire. He was assigned \nto the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Airborne Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne \nBrigade. At the time of his death, he was only 25 years old. However, \nthe sergeant had already given seven honorable years of service to the \nU.S. Army and been deployed on several tours of duty to Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  Graduating early from high school at the age of 17, Sergeant Rougle \ntold his father that he had made the important decision to enter into \nmilitary service. The sergeant's family said that he loved what he did, \nand that his main purpose was to help the poor people in war-torn \ncountries.\n  He followed a great family military legacy. His father Ismael Rougle \nserved in the Army for 25 years, which included a tour in Vietnam, and \nhis son wanted to follow in his father's footsteps from a very young \nage. As a child, Sergeant Rougle would emulate his father by dressing \nup in his father's uniforms.\n  Sergeant Rougle was scheduled to come home for a midtour leave to \ncelebrate his father's birthday and planned to take his 3-year-old \ndaughter Carmin to Disneyland. By all accounts, he loved his daughter \nmore than anything. Over the years, young Carmin will learn that her \nfather was not just a great man--he was a hero.\n  It is our responsibility to never forget heroes like Sergeant Rougle. \nMay his sacrifice always solemnly echo within us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13678-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REQUEST FOR SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of the \nSenate to the most-underreported story of the year: the continuing \nsuccess of our troops in Iraq. In particular, I would like to call my \ncolleagues' attention to an article by the American Enterprise \nInstitute's Fred Kagan in this week's Weekly Standard, which \narticulately speaks to the magnitude of the change in direction that \nhas taken place in Iraq.\n  The article reports how our soldiers and marines turned an imminent \nvictory for al-Qaida in Iraq into a humiliating defeat for them and \nthereby created an opportunity for further progress not only in Iraq \nbut also in the global struggle against terror. In the past 5 months we \nhave seen stunning results from the Petraeus strategy: terrorist \noperations in and around Baghdad have dropped by 59 percent; car bomb \ndeaths are down by 81 percent; casualties from enemy attacks dropped 77 \npercent; and, violence during the just-completed season of Ramadan--\ntraditionally a peak of terrorist attacks was the lowest in 3 years.\n  However, Mr. President, winning a battle is not the same as winning a \nwar. Our commanders and soldiers are continuing the fight to ensure \nthat al-Qaida does not recover even as they turn their attention to the \nnext battle: the fight against Shia militias sponsored by Iran.\n  What's more, these victories are not irreversible. Al-Qaida is a \nresourceful organization. If we let up, they can still recover. That is \nwhy our strategy on the ground must be based on the advice and \nexperience of our generals and not the political necessities of the \nmajority party here in Washington. We must resist politically-motivated \nmaneuvering, whether it be in the form of artificial timelines for \nwithdrawal or efforts to have politicians in Congress change the \nmission that has been delivering results.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, Nov. 5, 2007]\n\nWinning One Battle, Fighting the Next: America Needs To Be Heartened by \n                Our Success in Iraq, and Seize a Victory\n\n                        (By Frederick W. Kagan)\n\n       America has won an important battle in the war on terror. \n     We turned an imminent\n\n[[Page S13679]]\n\n     victory for Al Qaeda In Iraq into a humiliating defeat for \n     them and thereby created an opportunity for further progress \n     not only in Iraq, but also in the global struggle. In the \n     past five months, terrorist operations in and around Baghdad \n     have dropped by 59 percent. Car bomb deaths are down by 81 \n     percent. Casualties from enemy attacks dropped 77 percent. \n     And violence during the just-completed season of Ramadan--\n     traditionally a peak of terrorist attacks--was the lowest in \n     three years.\n       Winning a battle is not the same as winning a war. Our \n     commanders and soldiers are continuing the fight to ensure \n     that al Qaeda does not recover even as they turn their \n     attention to the next battle: against Shia militias sponsored \n     by Iran. Beyond Iraq, battles in Afghanistan and elsewhere \n     demand our attention. But let us properly take stock of what \n     has been accomplished.\n       At the end of 2006, the United States was headed for defeat \n     in Iraq. Al Qaeda and Sunni insurgent leaders proclaimed \n     their imminent triumph. Our own intelligence analysts and \n     commanders agreed that our previous strategies had failed. \n     The notion that a ``surge'' of a few brigades and a change of \n     mission could transform the security situation in Iraq was \n     ridiculed. Many experts and politicians proclaimed the \n     futility of further military effort in Iraq. Imagine if they \n     had been heeded.\n       Had al Qaeda been allowed to drive us from Iraq in \n     disgrace, it would control safe havens throughout Anbar, in \n     Baghdad, up the Tigris River valley, in Baquba, and in the \n     ``triangle of death.'' Al Qaeda In Iraq had already \n     proclaimed a puppet state, the Islamic State of Iraq, and was \n     sending money and fighters to the international al Qaeda \n     movement even as it was supplied with foreign suicide \n     bombers and leaders by that movement. The boasts of Osama \n     bin Laden that his movement had defeated the Soviet Union \n     were silly--al Qaeda did not exist when the Soviet Union \n     fell--but they were still a powerful recruiting tool. How \n     much more powerful a tool would have been the actual \n     defeat of the United States, the last remaining \n     superpower, at the hands of Al Qaeda In Iraq? How much \n     more dangerous would have been a terrorist movement with \n     bases in an oil-rich Arab country at the heart of al \n     Qaeda's mythical ``Caliphate'' than al Qaeda was when \n     based in barren, poverty-stricken Afghanistan, a country \n     where Arabs are seen as untrustworthy outsiders?\n       Instead, Al Qaeda In Iraq today is broken. Individual al \n     Qaeda cells persist, in steadily shrinking areas of the \n     country, but they can no longer mount the sort of coherent \n     operations across Iraq that had become the norm in 2006. The \n     elimination of key leaders and experts has led to a \n     significant reduction in the effectiveness of the al Qaeda \n     bombings that do occur, hence the steady and dramatic \n     declines in overall casualty rates.\n       Al Qaeda leaders seem aware of their defeat. General Ray \n     Odierno noted in a recent briefing that some of al Qaeda's \n     foreign leaders have begun to flee Iraq. Documents recovered \n     from a senior Al Qaeda In Iraq leader, Abu Usama al-Tunisi, \n     portray a movement that has lost the initiative and is \n     steadily losing its last places to hide. According to \n     Brigadier General Joseph Anderson, chief of staff for the \n     multinational coalition in Iraq, al-Tunisi wrote that ``he is \n     surrounded, communications have been cut, and he is desperate \n     for help.''\n       How did we achieve this success? Before the surge began, \n     American forces in Iraq had attempted to fight al Qaeda \n     primarily with the sort of intelligence-driven, targeted \n     raids that many advocates of immediate withdrawal claim they \n     want to continue. Those efforts failed. Our skilled soldiers \n     captured and killed many al Qaeda leaders, including Abu \n     Musab al Zarqawi, but the terrorists were able to replace \n     them faster than we could kill them. Success came with a new \n     strategy.\n       Al Qaeda excesses in Anbar Province and elsewhere had \n     already begun to generate local resentment, but those local \n     movements could not advance without our help. The takfiris--\n     as the Iraqis call the sectarian extremists of al Qaeda--\n     brutally murdered and tortured any local Sunni leaders who \n     dared to speak against them, until American troops began to \n     work to clear the terrorist strongholds in Ramadi in late \n     2006. But there were not enough U.S. forces in Anbar to \n     complete even that task, let alone to protect local \n     populations throughout the province and in the Sunni areas of \n     Iraq. The surge of forces into Anbar and the Baghdad belts \n     allowed American troops to complete the clearing of Ramadi \n     and to clear Falluja and other takfiri strongholds.\n       The additional troops also allowed American commanders to \n     pursue defeated al Qaeda cells and prevent them from \n     reestablishing safe-havens. The so-called ``water balloon \n     effect,'' in which terrorists were simply squeezed from one \n     area of the country to another, did not occur in 2007 because \n     our commanders finally had the resources to go after the \n     terrorists wherever they fled. After the clearing of the city \n     of Baquba this year, al Qaeda fighters attempted to flee up \n     the Diyala River valley and take refuge in the Hamrin \n     Ridge. Spectacular bombings in small villages in that \n     area, including the massive devastation in the Turkmen \n     village of Amerli, roughly 100 miles north of Baghdad, \n     that killed hundreds, were intended to provide al Qaeda \n     with the terror wedge it needed to gain a foothold in the \n     area. But with American troops in hot pursuit, the \n     terrorists had to stay on the run, breaking their movement \n     into smaller and more disaggregated cells. The addition of \n     more forces, the change in strategy to focus on protecting \n     the population, both Sunni and Shia, and the planning and \n     execution of multiple simultaneous, and sequential \n     operations across the entire theater combined with a shift \n     in attitudes among the Sunni population to revolutionize \n     the situation.\n       Some now say that, although America's soldiers were \n     successful in this task, the next battle is hopeless. We \n     cannot control the Shia militias, they say. The Iraqis will \n     never ``reconcile.'' The government will not make the \n     decisions it must make to sustain the current progress, and \n     all will collapse. Perhaps. But those who now proclaim the \n     hopelessness of future efforts also ridiculed the possibility \n     of the success we have just achieved. If one predicts failure \n     long enough, one may turn out to be right. But the \n     credibility of the prophets of doom--those who questioned the \n     veracity and integrity of General David Petraeus when he \n     dared to report progress--is at a low ebb.\n       There is a long struggle ahead in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and \n     elsewhere against al Qaeda and its allies in extremism. We \n     can still lose. American forces and Afghan allies defeated al \n     Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2001 as completely as we are \n     defeating it in Iraq. But mistakes and a lack of commitment \n     by both the United States and the NATO forces to whom we \n     handed off responsibility have allowed a resurgence of \n     terrorism in Afghanistan. We must not repeat that mistake in \n     Iraq where the stakes are so much higher. America must not \n     try to pocket the success we have achieved in Iraq and \n     declare a premature and meaningless victory. Instead, let us \n     be heartened by success. We have avoided for the moment a \n     terrible danger and created a dramatic opportunity. Let's \n     seize it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13679-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13679-S13680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MACKINAC BRIDGE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the State of Michigan today celebrates the \n50th anniversary of the bridging of Michigan's two peninsulas through \nthe engineering feat known as the Mackinac Bridge. A suspension bridge \nspanning a 5 mile stretch of the Straits of Mackinac, the Mighty Mac or \nBig Mac has become an icon of Michigan.\n  Although dreams of connecting the Upper and Lower Peninsula by bridge \nbegan in the 1880s, it would take more than 70 years for that dream to \nbecome a reality. In the meantime, ideas for crossing the straits \nranged from the improbable--a floating tunnel to the impractical--a \nseries of bridges and causeways--to the doable--a ferry service.\n  In 1923, Michigan began car ferry service across the Straits of \nMackinac between Mackinaw City and St. Ignace. Traffic on the car \nferries became so heavy within just five years that another option--a \nbridge--needed to be seriously considered. The State Highway Department \nundertook a feasibility study that reported favorably on a bridge.\n  Although the need and the know-how were there, the money was not. The \nMackinac Straits Bridge Authority of Michigan, established in 1934 by \nthe State legislature, tried twice that decade to obtain Federal funds \nfrom the federal Public Works Administration but was refused. World War \nII stopped further progress on a bridge.\n  In January 1951, the Mackinac Straits Bridge Authority issued a \nfavorable feasibility study. Legislation to finance and build the \nbridge passed in early 1952. The Authority was ready to offer bonds for \nsale by March 1953, but the money market had weakened. Later that \nspring, the Michigan Legislature passed a bill to pay for the annual \noperating and maintenance costs of the bridge from gasoline and license \nplate taxes. The market strengthened by the end of the year and almost \n$1 billion worth of Mackinac Bridge bonds were sold.\n  Prentiss M. Brown, a former U.S. Senator and chairman of the board of \nDetroit Edison Company, served as the first chairman of the Mackinac \nBridge Authority and shepherded the process of securing financing for \nthe Mackinac Bridge. In the words of Jack Carlisle, an announcer for \nWWJ radio in Detroit, Brown ``refused to accept defeat when it seemed \ninevitable. Prentiss M. Brown just wouldn't stay licked.''\n  Construction of the bridge officially began on May 7 and 8, 1954, \nwith ceremonies in St. Ignace and Mackinaw City. Designed by Dr. David \nB. Steinman, building the Mackinac Bridge required a complex \nchoreography of engineering detail and construction skill as evidenced \nby the 4,000 engineering drawings and 85,000 blueprints. Over 11,000 \npeople worked on the bridge including 350 engineers, 3,500 workers on \nsite and 7,500 workers at quarries, mills, and shops elsewhere.\n\n[[Page S13680]]\n\n  On November 1, 1957, the Mighty Mac opened to traffic with the formal \ndedication taking place the following June. The dream of bridging the \nUpper and Lower Peninsula had finally become a reality.\n  At 552 feet above the water, the main towers of Big Mac are almost \nexactly as high as the Washington Monument, which stands at 555 feet. \nWhen measured by its total length of 26,372 feet, the Mackinac Bridge \nqualifies as the longest suspension bridge in the United States, but \nfalls to third place behind the Golden Gate Bridge and Verrazano \nNarrows Bridge if only the suspended portion of the bridge is counted.\n  Once a year, the Big Mac opens its span to the oldest form of \ntransportation--walking. Begun in 1958, the annual Mackinac Bridge Walk \nhas become a Labor Day tradition for Michigan families on both \npeninsulas. The bridge's beautiful silhouette beckons thousands with \nthe promise of an exhilarating 5-mile walk and spectacular views of \nshoreline and water from 200 feet above the Straits of Mackinac.\n  Over the past 50 years, the Mackinac Bridge has become an elegant \nlandmark for our State and a source of pride for all of us. Today \nMichigan commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Mackinac Bridge with \na celebration at Bridge View Park in St. Ignace. My heart is with all \nthe people who are there celebrating, and I wish the rest of me were \nthere too. Congratulations, Big Mac.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13680-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE, EN BLOC HOTLINES\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to share my concerns regarding the \nprocess currently being utilized by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee to pass legislation on the Senate floor. As many of my \ncolleagues know, I am currently objecting to unanimous consent on two \nen bloc packages reported by the committee, containing more than 40 \nbills.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues that I do not object to all of \nthe bills contained in the two packages. In fact, I have offered to \ngive consent to all those bills where I have no fiscal or policy \nconcerns. Unfortunately, the committee is insisting on passing all of \nthe legislation en bloc and will not allow the noncontroversial bills \nto be released for passage. These bills are in effect being held \nhostage by the committee.\n  As my colleagues know, I evaluate all unanimous consent requests, in \npart, on whether the proposed legislation increases authorizations for \nspending. If it does, I also look to see whether the new cost has been \noffset by a corresponding reduction in another program authorization. I \nalso review each bill for specific policy concerns.\n  Of most concern to me, the two packages authorize over $150 million \nin new spending, without a single offset. This does not include the \n$640 million reauthorization for the Geologic Mapping Program. I have \noffered to work with the committee to identify possible offsets that \nwould allow the en bloc packages to move forward. Given the \nconsiderable program oversight performed by the committee, I am eager \nto hear where it believes other programs may not be working as intended \nor where they may have become of a lesser priority than the bills \ncurrently under consideration.\n  As stewards of the Federal tax dollar, I believe it is imperative we \nproceed with the hard but necessary work of prioritizing our spending. \nEvery American taxpayer is forced to do this every day, and so should \nwe. Prioritization begins with the authorization process, and so does \nlong-term fiscal discipline.\n  I renew my pledge to work with any Member of this body to identify \noffsets, to ensure that our actions today never add to the already \nheavy financial burden we have placed on the next generation of \nAmericans.\n  It is my hope the committee will abandon the practice of en bloc \nunanimous consent requests. Each bill should be considered on its \nmerits, and if it is truly worthwhile, should be allowed to stand on \nits own. As an institution, this Senate is more than capable of this \ntask.\n  To make the Record absolutely clear, I am including the list of \nnoncontroversial bills in these packages that should be cleared and \nallowed to pass under unanimous consent: S. 216, S. 266, S. 241, S. \n202, S. 232, S. 262, S. 220, H.R. 386, S. 320, S. 553, H.R. 497, H.R. \n658, S. 1139, H.R. 235, H.R. 482, H.R. 467.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13680-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VETERANS HOSPITALS COMBAT STAPH INFECTIONS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I find it disturbing and disheartening to \nknow that efforts to heal through modern medicine end up creating new \nmedical problems, in addition to those that are preexisting. \nUnfortunately, this is what is occurring with the rise of dangerous \ndrug-resistant forms of staph that have become prevalent as of late. I \nwant to talk about the potential dangers of these infections, \nespecially in a medical environment where patients are most vulnerable, \nand also give much-deserved praise to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for their work to combat staph infections in their hospitals.\n  There are many types of staph bacteria. While some forms of staph are \nharmless, others are fatal. A recent study conducted by the Association \nfor Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology suggests that \nas many as 1.2 million U.S. hospital patients are infected every year \nby a form of staph that is resistant to drugs.\n  Drug-resistant staph, often referred to as MRSA, Methicillin-\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus, has adapted in response to common \nantibiotics which have been used to combat these and other infections. \nMost staph infections arise from visits to the hospital and other \nhealth care settings.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs is taking effective steps to \nreduce staph infections in their hospitals. Based on a successful pilot \nprogram at VA's Pittsburgh health care system, VA has instituted a \nstaph prevention program in all 153 of their hospitals. Their \nprevention system is based on a strategy of enhanced hygiene and \nculture change among health care workers. Patients are monitored, \nproven precautions are followed for those affected, and close attention \nis paid to common sources of infection. The Pittsburgh pilot led to a \n50-percent decline in staph infections, something Acting VA Secretary \nGordon Mansfield referred to as ``dramatic reductions'' in staph \ninfections, and I look forward to similarly positive outcomes across \nthe veterans' health care system.\n  It is my hope that VA will continue to improve their prevention \nprograms and share information with other health care providers. This \nwill help VA safeguard our veterans and their families from staph \ninfections, serve as a successful model for our country's hospitals and \nmedical facilities, and improve the well-being of our Nation's \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13680-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13680-S13681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss several important \ntax relief measures that expire this year.\n  As several of my colleagues have noted, these provisions are \nimportant to many of our folks back home and have a direct impact on \ntheir daily lives and pocketbook. This tax relief has put more money in \ntaxpayers' pockets rather than the government coffers and needs to be \nextended.\n  I am pleased to introduce legislation to extend two expiring tax \nrelief measures.\n  The first measure ensures that we continue to provide a 7-year \ndepreciation schedule for motorsports complexes. This is an important \ntax relief provision to hundreds of race facilities across the country, \nboth large and small.\n  In Kansas, more than 30 tracks can benefit from this depreciation \nschedule. It allows race facilities to make important safety and \nmodernization investments under a depreciation schedule that reflects \nthe ongoing need to maintain these facilities.\n  The largest track in Kansas, the Kansas Speedway, which was just \ncompleted in 2001, has been the economic driver in the revitalization \nof Kansas City, KS. What was once one of the most economically \ndepressed areas in Kansas is now one of the fastest growing. The \nspeedway alone contributed more than $150 million to the local economy \nin its first year, creating 3,300 new jobs and generating $10 million \nin property taxes and $26 million in sales taxes.\n\n[[Page S13681]]\n\n  The track has spurred new investment in the area, including a 400-\nacre retail and entertainment center that has brought in more than 90 \nbusinesses and 5,500 jobs. Because of this growth, an additional $750 \nmillion in development in the area is underway. The area has become the \nlargest tourist attraction in Kansas, bringing in 12 million visitors \nper year.\n  As we look at extending tax relief, I hope we will be mindful of the \ntremendous economic benefit that these facilities generate in our home \nStates.\n  I am also pleased to introduce legislation to extend an important \ncharitable giving provision that we initially passed last year as part \nof the Pension Protection Act. This provision allows individuals age \n70\\1/2\\ or older, who must begin taking distributions from their \nindividual retirement accounts, to donate those distributions to a \ncharitable organization without incurring tax on the distribution. \nIndividuals many donate up to $100,000.\n  I have heard from many charitable organizations in Kansas that have \nalready seen the benefits of this legislation, including colleges and \nuniversities, that tell me that many donors are making good use of this \ntax relief provision.\n  At the University of Kansas for example, this provision has helped \ngenerate 94 gifts totaling more than $2.8 million. The gifts have \nranged from $100 to $100,000--the rollover maximum.\n  Smaller colleges are also benefitting. Sterling College, located in \ncentral Kansas, has an enrollment of 607 students. Last year the \ncollege raised a total of $2 million dollars in unrestricted gifts. \nMore than 10 percent of that amount, $253,000, was raised as a result \nof this provision. In addition, one donor who had previously given \n$1,000, increased her gift to over $80,000 as a direct result of the \nIRA charitable rollover provision.\n  This provision has proven to be an important incentive to encourage \nsmall donors to give, and is an important tool for charities to attract \nnew donors. I encourage my colleagues to support an extension of this \nmeasure.\n  I would also like to share my support for two other measures that \nextend expiring tax relief. The first is the deduction for tuition and \nhigher education expenses, introduced by Senator Cornyn. I am pleased \nto cosponsor this legislation.\n  This deduction is an important benefit for many families who are \nlooking for ways to pay for a college education. It allows a deduction \nof up to $4,000 for tuition and related expenses. Nearly 49,000 Kansas \ntaxpayers benefitted from this deduction in 2005. Across the country, \nmore than 4.5 million taxpayers claimed the deduction.\n  We have taken a number of steps in Congress to help families manage \nthe cost of a college education. This deduction is another important \nbenefit that we need to extend to aid families paying for college.\n  In addition, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation introduced by \nSenator Inhofe that extends an important tax incentive for marginal oil \nand gas wells.\n  Recognizing the value of oil and gas wells decline over time, the tax \ncode allows depletion deductions to recover investments in marginal oil \nand gas wells.\n  Under one method of depletion deduction--percentage depletion--15 \npercent of the taxpayer's gross income from an oil- or gas-producing \nproperty is allowed as a deduction in each taxable year. The amount \ndeducted generally may not exceed 100 percent of the net income from \nthat property in any year. However, this limitation is suspended for \nmarginal wells prior to January 1, 2008.\n  Extending this provision is critical for marginal wells, which are a \nkey source of domestic oil and gas production and create thousands of \njobs.\n  Marginal wells account for 17 percent of the oil produced \ndomestically and about 9 percent of natural gas. There are more than \n401,000 marginal oil wells in the U.S. which comprise 80 percent of all \nof the Nation's oil wells. They produced more than 321 million barrels \nof oil in 2005. This production prevented the U.S. from spending an \nadditional $16 billion on imported oil. Kansas ranks third among States \nin the number of marginal wells; and fourth in production from these \nwells.\n  The number of marginal gas wells has steadily increased over the past \n10 years and production has increased accordingly. Over the past 10 \nyears, production from the Nation's 288,000 marginal gas wells has \nnearly doubled. Kansas has the largest continuous natural gas reservoir \nin the lower 48 States and ranks eighth in the number of marginal gas \nwells, and second in production from these wells.\n  As we look to reduce reliance on foreign oil it is important we keep \nin mind that marginal oil and gas wells are an key source of domestic \nproduction. We need to maintain existing tax incentives to encourage \nthese small producers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13681-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE PETER HOAGLAND\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na good friend and great Nebraskan, former U.S. Representative Peter \nHoagland, who passed away Tuesday at the age of 66. Peter was a very \nspecial friend to all who knew him. His tenure in Congress coincided \nwith my first 4 years serving as Governor of the State of Nebraska, and \nI will always remember Peter's thoughtful advice and advocacy on issues \nimportant to our mutual constituents.\n  Peter worked to do what he believed was right for his district and \nour state. An Omaha native and alumnus of Omaha Central High School, \nPeter represented the good people of Nebraska's largest metropolitan \narea in one capacity or another for 14 years through two terms in the \nNebraska Legislature and three representing Nebraska's Second District \nin the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Elected to the Nebraska Unicameral in 1978, Peter later assumed a \nleadership role as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. This role \nsuited him well, as he was a Yale-educated attorney, having completed \nhis law degree in 1968 after serving our country as a U.S. Army \nintelligence officer. Peter was active on important topics such as \nground water protection, and he spearheaded the passage of landmark \ndrunk-driving legislation.\n  Peter was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988, where \nhe served three terms. He focused his efforts on the inner workings of \nhis committees. Peter was a workhorse, not a show horse; and he made \nhis presence felt on many issues, particularly those pertaining to \nbanking and the environment.\n  Peter Hoagland was a true leader; and while he may have left public \nservice, he never left public life. As a tribute to his immense legacy, \nNebraska Democrats honored Peter with the Hall of Fame Award at the \nMorrison-Exon Dinner earlier this year. I am grateful we had that \nopportunity to let Peter know how much he meant to all of us.\n  I offer my most sincere condolences to Peter's wife Barbara and their \nfamily. Peter's passion for service, his dynamic leadership, and his \nunwavering dedication will remain a source of inspiration to all who \nknew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13681-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13681-S13682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       COMMENDING HAWAII'S YOUTH\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I congratulate a number of young \nadults from Hawaii for being selected to perform on the National Public \nRadio, NPR, program, ``From the Top.'' ``From the Top'' is a weekly, \nhour-long show featuring America's most talented, young musicians. It \nis one of the most listened to programs on public radio with an \naudience of approximately 750,000 each week, over 250 stations \nnationwide. The show is hosted by pianist Christopher O'Riley and \nrecorded in front of a live audience.\n  The young adults include those from the Hawaii Youth Opera Chorus Na \nLeo Kuho`okahi ensemble: Sienna Achong, Juliana Besenbruch, Olivia \nBorges, Ka'iulani Bowers, Karyn Castro, Hina Felmet, Pili Gardner, \nMakena Hamilton, Marika Ikehara, Alana Mueller, Jade Olszowka, Noe \nRamirez, Erin Richardson, Sarah Sagarang, Kanoe Tjorvatjoglou, Krysti \nUranaka, and Kiyoe Wellington. Also performing are: Laura Bleakley, \nMaile Cha, Jacob DeForest, Asia Doike, Irwin Jiang, Annie Kwok, Alda \nLam, Andrew Ramos, Tyler Ramos, Yulia Sharipova, Rachel Stanton, and \nT.J.

The first \nperformance will be at Oahu's historic Hawaii Theatre on November 14, \nand the second at Maui Arts and Cultural Center on November 16. In \naddition to being taped, the students will be participating in \nassemblies at eight schools on three islands. Approximately 100 young \npeople are chosen each year to appear on ``From the Top,'' so to have \nHawaii's youth be selected is truly an honor.\n  The students' hard work and devotion to music has allowed them to \nexcel in the performing arts. However, they would not have been able to \nsucceed without the support of their family, friends, and instructors. \nInstructors play an essential role in guiding a student, and they need \nto be commended for their hard work and dedication to teaching as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13682-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING MISS LESLIE OSBORN\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I congratulate Leslie K. Osborn for \nearning Hawaii's first Silver Award in Venturing, the highest award in \nthe Venturing program of the Boy Scouts of America. Leslie will be \nhonored with this award at the annual Aloha Council Eagle Scout Banquet \nin April of 2008.\n  Venturing was created by the Boy Scouts of America in 1998 to provide \npositive experiences for young men and women and the tools needed to \nbecome responsible and caring adults.\n  Involvement in the Boy Scouts of America is a long-standing tradition \nin the Osborn family. Both Leslie's older brother, Bobby, and her \nyounger sister, Heather, are active in the program. Parents, LTC John \nand Patricia Osborn, teach their children strong family values and \nrespect for God and country. Leslie is a strong young woman who is \nmotivated by the desire to prove that she has the same capabilities as \nboys. She spends much of her time building her strength in wilderness \nsurvival through such activities as camping, climbing, and hiking.\n  Leslie is also an exceptional student. She has maintained a 4.0 GPA \nat Kalaheo High School while enjoying hobbies such as dancing jazz and \nballet. She is very involved in community services, both on her own \ntime through her work at the Marine Corps commissary and through her \nactivities in the Boy Scouts program. She has participated in numerous \ncommunity outreach programs, including the annual Toys for Tots program \nas well as beach cleanups. She plans to attend college with the goal of \nbecoming a veterinarian.\n  I look forward to hearing more about Leslie's successes as she \ncontinues to pursue her education and personal goals. Congratulations \nto her parents John and Patricia, who have raised their daughter to be \na remarkable young lady.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to a group of 84 World War II veterans from the Acadiana \nregion of Louisiana that is making its way to Washington this weekend. \nHere the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo \nJima memorials as well as Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath \nat the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n  The trip to the Nation's Capital this Saturday is being sponsored by \na group in Lafayette, LA, called Louisiana HonorAir. The organization \nis honoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving \nthem a chance to see the memorials dedicated to their service. So far \nthis year, there have been four trips to these Washington landmarks, \nand this weekend's trip will be the final one this year.\n  World War II was one of the greatest achievements in American \nhistory, and was also the deadliest conflict. More than 60 million \npeople worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, and more \nthan 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the long war. \nThe ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in Europe is a \ntestament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines. The years 1941-1945 also witnessed an unprecedented \nmobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our military on two \ndistant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today about 44,000 living WWII veterans, \nand every one of them has their own heroic tale of their experience in \nachieving the noble victory of freedom over tyranny. Veterans in this \ngroup began their service in 1940 before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, \nand served as late as 1957, between the Korean and Vietnam wars. They \nserved in every branch of the military--35 members in the Army; \nincluding a Buffalo soldier based in Italy; 27 in the Navy; 16 in the \nArmy Air Corps, now the Air Force; five in the Marines; and one in the \nCoast Guard. The spent their service in the European and Pacific \ntheaters as well as stateside and participated in many famous battles, \nincluding the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Normandy and the \nBattle of the Bulge.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 83 men and one woman, \nall Louisiana heroes, that we welcome to Washington this weekend and \nLouisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13682-4", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13682-S13683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FOUNDER'S AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to expand the boundaries of the Thunder Bay National \nMarine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Thunder Bay \nNational Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve Boundary Modification \nAct to expand the boundaries of the existing sanctuary.\n  Created as a unique Federal-State partnership in October 2000, the \nThunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary has been a resounding success. It \nhas preserved the proud maritime history of the Great Lakes, offered \neducational opportunities to children and researchers, and provided a \nfascinating site for divers and snorklers to explore. Expanding the \nsanctuary will bring even greater benefits.\n  When the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration originally \nconsidered the Sanctuary, it recommended an area that was twice as big \nas what was eventually established. That proposal was scaled back to \naddress concerns raised by some state and local communities who wanted \nto begin cautiously. Some of the doubters and most cautious at the \nbeginning have now become the biggest supporters of the sanctuary. \nToday, the expansion has broad support throughout the area.\n  Specifically, this bill would extend the sanctuary's boundaries to \ninclude the waters off Alcona, Alpena and Presque Isle Counties in \nMichigan and\n\n[[Page S13687]]\n\nwould extend the sanctuary east to the International boundary. This \nwould be a significant increase in total area. The current sanctuary \nincludes 448 square miles of water and 115 miles of shoreline, and the \nexpansion would include 3,722 square miles and include 226 miles of \nshoreline.\n  This expansion is needed to protect the maritime history of Michigan \nand the Great Lakes. Historically, this region was influenced by the \ndemand for natural resources. Because local roads were so inadequate, \nthe Great Lakes became an important passageway and trading route for \nsettlement and industrialization. The geography of Thunder Bay and the \nweather patterns in the lakes, however, caused dozens of ships to \nperish in what mariners call ``Shipwreck Alley.'' Many of these \nshipwrecks are well-preserved because they are in freshwater and of \ngreat interest to researchers and students.\n  The current sanctuary holds 116 shipwrecks though many, many more \nshipwrecks in this area have been mentioned in historical records. In \naddition to shipwrecks, the sanctuary protects and interprets the \nremains of commercial fishing sites, historic docks, and other \nunderwater archaeological sites.\n  Expanding the boundaries as provided for in this bill will protect an \nestimated 178 additional shipwrecks. For example, it would protect the \nCornelia B. Windiate, which is a three-mast wooden schooner and one of \nthe Great Lakes' most intact shipwrecks. The ship sank in December 1875 \nwhen bound from Milwaukee to Buffalo with a cargo of wheat, and was \nfeatured in an episode of Deep Sea Detectives on the History Channel. \nExpansion would also cover the H.P. Bridge, a three-mast wooden \nbarkentine, containing many artifacts such as pottery, clothing, and \nship tackle and hardware.\n  These shipwrecks are not only historically important, they are very \npopular with divers. Deep water wrecks are popular for technical \ndivers, and because the sites are often well preserved in the cold \nfreshwater, they contain many artifacts and provide a treasure of \ninformation about the past. Many of the shallow water wrecks are \naccessible by snorkelers, boaters and kayakers. These sites offer a \ntremendous amount of archaeological data on ship architecture and are \ngenerally easier to document.\n  The sanctuary is also making important contributions to research and \neducation. Using real-time video links, students in Alpena interact \nwith divers exploring underwater worlds with people who are thousands \nof miles away. In the near future, students from around the country \nwill be able to control remote submarines that allow them to explore \nthe E.B. Allen or the steamship Montana. Visitors to Thunder Bay can \nalso view artifacts and interpretive exhibits and watch films about \nThunder Bay and all of our Nation's Maritime Sanctuaries. Scientists \nfrom around the world dock their vessels in the Thunder Bay River as \nthey use the facility for their research.\n  The sanctuary has also been a real asset for the local community, and \nthe community has responded in kind. Since the establishment of the \nsanctuary, the community has worked with it to improve the Alpena \nCounty George N. Fletcher Library, to provide volunteers at festivals \nand outreach events, and to help digitize the Thunder Bay Sanctuary \nResearch Collection.\n  The Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary deserves to be expanded. \nDoing so will preserve important maritime history and will continue the \nsuccess of the current Sanctuary. It is a unique treasure that needs \nour support. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2282. A bill to increase the number of full-time personnel of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission assigned to duty stations at United \nStates ports of entry or to inspect overseas production facilities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to increase \nthe number of full-time personnel of the Consumer Product U.S. Safety \nCommission assigned to duty stations at U.S. ports of entry or to \ninspect overseas production facilities to ensure that the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission has the personnel necessary to adequately \naddress the growing problem of import safety. This bill would more than \ntriple the current number of commission staff assigned to U.S. ports of \nentry, by requiring that no less than 50 full-time import inspectors be \nin place at the beginning of the next fiscal year. Additionally, it \nwould expressly authorize the CPSC to send such inspectors to examine \nthe operations at overseas factories which manufacture consumer \nproducts destined for the U.S.\n  This legislation is critically necessary, given that an ever-\nincreasing number of the consumer products now sold on our shelves are \nmanufactured in countries with appalling safety and quality control \nstandards, such as China. Sine the year 2000, foreign imports to the \nU.S. have increased 67 percent by value, with imports from China nearly \ntripling, growing from $100 billion in 2000 to $288 billion last year. \nAlmost 20 percent of consumer products sold in the U.S. today were made \nin China. Particularly troubling is that Chinese manufacturers have \ncornered the U.S. market on toys, with over 80 percent of all toys sold \nin the U.S. coming from China. Since March 2007, over 8 million pieces \nof these Chinese-made toys have been recalled due to lead contamination \nalone.\n  Outrageously, the number of CPSC personnel dedicated to monitoring \nimport compliance with U.S. health and safety requirements has been \nslashed along with other Commission resources during the very period in \nwhich trade liberalization has allowed foreign producers greater access \nto our markets. With over 60 percent of CPSC staff having been cut over \nthe past 27 years--from almost 1,000 employees in 1980 to a record low \nof 420 employees in 2007--there remain only 15 full-time Commission \npersonnel assigned to inspect imports at U.S. ports. According to a \nSeptember 2, 2007, New York Times article, this handful of import \ninspectors ``are hard pressed to find dangerous cargo before it enters \nthe country; instead, they rely on other Federal agents, who mostly act \nas trademark enforcers.'' Similarly unacceptable is the fact that the \nCPSC lacks the staff to send a single inspector to the foreign \nfactories making the goods that we put on our kitchen counters and in \nthe hands of our children.\n  These facts unquestionably reveal, as a Consumers Union official told \nthe Senate Committee on Finance earlier this month, that the CPSC has \nnot kept up with the globalization of the marketplace. That is why I \nhave proposed this bill, which would rapidly shore-up the commission's \nimport inspection staff, who are so critical to protecting us from \ndangerous foreign products. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncommon-sense solution to an urgent problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2287. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe percentage depletion allowance for certain hardrock mines, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am very pleased to be joined by \nSenators Cantwell and Feinstein in introducing legislation to eliminate \nfrom the Federal tax code the ``Percentage Depletion Allowance'' for \nhardrock minerals mined on Federal public lands. Elimination of this \ndouble subsidy will produce estimated savings of at least $500 million \nover 5 years, based on the most recent year for which figures are \navailable from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Clinton \nadministration's fiscal year 2001 budget proposal. These savings will \nhelp fund the reclamation and restoration of abandoned mines through an \nAbandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, that my bill creates, and the \nremaining \\3/4\\ of savings will be returned to the Federal treasury.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were initiated by the Corporation \nExcise Act of 1909. That is right, these allowances were initiated \nnearly 100 years ago. Provisions for a depletion allowance based on the \nvalue of the mine were made under a 1912 Treasury Department \nregulation, but difficulty in applying this accounting principle to \nmineral production led to the initial codification of the mineral \ndepletion allowance in the Tariff Act of 1913. The\n\n[[Page S13688]]\n\nRevenue Act of 1926 established percentage depletion much in its \npresent form for oil and gas. The percentage depletion allowance was \nthen extended to metal mines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by the \nRevenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted several times since.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the tax \ncode to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction \nindustries far below tax rates on other industries, providing \nincentives to increase investment, exploration, and output. The \nproblem, however, is that percentage depletion also makes it possible \nto recover many times the amount of the original investment.\n  There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to \nrecover the costs of its capital investment: cost depletion and \npercentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the \nactual capital investment--the costs of discovering, purchasing, and \ndeveloping a mineral reserve--over the period during which the reserve \nproduces income. Under the cost depletion method, the total deductions \ncannot exceed the original capital investment.\n  Under percentage depletion, however, the deduction for recovery of a \ncompany's investment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income,'' namely, \nsales revenue from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total \ndeductions typically exceed the capital that the company invested. The \nset rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the Internal Revenue Code contains depletion allowances for more \nthan 70 metals and minerals, at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent.\n  There is no restriction in the tax code to ensure that over time \ncompanies do not deduct more than the capital that a company has \ninvested. Furthermore, a Percentage Deduction Allowance makes sense \nonly so long as the deducting company actually pays for the investment \nfor which it claims the deduction.\n  The result is a double subsidy for hardrock mining companies: first \nthey can mine on public lands for free under the General Mining Law of \n1872, and then they are allowed to take a deduction for capital \ninvestment that they have not made for the privilege to mine on public \nlands. My legislation would eliminate the use of the Percentage \nDepletion Allowance for mining on public lands, resulting in an \nestimated savings of $450 million over 5 years, while continuing to \nallow companies to recover reasonable cost depletion.\n  My bill would also create a new fund, called the Abandoned Mine \nReclamation Fund. One-fourth of the revenue raised by the bill, or \napproximately $110 million, would be deposited into an interest-bearing \nfund in the Treasury to be used to clean up abandoned hardrock mines in \nstates that are subject to the 1872 Mining Law. Though there is no \ncomprehensive inventory of abandoned mines, estimates put the figure at \nupwards of 100,000 abandoned mines on public lands.\n  There are currently no comprehensive federal or state programs to \naddress the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites \nrequires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up \nabandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a \nfirst step toward providing the needed authority and resources.\n  In today's budget climate, we are faced with the question of who \nshould bear the costs of exploration, development, and production of \nnatural resources: the taxpayers, or the users and producers of the \nresource? For more than a century, the mining industry has been paying \nnext to nothing for the privilege of extracting minerals from public \nlands and then abandoning its mines. Now those mines are adding to the \nnation's environmental and financial burdens. We face serious budget \nchoices this fiscal year, and one of those choices is whether to \ncontinue the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry.\n  The measure I am introducing is straightforward. It eliminates the \nPercentage Depletion Allowance for hardrock minerals mined on public \nlands while continuing to allow companies to recover reasonable cost \ndepletion.\n  Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a \ngovernment-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, there is \nnow sufficient reason to adopt a more reasonable depletion allowance \nthat is consistent with depreciation rates given to other businesses. \nThis corporate subsidy is simply not justified.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kerry to \nintroduce the Small Business Lending Oversight and Program Performance \nImprovements Act of 2007. I truly appreciate Senator Kerry's leadership \non small business issues and his bipartisan work with me on this bill.\n  Small businesses have propelled our Nation's economic growth, \nproducing more than 50 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, GDP, and \ncreating between 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs annually. The Small \nBusiness Administration's loan guarantee programs are a vital source of \nfinancing for many of these small start-up firms, entrepreneurs seeking \nworking capital, and small businesses that must purchase larger office \nspace or secure factory equipment so they can continue to expand.\n  At the same time, the SBA's 7(a) and 504 lending programs will not \nendure if careless oversight, and a lack of standards, allow scandal to \ntarnish the good names of these programs. The 7(a) and 504 lending \nprograms will not survive if we cannot prove to taxpayers that the \nmoney spent to guarantee small business loans actually produces \neconomic vitality, opportunity, and new jobs, for our Nation. Make no \nmistake, the only way to protect these integral programs and \ndemonstrate their effectiveness and economic growth capacity is through \nthe use of concrete measurements.\n  In order for the SBA's lending portfolios to grow and allow more \nsmall firms to secure the capital they require, the SBA must quantify \nboth quality and performance by establishing the specific criteria it \nwill examine and then assess changes in these factors over time. \nAdditionally, these benchmarks must be codified and transparent so that \nlenders and small businesses understand what is being measured.\n\n  The problem is this: although the SBA evaluates portfolio quality, \nand uses these assessments to conduct lender oversight, the SBA has \nfailed to provide participating lenders with some of the criteria or \nformulas the Agency uses to determine if their portfolios are sound or \nsubstandard. This lack of transparency not only hinders the SBA's \nlender oversight capabilities, it causes participating 7(a) and 504 \nlenders to be critical of the SBA's ability to accurately assess \nportfolio quality. Regrettably, the SBA's current oversight and \nportfolio quality assessment methods have not prevented recent high-\nprofile scandals from occurring.\n  Currently, the SBA has roughly $60 billion in outstanding loans \nissued to small businesses. Yet incredulously it does not track these \nbusinesses' economic performance. While the SBA's total loan volume has \nincreased substantially over the last 10 years, the agency has no way \nto show how these loans benefitted the U.S. economy. Ultimately, the \nSBA is unaware of how many jobs these loans have created, whether \ncompany net-sales or revenues have increased after securing capital, or \nhow many of these companies prepay, default, or go out of business. \nThough the purpose of these loans is to spur economic growth, the SBA \ndoes not assess the actual economic outcomes these loans help make \npossible. Without these measurements, how can the SBA attest to the \nincredible economic lift and vitality these loans help generate?\n  Two recent Government Accountability Office reports, one from July of \nthis year and one from June of 2004, recommended that the SBA improve \nits economic performance and portfolio quality measurements. Our bill \nwould implement the GAO's recommendations and improve the performance \nmeasures for 7(a) and 504 loans. Among other things, the bill would \nrequire the SBA to: create standards for lenders' portfolio quality; \nincrease the transparency of the SBA's lender oversight evaluation \nmeasures; report on borrowers' economic performance; and create a 7(a) \nand 504 portfolio default rate that can be compared directly to \ncommercial lenders' default rates.\n  We have an obligation not only to maintain, but to strengthen and \nimprove the SBA's key loan programs that I have heard time and again \nare a critical lifeline to the job generators we call small businesses. \nThe remedies that Senator Kerry and I are proposing today are necessary \nfor the SBA's lending programs to expand, and reach all of the small \nbusinesses that must have access to capital.\n  I urge my colleagues to strongly support the Small Business Lending \nOversight and Program Performance Improvements Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Lending \n     Oversight and Program Performance Improvement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Recent reports by the Government Accountability Office \n     have recommended that the Small Business Administration \n     develop better measurements and methods for measuring the \n     performance of lending programs and the effectiveness of \n     lender oversight.\n       (2) A July 2007 report by the Government Accountability \n     Office entitled ``Small Business Administration: Additional \n     Measures Needed to Assess 7(a) Loan Program's Performance'' \n     found the following:\n       (A) Determining the success of the loan programs under \n     section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)) \n     ``is difficult as the performance measures show only outputs \n     - the number of loans provided - and not outcomes, or the \n     fate of the businesses borrowing with the guarantee.''.\n       (B) ``The current measures do not indicate how well the \n     agency is meeting its strategic goal of helping small \n     businesses.''.\n       (C) ``To better ensure that the 7(a) program is meeting its \n     mission responsibility of helping small firms succeed through \n     guaranteed loans, we recommend that the SBA administrator \n     complete and expand the SBA's current work on evaluating the \n     program's performance measures. As part of that effort, at a \n     minimum, the SBA should further utilize the loan performance \n     information it already collects, including but not limited to \n     defaults, prepayments, and number of loans in good standing, \n     to better report how small businesses fare after they \n     participate in the 7(a) program.''.\n       (3) A June 2004 report by the Government Accountability \n     Office entitled ``Small Business Administration: New Services \n     for Lender Oversight Reflect Some Best Practices but Strategy \n     for Use Lags Behind'' found that ``Best practices dictate the \n     need for a clear and transparent understanding of how a risk \n     management service and the tools it provides will be used.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein in introducing legislation to designate the facility of the \nU.S. Postal Service located at 16731 Santa Ana Avenue in Fontana, \nCalifornia, as the ``Beatrice E. Watson Post Office Building.''\n  Beatrice ``Bea'' Watson was a former city clerk and councilwoman of \nFontana who volunteered tirelessly for her community. In an Inland \nValley Daily Bulletin profile last year, fellow Fontana residents \ndescribed Bea as a generous person who was devoted to her city, her \nfriends, and the many organizations with which she worked.\n  Over the 40 years of her residence in Fontana, Bea was involved with \nnumerous civic and community service organizations, including the \nFontana Woman's Club, the Fontana Historical Society, Chamber of \nCommerce, the Fontana Exchange Club, Parks and Recreation and the \nFontana Parent Teacher Association.\n  Bea also was responsible for the continued existence of the Fontana \nDays Parade, the annual summer celebration of the city's 1913 founding \nby A.B. Miller, even dipping into her own pocket at times to keep the \nparade going.\n  This August, Bea Watson, ``Mrs. Fontana,'' passed away, and I know \nher loss has been deeply felt by her family and the community. The \nFontana City Council asked Congress to honor Bea for bringing the whole \ncommunity together for the betterment of Fontana. I am proud to \nintroduce this bill, and encourage my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Bea Watson's example of dedicated service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Carper, and Mr. \n        Levin):\n  S. 2291. A bill to enhance citizen access to Government information \nand services by establishing plain language as the standard style of \nGovernment documents issued to the public, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Plain \nLanguage in Government Communications Act of 2007. I am pleased that \nSenators Claire McCaskill, Tom Carper, and Carl Levin have joined me as \noriginal co-sponsors of this bill.\n  Our bill is very similar to H.R. 3548, introduced by Representative \nBruce Braley in September, along with original co-sponsors \nRepresentatives Todd Akin, Dan Burton, James McGovern, and Nancy Boyda.\n  This bill would establish plain language as the standard writing \nstyle for Government documents issued to the public. Plain language is \nlanguage that the intended audience can readily understand and use \nbecause it is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best \npractices of plain language writing.\n  This bill would extend an initiative that President Bill Clinton and \nVice President Al Gore started nearly a decade ago as part of the \nReinventing Government initiative. In 1998 President Clinton directed \nagencies to write in plain language. Although many agencies have made \nprogress in writing\n\n[[Page S13692]]\n\nmore clearly, the requirement never was fully implemented, and in \nrecent years, the focus on writing in plain language has flagged. This \nlegislation will renew that focus.\n  The benefits of requiring the Government to write in plain language \nare numerous.\n  For example, using plain language improves customer service. \nVeterans, taxpayers, senior citizens, and others who need to understand \nGovernment instructions and fill out Government forms should not have \nto wade through complicated, bureaucratic language. Needlessly \ncomplicated Government documents waste countless hours of taxpayers' \ntime and cause unnecessary errors. The Federal Government works best \nfor the American people if Government documents are clear and \nstraightforward. Filling out Government forms should not be like \nsolving a complex crossword puzzle.\n  Writing in plain language also will make the Government more \nefficient and cost effective. Agencies that write in plain language \nspend less time answering customer service questions, and they obtain \nbetter compliance because people make fewer mistakes.\n  Furthermore, using plain language makes Government more transparent. \nThe American people cannot hold their Government accountable if no one \ncan understand the information that the Government provides about its \nactions and its requirements.\n  Numerous organizations have called on Congress to require the Federal \nGovernment to use plain language. For example, the AARP wrote a letter \nin support of this legislation stating that every day AARP members \ncontact AARP staff because they do not understand letters that they \nreceived from the Federal Government. The confusion is not the readers' \nfault. It is because many Federal Government letters are written in \ndense, complicated language that few people who are not lawyers could \nbe expected to understand. Certainly, anyone who has ever filled out \ntheir own tax forms can sympathize.\n\n  Additionally, several small business organizations--including the \nNational Small Business Association, the Small Business Legislative \nCouncil, and Women Impacting Public Policy--support the need for plain \nlanguage. The reason is simple. Small businesses waste considerable \ntime, effort, and money trying to decipher what the Federal Government \nrequires of them.\n  This bill addresses two important elements for ensuring that use of \nplain language becomes standard in Federal agencies: training and \noversight.\n  Each agency will report their plans to train employees to write in \nplain language. Writing in plain, clear, concise, and easily \nunderstandable language is a skill that Congress and Federal agencies \nmust foster. As Thomas Jefferson once said, ``The most valuable of all \ntalents is that of never using two words when one will do.'' As a \nformer teacher and principal, I understand that even very smart people \nmust be trained to write plainly.\n  Additionally, strong congressional oversight will ensure that \nagencies implement the plain language requirements. Agencies will be \nrequired to designate a senior official responsible for implementing \nplain language requirements. Each agency will be required to report to \nCongress how it will ensure compliance with the plain language \nrequirement and on its progress.\n  A few examples of the documents that will be covered by the plain \nlanguage requirement are Federal tax forms; veterans' benefit forms; \ninformation for workers about Federal health, safety, overtime pay, and \nmedical leave laws; Social Security and Medicare benefit forms; and \nFederal college aid applications. These documents help the American \npeople obtain important Government benefits and improve their quality \nof life.\n  To avoid imposing an unmanageable burden on agencies, agencies will \nnot be required to re-write existing documents in plain language. Only \nnew or substantially revised documents will be covered. Similarly, this \nbill does not cover regulations, so that agencies can focus first on \nimproving their every day communications with the American people. We \nrecognize that it will be more challenging to write regulations--which \nby their nature often will be complex and technical--in plain language.\n  Requiring agencies to write in plain language is an important step in \nimproving the way the Federal Government communicates with the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, to \nestablish the Office for Bombing Prevention, to address terrorist \nexplosive threats, and\n\n[[Page S13693]]\n\nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to introduce the National Bombing \nPrevention Act of 2007, an important measure to strengthen our domestic \ndefenses against terrorist attacks using explosives.\n  Terror bombings have a long and bloody history around the world and \nhere in the United States. In 1920, for example, an anarchist bombing \nin front of the New York Stock Exchange killed 38 people and wounded \nhundreds more. More recently, the 1990s bombings of the World Trade \nCenter and the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and attacks in \nIndonesia, Spain, and Great Britain remind us of the vicious and \nindiscriminate threat posed by bombs. As Secretary of Homeland Security \nMichael Chertoff has noted, they are the weapon of choice for \nterrorists.\n  The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security tell us that threat \nfrom these devices is not only real, but growing. Furthermore, the \nNational Intelligence Estimate has identified improvised explosive \ndevices or IEDs as a significant homeland-security threat.\n  As recent years' bombings demonstrate, the costs of inadequate \nprecautions can be horrendous. And as the threat of bomb attacks by \nhome-grown terrorist rises--witness the plot to bomb the JFK airport in \nNew York--we must be increasingly on guard. Much effort and much \nfunding has been directed to train and equip law-enforcement and other \npersonnel to detect and disrupt bomb plots, yet we still lack a formal, \nfull-fledged national strategy to coordinate and improve the \neffectiveness of those efforts.\n  The legislation I introduce today will improve our defenses against \nthese weapons. I am proud to be working again with the bill's chief co-\nsponsor, Senator Joe Lieberman, on this new effort to protect our \nnation.\n  The bill has also won the support of people directly involved in the \nfight against the threat of terrorist bombings. They include the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security; the National Bomb Squad Commanders \nAdvisory Board; the National Tactical Officers Association; the \nInternational Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators; the \nMaine Emergency Management Agency; and the police departments of Bangor \nand Portland, Maine.\n  The National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007 has three main elements: \nFirst, the bill will clarify the responsibilities of the DHS Office of \nBombing Prevention and authorize $25 million funding in both FY 2009 \nand 2010, up from the current Senate-passed funding level of $10 \nmillion in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill now pending at \nconference.\n  Our national fight against terrorist bombings is a large and multi-\nfaceted undertaking. It includes screening airline passengers, checking \ncargo, securing dangerous chemicals, protecting critical \ninfrastructure, promoting research and development of anti-IED \ntechnology, and sharing information among Government and private-sector \npartners. The DHS Office of Bombing Prevention is a leader in this \nfight.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill builds on the Office's past efforts. Among \nother things, the bill designates the Office of Bombing Protection as \nthe lead agency in DHS for combating terrorist explosive attacks; tasks \nOBP with coordinating national and intergovernmental bombing-prevention \nactivities; and assigns it responsibility for assisting state and local \ngovernments and cooperating with the private sector.\n  A key element of Federal assistance is training. Last week, for \nexample, members of several Maine and Connecticut police departments \nreceived DHS training and briefings here in Washington, as well as an \nFBI update, and fresh information on improvised explosive devices. My \nbill will bring more of that training to the States and make it more \naccessible to local law-enforcement officers.\n  Second, the bill directs the President to accelerate the release of \nthe National Strategy for Bombing Prevention and to update it every \nfour years. As terrorists' tactics change, we must review and adjust \nour counter-measures to defeat them.\n  Third, the bill will promote more research and development of \ncounter-explosive technologies and facilitate the transfer of military \ntechnologies for domestic anti-terror use.\n  My legislation is badly needed. We need to make sure that bomb squads \nhave the latest and most accurate information on bombing threats. We \nneed to raise awareness of the signs of possible threats, including \npurchases of pre-cursor materials and other suspicious activities. We \nneed to improve information sharing and coordination of activities \namong all levels of government as well as the private sector.\n  Under my legislation, the Department of Homeland Security will have \nthe legal authority, the responsibility, and the resources to ensure \nthat state and local law-enforcement personnel receive the training and \ninformation they need to protect us.\n  The National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007 will give our country \nimportant new protections. The need for that protection has been amply \ndemonstrated by repeated acts of savagery, and the threat of terrorist \nbombs continues to grow. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my Ranking Member \non the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator \nCollins, in introducing bipartisan legislation to strengthen our \nNation's ability to deter, detect, prevent, and respond to attacks \nusing improvised explosive devices, IED, in the U.S.\n  As we have seen in Iraq, London, and Germany, IEDs are a weapon of \nchoice for terrorists. The reality is that an IED is relatively easy \nand inexpensive to make and can cause mass casualties, even to armored \nmilitary personnel. IEDs are a global threat, and the American public, \nhere at home, is not immune.\n  Federal efforts to address this threat, however, have not been \nadequate. The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Bombing \nPrevention, which is the Department's lead agent for IED countermeasure \ncoordination, is currently operating with a substantially reduced \nbudget of $5 million, down from the $14 million it received in fiscal \nyears 2005 and 2006. Only $6 million has been requested for 2008. By \ncontrast, the DHS Office of Health Affairs, which has a similar \ncoordination responsibility for biosecurity and medical preparedness, \nhas a proposed budget for personnel and coordination activities of $28 \nmillion for 2008. Given the likelihood of an IED attack, we need to \nmake a comparable commitment in this area. As Secretary Chertoff said \nin an October 19 speech, ``although we can conceive of a terrorist \nattack that would be focused on a biological infection or some kind of \na chemical spray, the reality is the vast majority of terrorist attacks \nare conducted with bombs. And of those, the vast majority are \nimprovised explosive devices.''\n  The National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007, NBPA, would formally \nauthorize the Office of Bombing Prevention, OBP, and increase its \nbudget to $25 million. In addition to leading bombing prevention \nactivities within DHS, OBP would be directed to coordinate with other \nFederal, State, and local agencies and fill the existing gaps that are \nnot covered by another Federal agency's current bombing prevention \nefforts. For example, OBP would work with state and local officials to \nconduct a national analysis of bomb squad capabilities. This type of \ncomprehensive assessment does not currently exist at any level of \ngovernment, yet it is integral to understanding what resources are \navailable in the event of an explosion and where we should invest in \norder to better prepare the Nation as a whole. OBP would also improve \ninformation sharing with state and local bomb squads by providing \nregular updates on terrorist tactics, techniques, and procedures.\n  The NBPA would require the President to deliver a long awaited \nNational Strategy for Improvised Explosive Devices. This Strategy was \nsupposed to be delivered to Congress by DHS in January 2007 but was \nthen reassigned to the Department of Justice by presidential directive. \nTurf battles have caused further delay. This is simply unacceptable. \nRegardless of who takes the lead, the Nation must have a coherent \nstrategy guiding its counter IED efforts that will clarify the roles \nand responsibilities of all Federal agencies.\n  Finally, our legislation would require DHS to establish a program \nexpediting\n\n[[Page S13694]]\n\nthe transfer of counter IED technology to first responders. Under this \nprogram, the Department would work with other Federal agencies, \nincluding the Department of Defense, the private sector, and state and \nlocal bomb experts to identify existing technologies that could help \ndeter, detect, prevent, or respond to an explosive attack. Often, there \nis a significant lag time between the research and development of such \ntechnologies and deployment by the end user. This bill would hold DHS \naccountable for seeing products through to the deployment phase. \nSpecifically, DHS would be required to develop an electronic \ncountermeasures capability to disable radio controlled bombs. Radio \n``jammers'' have been developed by DoD for Iraq and Afghanistan, but \nthat technology needs to be significantly modified for the civilian \nenvironment.\n  Improvised explosive devices are one of the most popular weapons \nterrorists are using today. They can be easily assembled from \ninstructions available on the Internet with readily available chemicals \nsuch as peroxide or ammonium nitrate. And, most importantly, terrorists \nall over the world have demonstrated their intent and ability to use \nthese weapons to kill and maim large numbers of people. If DHS is to \nplan effectively for future attacks here at home, it must have a \ncohesive and robust defense against the most likely threats. I ask my \ncolleagues to join us in ensuring DHS and its partners have the \nnecessary tools to protect the U.S. from an improvised explosive \ndevice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Bunning, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. \n        Ensign):\n  S. 2293.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \na voter-verified permanent paper ballot under title III of such Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today, joined by Senator \nWhitehouse, I am introducing the Voter Confidence and Increased \nAccessibility Act of 2007. As we enter the month of November, next \nyear's national election is just one year away, and we must act now to \nensure that the next time Americans go to the polls nationwide, they \nhave the chance to cast their vote and have their vote counted as \nintended.\n  Our bill will require all voting machines--beginning in the 2008 \nelection--to produce a paper record of each ballot that can be verified \nby the voter before a ballot is submitted to be counted. This also is \nthe first bill to propose a nationwide ban, by 2012, on the use of \ntouch-screen voting machines in Federal elections.\n  We are introducing this bill to address the problems that have \nplagued the accuracy and integrity of our voting systems. We know all \ntoo well the problems that have occurred in Florida--in the 2000 \nelection and, most recently in the 2006 congressional election in the \n13th Congressional District--but my State is not alone. Recent studies \nin California and elsewhere have demonstrated that touch-screen voting \nmachines are unreliable and vulnerable to error.\n  The bottom line is we have to ensure that every vote is counted--and \ncounted properly. Citizens must have confidence in the integrity of \ntheir elections.\n  Florida, under the leadership of Governor Charlie Crist and Secretary \nof State Kurt Browning, has acted decisively, and on a bipartisan \nbasis, to require the replacement of paperless touch-screen voting \nmachines throughout the State with optical scan equipment. By using op-\nscan machines, voters will have the opportunity to complete a paper \nballot that will be verified by the voter before it is electronically \ncounted. By 2012, touchscreen voting machines will be a thing of the \npast in Florida. Using Florida's model, the bill I am filing today will \nphase out touch-screen voting machines in Federal elections nationwide \nby 2012.\n  This morning I met with Secretary Browning to discuss my intent to \nfile legislation modeled on Florida's initiative. Secretary Browning \nindicated his support for a ban on touch-screen voting machines.\n  In addition to banning touch-screen machines by 2012, and requiring a \nvoter-verified paper ballot for every vote that is cast, beginning in \nNovember 2008, other highlights of the bill are as follows.\n  It will require and fund routine random audits to be conducted by \nhand count in 3 percent of precincts in all Federal elections. If the \nvote is very close, that percentage goes up to 5 or 10 percent. On the \nother hand, if the winning candidate received more than 80 percent of \nthe vote, no audit of that race will be necessary.\n  The bill will authorize adequate funding--$1 billion--for replacing \nand upgrading voting equipment.\n  Our legislation will require that every voter has the opportunity to \nvote by paper ballot if the voting machine in their precinct is broken, \nand beginning in 2012, for any reason.\n  Finally, the bill will establish an arms-length relationship between \ntest labs and voting machine vendors, to prevent any efforts, malicious \nor otherwise, to compromise the accuracy and integrity of voting \nmachines.\n  A companion version of our bill was introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Rush Holt of New Jersey, and was passed out of \nCommittee. The bill now awaits a vote by the full Chamber. I hope my \ncolleagues in the House will act to pass this important legislation, \nand I invite my colleagues in the Senate to join me by co-sponsoring \nour bill in the Senate.

A bill to require the FCC to conduct an economic study on \nthe impact that low-power FM stations will have on full-power \ncommercial FM stations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould require the Federal Communications Commission to fulfill its \nobligation of conducting an economic study on the impact low-power FM \nstations have on full-power commercial stations. The reason it is \nimperative the FCC perform this study is because we don't have a \ncomprehensive understanding as to the effect that low-power FM stations \nhave on their full-power counterparts.\n  When Congress imposed the three-adjacent-channel restriction on low-\npower licensees in 2001, we tasked the FCC with conducting two studies \nbecause we were concerned about the interference LPFM stations could \ncause with being too close in frequency to full-power commercial \nstations. The two studies were to determine the impact that the \npresence of a low-power channel would have with respect to interference \nwith a nearby full-power station and the economic impact the presence \nof low power stations would bring to the commercial licensees. However, \nthe FCC completed only one study--the interference analysis.\n  My legislation calls for the FCC to complete an economic study on the \nimpact LPFM stations have on full-power commercial radio stations \nwithin 18 months and report its findings to Congress.\n  Volunteer, non-profit LPFM stations have found a niche but they also \nprovide competition to full-power stations without having to incur the \nsame costs as those commercial stations, particularly with the absence \nof licensing fees and employees' salaries. Most of us have raised \nserious concerns about the continued media consolidation that is \noccurring and negatively affecting localism and diversity.\n  Part of the reason for this consolidation is because local, \nindependently owned stations are seeing lower profit margins, which are \nmaking it more and more difficult to continue broadcasting. Due to \nshrinking profit, these stations either go out of business or are sold \nout to larger, nationwide companies. The buy-out of local stations by \nout-of-town firms does more to harm diverse and locally oriented \nbroadcasting than anything else. So we must actively investigate this \ntrend and determine what is contributing to the diminishing returns of \nindependently owned stations.\n  Some may question why perform this study since Mitre Corporation, the \ncompany that performed the initial interference study, recommended the \nFCC should not undertake the additional expense of a formal listener \ntest program or a Phase II economic analysis. The reason is because the \nPhase II economic analysis was only on the potential radio interference \nimpact of LPFM on incumbent full-power stations and did not take into \naccount other economic impacts that were outside the scope of that \neffort. The Government must ensure that by opening up low-power FM \nbroadcast opportunities we are not causing any undue harm to the full-\npower radio stations, which we have obligations to as the issuer of \ntheir licenses.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in supporting the critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2298.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould preserve the Federal Communications Commission's right to deny a \nlow-power FM license if the applicant has run afoul of basic, \nlongstanding Federal restrictions on the transmission of radio waves, \nsuch as if the applicant has been previously fined for running an \nunlicensed ``pirate'' radio station.\n  Before the issuance of low-power licenses, numerous individuals and \nentities operated low-power FM stations without a broadcast license. \nThese ``pirate'' stations many times broadcasted in open defiance of \nthe Commission's initial ban on LPFM broadcasts. From January 1998 to \nFebruary 2000, the Commission shut down, on average, more than a dozen \nunlicensed radio stations each month. On several separate occasions, \nthese unlicensed radio stations actually disrupted air traffic control \ncommunications.\n  Congress, through the enactment of the Radio Broadcast Preservation \nAct of 2000, directed the FCC to modify its low-power FM rules to \n``prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low-power FM license if the \napplicant has engaged in any manner in the unlicensed operation of any \nstation in violation of section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934'' \nso the Commission could curtail these pirate stations and disruption \noccurrence.\n  My concern is by completely repealing section 632, which pending \nlegislation proposes, it hinders the ability of the FCC to prohibit \napplicants from receiving low-power FM licenses. The Commission is \nresponsible for making sure broadcasters follow the basic rules and \nregulations that are inherently essential to having a broadcast service \nthat serves public interest since broadcasters are utilizing public \nspectrum. This legislation retains a targeted response to the problem \nof pirate broadcasting.\n  The commission is to grant a broadcast license only if the ``public \ninterest, convenience, and necessity would be served.'' Completely \nrepealing Section 632 could hinder the FCC from upholding this \nresponsibility with respect to low-power FM broadcasters. For this\n\n[[Page S13702]]\n\nreason, we must act to preserve the FCC's authority to be able to \nprohibit low-power FM licenses to applicants that have violated basic \ntenets of broadcast policy--it is only logical that we do this to \nensure businesses that use the public spectrum, in any capacity, \nadhered to laws government has put in place to serve and protect the \npublic interest.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in supporting the critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2299. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \nan advisory committee to develop recommendations regarding the national \naquatic animal health plan developed by the National Aquatic Animal \nHealth Task Force, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nI believe is vital to the prosperity and competitiveness of an element \nof agriculture that is often overlooked: American aquaculture. Some \nexperts estimate that to meet the demand for healthy, fresh \naquacultural products, global production will have to double in the \nnext 40 years. Yet in spite of this skyrocketing demand, America is at \nrisk of being left behind by other nations who have thus far exhibited \ngreater foresight than we have; putting into place a comprehensive \ninfrastructure for sustainable seafood. While it is true that American \naquaculture sales exceeded an impressive one billion dollars in 2005, \nthis was a pittance when compared to the $70 billion market worldwide. \nIn fact, in 2006 the U.S. had a trade deficit in seafood production of \n$9.1 billion. With demand rising so dramatically globally and, in \nparticular, here at home, we cannot afford to fall behind any further.\n  That is why I have taken this opportunity to introduce the National \nAquatic Animal Health Act. This legislation will begin the process of \ncreating a national infrastructure that will attract investment, \nprotect the valuable stocks of our aquaculture farmers from disease, \nand create a unique, flexible partnership between the Federal \nGovernment, State agencies, and industry groups. Dedicated to \nproactively monitoring seafood stocks for disease, this program will \nemploy the resources and vast field experience of the Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service, or APHIS, coupled with experts on disease at \nvarious State agriculture and marine agencies and industry \nprofessionals to certify the health of all participating aquaculture \nspecies.\n  Modeled after similar animal monitoring programs already in place at \nAPHIS, this program will provide a nationwide set of standards, the \nkind of uniformity that is currently absent in the aquaculture \ncommunity. Instead, a myriad of jurisdictional conflicts and competing \nregulations among various states creates uncertainty and erects \nimpediments to interstate commerce. But this bill is not a set of \nonerous regulations imposed upon the private sector by a federal \nagency; under the legislation, states are required to opt-in to the \nprogram. They must choose to utilize the assets available in this \nlegislation to assist in preserving that state's particular aquaculture \nproducts.\n  My home State of Maine has tremendously benefited from aquaculture. \nThere are nearly three dozen hatcheries in the State, handling both \nfinfish and shellfish. Our 3,500 miles of coastline has served as an \nideal incubator for the expansion of the aquaculture industry. The \ntotal economic activity generated from the industry State-wide was over \n$130 million last year, providing jobs for over 1,000 hard-working \nMainers. This sort of productivity was not always the case. In 2001, \nnearly all the salmon stocks in Maine had to be eliminated due to an \noutbreak of a crippling, infectious disease known as ISA. It took the \nindustry years to recover. Now, the Great Lakes face the threat of the \nvirulent pathogen known as VHS. It is my hope that with swift passage \nof this legislation, we will no longer have to fear this kind of \nwidespread disease and the subsequent containment costs that could \ncause inestimable damage to an industry that is struggling to catch up \nto its global competitors. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation as we move forward on debating Federal farm policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2300. A bill to improve the Small Business Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing \nlegislation, the Small Business Contracting Revitalization Act of 2007, \ndesigned to protect the interests of small businesses in the Federal \nmarketplace.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have focused a considerable amount of energy \npromoting the interests of small businesses in the Federal marketplace. \nThe legislation that we are introducing today marks a critical step \nforward in this process.\n  It is no secret that the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship places a great deal of importance on moving \nlegislation forward in a bipartisan manner, the members of my Committee \nunderstand we represent the interests of all of our Nation's small \nbusinesses, the most important and dynamic segment of our economy. And \nnowhere is the bipartisan consensus stronger than in the area of \nFederal procurement and ensuring that our Nation's small businesses \nreceive their fair share of procurement opportunities. I am pleased to \nonce again be introducing bipartisan legislation with the Committee's \nranking member, Senator Olympia Snowe. Regardless of who has chaired \nthe Committee during our tenure together, we have both worked hard to \nimprove small business Federal procurement opportunities.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has one ultimate purpose, to \nexpand opportunities for small businesses to contract with the Federal \ngovernment. And the reality is that small businesses need all the help \nthey can get with respect to accessing the Federal marketplace. In \nfiscal year 2006 according to Eagle Eye Publishing, the Federal \nGovernment missed its 23 percent contracting goal by 3 percent. That 3 \npercent represents more than $12 billion in lost contracting dollars \nfor small businesses. Service-disabled veterans fared the worst when it \ncame to Federal contracting with only 0.87 percent of Federal dollars \ngoing to their firms. Women-owned firms only took in 2.57 percent of \nFederal dollars while they make up more than 30 percent of all \nprivately held firms. Minority-owned firms continue to face barriers to \nFederal contracting. The SDB and 8(a) program only accounted for 6.75 \npercent of Federal contracting. These numbers tell the stark story of \nwhy this legislation is so important. If small business is the engine \nthat drives our economy when it comes to Federal procurement that \nengine needs an overhaul. Our bill looks to make that overhaul as we \nlook at making improvements in five key areas.\n  The first area we attempt to make improvements in is the area of \ncontract bundling. Although contracting bundling may have started out \nas a good idea it has now become the prime example of the old saying \nthat too much of a good thing can be very, very bad. The proliferation \nof bundled contracts coupled with a decimation of contracting \nprofessionals within the Government threatens to kill small businesses' \nability to compete for Federal contracts. In our hearing on July 18, \n2007, on contracting, we heard testimony about the damage to \nopportunities for small businesses because of the lack of oversight and \ncontract bundling.\n  Our bill looks to address those issues by ensuring: accountability of \nsenior agency management for all incidents of bundling; timely and \naccurate reporting of contract bundling information by all Federal \nagencies; and improved oversight of bundling regulation compliance by \nthe Small Business Administration.\n  The bill also ensures that contract consolidation decisions made by a \ndepartment or agency, other than the Defense Department and its \nagencies, provide small businesses with appropriate opportunities to \nparticipate as prime contractors and subcontractors.\n  The second area that this bill attempts to address is subcontracting. \nThe Committee heard in the July 18 hearing and in a May 22, 2007, \nhearing on minority business about the challenges that many small \nbusiness subcontractors face when dealing with\n\n[[Page S13703]]\n\nprime contractors. Witnesses related that the way subcontracting \ncompliance is calculated creates opportunity for abuse. They also \nrelated that many small businesses will spend time, money and effort \npreparing bid proposals to be a part of a bid team and that once the \ncontract is won they never hear from the prime contractor again. Many \nalso complain about lack of timely payments after they have completed \nwork.\n  This bill attempts to deal with some of these issues by including \nprovisions designed to prevent misrepresentations in subcontracting by \nprime contractors. To accomplish this, the bill: provides guidelines \nand procedures for reviewing and evaluating subcontractor participation \nin prime contracts; authorizes agency pilot programs that will grant \ncontractual incentives to prime contractors who exceed their small \nbusiness goals; and requires prime contractors who fail to comply with \nsubcontracting plans to fund mentor-protege assistance programs for \nsmall businesses.\n  The third area that our legislation attempts to address is the \nupdating of the socioeconomic programs administered by the SBA. In our \nfirst hearing of the year on January 31, 2007, we heard veterans with \nservice connected disabilities speak about the difficulty that they are \nhaving accessing the Federal marketplace. It is clear that the \nGovernment is not doing enough. In fiscal year 2006, service-disabled \nveteran-owned businesses only got 0.87 percent of all Federal \nprocurement--well short of the 3 percent statutory goal.\n  Our bill will assist service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses \nin obtaining Government contract and subcontract opportunities by \nexpanding the authority for sole-source awards to SDV firms. In \naddition, the bill will allow: the surviving spouse of a service-\ndisabled veteran to retain the business's SDV designation for up to 10 \nyears following the veteran's death; the SBA to accept SDV firm \ncertifications from the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the \nestablishment of an SDV mentor-protege program by the SBA. Our veterans \nare returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and we owe it to them to give \nthem every opportunity at fulfilling the dream of entrepreneurship.\n  We heard from women business owners in our September 20, 2007, \nhearing, on women's entrepreneurship that the time has come to \nimplement the women's procurement program. The administration has \ncontinually postponed implementing a women's procurement program that \nbecame law 7 years ago. This bill tells SBA to get it done within 90 \ndays.\n  Another program sorely needing our attention is the 8(a) program. \nThis program was created to assist socially and economically \ndisadvantaged small businesses, but, as we heard during the May 22, \n2007, hearing, the financial threshold for inclusion in the program is \nout-dated and too restrictive. The net-worth thresholds have not been \nupdated since 1989. This bill allows for an inflationary adjustment to \nbe made to the threshold and it excludes qualified retirement accounts \nfrom consideration while calculating the threshold so that businesses \nthat belong in this program won't be shut out.\n  This bill also makes a number of changes to the HUBZone program. The \nbill would expand HUBZones to areas adjacent to military installations \naffected by BRAC. It will also make other changes that will expand the \nHUBZone program to subcontracting as well as creating a mentor protege \nprogram. I understand the stated goal of this program is to develop \nareas of poverty through government contracting. And while I agree that \nthis is a laudable goal I also remember the controversy that surrounded \nthe creation of this program in 1996. I am keenly aware that the \nHUBZone program was created to supplant race-conscious programs like \n8(a) and the small disadvantaged business program. I fought hard to \npreserve those programs then and I will continue to preserve and \nstrengthen those programs in the future. In the interests of moving \nthis bill forward and improving all of the programs I have agreed to \ninclude these priorities for Ranking Member Snowe. I look forward to \nworking with her to move the priorities that are important to all of \nthe socio-economic groups in this legislation.\n  The fourth area that we intend to update is the acquisition process. \nThis bill aims to increase the number of small business contracting \nopportunities by including additional provisions to reduce bundled \ncontracts and by reserving more contracts for small business concerns. \nThe bill accomplishes this by: authorizing small business set-asides in \nmultiple-award, multi-agency contracting vehicles; and requiring that \nagencies include advance plans on small business spending in their \nbudgets and submit a report describing the impact of each bundled \ncontract awarded by an agency. The bill also directs the SBA to \nannually report to Congress on small business participation in overseas \nGovernment contracts.\n  The last area that we tackle in this legislation is small business \nsize and status integrity. The Committee has heard from a number of \nsmall businesses about large businesses parading as small businesses. \nDuring our July hearing we looked at the list of the top 25 small \nbusinesses doing Federal contracting. On that list at least six clearly \nrecognizable multi-billion dollar corporations were among the top 25 \nsmall businesses listed including SAIC at number two. I have been \nadamant that small business contracts must go to small businesses. \nSmall businesses are losing billions of dollars in opportunities \nbecause of these size standard loopholes.\n  This bill attempts to address these issues by adding a new section, \nSec. 38, to the Small Business Act that is designed to strengthen the \nGovernment's ability to enforce the size and status standards for small \nbusiness certification. To achieve this, the new section establishes \nprocedures for protests, through the SBA, of small business set-aside \nawards made to large businesses; requires the development of training \nprograms for small business size standards; requires a government-wide \npolicy on prosecutions of size and status fraud; and requires a \ndetailed review of the size standards for small businesses by the SBA \nwithin 1 year.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a truly bi-\npartisan effort and we look forward to working with the rest of the \nSenate as we move this legislation forward. It is well past time to \nprovide greater opportunities for the thousands of small business \nowners who wish to do business with the Federal government. I believe \nthat this legislation is a good step toward opening those doors of \nopportunity.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting this bill Mr. \nPresident, ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to introduce, with \nChairman Kerry, the Small Business Contracting Revitalization Act of \n2007. This critical legislation is a product of consensus-building and \ncompromise over the past few years and truly reflects the bipartisan \nnature of our Committee. Thank you, Chairman Kerry, for working to make \nthis a truly bipartisan bill.\n  This legislation addresses the numerous barriers facing small \nbusinesses in securing their fair share of Federal contracting dollars. \nCurrently, small businesses are eligible for $340 billion in Federal \ncontracting dollars, yet receive only $77 billion. Regrettably, the \nFederal Government consistently fails to satisfy its 23 percent small \nbusiness goal resulting in small businesses losing billions of dollars \nin contracting opportunities.\n  I am dismayed by the myriad ways that Government agencies have time \nand again egregiously failed to achieve\n\n[[Page S13711]]\n\nmost of their small business statutory ``goaling'' requirements. For \nexample, in fiscal year 2006, the Historically Underutilized Business \nZone, HUBZone, program met only 2.1 percent of its three percent goal, \nwhile our Nation's service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses \nreceived a Government-wide, paltry total of only 0.9 percent of its \nthree percent small business goal. This longstanding area of concern is \ncoupled with a litany of deficiencies that include ``contract \nbundling,'' sub-contracting misrepresentations, inaccurate small \nbusiness size determinations, flawed reporting data, and under-\nutilization of key small business contracting programs.\n  As the Chairman is well aware, these problems are not new, and our \nCommittee has held countless hearings on various contracting concerns \nthroughout the years. Business opportunities through Federal contracts \nprovide vital economic benefits for small businesses, which is why last \nyear, my Small Business Administration Reauthorization Bill, which \npassed our Committee unanimously, contained a robust package of small \nbusiness contracting initiatives.\n  Our legislation builds on the contracting provisions of that bill, by \nimproving all of the small business contracting programs--including the \nHUBZone, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, and \nservice-disabled veteran-owned small business programs. It equips the \nSBA with additional tools to meet the demands of an ever-changing 21st \ncentury contracting environment.\n  This bipartisan measure also includes several other priorities that I \nhave long championed--most notably, enhancing the HUBZone program. In \nmy home state of Maine, only 118 of 41,026 small businesses are \nqualified HUBZone businesses.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to \nencourage the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, to take \naction to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma.\n  In late September, tens of thousands of Burmese citizens, including \nthousands of Buddhist monks, took to the streets to demand a return to \ndemocracy in Burma. Tragically, the world watched in horror as Burma's \nmilitary junta implemented a brutal and ruthless crackdown resulting in \nthe death of hundreds and the detention of thousands.\n  The current Burmese government, the State Peace and Development \nCouncil, SPDC, is a military dictatorship that refused to relinquish \npower even after the Burmese people voted them out in a democratic \nelection in 1990. The winner of that election, the National League for \nDemocracy was not allowed to take power, and its leader, Daw Aung San \nSuu Kyi, was placed under house arrest, where she remains today.\n  The world must not stay silent while the people of Burma struggle for \ndemocracy and basic human rights. We have a moral responsibility to \nspeak out for the Burmese people who have been silenced by the junta.\n  The events of the last several weeks are reminiscent of the crackdown \non a similar uprising in the summer of 1988, in which an estimated \n3,000 people were killed. Today, the remaining leaders of that \nuprising, known as ``The 88 Generation Students,'' issued a letter to \nthe Chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, asking that \nit ``consider suspending the SPDC's membership in ASEAN if it continues \nto ignore the requests of the international community.'' This \nresolution echos that suggestion.\n  ASEAN has expressed ``revulsion'' over reports that the SPDC is using \ndeadly force to suppress demonstrators. I appreciate this strong \nstatement. Unfortunately, it is clear that words alone are not enough \nto force change within Burma. Later this month, ASEAN will hold its \nregional summit--a prime opportunity for ASEAN to back its words with \nconcrete action.\n  Yesterday, it was reported that the Buddhist monks were again \nmarching in the streets of Burma in clear defiance of the military \njunta. It is time for Burma's neighbors to apply real pressure on the \nmilitary government so that future violence can be avoided. I urge my \ncolleagues to stand with the people of Burma and support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/01/senate-section/article/S13712-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3497.
