Mr. President, on Friday, the Fourth of July--in fact the \nFourth of July had just broken; it was an hour and a half after \nmidnight--the Senate lost a Member of our Senate family: Jesse Helms of \nNorth Carolina.\n  I can't but think of Jesse Helms and the first name that enters my \nmind is\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nSenator Paul Wellstone. Paul Wellstone, as we all remember, was a \nSenator from Minnesota. I am sure it seems odd to most people--\nrecognizing their political proclivities; that is, those of Senator \nWellstone and those of Senator Helms--why my mind picks up Paul \nWellstone upon mentioning the name of Jesse Helms. It is hard to \nimagine two Senators more divergent in their views.\n  Senator Wellstone was clearly a liberal. Senator Helms was clearly a \nvery conservative man. Their views were very divergent, very different. \nIt is no secret because he told everyone when he came to Washington--\nPaul Wellstone made it clear he didn't like his rightwing colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Jesse Helms. He said that openly. But it was not \nlong before Paul Wellstone publicly changed his view of Senator Helms. \nSenator Wellstone continued to fiercely disagree with Jesse Helms on \nmost issues, but he quickly came to respect him for his sincerity.\n  When I came to the Senate, I, similar to all new Senators, was \nexcited to be here and understood what a great honor it was to \nrepresent the people of the State of Nevada in the Senate. But one of \nthe last people whom I was going to try to befriend was Jesse Helms. As \na moderate Democrat, I found his views extreme. We found little common \nground in points of policy, it appeared.\n  As a freshman Senator, I enjoyed presiding, as does the Presiding \nOfficer now presiding over the Senate. I spent my share of time in the \nseat the Presiding Officer now has. I enjoyed that very much. During my \ntime, that first 2 years I was in the Senate, I watched Jesse Helms \nright over here to my right, stand and talk often--and a lot. I can \nremember one time he was here--I was the Presiding Officer, he was over \nthere--there was not another person in this Chamber. Jesse Helms said \nto me, as sincerely as anyone could say anything--and he had a distinct \nspeaking voice--he said to me as sincerely as anyone could say \nanything, he said:\n\n       Mr. President, I don't want to be here on this issue but no \n     one else will come and talk on it.\n\n  It was an issue dealing with pornography. The speech Jesse Helms gave \nwas often on issues that other people would not speak out about. But I \nbecame so impressed with his sincerity, that he wasn't doing what he \nsaid for political reasons; he was doing it because that is what he \nbelieved. We all have to admire someone such as that, even though we \nmay disagree with what they speak.\n  I came to understand what Paul Wellstone had come to realize. I came \nto it before Paul Wellstone did because I got here before he did. \nWhether you agreed with the Senator from North Carolina, his sincerity \nand his views and the forthright way in which he stood by them were \nremarkable. So I believe it is fitting that Jesse Helms' last day on \nEarth was the Fourth of July. He loved his country. He spent every day \ndoing what he believed was necessary to make it stronger. His wife \nDorothy and children, Jane, Nancy, and Charles, along with seven Helms \ngrandchildren and one great grandchild are in our thoughts.\n  Rest well, Jesse Helms.\n  I have some other things to say, but perhaps my colleague wants to \nsay something about Senator Helms? If that is the case, I will save my \nremarks until he finishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6344-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend, the majority leader. Let me just \nadd, Jesse and Dot Helms were good friends of Elaine's and mine and \ngood friends of a lot of other people in the Senate on both sides. \nThere are a significant number of our conference planning to attend the \nfuneral tomorrow. I thank the majority leader for his accommodation of \nthose requests by having the votes on Wednesday morning. At Dot Helms' \nrequest, I will be doing one of the eulogies tomorrow at the funeral, \nand I will have more to say about the life of my good friend Jesse \nHelms when I get back. But I wish to echo the remarks of the majority \nleader about what a fine gentleman he was.\n  If you took a poll around here of the pages and the people who work \nin the Capitol about who was the most popular Member, I expect Jesse \nHelms would have won it--which would surprise an awful lot of people in \nthe press and out in America who thought of Senator Helms as sort of a \nfierce individual. In fact, in person, he was as gentle, as \naccommodating, and as friendly as anybody I have ever met. We all will \nmiss Jesse Helms a great deal.\n  I thank the majority leader for giving me an opportunity to make some \ncomments at this point about our good friend Jesse Helms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6344-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, just as the American people are recovering \nfrom a holiday weekend marked by record gas prices announced this \nmorning, averaging $4.11 a gallon--and it is much more than that in \nNevada; it is $4.25 in Nevada--another report in the news this morning \nsuggests oil might reach $200 before the end of the year--$200 a \nbarrel. It was only a couple months ago that President Bush seemed \nshocked and confused when a reporter suggested that some analysts were \npredicting that gas would reach $4 a gallon. Now some economists \nconsider $6 a gallon a very real possibility.\n  While most Americans enjoyed a day off from work on Friday to \ncelebrate the Fourth of July, no one gets a day off from paying record \ngas prices, record oil prices, and record grocery prices.\n  I spoke an hour ago to Verie Doing, who owns the biggest business in \nSearchlight. Verie and her late husband, Warren Doing, ran what might \nnot be much by most standards, but it is for the people in Searchlight. \nShe employs 70 or 80 people, and it is the biggest employer in \nSearchlight. She has a bar and casino, a restaurant. She said she is \nfeeling the impact of gas prices. Las Vegas is 60 miles away, there is \nno town closer, so in Searchlight you need the tourist trade.\n  She is similar to all small business people--they are struggling. \nThat is why on Thursday it was announced that Starbucks is closing more \nthan 600 stores; Dillard's will likely go out of business; Pep Boys \nwill likely go out of business. There are huge cutbacks in many other \ncompanies. Nine thousand stores will close before the end of the year. \nThat, of course, opens places that people are going to have to try to \nrent, probably at reduced rates if they even can rent them. So this is \na snowballing effect.\n  With rare exception, all these problems economically are caused by \ntwo things: the gas prices and the housing crisis. We have 8,500 new \nhome foreclosures every day. Americans are at risk of losing their \nhomes. They don't get a day off, of course. As American people endure \nsleepless nights trying to figure out how to make ends meet and provide \nfor their families, they deserve to know that Congress is working hard \nto help.\n  But what we are seeing is the Republican leaders, both in the House \nand in the Senate, simply refusing to work with Democrats on \nlegislation essential to our country in this economic recession. Of \ncourse, it is more focused on the Senate because, as we know, if you \nare in the majority of the House, you can move things. In the Senate, \nthat is not the way it is. We have the ability to filibuster things \nand, as we know, that is what has been going on in recent months.\n  My friend, Senator McConnell, said time and time again the way to get \nthings done in the Senate is through bipartisanship. There is no \nquestion about that. The only way you get things done in this body is \nbipartisanship, and that is why I have said if there is a change in the \nnumber of Senators we have next year, if there are more seats on this \nside of the aisle next year, we still have to work on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I am committed to doing that. I could not agree, as I have indicated,\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\nmore with Senator McConnell that we have to work on a bipartisan basis. \nThat is why in the waning days and hours of the last work period I \nbrought to the Senate legislation that was bipartisan in the truest \nsense, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that finally \ngives our troops the care and benefits they have earned with tremendous \nvalor; one of the most important things this country has done in \ndecades, a GI bill of rights.\n  Coincidentally, the Presiding Officer is the man who wrote that. \nThere are a lot of people, I am sure, knowing the humility the \nPresiding Officer has that you want to give credit, but the credit \nstarts with the Presiding Officer as the first person in line, in my \nmind, and Senator Hagel.\n  But it was bipartisan. That is how we got it done. As good and as \nintelligent, as necessary, as the GI bill of rights was, we could never \nhave gotten it done without the bipartisan support that Senator Webb of \nVirginia got for that bill.\n  We also introduced, right before we left, a housing bill to stem the \ntide of foreclosures and correct flaws in the lending laws to prevent \nforeclosure of future homeowners. In that we did not finish that bill \nbefore we left, add 10 days, make it a short period of time, that is \n85,000 homes have gone into foreclosure; 8,500 a day. Add one zero to \nthat, that is 85,000.\n  We had a Medicare doctors fix to prevent payment cuts for doctors and \nimprove care for patients. That was so important. I know that the \nattention is focused on the doctors, but it is more than the doctors. \nOf course, the doctors did not want a 10.6-percent cut. But that had a \ntremendous snowballing effect. Doctors cannot afford to take Medicare \npatients with this cut. They will not take them. I had the opportunity \nto go to dinner with two of my wife's physicians, people who have cared \nfor her over the years, during the break. One of them said: I am not \nsure I can take Medicare patients anymore--an internist, great \nreputation.\n  Not only does it affect that, many entities base their reimbursement \non what Medicare pays. So it is a very difficult situation. It was a \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  We also did, right before we left, a bill cutting taxes for \ninnovators and entrepreneurs, for developing clean alternative fuels \nthat would help end our addiction to foreign oil. So despite my friend, \nthe Republican leader's, words on embracing bipartisanship, the Senate \nRepublicans blocked all these strongly bipartisan bills except for the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, every one of them, and a few more.\n  The housing bill is supported by a strong bipartisan majority of \nRepublicans and Democrats. Cloture was invoked by a vote of 83 to 9, \nand the Dodd-Shelby-Baucus-Grassley substitute amendment was agreed to \nby a vote of 79 to 16. We could have finished that bill last work \nperiod, but Senate Republican leaders blocked housing.\n  Since then, as I have already said, another 85,000 homes have been \nforeclosed upon, or at least the foreclosure proceedings have started. \nThe Medicare doctors fix passed the House with a stunning 355-to-59 \nvote. Could anything be more bipartisan? Virtually every House Democrat \nand two-thirds of the House Republicans supported it. Two-thirds of the \nHouse Republicans supported it. How could anything be more bipartisan?\n  As we talked about before we left, one of the Republicans who voted \nagainst it apologized publicly, wrote a letter saying: I made a \nmistake.\n  Yet Republican leaders blocked the Medicare fix and chose to protect \ninsurance companies and the health care providers at the expense of \nelderly patients and their doctors. Last year these people my friends \non the other side of the aisle are trying to protect with the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, part of the Medicare bill that was passed some time \nago, made more than $15 billion.\n  To take care of this issue that is so important to the American \npeople, the so-called doctors fix, I explained how important it is; we \ntook a tiny bit of the $15 billion. So we should have done this. We \nshould have fixed it. It should not have been blocked. It was a choice \nmade to protect the HMOs and the insurance companies at the expense of \nelderly patients and their doctors.\n  The alternative energy tax extenders also enjoy strong bipartisan \nsupport. Yet this legislation has been blocked, this legislation which \nwould literally cut taxes. It seems that the Republican definition of \n``bipartisan'' is not what the rest of us understand ``bipartisanship'' \nas meaning. Under their definition, even if a small handful of \nRepublicans--remember, I have gone over the number of these bills \npassing overwhelmingly. Even if a small handful of Republicans oppose \nthe legislation all of the rest support, the Republican leadership does \nnot consider it to be bipartisan.\n  I understand the frustration the Republicans feel as a minority \nparty. But the stakes are too high for inaction. If they, the \nRepublicans in the Senate, seek bipartisanship, as they claim they do, \nmy Republican friends should end their pointless, harmful obstruction \nand work with us to pass these bills that all enjoy strong and in many \ncases overwhelming bipartisan support: housing, tax extenders, \nincluding provisions for alternative energy, the Medicare bill, only to \nname a few.\n  Now, this work period is one that we have a lot of work to do, a \nwhole lot of work to do. I had the good fortune of speaking with the \nRepublican leader today, and I went over with him some of the things we \nneed to do this work period. We need to complete a number of issues. We \nneed one more to join us on Medicare. It is no big surprise that we are \ngoing to have a vote on Medicare again on Wednesday so everyone should \nbe prepared for that. We can do that. There can be some obstacles \nthrown up. But they cannot stop us from voting Wednesday afternoon. \nThere can be an effort made to have a majority vote on this, one matter \nto proceed to it, and another one. But, of course, we wind up needing \n60 votes. And there will be an opportunity Wednesday, probably in the \nlate afternoon, to see if we can pick up that one extra vote.\n  We are going to pass FISA, a bill I oppose because of its unique \nprovision. But a bipartisan majority of Senators will likely support \nthat. We must also address gas prices. I have talked to the Republican \nleader about hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis. \nI am certainly going to try.\n  One of the areas that it appears there is some agreement on is \nspeculation, and maybe we can do something in that regard together, \nbecause there have been public statements made by the Republican \ncolleagues that speculation is a problem. Maybe we can do something \nwith the other aspects of that. I am happy to try to work something \nout.\n  We have to do PEPFAR. I hope we can do that by unanimous consent. I \nhope we do not have to go through all of the procedures. I mean there \nare literally a handful of Republicans holding that up. They have held \nit up for a long time. We have tried to move it on a number of \noccasions. There have been objections to it. So this work period we \nhave to move forward on it.\n  I have talked about the energy tax extenders, the Consumer Product \nSafety conference report. That is going to come to us. That is almost \ncompleted. We are going to have to have a run at LIHEAP to see what we \ncan do for that; the media shield law. Some of these may not go very \nfar because there may be Republican objection, there may be bipartisan \nobjection to some of these on proceeding to them. We will have to see.\n  There is also a package, I have talked to the Republican leader, a \nbig package of bills we are putting together that has been held up by \none Senator. We are going to put those together. They are already put \ntogether. We are going to move forward on those.\n  We also, I think, have to do the DOD authorization and appropriations \nbill. This is not a list of Democratic priorities or pet issues, it is \nnot a platform for the Obama campaign or any of the Senate races around \nthe country. These are critical priorities of the American people, \nevery one of them.\n  The next several weeks can be easy or they can be difficult. If my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing, we can pass this \nlegislation swiftly and with overwhelming support from Democrats and \nRepublicans. But if we look to the last 18 months, past as prologue, \nthen there be likely some heel dragging. If we finish these pieces of \nlegislation in the first 4 weeks we are here, then I have no problem \ntaking that first week in August off. If\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\nthese issues are more than we can bear, talk to me. I think I have been \npretty reasonable in setting these out. But I have gone over these with \nthe Republican leader, and I am happy to sit down and talk to him if he \nthinks that some of them are a bridge too far. But this, in my opinion, \nis what we need to do so that the Senate is respectful of the wishes of \nthe American people.\n  A couple of other things. I do not think it is good for us that we \ntry to accomplish nothing. I remind my Republican colleagues, and \nperhaps I do not need to do this, that the root of continued \nobstructionism is not without cost. Most importantly, it comes at a \ncost to the American people who are facing Medicare cuts, increasing \nhome foreclosure, ever increasing gas prices, because Republicans \nrefused to work with us last work period.\n  But continued obstruction is, I believe, in my opinion, coming at a \ncost to our Republican colleagues themselves as well. The American \npeople see with clear eyes that our country's economic crisis continues \nto grow worse. The Republicans have dragged their heels. It is not \ncoincidental that we have had editorials all over the country--I am not \ngoing point to those--indicating that the Republicans have to work more \nto get things done.\n  But there is good reason to show that Americans favor a Democratic \ncontrol of Congress by the widest margin in the history of polling. \nNever, never has there been a wide margin between Democrats and \nRepublicans as to who the American people feel will do a better job \ntaking care of our country. So maybe after a week back home among \nfamily, friends, constituents, my Republican colleagues are ready to \nwalk away from the small handful of their colleagues who insist upon \ninaction. Maybe enough voters back home explained to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle exactly how urgently they need help.\n  If so, I say to my Republican colleagues, I am here, we are here to \nwork with you. It is not too late to be the 60th vote on Medicare and \njoin us on housing, alternative fuels. I hope the July 4 recess will be \nremembered as a turning point for this Congress, and we can now move \nforward with the same urgency the American people feel to find common \nground and change our country as it desperately needs changing.\n  The turning point can begin now. The Republicans can allow us to move \nforward and debate legislation to lower gas prices, invest in clean, \nrenewable, alternative energy. I am not going to go over a list of \nunanimous-consent requests; I have done that in the past. I simply want \nto say, let's not have these objections to these pieces of legislation. \nLet's try to work together.\n  We frankly have had--and I spoke to a Republican Senator today, \nsaying: We need more opportunity to offer amendments. I said to my \nfriend, a Republican Senator: You know, we are in the throes of a \nPresidential election. We have at the most about 9 weeks of legislative \ntime before that election.\n  On opportunities that we had to legislate, where we brought to the \nfloor pieces of legislation that were open to amendment, here is what \nwe got: The 18-cent tax holiday was an effort of John McCain to do a \ncampaign issue. Senator Obama said it was a political gimmick and it \ndidn't go anywhere. Also on the GI bill of rights, as my friend the \nPresiding Officer will acknowledge, we had an open piece of \nlegislation. What do they want to offer on that? Something to change \nthe GI bill of rights because Senator McCain said it was too generous. \nOn housing, we want to legislate on housing. And when other issues come \nup, that is what we want to legislate on.\n  We are not going to have this as an opportunity to do a Presidential \nelection here in the Senate. We have elections all over the country, \nand we have enough to do.\n  I would hope my friends will respond to the deafening calls from \ntheir constituents to take action. Instead of working with us on \nlegislation to lower gas prices, they propose that we lease more land \nto oil companies. We participated in that. I led the effort over here, \nwith a number of other Senators, to get Senators to go along with \ndrilling in the gulf. We did that. We did that. But it is interesting, \nwe have been told by those companies that any new offshore drilling, if \nthey decide that is what they want to do, will take at least 2 years \nbefore they can get a piece of equipment to drill offshore. They don't \nhave any. So we are not blind to the American people looking to every \nopportunity they can. We are not knee-jerk opposed to drilling, but we \ndo acknowledge that our great country, with the wonderful natural \nresources Lewis and Clark and others discovered--we have less than 3 \npercent of the oil in the entire world, and that counts ANWR and all \nthe offshore--less than 3 percent. We use more than 25 percent of all \nthe oil that is used in the world. We use 21 million barrels a day 7 \ndays a week. We are open to any reasonable approach that will lower gas \nprices, but let's also not forget that the oil industry already leases \n68 million acres in America that they aren't using.\n  The State of Nevada is the seventh largest State in the Union. The 68 \nmillion acres is about the size as the State of Nevada. That is a lot \nof area to drill on. If you go from the southern tip of the State of \nNevada to the northern tip of the State of Nevada, that is at least 750 \nmiles. It is wide. At the top, it is about 400 miles wide. That is a \nlot of area to drill. That is how much land and offshore they have to \ndrill on right now.\n  So even if the Republican proposal were enacted, it would take years \nand even decades to conduct exploration to begin drilling. Even then, \nthe plan wouldn't lower gas prices. But we are willing to take a look \nat any proposal like that. As I indicated, we helped get offshore \ndrilling in the gulf.\n  So instead of proposing legislation that would just add more to the \n68 million unused acres, I think we should try something that might be \na little better than that. We are willing to do whatever is reasonable. \nWe have done so in the past. As I indicated, in 2006, we helped pass a \nbipartisan plan for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Republicans can work with us to end speculation on the oil markets \nthat contributes tangibly to higher prices at the pump. I talked here a \nfew minutes ago about how there appears to be bipartisan support for \ndoing something about speculation. I will come to my Republican \ncolleagues before the end of the week with a proposal on which I hope \nwe can pick up Republican support. Is the plan I am going to come up \nwith perfect? Of course not. But we have been doing a lot of work. I \nhave a number of meetings, some of which are in the evening this week. \nIf my Republican colleagues want to add something to this speculation \nthing to make it better, we will work with them.\n  The main thing, though, is that we have to work to make America, a \ncountry that contains less than 3 percent of the world's supply of oil, \nenergy independent by investing in renewables, clean renewables. These \nsteps would lower gas prices in the short term and it would create \njobs, hundreds of thousands of jobs, clean jobs, high-paying jobs.\n  I hope that this next work period, we can work together and \naccomplish a lot for America. I have tried to outline here for my \ncolleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, what is in store for us \nthis next work period.\n  I look forward to leaving here for the conventions, during the time \nwe are gone, which will bring us a new President. Hopefully, we will \nwalk out of here with our shoulders back and our heads held high that \nwe have been able to accomplish something this work period.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6346-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6346-S6347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GAS PRICES REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no question what the No. 1 \nissue is on the minds of the American people. It is the price of gas at \nthe pump. It is literally off the charts. For those of us who have \nlooked at surveys over the years, it is hard to recall, other than the \npost-9/11 period, a single issue that has enjoyed this kind of \ndominance in public opinion polls in America. I was home last week. I \nheard from a lot of Kentuckians on this issue. I know I wasn't the only \none hearing the same thing. The high price of gas is the No. 1 issue \nfacing Americans at this time. It should be the No. 1 issue for the \nSenate. Americans are hurting. They have every right to expect their \nelected representatives to actually do\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nsomething about it. We need to take up and pass legislation which not \nonly makes a statement but which also makes a difference.\n  Just before the Fourth of July holiday, 44 Republicans introduced the \nGas Price Reduction Act, a series of proposals to increase American \nenergy production, to increase conservation, and to make sure that \nexcessive speculation is not driving up the price of oil; basically, \nfind more, use less. This is the only legislation that has been offered \nthat has both a real chance to pass and will truly help consumers at \nthe pump.\n  The find more provisions include increased exploration on the outer \ncontinental shelf, where States want it, and lifting the ban on western \noil shale exploration. Under use less, we propose incentivizing the \ndevelopment of plug-in electric cars and trucks, and the advanced \nbatteries needed to power them.\n  We can and should increase development of alternative sources of \nenergy. But conservation, alone, is not the way out of this problem. \nThe current spike in energy prices is a supply and demand problem, not \na demand and demand problem. If prices are going to come down, we need \nto find more energy at home and use less. We must do both.\n  The goal of finding more energy at home, rather than relying on the \nMiddle East, is not a fantasy. America is already the No. 3 oil \nproducer in the world, and a number of States have indicated they would \nlike to open up the area off their coasts to even more oil exploration, \nbut they are prohibited by a Federal ban. At $4.10 a gallon, this \nnationwide ban no longer makes sense. It should be lifted with prices \nwhere they are now. It should be up to individual States to decide \nwhether to allow exploration 50 miles off their coasts.\n  We should also lift the ban on oil shale development which the new \nDemocratic congress enacted last year. Our western States are sitting \non a sea of oil three times as large as the oil reserves in Saudi \nArabia. Yet at the insistence of the Democratic majority, we are not \nallowed to touch it. They have put a 100 percent ban on oil shale \nexploration. With gas prices at more than $4 a gallon, this prohibition \nmakes no sense.\n  Some on the other side say that opening up new off-shore exploration \nor using oil shale would not have an immediate effect and therefore \nshould not be done at all. But the effect of allowing new exploration \nat home would send a clear signal to the international markets that we \nare willing to take serious steps to increase supply even while we move \nto conserve.\n  There is already a strong bipartisan consensus on the importance of \nconservation. In addition to working with our friends on the other side \nlate last year to pass the first increase in fuel efficiency standards \nin more than three decades, Republicans are also looking in this bill \nto conserve energy by spurring the development of plug-in electric cars \nand trucks.\n  But conservation alone won't resolve this problem. Conservation is \njust one side of the problem. We need to find more and use less, if we \nwant to bring prices down.\n  Finally, I know there have been concerns that oil speculators are \ncontributing to the rising price of gas. Our bill addresses this \nconcern through putting more cops on the beat at the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, increasing transparency and strengthening U.S. \nfutures markets.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act is a dramatic step in the right \ndirection. In putting it together, Republicans were careful to focus on \nproposals that already have support from the other side of the aisle. \nWe are not interested in simply making a statement. We are determined \nto address the problem. We want to pass legislation which will make a \ndifference to families feeling the pinch.\n  This bill contains provisions that should be agreeable to both sides \nof the aisle. It tackles both sides of the energy issue by increasing \nsupply and curbing demand. We should do both.\n  There are many important issues facing the Congress, but few are more \nimportant than addressing the issue of energy. It is time to act, and \nthis balanced approach is a good start.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I think \nthere should be an opportunity, based on his statement and my \nstatement, to do something about gas prices. We have introduced a piece \nof legislation we have had. We have had votes on it here before. It \ndeals with a number of issues, including whether OPEC should be subject \nto the antitrust laws, which the former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and now ranking member thinks is very important, as does \nSenator Kohl and others on our side. That is part of ours. There are a \nnumber of issues. But to get everybody to agree that everything in it \nis good is difficult.\n  That is the same problem we are going to have with the proposal my \nfriend talks about, the so-called new Republican piece of legislation. \nFrom what I have said and what he has said, it seems that we could \ncertainly get together and agree on, if not all of both packages, some, \nand move forward.\n  For example, I mentioned this speculation thing. Maybe we can do \nthat. I come from the western part of the United States. That is where \nmost of the oil shale is. We had a great program going in the 1970s, \nwhen suddenly we took away the tax incentives for more work on oil \nshale. This isn't anything I personally think is repugnant. I think it \nis something we should take a look at. I have already given my views on \noffshore drilling and onshore drilling.\n  So we want to work together. The message that I hope comes from our \ndiscussion early this afternoon is that Democrats and Republicans want \nto try to do something about gas prices. Hopefully, during this next \nwork period we can do it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, not by way of rebuttal but agreeing \nwith the majority leader, the American people are demanding that we do \nsomething. They are not kidding about this issue. I appreciate the \nspirit of the remarks of the majority leader. Just to give an example \nof the shifting views on this, a Pew poll just announced last week, \ntaken very recently, indicates that just among political liberals \nalone, just to give one snapshot of how the public is evolving on this \nissue, the number of liberals, liberals only, who favor increased \nenergy exploration doubled. That is just among a subset of the American \npopulation. The American people are demanding that we act.\n  I appreciate the comments of the majority leader. Hopefully, we will \nbe able to find a way to do both things, both to find more and to use \nless.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6347-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ORDER FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I just spent a week at home listening to \nOregonians describe their concerns, virtually all of which include the \nword ``bill.'' As we have heard today on the Senate floor, it is sure \nto be ``gasoline bill.'' But it might also be ``medical bill'' or \n``food bill'' or ``credit card bill'' or ``tuition bill'' or ``tax \nbill'' or ``housing bill.'' Taken together, it is obvious these bills \nare hitting millions of our people like a wrecking ball.\n  In addition, millions more Americans see themselves walking an \neconomic tightrope. For example, many of our\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\npeople try each month to pay off the interest on their maxed-out credit \ncard while still paying those huge and skyrocketing gasoline bills. Our \npeople are deeply worried that the cost of paying for essentials is \njust going to keep soaring and they are going to fall off the economic \ntightrope I have described into a no-man's land where they cannot \nsupport themselves or their families.\n  On Independence Day, I was in Canyonville, OR, to speak at a \nwonderful supper honoring veterans that was organized by the Cow Creek \nBand of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians. In my talk, I reflected on how \nimportant it is for Americans to be independent of foreign oil, \nindependent of those crushing and escalating medical bills, and \nindependent of the economic insecurity that has kept so many unemployed \nfor months and months.\n  After my talk, a veteran stopped me and said: Just do what is right \nfor the country. Forget the politics. Country first. That, of course, \nis what our veterans have always done: country first. Do what is right. \nNever forget. That is what makes America so special.\n  I do not have enough time to outline a prescription for all of the \neconomic challenges our country faces that involve solutions built on \nthat veteran's prescription of country first. I do want to report that \nwe have heard what that veteran has said with respect to health care \nand fixing health care in the Senate.\n  Sixteen of us in the Senate--eight Democrats and eight Republicans--\nhave now come together behind legislation to rein in health care costs \nwhile providing quality care to all our people. With Senator Bennett \nfrom the other side of the aisle in the lead for Republicans, we hold \ndown health care costs by ensuring all our people are part of a large \npool so they have more bargaining power in the marketplace.\n  We institute insurance reforms so it is not possible to discriminate \nagainst someone who has been ill. We lower the administrative costs of \ncovering health services. We reform the Tax Code to take away the tax \nbreaks for the Cadillac health care plans and use those dollars for \nmiddle and lower middle income folks who are hurting. We have written \ninto our proposal the opportunity for employers who want to keep \noffering health coverage and for workers who want to take that coverage \nto always be able to do so. But we also offer to both employers and \nemployees more choices, more alternatives to hold down costs because \ntoday, for too many employers and too many workers, there are no \nalternatives to these 15-, 20-, and 25-percent rate hikes we are seeing \nagain and again across this country.\n  What our bipartisan group of 16 Senators does is, we modernize our \nhealth care system because in many respects some of the key features of \nour health care system in 2008 are not very different than those of \n1948. Back in 1948, when there were wage and price controls, people \nwould go to work somewhere for 30 years or so until you gave them a big \nsteak retirement dinner and a gold watch. Today, the typical worker \nchanges their job seven times by the time they are 35, and employers \nare having difficulty competing in global markets. That was one of the \nconsiderations in the Boeing-Airbus competition, that Boeing paid a lot \nmore for health care than did Airbus.\n  Our group of 16 Senators has been able to get a favorable review of \nour proposal by the Congressional Budget Office, the agency that keeps \ntrack of the financial underpinnings of major proposals. They have \nfound that our proposal is revenue neutral in the short term, so it \nwill not take big tax hikes on middle-income people to fix health care. \nThey found in the third year, as a result of what we do to change the \nincentives, change behavior, we actually start holding down the rate of \ngrowth in health care, and we start generating a surplus for the \nFederal Government.\n  Now, we understand as part of this legislation that both political \nparties have had valuable contributions to make with respect to the \ncause of fixing health care. Democrats have been right on the coverage \nissue because unless you cover everyone, those who are uninsured shift \ntheir bills to the insured and costs continue to soar. But those on the \nother side of the aisle have made a great contribution in terms of \nsaying we must not discourage innovation; we must not discourage the \navailability of choices. There needs to be a role for the private \nsector.\n  So what our group of 16 Senators has said--and I note the presence of \nSenator Specter on the Senate floor. He has been an extraordinary \nadvocate of improved health care services, and he and I have had many \ndiscussions on this topic and will have many more in the days ahead.\n  I close simply by saying, what our group of 16 Senators--this is the \nfirst time in the history of the Senate, going back 60 years to Harry \nTruman, where there has been a significant bipartisan group of Senators \nin favor of universal coverage--what our guiding principle has been in \nthis effort, on a topic this big and this complicated--and it surely \nwill go through a host of modifications and changes. In my committee, I \nintend to work very closely with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, \ntwo great leaders who work in a bipartisan fashion. We are going to \nhave to work in a bipartisan fashion to fix American health care.\n  But given that litany of concerns I have described, with six or seven \ntop issues being ones where the second word is ``bill,'' starting with \n``gasoline bill''--we have to come together on a bipartisan basis to \ndeal with those concerns. That is what Senator Bennett and I have \nsought to do as part of our health care legislation. That is what we \nare going to have to do to tackle the premier economic issues of our \ntime.\n  As that veteran said to me just a couple of nights ago in \nCanyonville, OR, putting country first is what public service and \npublic service in the Senate is all about.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak for up to 20 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to seek \nrecognition on the issue of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nwhich will be the order of the business of the Senate later this week, \nand I have an amendment pending there. But before proceeding to that \nimportant subject, I would like to make a comment or two about what has \noccurred on the Senate floor already.\n  At the outset, I compliment my distinguished colleague from Oregon, \nwho has played such an important leadership role in the Senate \ngenerally since coming over from the House, working with him on many \nitems, and taking a very close look at an innovative approach to health \ncare coverage for all Americans. There is no doubt about the need to \nhave that coverage. The question is how we do it, maintaining the \nessentials of the free enterprise system to avoid the bureaucracy of \nthe so-called Clinton plan from 1993, which put a great bureaucracy \nbetween the doctor and the patient.\n  What Senator Wyden has proposed, along with Senator Bennett, on a \nbipartisan basis, is very carefully considered--with a significant \nnumber of sponsors on both sides--is a good way to proceed, and my \nstaff and I are taking a very close look at that important proposal.\n  Just on a personal note, while Senator Wyden is a westerner, and some \nmight say I am an easterner, we were both born in Wichita, KS, which \nmay not be a mark of great distinction but worth a 20-second notation \non the floor of the Senate. Somebody listening in Wichita this \nafternoon--my Aunt Rose--watches fastidiously, so I want to give a \nlittle salute to the hometown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6348-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6348-S6351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKING TOGETHER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was pleased to hear some of the \ncomments by our leaders earlier on a conciliatory note after the \nfireworks a week ago Thursday before we adjourned. The fireworks over \nthe Medicare bill I think vastly overshadowed the fireworks a week \nlater on the Fourth of July. I am glad to hear them talk about working \ntogether.\n  If there is one point of virtual unanimity in America today, it is \nthe\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\nAmerican people are sick and tired of the partisan bickering in \nWashington, DC. When they talk about coming together on energy and the \nhigh prices of gasoline, every Member has to hear it everywhere because \nthat is such a prominent item of great pain and suffering in America \ntoday: the high cost of gasoline and the high cost of heating oil when \nwinter comes, especially for the seniors who have the choice of either \nheating or eating. I believe there are some things that can be done in \nthe short term, difficult as so many of the items are. I have spoken \nbefore about the issue and do not intend to speak at length today. But \nI am encouraged by what Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have had to \nsay.\n  One item which could be acted upon immediately, which could have some \nimmediate impact, is the effort Senator Kohl and I have made for many \nyears now to take away the antitrust exemption for OPEC oil-producing \nnations. Right now, they have a sovereign immunity. But there is \nnothing sovereign about what goes on in fixing the prices of oil in the \ninternational market--fixing the prices by having the OPEC countries \nget into a small room, lower production and increase the cost because \nthe supply is lower and the demand is greater.\n  While we certainly ought to undertake conservation measures, as we \nfinally did, raising the miles per gallon last year to 35, and with \nmany other items we could make on conservation, we could have a \nsignificant and short-term impact upon supply by taking away the \nantitrust exemption, which we can do under the case law. It is a \ncommercial transaction. It passed the Senate by a big vote. More than \n70 Senators voted for it in the past. It is on the agenda. It has been \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee. The OPEC countries say they \nshouldn't be subject to the antitrust laws. Well, they find it very \nprofitable not to be. They say it wouldn't do any good because OPEC is \npaying now for all of the production it can undertake, but 3 weeks ago, \nSaudi Arabia made an announcement that they were going to increase \nproduction. The speculation behind that announcement was that they were \nconcerned about measures which were being undertaken by the United \nStates and other countries to respond. In the long term, their \ninterests might be best off if they increase production. Well, I think \nif they were subjected to the antitrust laws, we would put them to the \ntest.\n\n  There is no earthly reason they should not be subjected to our \nantitrust laws. That has not moved forward because of some concerns \nthat there ought to be some companion legislation on drilling. Well, \nthat is something which ought to be considered--not carte blanche and \nnot necessarily in broad, sweeping terms but on a case-by-case basis.\n  I have a very strong record in my tenure in the Senate on \nenvironmental protection, but if you take ANWR, I was convinced 20 \nyears ago when I made a trip there that ANWR could be the subject of \nvery substantial exploration with adequate concern for environmental \nprotection. ANWR has a footprint about as big as Philadelphia \nInternational Airport, and there are ways of drilling down with a \nsingle hole proliferating underground. I saw the caribou there. I saw \nthe other drilling in the area. I saw how the caribou and other \nenvironmental concerns could be protected. Too often, when the matter \nhas come up on the floor--and it has come up on many occasions--we \ncan't get to the 60-vote threshold; 56, 57, something in that range. It \nbecomes a battle by competing forces who are dug in and entrenched.\n  I think it is an item the Congress could consider in some greater \ndetail and on a selective basis move in the immediate future to try to \nincrease our own capacity. You don't have to go completely on offshore \nor completely on shale or completely in any direction, but some studied \nanalysis and some careful consideration, trying to leave the entrenched \nbattle lines which have characterized this body and the House on this \nissue for so long, would be very salutary and I think could lead to a \nbetter result. At least that is one man's opinion, having been there, \nhaving looked at it, and having heard people on both sides over the \npast two decades.\n  The subject of Medicare is very much a lead topic. It is the lead \nstory in the New York Times this morning, and it is the lead story all \nacross America. It would be my hope that the leaders could yet come to \na resolution of the issue on some sensible terms without having a \n``gotcha'' vote; without moving forward, as the majority leader did a \nweek ago Thursday, on predicting how many Democratic Senators there \nwould be and making it a test case and having a political cost on the \nvote, but to try to work it through to get legislation finished so that \ndoctors do not get a 10.6-percent cut. I believe there is widespread \nsupport in both bodies not to have that cut go into effect and to \nalleviate the concerns of seniors that doctors will stop taking \nMedicare patients because of that cut, which is so excessive--\nlegislation which has been pending for a long time. Each year, the cut \ncomes up, and each year, the cut is rescinded.\n  The core problem on this issue really arises from the difficulties \ncaused by the procedure known as filling the tree. We have seen, in the \ncourse of the past two decades, a new procedure adopted where the \nmajority leader utilizes his primacy--that means his ability to get \nrecognition--to offer an amendment and then to offer a second amendment \nbefore any other Senator has a chance to offer an amendment, and then \nno other Senator can offer an amendment.\n  When the Medicare bill first came up 2 or 3 weeks ago, I talked to \nSenator Reid and said that I would support cloture if the procedures of \nthe Senate were honored and an amendment could be offered. He said he \nwould do that. I voted for cloture.\n  When the bill came up a week ago Thursday, there was no opportunity \nto offer an amendment because the House of Representatives had passed a \nMedicare bill and left town. They do that from time to time. They pass \na bill, send it over, and leave town. They present an ultimatum to the \nSenate: Take it or leave it--a rather convenient way to have a de facto \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  The Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature. For those who \ndon't know that highfalutin word, that means there are two bodies. All \ngrade school children know you have to pass a bill in the House and a \nbill in the Senate, and then it goes to the President for signature or \nveto. But when the House leaves town, suddenly it becomes a unicameral \nlegislature--a constitutional amendment, all in one fell swoop by \nbuying airplane and railway tickets. Well, I am not prepared to accept \nthat kind of an edict from the House of Representatives or the majority \nleader or anybody, and it would seem to me that processes were being \nshortcut. It took the unusual step of writing to the President and \nurging him to use his constitutional authority to recall the House of \nRepresentatives into session during the week of July 4th. I didn't have \nmuch expectation that it would be done, but the House ought not to \nleave town and leave us without recourse to offer amendments, which is \nour right under the Constitution, and to send it back to the House for \ntheir concurrence, and that could be done yet. It is my hope we will \nmove in that direction.\n  This business of filling the tree is of recent origin. Going back to \nthe 99th Congress in 1985 and 1986, Senator Dole used it five times. \nSenator Byrd used it in the next Congress three times. In the next \nCongress, Senator Mitchell didn't use it at all. Then, in the 103rd, \nfor 1993 and 1994, Senator Mitchell used it nine times. Then Senator \nLott picked it up a few times in the intervening years until the 106th \nCongress, when he used it nine times. Then Senator Frist used it nine \ntimes in the 109th Congress. So far, Senator Reid has used it 12 times. \nThat process precludes Senators from offering amendments. That is not \nthe way the Senate has been designed to run.\n  I was concerned about this and made an extensive statement on global \nwarming and in February of last year, some 18 months ago, introduced a \nrule change and wrote to the chairperson of the Rules Committee and the \nranking Republican urging that that rule be taken up so that the Senate \ncan work its will on preserving the right of Senators to offer \namendments. Were that to be done, then when the effort was made on \ncloture, it wouldn't be summarily dismissed if there was a fair chance \nto offer amendments.\n  There has been a major development on the very important issues \nrelating to warrantless wiretapping in an opinion issued by the Chief \nJudge of the\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\nU.S. district court in San Francisco on the constitutionality of the \nForeign Intelligence Act. The case handed down last Wednesday--some 56 \npages, very complicated, very important--is on the issues which are \nbeing raised in the debate which we are going to have later this week \non FISA. This is the same judge who handed down another very extensive \nopinion on the litigation involving the 40 telephone companies that are \nbeing sued in his court, issued on July 20, 2006, some 29 pages. This \ncase is now under appeal under the state secrets doctrine.\n  Because of their tremendous impact on the issues which we are going \nto be considering, interested parties may review Chief Judge Walker's \nopinion in Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Bush online at: http://\nwww.cand.us\ncourts.gov/cand/judges.nsf/61fffe74f99516\nd088256d480060b72d/35760d9e4cc9207588257\n47a0082f983/$FILE/Al_Haramain%\n20Order%20Following %20Remand%207-2-08.pdf and his decision in Hepting \nv. AT, located at 439 F.Supp. 2d 974 (N.D. Cal. 2006).\n  Mr. SPECTER. The core of Chief Judge Walker's opinion is a very \nimportant holding, and that is essentially that the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive way to have wiretapping \nand that the President exceeded his constitutional authority in putting \ninto effect the terrorist surveillance program.\n  This is what Chief Judge Walker had to say:\n\n       Congress appears clearly to have intended to, and did, \n     establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence \n     surveillance activities to be conducted. Whatever power the \n     executive may otherwise have had in this regard, FISA limits \n     the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities.\n\n  The Supreme Court of the United States candidly ducked the issue in \nthe case coming out of Detroit. The Federal judge there had held the \nterrorist surveillance program unconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit \nreversed on the ground of standing, but, as demonstrated from the \nscholarly dissenting opinion on the standing issue, there was ample \ngrounds to have granted standing. It is really a very flexible \ndoctrine.\n  Then the Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari and in \neffect ducked the case, really avoiding deciding the most important \nconstitutional confrontation of our era on the President's authority \nunder article II and the congressional authority under article I. But \nnow the fat is in the fire again, as of last Wednesday, with Judge \nVaughn's opinion.\n  Then you come down to the issue of standing, which is still to be \ndetermined, but this is what Judge Walker had to say about that:\n\n       Both plaintiff amici hint at the proper showing when they \n     refer to ``independent evidence disclosing that plaintiffs \n     have been surveilled'' and a ``rich load of disclosure to \n     support their claims'' in various of the multidistrict \n     litigation cases.\n\n  So that when you have Judge Walker, who has the consolidation of the \n40 cases picking up this issue, there is strong--well, it is more than \na suggestion or a hint; it is a pretty extensive statement that there \nis a rich load of disclosure to support the claims of standing.\n  The business about the court stripping is always problemsome. But it \nis especially problemsome in the context of an ongoing case that is \nabout to reach fruition, where such extensive consideration has been \ngiven and a decision may be imminent. It is very unseemly on our \ndoctrine of separation of powers for the Congress to step in and grant \nretroactive immunity.\n  This is especially problemsome, as I see it, because we are being \nasked to grant retroactive immunity where there has not even been an on \nthe record disclosure of what we are immunizing. You have the \nallegations as contained in the litigation--the allegations of data \nmining--but you have a program where most of the Members of Congress \nhave not even been briefed on it. Yet we are asked to come in and grant \nretroactive immunity.\n  It is especially problemsome, as I see it, because we could maintain \nthe program and still not subject the telephone companies to liability \nin a couple directions. The telephone companies have been good \ncitizens. When this matter came up several months ago the first time in \nthe Senate, I proposed an amendment to substitute the Federal \nGovernment as the party defending. The party can take over the \nlitigation in the shoes of the telephone companies, with the same \ndefenses, no more and no less than the telephone companies have, no \ngovernmental immunity, no sovereign immunity but State secret doctrine, \nif it applied. That way, you don't foreclose the courts from acting.\n  There is another alternative, which is my pending amendment--\nscheduled to be argued and voted upon this week. Our legislation does \nnot give it to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts but to the \ndistrict courts generally. But all there has to be is a showing that \nthere was a request made in the proper form by the administration to \nthe judge for carrying out this program, whatever it is. That is under \nour bill. Well, my amendment would broaden that to give the court the \njurisdiction to decide constitutionality.\n  In a sense, that has already been foreclosed by what Judge Walker \nsaid last Wednesday in finding the terrorist surveillance program \nunconstitutional. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 not \nonly covers warrantless wiretapping, but it covers pen registers and it \ncovers trap-and-trace devices. So presumably--and this is all a matter \nof presumption because we don't know exactly what the program is--it \nwould cover whatever program there is at issue in this legislation.\n  And then we have the amendment pending by Senator Bingaman, which I \nam working on with him collaboratively, which picks up the obligation \nof the inspectors general of the various intelligence agencies to \nreview the program and then to send it back to Congress 90 days later \nto see if we will uphold it when we know something more about the \nprogram. Certainly, today, it qualifies as a pig in a poke. We don't \nknow what it is for which we are asked to grant retroactive immunity. \nSo another alternative would be the proposal that Senator Bingaman has \nintroduced, which I have cosponsored, which would call for the decision \nat a time when Congress at least knows a little something about what it \nis we are voting on.\n  In essence, I submit that we have come to a very serious situation \nwhere, in the future, historians are going to look back at the period \nfrom 9/11 to the present time as the greatest expansion of executive \nauthority in history. The Congress has been totally ineffectual to \nrestrain that. The National Security Act of 1947 requires that both \nintelligence committees be fully briefed on programs such as the \nterrorist surveillance program, which was violated by the President and \nthe executive branch. Briefings were not made until piecemeal, and \nfinally they needed the confirmation of General Hayden. It has been \nlongstanding tradition for the executive branch to tell the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and the ranking member about this. It came as a \nsurprise to me by reading the New York Times one Friday in December of \n2005, when we were arguing the PATRIOT Act on the final day and \nexpected to pass it, and the legislation blew up in our faces when that \nwas disclosed. Some Senators said they intended to vote for the PATRIOT \nAct but didn't do so when confronted with the secret program that the \nadministration had not disclosed. But the administration violated the \nstatute and had no recourse. The administration violated the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act and could not get a review by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States in the case coming out of Detroit and the \nSixth Circuit.\n  Then you had the hesitancy of the Supreme Court ruling on habeas \ncorpus. In Rasul, Justice Stevens's opinion goes at great length to \ntrace the constitutional common-law basis for the right of a writ of \nhabeas corpus, starting with John at Runnymede, which was 1215. There \nwas an alternative analysis of the statute on habeas corpus. The case \ngets to the District of Columbia Circuit Court, and they ignore the \ncitations of constitutional authority and say: Well, Congress changed \nthe statute and that governs, flying in the face of a Supreme Court \ndirection and order from a superior court. And then the Supreme Court \ndanced around Boumediene for a long time. First, cert was denied, and \nthen in an unusual petition for reargument, taking five votes, granted \ncert because of the ineffective and insufficient procedures of the \ncombat status review board.\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\n  So you have a long history of ineptitude--total ineptitude--by the \nCongress and more than ineptitude by the Congress, complicity in \npassing the Military Commissions Act and facilitating a free hand by \nthe administration in changing the legislation on habeas corpus. That \nshould not have had an impact on the ultimate result because habeas \ncorpus is a constitutional right, and the Supreme Court finally got \naround to saying so when confronted with the totally insufficient \nprocedures on the combat status review board. So we have another chance \nwhen the FISA legislation comes up. We have a lot of guidance, from \nwhat Chief Judge Walker has had to say.\n\n  It is understandable that the Congress continues to support law \nenforcement powers because of the continuing terrorist threat. No one \nwants to be blamed for another 9/11. My own briefings on the telephone \ncompanies' cooperation with the Government--and I speak in terms only \nof reports and allegations because it is not a matter of record--my own \nbriefings on the telephone companies' cooperation with the Government \nhave convinced me of the program's value, so that I voted for it, even \nthough my amendment to substitute the Government for the telephone \ncompanies was defeated in the Senate's February vote. Similarly, I am \nprepared to support it again as a last resort, even if it cannot be \nimproved by providing for judicial review.\n  However, since Congress has been so ineffective in providing a check \nand balance, I will fight hard this week--starting today with this \nspeech--to secure passage of an amendment to keep the courts open. When \nthe stakes are high, as they invariably are when Congress addresses \ncivil liberties and national security, Members frequently must choose \nbetween the lesser of two imperfect options. Unfortunately, we too \noften back ourselves into these corners by deferring legislation until \nthere is a looming deadline or a congressional recess. Perhaps that is \nwhy so many of my colleagues have resigned themselves to accept the \ncurrent bill without seeking to improve it.\n  I ask my colleagues to look to Judge Walker's opinions as guidance as \nto what we ought to be doing to back him up on what he has done, in a \ncourageous way, in taking the bull by the horns and declaring the \nterrorist surveillance program unconstitutional and setting the path \nfor standing.\n  Although I am prepared to stomach the bill if I must, I am not ready \nto concede that the debate is over. Contrary to the conventional \nwisdom, I don't believe it is too late to make this bill better. \nPerhaps the Fourth of July holiday will inspire the Senate to exercise \nits independence from the executive branch now that we have returned to \nWashington.\n  I thank the Chair and my distinguished colleague from North Dakota \nfor his patience--if he has any. Senator Dorgan customarily does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in morning business, and I \nask unanimous consent to use the remaining time in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6351-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6351-S6353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the issue of energy. \nI understand the urgency of the need to get our energy policies right. \nWe have a very serious problem, I think, in a range of areas. Energy \npolicy is something that affects everybody. They pull up to the gas \npump to fill their tanks and wonder how they are going to be able to \nafford it. If you try to run an airline, you try to stop the \nhemorrhaging of red ink because of the enormous cost of jet fuel. If \nyou have a trucking company, you are trying to avoid going bankrupt \nbecause of the cost of diesel fuel. If you have a family farm, you are \ntrying to get the money together to fill your fuel tanks for the summer \nand fall harvests.\n  There is so much that is damaging our economy, as the price of \ngasoline has gone to $4-plus a gallon and the price of oil is bouncing \naround $140 a barrel. I wish to talk about that. I understand, as a \nMember of this body, that old saying is that ``when all is said and \ndone, more is said than done.'' I understand how people feel about \nthat. Democracy is painfully slow and, yet, in this case, we face \nsomething that is urgent and needs, I think, some haste and speed. I \nknow there are others who look at the legislative bodies, or politics \ngenerally, and see windbags in blue suits, and they think there is a \nlot of discussion and precious little action. I will talk a bit about \nthis issue of the need for action.\n  We get up in the morning and we, generally speaking, reach for a \nswitch and turn it on and there is light. We might--those of us who \nneed to--plug in an electric razor and shave in the morning. We might \ndecide to have breakfast and turn on a stove and fry some eggs. We \ncould go out to the car and put a key into the ignition and start the \nengine. There are so many different things we do every single moment of \nthe day that we don't think about, but it represents the consumption of \nenergy--an unbelievable amount of energy, in the form of oil, natural \ngas, electricity, and coal.\n  Now, let me describe for a moment where we find ourselves. This great \ncountry of ours--and there is nothing like it on the face of the \nEarth--has an unbelievable appetite for oil. Sixty to seventy percent \nof our oil comes from outside our country. We stick straws in the Earth \nand suck out oil from the planet every day. We suck 85 million barrels \na day out of the planet Earth, and 21 million, or one-fourth, is \ndestined to be used in the United States of America. That describes to \nyou how much of an appetite we have for oil.\n  We use a substantial amount of the Earth's oil. Seventy percent of \nthe oil that we use is used in vehicles. So that consumes a substantial \namount of our oil.\n  The runup in price has had such a dramatic impact on this economy and \non American families. I want to describe a bit about that today.\n  Some would say the price of oil has increased because it is supply \nand demand. Right? Greater demand, less supply; therefore, a higher \nprice. But that is not true. I would like someone to name for me one \nthing that has happened in the past year with respect to supply and \ndemand that justifies a doubling of the price of oil. You can't do it. \nI will stand here for 3 days. You can't do it. Nothing has happened in \nthe last year with respect to supply and demand that justifies doubling \nthe price of oil. If anything, exactly the opposite should have been \nthe case. We are using less fuel in the United States right now than we \ndid in the equivalent period a year ago. We drove about 5 billion fewer \nmiles. That means demand is down. Supply is up.\n  The closing month inventory of crude oil for the first 5 months of \nthis year has supplies increasing. If supplies are increasing and \ndemand is down, what should happen to price? It should go down. But the \nfact is, the price has gone up like a Roman candle, just up, up, \nstraight up.\n  As I have indicated, the OPEC countries are blissfully happy going to \nthe bank to deposit our money in their bank accounts. The big oil \ncompanies have a permanent grin. They love depositing our money into \ntheir bank accounts. Everybody loves it except the consumer who is \npaying through the nose for gasoline--$4, $4.50 a gallon for regular \ngasoline.\n  There are a lot of things that need to be done in energy. We need to \nproduce more, yes. We need to conserve more, certainly. We need more \nefficiency in all the appliances we use. We certainly do that. And we \nought to have a national commitment toward renewable energy sources. We \nought to do that, all of that.\n  I support drilling offshore. I am one of four Senators who helped \nopen what is now lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico. That is now open, and \nthat is good. Hurricane Katrina came through the gulf--we are never \ngoing to have a bigger wind than that through the gulf--and those \noffshore platforms withstood. There was no oil leakage in the gulf as a \nresult of that hurricane.\n  We can get those resources, in my judgment. Some say the hood \nornament is ANWR. We have to drill in ANWR in Alaska. It is one of the \nfew pristine areas put away for future generations in legislation \nsigned by Dwight Eisenhower.\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\n  In any event, that is not where the major oil deposits are. The major \ndeposits are in the Gulf of Mexico, and we ought to drill more there. I \nsupport that. We ought to conserve more, much more. That includes more \nfuel-efficient vehicles. In fact, we did that, the first time in 27 \nyears we required a 10-miles-per-gallon increase in the efficiency of \nvehicles in 10 years.\n  There is so much we can and should do to solve this problem. But what \nhas happened in the last year with respect to energy prices is, in my \njudgment, largely unconnected to what I just described. Let me tell you \nwhat I think is happening.\n  There is an unbelievable amount of speculation in the oil futures \nmarket. Let me describe it. This is the growth of speculation in the \noil futures market. In the year 2000, 37 percent of the trades in the \noil futures market was by speculators. Today it is 71 percent. That \nmarket has largely been taken over by speculators or, as Will Rogers \ndescribed 80 years ago, people buying things they will never get from \npeople who never had it and, by the way, buying it with money they \nnever had. This is an unbelievable amount of excess speculation driving \nup prices.\n  This morning in the Washington Post there was a well-written story by \na journalist named David Cho. The story was: ``Pension Funds Boosted By \nOil: While Stocks Fall, Commodity Bets Are Paying Off.''\n  This was a story about CalPERS and other pension funds moving \nbillions and billions of dollars into the futures market. In fact, \ninvestors, including pension funds and Wall Street speculators, have \nincreased their investments in the futures market from $13 billion in \n2003 to $260 billion today. Think of that. From 2003 to 2008, you go \nfrom $13 billion to $260 billion moving into this marketplace, which is \nnot a particularly large marketplace. We produce 85 million barrels a \nday coming out of the Earth, and we trade 22 times that amount every \nsingle day. We have these dramatic amounts of additional speculation, \nespecially by pension funds coming into this marketplace. Then we have \nbrain-dead people walking around saying: What speculation? We don't \nthink there is any excess speculation. This is simply the market \nworking. Nonsense. That is unbelievable nonsense.\n  The article says:\n\n       For decades, trading commodity contracts was considered \n     taboo by most pension funds because the market is so volatile \n     and risky.\n\n  All of the sudden risk doesn't matter so much, I guess. Just jump in \nwith both feet right smack into the oil futures market, grab a bunch of \nit, and see what happens. I don't understand that. Where do we find all \nthe cards with which to build this house of cards?\n\n       Walter Lukken, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission--\n\n  By the way, they are the regulators. They are the referees, the ones \nwearing the striped shirts carrying the whistles and supposed to call \nthe fouls--\n\n       Walter Lukken, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission, said the price of oil and other goods is \n     going up simply because demand is outstripping supply. \n     ``It's our proposition that strong fundamentals are at \n     play, driving higher commodity prices across the board.''\n\n  That is our regulator saying: What, we worry? I don't see anything \nhappening.\n  Let me remind everyone again of the amount of speculation that has \ngone up in 5 years. This market was 37 percent speculators. It is now \n71 percent speculators. That is a study that was done by the House \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. So the head of the \nregulatory authority says: You know what. I don't think anything is \ngoing on. I am blissfully happy here, going to work in the mornings, \nand I am perfectly willing not to see what exists.\n  Let me describe a chart I think is one of the most interesting charts \nwith respect to oil prices. I put this chart together to show the \nEnergy Information Agency--we spend $100 million on this agency. They \nare an agency that is not about policy. They are to give us information \non energy and give us their best judgments on energy prices, among \nother things. Here is what they have said.\n  The yellow line shows the following: In May of last year, they said: \nHere is where we think the price of oil is going to go. And in July, \nthey said: It is going to be higher than that. Here is where we think \nit is going to go, up to 2009. Then in September, they made another \nestimate a little higher: Here is where we think it is going to go. \nLast November: Here is where we think the price of oil is going to go \nin the next year. January: Here is where we think it is going to go.\n  Can you imagine that? This is the best agency we have, the Energy \nInformation Administration, with which to make judgments, and how did \nthey make judgments that were so unbelievably wrong? I had the head of \nthis agency before my subcommittee the week before we left for the \nrecess. He couldn't answer the question. This must be an embarrassing \nchart for the smartest guys in the room.\n  I said: Let me answer it for you. If you can't answer it, let me \nanswer it for you. I taught economics in college ever so briefly but \nenough so I think I can answer this chart.\n  The reason our agency has been wrong, so consistently wrong all the \ntime every time they made an estimate--here is where the price of oil \nis going to go, instead it went like this, straight up--is because this \nmarket has been taken over not by supply-and-demand relationships but \nby speculators. They are up to their necks deep in speculation. So this \nline, the red line, could not possibly be determined by an agency that \nis looking at supply-and-demand fundamentals because this does not \nrelate to anything except an orgy of speculation by people who want to \nget into the market and make big bucks so we deposit our money into \ntheir bank accounts.\n  The senior vice president of ExxonMobil in April said the price of \noil should be about $50 or $55 a barrel. I suppose he is looking at \nthings such as supply and demand.\n  Fadel Gheit came to the Congress--this guy worked for 30, 35 years \nfor Oppenheimer Company. He was their resident expert on energy. Here \nis what he said:\n\n       There is no shortage of oil on the world market today. I'm \n     convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel. I call it the world's largest gambling hall, open 24/\n     7. Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. This is like a \n     highway with no cops, no speed limit, and everybody going 120 \n     miles an hour.\n\n  Then the Energy Secretary, a man I like, a good guy, said:\n\n       There is no evidence that we can find that speculators are \n     driving the futures prices for oil.\n\n  This apparently is the new master narrative. Just say nothing is \nhappening and then hope nobody can discover something that is \nhappening.\n  The problem is, every hour of every day the American people drive up \nto the gas pumps and discover what politicians--at least some of them--\nare insisting doesn't exist. It is unbelievable to me.\n  In every circumstance where there has been dramatic excess \nspeculation in the market and the market becomes broken, it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress to set it right.\n  I have introduced legislation, and there are half a dozen pieces of \nlegislation around here to try to address this issue.\n  I understand we will have discussions all of July about this \nsituation, and I understand the inclination, perhaps, by some will be \nto decide we ought to do something without teeth. If we can just do \nsomething and say we did something and it has no grip or bite, we can \nall go home, thumb our suspenders, and even puff on a cigar for those \nwho smoke, and say: We did it, the United States Senate, good for us. \nIt is not good for us unless it is something that has an impact on a \nmarket that is broken. Let me describe the legislation I introduced. It \nis called the End Oil Speculation Act of 2008. That describes exactly \nwhat it would do. It requires the regulator, the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, to separate trades in the futures market for oil. \nOne set of trades would be trades between consumers and producers of a \nphysical product for the purpose of hedging risk. That is precisely \nwhat the market was established to do. That is exactly what the market \nis about. It is why we have a futures market. A futures market is \nnecessary and is there because it is needed to hedge risks of a \nphysical commodity.\n  We would require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to separate\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\nthose trades. Other trades then are defined as speculative trades, and \na 25-percent margin requirement would be applied to those non-\nlegitimate hedge trades. Why that? The fact is, if you are going to \nspeculate in stocks on margin, you have to put up 50 percent of the \nmoney. If you want to control oil on margin, put up 5 percent or 7 \npercent maximum. Let's quintuple that to 25 percent and see if we can \nwring the speculators out of this market. If you are engaged to \nspeculate on one side or another of a legitimate hedge for the trading \nof a physical commodity, as far as I am concerned, that is what the \nmarket is about. You should not be subject to this new requirement. But \nif you are just out there trying to figure out how to play bingo with \nthis oil market, despite the fact you do not even know what oil looks \nlike, you couldn't lift a 5-gallon can if your life depended on it, \ndon't want to see oil, don't want to store it, you have no interest in \noil--what you are interested in is making money, then this increased \nmargin requirement should apply to you.\n  We have hedge funds and investment banks that are up to their necks \nin these markets. They have no interest in oil. We have hedge funds for \nthe first time in history buying oil storage in order to buy it, take \nit off the market, store it, so that it becomes more valuable later, \nand they sell it and make a profit. The problem with all of this is the \ncountry's economy is being damaged, and we have a responsibility, I \nbelieve, to try to fix these kinds of problems when they exist.\n  I know that we will have a discussion this week and this month about \nfour or five different approaches. And I know they will all have great \nlabels. When I grew up, my neighbor, Herman, an old man--he had \nrheumatism, he wore suspenders and never traveled much off his front \nporch. And he had a dog. His dog was a three-legged, one-eyed dog with \nfleas. He called him Lucky. I thought: That name doesn't fit a three-\nlegged dog with one eye with fleas. But Lucky actually answered to the \ncall of ``Lucky.''\n  We do that with legislation around here, some of us. I shouldn't say \n``us'' because I try not to do it. They package legislation and label \nit as if it is going to do something.\n  The only issue at the end of the day in the Senate in terms of \ndealing with this energy urgency--and I believe it is urgent--the only \nissue is have we done something that has some bite and grip and starts \nto fix a market that is broken? Have we decided to wring some of this \nspeculation out of this market and put energy prices back where they \nought to be?\n\n  Let me point out once more that, according to the House Subcommittee \non Oversight and Investigations, who did an evaluation of this, 71 \npercent of the trades in the oil futures market is now speculative--\npure speculation--as opposed to the non-speculators who are using that \nmarket for the purposes which it was intended. I say to all those who \nsay: You know, speculation--what speculation? I see nothing, hear \nnothing, know nothing. Well, I say: Look at this EIA chart again and \ntry to figure out what this line means. Most Americans understand \nexactly what this line means. It is what they have to pay at the pump \nevery time they take the gas cap off their tank. And they know where it \nis going. A fair amount of that is going to OPEC.\n  By the way, enough of that spills from the barrel to fund some \nterrorism. In addition to all that, a substantial amount is going to \nthe major integrated oil companies. I might observe here that some say: \nWell, that is important, because they need to invest in additional \nexploration. The largest oil company in this country spent twice as \nmuch last year buying back its stock as it did drilling for oil. That \nis all you need to know about that.\n  The American people need this Congress to address this issue now, in \nthe month of July. This country's economy is in substantial difficulty \nfor a lot of reasons. We have a lot of speculation, a lot of risk \ncreated in a whole range of areas.\n  Take a look at the subprime loan scandal. Evaluate what has happened \nas a result of the collapse of home values and the subprime loan \nscandal--all these issues together--and what it has done to our \neconomy. And put on top of that this dramatic runup in energy prices, \nand on top of that look at the President's budget where he says: Oh, by \nthe way, I want you to pass a budget that has a $420 billion deficit.\n  Except that is not what the deficit is. The deficit is not what the \nPresident says it is. It is how much the President says we have to \nborrow to keep the Government going this year, which is over $700 \nbillion. We have a fiscal policy off the trail, with $700 billion a \nyear, and we will borrow $800 billion because of our trade policy this \nyear, due to trade deficits. So $700 billion, $800 billion, and that is \n$1.5 trillion in 1 year of red ink, with a $14 trillion economy. That \nis slightly more than 10 percent of this entire economy's value \nrepresented by red ink. That is unsustainable. It doesn't work.\n  Look, I am an optimist. I believe we can fix all this. I believe we \ncan put this country back on track, with a sound fiscal policy that \nsays let's pay for that which we use. If we are going to spend money, \nlet's pay for it. We can say if we are going to send soldiers to war, \nwe can at least ask the American people to pay for the cost of the war. \nWe can decide to crack down on oil speculators, and mortgage sharks who \nare peddling bad mortgages around the country. In all cases, whether it \nis the oil futures market or whether it is the financial area, it \nrequires regulators who are not brain dead and who are willing to come \nto town to have effective regulation and make sure that markets work.\n  I believe we can fix all of these things, but we don't have a lot of \ntime. This economy, I think, is a fragile economy. It is strong and \nresilient. But you lay these four things on top of it, and it becomes a \nfragile situation that requires action by us. I know that because I was \nin North Dakota all of this past week.\n  I saw a letter to the editor today saying: Well, the problem with all \nof this is the Democrats. The Democrats are causing all this. That is \nsuch sheer nonsense. Going back to 2001--talking about oil, the \nsubprime mortgage scandal, and others--we had regulators coming to town \nwho said: You know, we don't even like Government, and we would love to \nbe a regulator to say we are not very interested in regulating. In \nfact, we don't need to put on a striped shirt. We don't have a whistle. \nWe want to come here and say things are going to be better. We won't \nlook.\n  I chaired the hearings in the Commerce Committee on the Enron \nscandal. I had Ken Lay come in front of my committee, raise his hand \nand take the oath, and then take the fifth amendment. He is now dead, \nbut there are a number of those he worked with who are now in prison, \nbecause part of that was a criminal enterprise and the regulators \nweren't willing to look. Now, I am not alleging that is the case with \nthe futures market, but I am alleging this market is broken and causing \ndramatic injury to every American family. This country's economy and \nthe American people can and should expect us to take action.\n  My hope is that in the coming week or two we can pass some \nlegislation. I hope that legislation will closely resemble the End Oil \nSpeculation Act, in which we require the regulatory body to use its \nexisting authority to do two things: Separate the legitimate hedging \nthat occurs, and should occur in this marketplace, from excess \nspeculation, and then wring out the excess speculation in order to \nbegin to put some downward pressure on prices.\n  The American people deserve the right to expect that from their \nGovernment. I hope my colleagues and I can overcome what has been for \ntoo long in this Chamber a dramatic amount of stalling and obfuscation \nby those who dig their heels in and don't want to make any progress on \nanything. So my hope is that perhaps in the coming month we will be \nable to make some progress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder with respect to H.R. 6304--that is the FISA legislation--be \nmodified as follows: that all debate time on the amendments must be \nutilized during Tuesday's session; and that on Wednesday, at 9:30 a.m., \nimmediately after the opening of the Senate, the Senate resume H.R. \n6304, with the debate time previously specified prior to the cloture \nvote commencing at that time; with Senator Bingaman controlling 10 \nminutes of the time controlled by the majority leader; and that after \nall debate time has been used or yielded back, the Senate then proceed \nto vote in relation to the amendments, that upon disposition of the \namendments, the Senate then vote on the motion to invoke cloture, and \nthen passage, as previously ordered; provided further that the previous \norder with respect to debate time between votes and the vote time and \nsequence and all other provisions of the previous order remain in \neffect.\n  Mr. President, if the Chair would withhold, this is the matter about \nwhich I spoke to the Senate earlier today. I, of course, have conferred \nwith the distinguished Republican leader. What we want to do--the order \nis set now that we would do all the debate time and all the votes \ntomorrow. We are not sure how late the plane will be getting back from \nNorth Carolina. This morning we had one Democratic Senator--there may \nbe two or three--now going to North Carolina.\n  So rather than having people who are here waiting around until the \nplane gets back, we will complete all the debate tomorrow, and then \nvote, and have all the time used up except what I have outlined here, \nWednesday morning. I would assume we would start voting probably at \naround 11:15, and we would complete those votes well before the caucus \nof the Republicans on Wednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could also inform Senators, there are \nstorms in the Midwest and, as a result of that, we have received calls. \nI guess what happens after a holiday, we have Democrats and Republicans \nwho may not be here 20 minutes after 5:30. We are not going to do any \nheavy lifting after the vote tonight anyway, so we are going to keep \nthe vote open for a while to see if some Senators who would like to be \nrecorded--I do not think it will be a close vote--have that \nopportunity, both Democrats and Republicans. As everyone knows, we have \nhad a rule around here that, unless it is a close vote, we close it as \nquickly as we can after the time has expired. We will continue doing \nthat. But I thought tonight it would be appropriate to not cut people \noff because of these flights being delayed.\n  Also, of course, the previous order with respect to counting \npostcloture time, if cloture is invoked--there is an order already in \neffect for that--and that would remain as if cloture had been invoked \nat 5 p.m. today.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 3221, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A message from the House of Representatives to accompany \n     H.R. 3221, an act to provide needed housing reform, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we only have a few minutes before there is a \nrollcall vote. I wish to take a few minutes to give my colleagues an \nupdate on where we stand on this issue.\n  The cover story in today's Congressional Quarterly Weekly is devoted \nto the housing crisis. One of the opening paragraphs in the story reads \nas follows:\n\n       U.S. companies eliminated 91,000 jobs in June, on top of \n     the 487,000 dumped in the previous six months. Car sales fell \n     last month to their lowest level in 15 years. . . . Much of \n     this bad economic news comes back, at some point, to the \n     collapse in house prices and the resulting foreclosures.\n\n  As we all know and as the article points out, home ownership is the \nlargest investment most Americans will ever make. Middle-class families \nuse home equity as a cushion against uncertainty, to finance a secure \nretirement, college costs, health care expenses, and the like. ``Now,'' \nto quote the Congressional Quarterly article again, ``that has come to \na crashing halt, leaving many in the middle class working harder than \never and yet still hard-pressed to make ends meet.''\n  That brings us to where we are today, with the consideration of the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which the Banking Committee, \nwhich I am pleased to chair, reported out with a 19-to-2 vote. I \ncompliment Senator Shelby from Alabama, the ranking Republican of the \nCommittee, with whom I worked closely over the past number of months in \ngrappling with the housing issue.\n  Among the key elements of this bill is a new program to provide \nrelief to these homeowners who would otherwise suffer through \nforeclosure--a provision that would help them salvage their American \ndream.\n  It was my hope that this bill would have been on the President's desk \nby now, but regrettably we were unable to achieve that goal because of \nunfortunate delaying tactics. That failure has consequences. Because we \nfailed to take action, there have been approximately another 90,000 \nforeclosures that occurred over the week we were home during the \nIndependence Day break. Had we passed the legislation and sent it to \nthe President, as I argued for, before July 1, I think we would have \navoided some 90,000 filings that occurred during the period we were on \nthis recess. Not only are these families threatened with foreclosure, \nbut their neighbors and their communities will see falling home prices, \nrising crime rates, and fewer resources for local schools, police, \nfire, libraries, and other services.\n  I remind colleagues that this legislation has proven time and again \nto enjoy strong bipartisan support. In fact, shortly before we left for \nthe recess, this bill passed by a vote of 79 to 16 on a cloture motion. \nYet, because of a technicality, this measure is now being held up by \none Senator because that Senator wants to add another vote on a \ncompletely unrelated matter.\n  Let me review for my colleagues, as we prepare to renew our \ndiscussion on this bill, exactly what it is we are talking about and \nwhy it is so hard to achieve. The bill we are working on has a number \nof very key elements, all of which have been supported by strong \nbipartisan votes in either the Banking Committee or on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  First, we have the HOPE for Homeowners Act, which will help 400,000 \nto 500,000 American families save their homes from foreclosure. These \nfamilies were simply seeking the American dream of home ownership. \nSadly, in case after case, they were led astray, steered into mortgages \nthey could not afford, often by mortgage brokers and loan officers who \npretended to be trusted financial advisers but were really only out to \nmake a buck for themselves. The HOPE for Homeowners Act is a voluntary \nprogram that will help save these homes by forcing the lenders to \nchoose to participate and take significant losses. There are no \nbailouts here. The homeowners will have to pledge at least 50 percent \nof all new equity and future appreciation in order to get the benefit \nof the new FHA-insured mortgage.\n  There are many protections built into the program: Only homeowners \ncan qualify; no investors or speculators will be allowed to \nparticipate; borrowers would have to show they cannot afford their \ncurrent mortgages; and all loans will be underwritten at a level the \nborrower can afford to pay. New loans will be 30-year fixed-rate \nmortgages.\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\n  All of this is done at no cost to the taxpayer. In fact, over the \nnext 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that the \nprogram could actually raise some $250 million for the Treasury.\n  This provision, combined with the GSE regulatory reform section of \nthe bill, passed the Banking Committee by a vote of 19 to 2, receiving \nstrong bipartisan backing.\n  We desperately need this legislation. As I have said over the past \nnumber of weeks, every day that we wait, somewhere between 8,000 and \n9,000 new foreclosures are filed in our country.\n  In late June, the census reported that the home ownership rate, after \nreaching an alltime high in 2005, fell to 67.8 percent--the sharpest \ndecline in home ownership in 20 years. Minorities, who were \ndisproportionately likely to get subprime loans, are suffering \nespecially badly. That is why this legislation is widely supported by \nthe community and civil rights organizations around our country. They \nsee a generation of wealth being lost as a result of this foreclosure \ncrisis.\n  The Senate expressed its strong bipartisan support for the HOPE for \nHomeowners Act when it defeated an amendment to strip this program out \nof the larger bill on a vote of 69 to 21.\n  Second, the bill includes the FHA Modernization Act. This passed in \nearly April as part of the Foreclosure Prevention Act by a vote of 84 \nto 12 in this body. The provisions in the current bill are identical to \nthat legislation, with the exception that the loan limits have been \nincreased in high-cost areas to a maximum of $625,000.\n  As the administration has repeatedly said, modernizing the FHA \nprogram will put it in a far better position to help keep future \nborrowers away from subprime loans.\n  A number of our colleagues have spent some time citing the problems \nat FHA. Clearly, FHA has suffered some losses in recent months, as have \nall players in the mortgage market. Yet the program has about $18.5 \nbillion in reserves, and the performance of FHA loans improved over the \npast quarter, even as the performance of both prime and subprime loans \nhas declined, according to data provided by the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation.\n  Moreover, for the past several months, credit scores of FHA borrowers \nhave been rising, and the percentage of refinance loans--loans to \nborrowers with a proven track record of making timely payments--has \nactually increased. In addition, this bill eliminates the seller-funded \ndownpayment assistance program which has been the largest source of \nlosses in the FHA program.\n  In other words, with its hefty reserves, an improving mix of \nbusiness, and the reforms in this bill, we can have confidence that FHA \nwill be safe and sound for years to come.\n  Third, this legislation creates a strong and effective world-class \nregulator with the housing government-sponsored enterprises--Fannie \nMae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. These entities have \nkept the housing and conforming mortgage markets going while other \ncapital markets have frozen.\n  Madam President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. We need to make sure these crucial market players are \nappropriately capitalized, well regulated, and properly supervised so \nthe American people can continue to depend on them to ensure that \naffordable mortgages are always available. Recent losses at Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac speak to the urgency of this need, and the bill before \nus accomplishes that goal.\n  Finally, there are other important provisions in this bill. The bill \nincludes $3.9 billion in community development block grants to help \nlocal communities revitalize neighborhoods devastated by foreclosures. \nAll the major organizations representing Governors and mayors across \nthe country strongly support this provision as well.\n  Lastly, this bill also has an affordable housing program in it which \nis absolutely critical for the long-term needs of our country.\n  In short, this is a good bill. It is a balanced bill that goes to the \nheart of our Nation's current economic problems. The bill has very \nbroad support, including from the Conference of Mayors, the League of \nCities, the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, the Leadership \nConference of Civil Rights, the Mortgage Bankers Association, the \nConsumer Federation of America, the National Association of \nHomebuilders, the NAACP, ACORN, the Financial Services Roundtable, and \nnumerous other business, consumer, and civil rights organizations.\n  Senator Shelby and I urge that this legislation be supported. I hope \nwe have a chance to pass it quickly, to send it to the other body for \ntheir consideration, and then give this bill to the President for his \nsignature. This will be the major achievement and accomplishment of \nthis Congress, when it comes to dealing with the underlying economic \ncrisis which, at its heart, is the foreclosure rate.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Hunsberger\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SSG Travis K. Hunsberger from Goshen, IN. Travis was 24 years \nold when he lost his life on June 27, 2008, in Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan, \nfrom injuries sustained from an improvised explosive device. He was a \nmember of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group of Fort Bragg, \nNC.\n  Today, I join Travis' family and friends in mourning his death. \nTravis will forever be remembered as a husband, son, brother, friend, \nand soldier. He is survived by his loving wife Hannah; his parents \nSteve and Ronda Hunsberger; his sister Kelsey; and his brother Kyle.\n  Travis graduated from Northwood High School in 2002 and attended Ball \nState for 2 years before enlisting. A family man, Travis invited his \nparents to Fort Bragg to witness a reenactment of his wedding. Travis \nhad served once before in Afghanistan and sustained an injury, yet he \nnever wavered in his commitment to his country or to the U.S. Armed \nForces. Prior to Travis' redeployment, his father, Steve Hunsberger, \ntold a local reporter that Travis had a choice of being on an ``A \nteam'' or a ``B team,'' with the A team serving in a ``more dangerous \nrealm.'' Travis, unwavering in his bravery, chose the ``A'' team. His \ndedication to his country ``is what brought him his greatest \nhappiness,'' Kent Norr, associate pastor at Wakarusa Missionary Church, \nsaid. These words illustrate the passion Travis had for serving this \nnation, and his memory will endure through the many lives he touched.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Travis set. Today and always, Travis will be \nremembered by family, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American \nhero, and we cherish the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his \ncountry.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as we can take \nsome measure of solace in knowing that Travis' heroism and memory will \noutlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Travis K. Hunsberger in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis struggle in which we are engaged, and the immeasurable pain that \ncomes with so great a loss, I pray that Travis' family can find comfort \nin the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death \nin victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Travis.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant James P. Snyder\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life \nof the brave staff sergeant from Nappanee, IN. James Snyder, 48 years \nold, died on May 10, 2008, at Fort Benning, GA, from injuries sustained \nin January from a roadside bomb explosion in Baghdad, Iraq. With an \noptimistic future before him, James risked everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  For James, military service was a family tradition. His family has \nvaliantly served in the military since World War I, and James was proud \nto take up that mantle. Originally from Columbus, IN, James was a \nlifelong Hoosier. He graduated from Wawassee High School and joined the \nArmed Forces in 1989. A career soldier, James was on his 3rd tour of \nduty in Iraq when he was injured. He also served in Operation Desert \nStorm in 2005.\n  Those who knew James best recall a patriotic man who loved history. \nHe was devoted to his family and cared deeply for his fellow soldiers. \nDuring his time at Fort Benning, he often spoke of his need to return \nto Iraq to take care of his comrades. His great example of service and \ncharacter inspired his two nephews, Jeremiah Mench and Steven Keller, \nto enlist in the Army.\n  Today, I join James' family and friends in mourning his death. James \nwill forever be remembered as a loving husband, father, son, brother, \nand friend to many. He is survived by his wife Christine Hochstetler; \nhis children Dourlas, Karlene, and Joseph; his mother Donna; his \nbrothers David, Daniel, and Paul; and his sisters Lorree, Laura, and \nNeva.\n  While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of James, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief. Today and always, \nJames will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers \nas a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while \ndutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring James' sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of James' actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of James P. Snyder in the Record \nof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this \njust cause in which we are engaged, and the pain that comes with the \nloss of our heroes, I hope that James' family can find comfort in the \nwords of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in \nvictory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with James.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6356-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6356-S6358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\nthe hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking and \ntouching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail sent \nto me through energy_prices@crapo.senate\n.gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sen. Crapo: Thanks for your inquiry into my response to \n     rising fuel prices. I have changed my job so I can more \n     easily bicycle to work and I do so nearly every day. Beyond \n     that, no changes for me! Personally, I think fuel prices \n     rising a few bucks more would be a great thing, and in \n     Republican market economy thought, let the market determine \n     the price!\n       I think increases in nuclear energy would be a very poor \n     idea considering current technology and waste storage issues. \n     I would, however, support resumption of research into the \n     Integral Fast Reactor at the INL.\n       Increased production from the ANWR is also a bad idea. This \n     is doing nothing but wasting choice American oil supplies \n     when they may be truly needed later. It would, of course, \n     increase the profit margins of the oil companies. Exploit the \n     tar sands and oil shales while prices are high enough to make \n     them economically viable.\n       I'm fully supportive of increased funding of alternative \n     energy systems and mass transit. I applaud your efforts to \n     bring AMTRAK back to Boise. Rising fuel prices will also \n     ensure that more people use public transportation.\n       I believe that our best efforts (and perhaps an increase in \n     fuel taxes would be necessary) should be to find new and \n     improved energy STORAGE systems. Solar, wind, tide and other \n     renewables supply more than enough energy, but they are \n     intermittant at best. Improved storage systems could fix \n     that. How about a Hoover Dam-sized project to build a giant \n     turbine (or 2 or 3) in the Gulf Stream off the coast of \n     Florida?\n       Conservation of America's vital natural resources is \n     paramount. Just look to the oil booms of Ohio and \n     Pennsylvania in the 1870s for a bit of guidance. When the \n     resources are used up, they are gone forever. What is more \n     important, short-term profit or long-term prosperity? The \n     U.S. needs to be at the world forefront of energy, not stuck \n     in a 1950s oil-powered economy!\n       Best of luck, Senator.\n     John, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hello, I am an under-employed degreed person. I became a \n     single mother about 8 years ago. I have a college degree in \n     general science, and an Associate's degree in Horticultural \n     Sciences. I was a pre-med student for the first four years of \n     my college life. Currently I do not have a job at all. During \n     the school year, I work part-time in the local school system \n     as a ``para-professional,'' which means I will never be \n     employed full-time by the school system, but I will be \n     expected to go over and above for my students, which I do! I \n     gladly work extra to ensure the school is a safe, caring \n     place with an environment for learning. The school is a \n     rural, ``one-room'' school in Clearwater County. It is \n     absolutely a wonderful place!!! I do so wish I could be \n     making a living during the years of employment here, but the \n     pay is very low, and not a living wage, as the local job \n     service people say.\n       I feel education is the key for the success of the upcoming \n     generation of young people. Obviously, I have financial \n     challenges. I also have six children, who I have home-\n     schooled, and also enrolled them in public school for the \n     last few years, usually when they reach high school. I was \n     certified in secondary ed years ago, and have not had the \n     resources to re-establish that certification. I also think it \n     is important to acclimatize the student to the big world \n     outside the home. I have been successful with them. Three of \n     my sons attend, or have attended, the University of Idaho. \n     One son is stationed in Iraq, since November, 2007, which has \n     been a learning experience for everyone around us. My other \n     two are still in school, and as most of the others are \n     straight A students. One is even thinking of applying to West \n     Point next year. I think he can do whatever he sets his mind \n     in motion to accomplish.\n       My experience with the gasoline/petroleum crisis is that I \n     am spending so much on gasoline to transport myself, my kids, \n     and accomplish daily tasks that little is left for life. I \n     love visiting my boys in Moscow. The price is now prohibiting \n     much of that, unless I make an excuse. I miss my boys, and \n     they cannot afford to come see me!! They make very little \n     between classes, and the high price to just go visit Mom is \n     too much of a chunk out of their minimum incomes. I remember \n     when I worked in high school and college, buying gas was not \n     something you had to spend most of your money on. The price \n     was low enough that you just filled up, not worrying about \n     working three days to afford your tank of gas!!! How can \n     they, or myself, ever get ahead????\n       I feel that Congress should be moving forward on finding \n     other methods of energy for the vehicle. I do not think \n     releasing petrol reserves or more drilling is the answer. We \n     should be thinking of the future with minor dependence on \n     oil. Our country has been trained to live in our cars and, \n     while that is not bad, we need to find another way to fuel \n     them. I personally do not think forcing everyone to live in \n     town is the answer. I would never survive in a town, I need \n     my open spaces. I also could pursue more education, but the \n     colleges are becoming farther out of reach because people \n     will not be able to afford to go. That is not right. I should \n     not have to accept unsatisfactory employment to live out of \n     town. The out-of-towners are where much of the brains of the \n     world come from. If it keeps going like it is, I will not \n     even be able to get to the grocery store, much less into town \n     to purchase gasoline! I won't even be able to get to a job, \n     because my job is out of town! What about the farmers who \n     make their living, and also make America run, they should not \n     be punished because they are from out of town. It could \n     become an elitist society again. No doubt this problem could \n     divide America as never before.\n       I heard today that Boise, Idaho, was named as the second \n     most livable town in the country. I have only lived here for \n     14 years, but I am happy to hear that. I feel Idaho is a \n     wonderful place to live. I would like to see that continue. \n     There are those of us, a big number, who would be in serious \n     crisis, if the price of energy, even just gas continues to \n     spiral upward. I am not sure what will happen. We are also \n     rural we have no TV reception, and only dial-up internet. \n     I can see a lot of people who will be in a world of hurt \n     as they say. We have not had time to make disaster plans \n     for this. This could be a life-altering crisis that has \n     the potential to be as great a disaster as any naturally \n     caused. Local law enforcement could be greatly taxed with \n     people asking for assistance for day to day survival.\n       I really believe that developing the new technologies for \n     energy usage will be the key to America and Idaho's success. \n     We must think of the future, and I believe less dependence on \n     oil, smarter cars, and using resources with extreme caution \n     is the only way to ensure next generations of Americans that \n     our nation is as great as it has ever been.\n       Thank you for your time,\n     Sharon, Orofino.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: I am a single woman of 87, raising a 10-\n     year-old great grandson who lives in Boise, Idaho. Now Idaho \n     Power has gotten another raise and that along with over $4.00 \n     a gallon for fuel, I now either have gas to get to the store \n     or medicine. With a 10-year-old, food is most important. (No \n     regular bus service; besides it costs $2.00 to go to and from \n     the closest grocery store by bus.) I sold my car and the \n     pickup that belonged to my late husband (1992 Ford) and, with \n     the help of my grandson, my church, and the Kia dealer in \n     Nampa, I have a small car that gets around town but not good \n     enough that if one of my children in Hammet or Jerome were to \n     become seriously ill. I would be afraid to drive it that far. \n     I now have an automobile that I am afraid will break down \n     instead of a dependable one all because of the price of fuel.\n       Question is why was Idaho Power allowed to let Washington \n     Power and Light take the power from the power plant at Lucky \n     Peak for less than it costs the citizens of Idaho per \n     kilowatt??????\n       Along with this I have worked all of my life and paid into \n     Social Security. I worked for a doctor who did not pay the \n     taxes which he was required to and now my check is \n     approximately $300.00 less than it would have if he would \n     have paid in those six years. He has since retired and taken \n     out bankruptcy, and those of us who he shorted are not going \n     to get anything because his attorney was allowed to prolong \n     any legal action over the time limit. Now Social Security is \n     going to take over 186.00 from my check to pay for insurance, \n     which is not going to pay any of my bills. Yet they are \n     allowed to automatically to deduct this. Have you ever tried \n     to feed yourself, a ten-year-old, pay property taxes and buy \n     medicine on $517.00 a month?\n       Probably not, and all of the good Senators and \n     Representatives will never know because they do not, from my \n     information, fall under Social Security.\n       I am sending this; however, I am sure it will not do any \n     good. After all the last time that I contacted you, nothing \n     came of it and further I got penalized 1 per cent of my check \n     for doing so. I wish every Congressmen and government \n     official would have to live for just 6 months like over 46% \n     of the American people do.\n                                                      Mary, Boise.\n       P.S. Please have your staff continue to waste money sending \n     me and many others who have come to you for help asking us to \n     donate to your cause.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Mike Crapo: Thank you so much for the \n     opportunity to share my thoughts with you. I do think your \n     asking for stories from people is an excellent idea.\n       Many decisions we make can seem O.K. at the time, but then \n     actions outside our control can turn those decisions into \n     problems. Like deciding where we want to live. While gas was \n     cheap, families decided they wanted big houses outside the \n     city and then would\n\n[[Page S6358]]\n\n     commute into Boise. Now that so many people have moved out of \n     town, it is like flushing good money and good air away as \n     people drive back into town to work. Instead of spending \n     money on adding two more lanes on the freeway, money should \n     go to provide more options to get people out of their cars. I \n     have a friend who used to be in a van pool, but then the \n     people in her group moved and now she cannot get back into a \n     different van pool.\n       We did decide to live close enough to our work (3 to 6 \n     miles) that we are able to bike and save gas. But even we \n     feel the rise from gas prices because so much of what we \n     purchase depends on gas, and so what we buy from food to \n     clothes have gone up in price. And the more I read, the more \n     I realize that we should not be going into ethanol production \n     from corn. This causes more problems than it helps.\n       We really need to say as a country that we will work on \n     this energy issue together. We need to start conserving as \n     much as possible. Building ``green'' should not just be a \n     nice add-on option. Any new building should be required to be \n     as energy efficient as possible and government money should \n     be invested in research to make buildings even better.\n       America needs to stand up and say we can do this, we can be \n     creative and get out of our gasoline rut. We need to help \n     people on the fringe who are on fixed on low incomes. But for \n     people who make poor and selfish decisions on their driving \n     habits should have to pay for that. So for those people, gas \n     prices are too cheap. We do not even pay the true cost of \n     gasoline in regards to the environment or human health \n     issues. We truly need a new vision and will power.\n       Thank you very much.\n       Sincerely,\n     Annette, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am an over-the-road truckdriver, and these fuel prices \n     are killing us. Back East and out West, we are seeing fuel \n     prices up toward $5.00 a gal. Where is it going to stop? We \n     need to drill in ANWR, and off our East and West coasts. And \n     we need more refineries. It seems to be like Washington, D.C. \n     does not care for the working class people anymore. They just \n     see us as an endless path to money. Take from us all they can \n     then forget us and sell us out to the highest bidder. Where \n     will it stop?\n     Roger, Chubbuck.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mike: I am a semi-retired person. I work at a bagel-\n     deli at almost Eagle Road, since I live in Boise, and only \n     live \\1/2\\-mile from BSU, I drive 12 miles each way to work. \n     Since I make $8.50 an hour, and it costs me $4.00 (my truck \n     gets 22 miles per gallon), to go to work, it is far more \n     difficult than it was as $2.50 a gallon for fuel.\n       I am 62 years old. I have always believed in all renewable \n     resources. I cannot believe that people think that nuclear \n     fuel is unsafe, plus the fact that we aren't accessing our \n     oil?\n       Best regards,\n     Boyd, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo--I am at a loss to understand why \n     Congress chose to support ethanol instead of hydrogen fuel. \n     The vehicles have been developed, have clean emissions, and \n     it seems practical since hydrogen is abundant. However, \n     hydrogen fuel pumps will have to be installed around the \n     country before the general public can buy and use these \n     vehicles. This is something that Congress can and should \n     support.\n       I am so opposed to ethanol. It can't be transported via the \n     current fuel lines, because of its corrosiveness. There is a \n     world food shortage, and none of our farmland should be used \n     to grow fuel instead of food. Ethanol gets lower mileage, and \n     frankly, I do not like having even 10% ethanol fuel in my \n     engine. Ethanol is not the solution to our fuel problems.\n       Electric cars, while cleaner, still need a valuable \n     resource (electricity) to operate.\n       Energy credits are really good. Hopefully, there is \n     something in the tax code for developers of alternate sources \n     of energy (solar, wind, thermal, etc.). I also am in favor of \n     nuclear energy. The European countries are certainly using \n     that. I know that nuclear waste is an issue, but I think it \n     is one that can be solved.\n       This is not a ``story,'' but I took the opportunity to \n     express my opinion about this.\n     Diana.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, I have a gift and awards business in \n     Moscow, ID where we engrave various items (most of which are \n     made in China), and are experiencing increasing freight \n     prices for all our received items. Freight rates are changing \n     every day not only for delivery, but for other items we \n     purchase used in our business. My employees are feeling the \n     high gasoline prices commuting to work, and are looking for \n     some sort of relief from me. This will drive up my cost of \n     doing business and I will have to pass this cost on to my \n     customers which in turn will be passed on to everyone.\n       I am glad that you sent out this e-mail requesting a \n     response to high gasoline prices. I commend your position on \n     this issue. I am sending out e-mails to all my elected \n     officials stating that if you don't support a national energy \n     policy (drilling, nuclear ) then I will do everything in my \n     power to replace you the next election. It's time that the \n     people take back their government. Like it says ``We the \n     people'' . . . An intelligent, responsible representative of \n     the people will get on board and do what he or she is getting \n     paid for, representing the people not just special interest.\n       I want to encourage you to spread the word that ``We the \n     people'' are getting sick and tired of not being represented \n     as we request be. People that I see on a daily basis agree \n     that this country is going down hill not even sideways. We \n     are in trouble economically with loss of our manufacturing \n     base, no positive energy policy will jeopardize our entire \n     way of life in the U.S. and will set us up eventually for a \n     war we don't want.\n       Please carry the banner, inform your colleagues and let's \n     get this country on the right track again! ``We the people'', \n     love this country.\n       Sincerely,\n     Dick.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mr. Crapo, Thank you for standing up to Senate and \n     demanding something be done on our behalf. Rest assured I \n     will remember those that did come election time. There is no \n     reason why we can not explore our own sources of energy \n     instead of sending our tax dollars to other countries.\n       As for how it has affected my family. We bought a camper \n     and pickup truck last year to take family vacations and see \n     this beautiful country of ours. With the rise in gas prices \n     we are limiting ourselves to travel only where one tank of \n     gas can get us. We had planned trips to Yellowstone, Las \n     Vegas, the redwoods in California and Washington State. All \n     those trips are cancelled as we have to stay close to home. \n     It is so bad right now that I cancelled attending my nephews \n     wedding in Washington because the gas prices there are worse \n     than ours.\n       We used to go to Meridian (we live in Kuna) once a week for \n     groceries and to go out to dinner. We now do like we used to \n     when we lived in Cascade. We go to Meridian once a month for \n     groceries and rarely go out to dinner because of fuel cost. \n     My wife and I have even discussed trading the Dodge Durango \n     that she loves and buying a small car for her commute.\n       While I understand that there are countries out there that \n     have it worse than us but this is supposed to be the greatest \n     and yet we can not even provide our citizens with our own \n     energy. We at the whim of the Arab controlled oil and I see \n     it only getting worse if we do not do something now.\n       Thank you again.\n     Tim and Amanda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6358-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING JOSE ANTONIO DIAZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Yolo County Sheriff's Deputy Jose Antonio ``Tony'' \nDiaz, who was tragically killed in the line of duty on June 15, 2008.\n  Tony Diaz was born in Jacona, Mexico, on September 20, 1970, and \nimmigrated to the United States with his family when he was 4 years \nold. His family settled in Dixon, CA, where he graduated from Dixon \nHigh School in 1989.\n  Tony Diaz's family instilled a strong work ethic in him from a young \nage. As a teenager, he worked in agricultural fields in the summer. \nShortly following his graduation from high school, Tony went to work \nfor the California Human Development Corporation where he worked to \nassist farm workers, and was soon promoted to the corporate office. \nTony's strong skills with computers led him to a position in the Yolo \nCounty Information Technology Department in 1999 where an assignment \nwith the Sheriff's Department piqued his interest in law enforcement. \nTony put himself through the Yuba College Police Academy and became a \nsheriff's deputy in 2004.\n  As a dedicated member of the Yolo County Sheriff's Department, Deputy \nDiaz served with pride for 4 years in several areas including court \nsecurity, transportation and patrol.\n  Deputy Diaz will be remembered as a loving son, a proud father of \nthree daughters, a devoted friend, and respected colleague.\n  Jose Antonio Diaz's brave service and commitment to public safety \nwill not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6358-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6358-S6359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JACKIE LEE HOUSTON\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

I am very pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the important work and contributions of Jackie Lee Houston.\n  During the ceremony, Palm Springs Mayor Steve Pougnet pointed out the \namazing contributions of Jackie Lee\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\nHouston. She has been an integral part of the fine work being done at \nAngel View Crippled Children's Foundation, the Palm Springs Art Museum, \nthe Palm Springs International Film Festival, the Palm Springs Opera \nGuild of the Desert, the Stroke Recovery Center, and Desert AIDS \nProject. Houston is also the sponsor of the ``Jackie Lee Houston \nScholarship,'' offering support to residents of the region hoping to \npursue post-graduate training in design.\n  It is especially fitting that the new Jackie Lee Houston Plaza will \noffer an entry to the Palm Springs Convention Center because every year \nthe Palm Springs International Film Festival opens there. It is a \nproject that has had Houston's full support. It is also fitting that \nthe plaza will offer visitors a desert landscape where they cannot just \nenjoy the native plants, but also help to build a sense of community \nthat is so important to Houston.\n  I am delighted that the amazing community and philanthropic work of \nJackie Lee Houston will be memorialized with this plaza in Palm \nSprings. I commend Mayor Pougnet and the members of the Palm Springs \nCity Council for their efforts in this regard and, of course, send my \nvery best regards to Jackie Lee Houston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6359-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL MELISSA A.

A bill to rename the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National \nHistoric Site in the State of Kentucky as the ``Abraham Lincoln \nBirthplace National Historical Park''; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill to \nrename the ``Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site'' in the \nState of Kentucky as the ``Abraham Lincoln Birthplace Historical \nPark.''\n  In 1809, Abraham Lincoln was born at Sinking Spring Farm, near \nHodgenville, Kentucky, making him the first President to be born \noutside the original Thirteen Colonies. A century later, in 1916, the \nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site was established to \nprotect over 100 acres of this enshrined area.\n  In 1811, the Lincoln family moved from Sinking Spring Farm to Knob \nHill Farm, Kentucky, until Abraham Lincoln was nearly 8 years old. At \nthe age of 51, Abraham Lincoln wrote, ``My earliest recollection is the \nKnob Creek place.'' While at Knob Hill, Abraham Lincoln learned to talk \nand assume household duties, helping his family gather wood and water. \nIt was also at Knob Hill, during his boyhood years, where Lincoln first \nsaw African Americans being taken south along the Louisville-Nashville \nTurnpike, part of the old Cumberland Road, to be sold as slaves. Only \n50 years later, Abraham Lincoln would successfully lead his Nation \nthrough its worst crisis to abolish slavery.\n  There is an inspiring climb from modest beginnings to the highest \noffice in the land, along with a relentless spirit through the most \ndistressing time in the history of our Nation, which opens us to the \nlife of Abraham Lincoln.\n  As someone who is proud to share the same birth State with Abraham \nLincoln, I believe there is a credible desire in Kentucky to continue \nthe education and promotion among our citizens, particularly the young, \nto understand and appreciate his righteous leadership. It is difficult \nto name another person who has displayed the qualities and character of \nthe U.S. as much as Abraham Lincoln.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6364-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6364-S6365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 607--DESIGNATING JULY 10, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL SUMMER \n                             LEARNING DAY''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Obama, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 607\n\n       Whereas all students experience a measurable loss of \n     mathematics and reading skills when they do not engage in \n     educational activities during the summer months;\n       Whereas summer learning loss is greatest for low-income \n     children, who often lack the academic enrichment \n     opportunities available to their more affluent peers;\n       Whereas recent research indicates that \\2/3\\ of the \n     achievement gap between low-income children and their more \n     affluent peers can be explained by unequal access to summer \n     learning opportunities, which results in low-income youth \n     being less likely to graduate from high school or enter \n     college;\n       Whereas recent surveys indicate that low-income parents \n     have considerable difficulty finding available summer \n     opportunities for their children;\n       Whereas structured enrichment and education programs are \n     proven to accelerate learning for students who participate in \n     such programs for several weeks during the summer;\n       Whereas students who participate in the Building Educated \n     Leaders for Life (``BELL'') summer programs gain several \n     months' worth of reading and mathematics skills through \n     summer enrichment, and students who regularly attend the \n     Teach Baltimore Summer Academy for 2 summers are \\1/2\\ year \n     ahead of their peers in reading skills;\n       Whereas the Summer Youth Program Fund in Indianapolis, \n     Indiana, the first community collaborative fund for youth \n     programs in the United States, serves as an example for other \n     urban communities by providing summer learning opportunities \n     for young people;\n       Whereas thousands of students in similar programs make \n     measurable gains in academic achievement;\n       Whereas recent research demonstrates that most children, \n     particularly children at high\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\n     risk of obesity, gain weight more rapidly when they are out \n     of school during the summer;\n       Whereas Summer Learning Day is designed to highlight the \n     need for more young people to be engaged in summer learning \n     activities and to support local summer programs that benefit \n     children, families, and communities;\n       Whereas a wide array of schools, public agencies, nonprofit \n     organizations, universities, museums, libraries, and summer \n     camps in many States across the United States, will celebrate \n     annual Summer Learning Day on July 10, 2008: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 10, 2008, as ``National Summer Learning \n     Day'', in order to raise public awareness about the positive \n     impact of summer learning opportunities on the development \n     and educational success of the children of the United States;\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to promote summer \n     learning activities, in order to send young people back to \n     school ready to learn, to support working parents and their \n     children, and to keep the children of the United States safe \n     and healthy during the summer months; and\n       (3) urges communities to celebrate, with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities, the importance of high quality \n     summer learning opportunities in the lives of young students \n     and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/07/senate-section/article/S6365-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 608--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF JESSE ALEXANDER HELMS, \n   JR., FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Burr, Mr. Akaka, \nMr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, \nMr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nColeman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \nMr. Obama, Mr. Pryor;

Res. 610\n\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was \n     created by Executive order on July 6, 1973, and merged the \n     previously separate law enforcement and intelligence agencies \n     responsible for narcotics control;\n       Whereas the first administrator of the DEA, John R. \n     Bartels, Jr., was confirmed by the Senate on October 4, 1973;\n       Whereas since 1973, the men and women of the DEA have \n     served the United States with courage, vision, and \n     determination, protecting all the people of the United States \n     from the scourge of drug trafficking, drug abuse, and related \n     violence;\n       Whereas the DEA has adjusted and refined the tactics and \n     methods by which the DEA targets the most dangerous drug \n     trafficking operations to bring to justice criminals such as \n     New York City's Nicky Barnes, key members of the infamous \n     Colombian Medellin cartel, Thai warlord Khun Sa, several \n     members of the Mexican Arellano-Felix organization, Afghan \n     terrorist Haji Baz Mohammad, and international arms dealer \n     Viktor Bout;\n       Whereas throughout the 35 years since the DEA was created, \n     the DEA has continually adapted to the evolving trends of \n     drug trafficking organizations by aggressively targeting \n     organizations involved in the growing, manufacturing, and \n     distribution of such substances as marijuana, cocaine, \n     heroin, methamphetamine, Ecstasy, and controlled prescription \n     drugs;\n       Whereas in 227 domestic offices, in 21 field divisions, the \n     DEA continues to strengthen and enhance existing \n     relationships with Federal, State, and local counterparts in \n     every State in the Union to combat drug trafficking;\n       Whereas since 2000, DEA special agents have seized over \n     5,500 kilograms of heroin, 650,000 kilograms of cocaine, \n     2,300,000 kilograms of marijuana, and 13,000 kilograms of \n     methamphetamine and almost 80,000,000 dosage units of \n     hallucinogens, and made over 240,000 arrests;\n       Whereas with 87 foreign offices, located in 63 countries, \n     the DEA has the largest international presence of any Federal \n     law enforcement agency;\n       Whereas the personnel of the DEA continue to collaborate \n     closely with international partners around the globe, \n     including in such drug-producing countries as Colombia, \n     Mexico, Afghanistan, and Thailand;\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\n       Whereas the results of this international collaboration \n     since 2000 alone have led to the indictments of 63 leaders, \n     members, and associates of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \n     Colombia, a designated foreign terrorist organization;\n       Whereas through the creation of the Diversion Control \n     Program in 1971, the DEA now registers and regulates over \n     1,200,000 registrants, while simultaneously combating the \n     continually evolving threat posed by the diversion of \n     controlled pharmaceuticals;\n       Whereas the DEA continues to disrupt drug trafficking \n     activities by denying drug trafficking organizations \n     $3,500,000,000 in fiscal year 2007 alone, exceeding their 5-\n     year goal of $3,000,000,000 annually by fiscal year 2009;\n       Whereas DEA special agents continue to work alongside \n     Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials \n     throughout the United States in a cooperative effort to put \n     drug traffickers behind bars;\n       Whereas throughout the history of the DEA and its \n     predecessor agencies, many employees and members of the task \n     forces have given their lives in the line of duty, including: \n     Charles Archie Wood, Stafford E.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaty transmitted to the Senate on July 7, 2008, by the \nPresident of the United States. It is the Treaty on Plant Genetic \nResources for Food and Agriculture (Treaty Document No. 110-19).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for \nFood and Agriculture, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations on November 3, 2001, and signed by the United \nStates on November 1, 2002 (the ``Treaty''). The Treaty entered into \nforce in June 2004.\n  The centerpiece of the Treaty is the establishment of a multilateral \nsystem under which a party provides access to other parties, upon \nrequest, to listed plant genetic resources held in national genebanks. \nThese resources are to be used solely for purposes of research, \nbreeding, and training in agriculture. A recipient of such a resource \nmust then share the benefits from its use, e.g., a recipient who \ncommercializes a product containing an accessed plant genetic resource \nmust generally pay a percentage of any gross sales into a trust \naccount.\n  Transfers under the multilateral system are to be accompanied by a \nstandard material transfer agreement, the current version of which was \nconcluded in June 2006.\n  Provision of plant genetic resources from U.S. genebanks is fully \nconsistent with the Department of Agriculture's long-standing general \npractice of providing access to such plant genetic resources upon \nrequest. Ratification of the Treaty will provide U.S. agricultural \ninterests with similar access to other parties' genebanks, thus helping \nU.S. farmers and researchers sustain and improve their crops and \npromote food security.\n  The Treaty may be implemented under existing U.S. authorities.\n  I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State concerning the Treaty, which contains an \nunderstanding regarding Article 12.\n                                                      George W.
