Madam President, 5 years ago on the deck of an aircraft \ncarrier returning from the Middle East, America and the world witnessed \nperhaps the greatest act of hubris our country has ever seen in \nwartime. Resplendent in a flight suit, landing theatrically in a \nfighter jet, President Bush declared: ``In the battle for Iraq, United \nStates and our allies have prevailed.'' Above him was a banner, printed \nby the White House, with the idea coming from Karl Rove. That banner \nproclaimed ``Mission Accomplished.''\n  With families fleeing from Iraq by the tens of thousands to live as \nrefugees, now approaching 2\\1/2\\ million--mission accomplished? With no \ngovernment in place, with towns destroyed, with infrastructure in \nshambles--mission accomplished?\n  When President Bush put on his flight suit, 139 American troops had \nlost their lives. Today, the toll has reached 4,058 or 4,059. In April, \nwith the highest death count in 7 months, 51 Americans were killed.\n  When President Bush landed on the runway of the USS Abraham Lincoln, \n548 Americans had been wounded. Today that count is far more than \n30,000, many of those grave injuries.\n  When President Bush announced that ``major combat operations have \nended,'' the American taxpayers had spent about $79 billion in Iraq. \nToday, $526 billion and counting, we are spending $5,000 every second, \n7 days a week, every week of the month, every month of the year. Those \ncosts are going up, not down, with experts such as Nobel Prize-winning \neconomist Joseph Stiglitz predicting $3 trillion will be the cost of \nthe war, with every penny of it borrowed--from Japan, from China, from \nSaudi Arabia, even from Mexico.\n  In May, 2003, many of our allies had already begun to stand apart \nfrom us on the war. Today, our moral authority in the world has been \ngravely damaged. Not one American looks back on the 5 years since that \naircraft stunt with any sense of satisfaction. Our country looks back \nwith grief, sadness, yet with a fierce and unwavering commitment to \nfinally change the mission and responsibly end the war in Iraq and \nbring our troops home.\n  That day aboard the USS Lincoln, our President told us the war would \nnot be endless. He said: ``Americans, following a battle, want nothing \nmore than to return home.'' He told the brave men and women aboard that \ncarrier that home was their direction that day; that:\n\n       After service in the Afghan and Iraq theaters of the war, \n     after 100,000 miles on the longest carrier deployment in U.S. \n     history, you are homeward bound.\n\n  Madam President, let me again read that quote:\n\n       After service in the Afghan and Iraq theaters of the war, \n     after 100,000 miles on the\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\n     longest carrier deployment in U.S. history, you are homeward \n     bound.\n\n  To the men and women aboard the Lincoln that day, that speech must \nseem a distant memory. Could they have imagined that day that many of \nthem, and their brothers and sisters in arms, would now be in their \nthird, fourth, and fifth tours of duty? The ``Mission Accomplished'' \nspeech will rightly be remembered with great anguish by all.\n  Look at this. This chart, sadly, is a little behind but it makes the \npicture. I indicated that wounded troops are more than 30,000 now. \nTroops in Iraq on that day were 5,000 more then, with the troops, some \nof them, coming home.\n\n  Cost of the war to the taxpayers--you can see that.\n  What do you American people think about the war in Iraq, was it worth \nfighting? You can see the numbers.\n  The estimated number of Iraqi civilians killed--Johns Hopkins \nUniversity did a study. Their study says over 200,000 Iraqis have been \nkilled. The number of Iraqis who have fled their homes is almost 5 \nmillion. The number of Iraqi security forces--we have trained them, we \npaid for them--is almost half a million.\n  Iraqi prison population.\n  Number of daily attacks by insurgents and militias in Iraq: to date \nit is about 55.\n  The number of multiple-fatality bombings in Iraq in May of 2003: \nzero. Now look at that.\n  Suicide attacks: almost 1000.\n  The price of oil: in May of 2003, it was $26.03 a barrel. Yesterday \nwe had a little drop in the oil price. It is down from more than $120 a \nbarrel the last few days to only $115 a barrel.\n  The price of gas then was $1.50. If you are lucky, you can find it \nsomeplace in the United States for $3.62. That is the average.\n  George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld will be written in the \npages of history as the men who rushed a peaceful, deliberate nation \nheadfirst into war without the slightest notion of what it meant to run \nor to end it. Five years later, the cost of their hubris is \nstaggering--in lives lost and damaged, dollars spent, moral authority \nsquandered.\n  Let's think back to the men and women aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln \nthat day 5 years ago; the excitement they must have felt by a \nPresidential visit; the encouragement of his words; the satisfaction of \nheading home to their families after a job well done.\n  They did their jobs, but the Commander in Chief didn't do his--as he \nhas not done his job here at home, with record gas prices, record oil \nprices, and an economy spiraling into recession. I met with a number of \nhomebuilders yesterday in room S-219. Have we reached the bottom in the \nhousing market? They said: No, we are not close yet. About 50 million \nAmericans are uninsured for health costs.\n  On this fifth anniversary, a sorry moment in our country's history, \nwe pause to honor the troops aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln and all our \ntroops, their brothers and sisters in arms who fought and sacrificed \nand continue to fight in Iraq. They deserve not the false hope of a \nslogan engineered by Karl Rove, the President's chief slogan maker, but \nthe real hope of a responsible end to a war that has raged far too \nlong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3650-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, here we go again. We all know the Senate \nhas limited time left this year to debate important legislation. It is \nbecoming more and more clear the Democratic leadership is staunchly \nopposed to doing anything that would alleviate the seemingly endless \nupward pressure on energy prices. Given their unyielding desire to \nincrease taxes on much of the energy industry, I can only assume the \nDemocrats in Congress believe that steadily increasing energy prices \nsimply provide political fodder upon which they can capitalize. \nDemocrats in both Chambers appear beholden to the environmental agenda, \na radical agenda that wholly disregards America's economy.\n  Oblivious to prices at the pump and indifferent to from whom we \nimport our oil, far-left environmentalists and their cohorts in \nCongress are failing in their duty to the American public. The Congress \nhas stymied efforts to produce trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, \ntrillions of barrels of oil, and prevented the construction of new \nrefineries, nuclear powerplants, and hydroelectric facilities through \npublic policies that limit energy supply. We cannot afford to take any \noption off the table.\n  The security concerns of America and our businesses and consumers \nstill demand energy. In oil alone, we consume over 20 million barrels a \nday. Since we only produce just over 8 million barrels per day, the gap \nmust be made up by purchasing oil from hostile or undemocratic nations, \nsuch as Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria to meet our energy needs. \nWe spend over half a trillion dollars each year importing foreign oil, \nand it is far past time to rectify this unhealthy dependency.\n  The global price for petroleum reaches new highs every day and \npetroleum-related imports have caused our trade deficit to increase by \nbillions of dollars.\n  According to a study by the Congressional Research Service, in 2005 \nand 2006 alone, our trade deficit rose by $120 billion. As oil prices \ncontinue to rise and domestic energy production is further obstructed, \nAmerica's trade balance will only fall deeper into the red.\n  As a Senator from energy rich Colorado, I am on the front lines of \nthe battle to increase our domestic energy production. The Democrats \ncontinue to delay efforts to tap into a natural gas reserve below the \nNaval Oil Shale Reserve, often referred to as the Roan Plateau, that \ncontains approximately 8.9 trillion cubic feet. We need this clean \nsource of energy now.\n  Moreover, below the vast lands of Colorado and Wyoming lies roughly \n1.5 trillion barrels of potentially recoverable oil. This amount dwarfs \nthe reserves of Saudi Arabia and other petro-rich nations, and new \ntechnologies continually emerging would allow us to responsibly extract \nthis oil to help meet our demands. The benefits to Colorado and the \nAmerican economy would be tremendous.\n  Additionally, national environmentalist groups have succeeded in \npressuring Members of Congress to mandate a lock-down of what could be \nan immense treasure chest of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  In subverting the widespread local support of Alaskans and in \nprohibiting the potential extraction of 5 to 15 billion barrels of oil, \nenvironmentalists stubbornly resist even moving forward with \ncomprehensive testing that could result in the environmentally \nresponsible development of parts of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey announced this month that 3 to 4 billion \nbarrels of technically recoverable oil exists under North Dakota and \nMontana's Bakken Formation. This is 25 times more than was estimated to \nexist in 1995. These numbers are staggering, and there are other \nexamples where our aversion to responsible development defies common \nsense.\n  Of course, we must continue our dedicated efforts to explore \nalternative sources of energy to meet our demands, but it is possible \nto develop sections of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, extract \nnatural gas from the Rocky Mountain west and harvest resources offshore \nin economically feasible ways and also protect our natural wonders.\n  We should not take increased production of any domestic oil off the \ntable. The longer we completely deny access to domestic supplies, the \nmore we exacerbate our current energy shortages.\n  We cannot solve the problem of soaring gas prices facing America \ntoday with one solution, but we certainly\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\nshould not allow the relentless push of environmentalists' narrow \nagenda to make this crisis even worse. What will the average gallon of \ngas in America have to cost for the Democratic leadership in Congress \nto step to the plate with a comprehensive solution for our consumers?\n  We should seek to develop our renewable resources along with oil, \ngas, clean coal, nuclear, and hydroelectric energy in a manner that \nprevents foreign interests from taking over energy for their own \npurposes.\n  It is time for congressional leaders to be a part of the solution and \nnot the problem. It is time to put every idea on the table. It is time \nfor common sense.\n  In the State of Colorado, we have a plethora of energy sources. We \nobviously rely on renewable energy because we have lots of sun and \nwind, we have hydroelectric, we have uranium to produce nuclear power. \nNone of these or our rich resources in petroleum and coal that exist \nthroughout the country should be taken off the table.\n  For us to subject ourselves to a harsh extreme environmental agenda \ndoes not make sense. This country should continue to work to develop \nall of those resources. Obviously, the future of this country is on the \nrenewable side, but we have to deal with today's problems, today's \nprice at the gas pump, and therefore we need to produce domestic \nresources in addition to supporting the renewable technologies we are \ncurrently developing.\n  If we do that, we will most successfully address the high cost at the \ngas pump today. Congress should be working with industry to make sure \nwe have more plentiful supplies of gas and petroleum products in \naddition to developing other sources of renewable energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would you please let me know when 5 minutes has \nexpired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3651-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3651-S3652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TVA APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, Tennesseans like our sports teams, \nwhether it is the Lady Vols, or the Memphis Tigers, or Bruce Pearl's \nteam from Knoxville. But John Calipari or Pat Summitt or Bruce Pearl \nwouldn't think of sending any of our teams into a big game with two \nplayers locked up somewhere--two players missing.\n  That is exactly what my friend, the Democratic leader, has done for \n8.7 million Americans who live in the seven-State region of the \nTennessee Valley Authority. Our big game, like most Americans, is gas \nprices, electric prices, climate change, clean air, national security.\n  Every Senator is on the floor talking about that; some blaming, some \nwith solutions. I am going to Oak Ridge on May 9 to propose a new \nManhattan Project to deal with clean energy independence.\n  But our secret weapon in the TVA region is the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority. That is how we get our clean air so we're in compliance with \nclean air laws and new jobs can come in. It is how we deal with climate \nchange. They have coal-fired powerplants. It is how we deal with large \namounts of electricity at a low cost. That has to do with jobs and it \nhas to do with gas prices as well.\n  Nissan, Toyota, and General Motors all are about to sell us plug-in \nhybrids that could, by some estimates, reduce the amount of gasoline we \nuse by up to 40 percent. That would deal with gas prices. But who will \nsupply electricity for the plug-in hybrids? The Tennessee Valley \nAuthority. So what happens? The Democratic leader locks up two of our \nbest players and won't let them play in the biggest game we've got. If \nhe did that to two of our Memphis basketball players, or UT Lady Vols, \nor two of Bruce Pearl's players, there would be a revolt in Tennessee, \nand I hope there is a revolt about this.\n  Here is what has happened: In 2004, after several years of debate, we \ncreated a new board for the Nation's largest public utility--the \nTennessee Valley Authority. The President appointed nine members. They \nwere unanimously approved. Two had short terms; they served with \ndistinction and the President nominated them for reappointment. The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee unanimously, under Chairman \nBoxer, brought them to the floor. They are ready for approval, ready to \ngo to work. But the Democratic Leader has sent me a letter that \nbasically says he will not allow them to be confirmed because they are \nRepublicans. That astounds me. I ask unanimous consent to put that \nletter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2008.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: I am writing to you to advise you \n     of my concerns regarding appointments to the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority (TVA).\n       As you know, the TVA was reconfigured in P.L. 108-477, the \n     Omnibus Appropriations bill enacted December 8, 2004. The \n     inclusion of that substantive legislation in this \n     appropriations vehicle expanded TVA membership to 9 members \n     from 3 members. This omnibus legislative rider gave \n     appointive authority entirely to the President with no \n     bipartisan representation.\n       I expressed my concerns regarding this situation over a \n     year ago when the first slate of 6 TVA nominees was sent to \n     the Senate. I asked the President to consider using one of \n     the remaining positions for a Democratic candidate. Despite \n     that request, the President nominated 3 additional \n     Republicans for the TVA. Before the Easter recess, we \n     confirmed one of those remaining 3 TVA nominees.\n       Given the inadequacy of bipartisan representation on the \n     TVA and our recent approval of 7 Republican nominations to \n     the TVA, I do not support proceeding with further TVA \n     confirmations at this time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                                  Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Democratic leader's decision to block these \nnominees because of their party affiliation overturns 75 years of \nFederal law and custom. Since 1933, Federal law has never made politics \none of the considerations for TVA appointments.\n  Most Presidents have appointed members of their own party, sometimes \npolitical independents--such as Bishop William Graves, one of the two \nnominees for reappointment who is being locked up.\n  Bishop Graves is not even a Republican. He is the most experienced \nmember of the TVA board, coming from the largest customer, Memphis \nLight, Gas and Water, and he is the presiding bishop of one of the \nlargest religious denominations in America.\n  I have sent a letter to the majority leader. I ask unanimous consent \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: Your decision to block Senate \n     confirmation of the President's renomination of Bishop \n     William Graves of Memphis and Susan Williams of Knoxville to \n     the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors astounds \n     me. If you succeed, you would overturn seventy-five years of \n     federal law and custom.\n       Your actions insult the Mid-South's largest city, Memphis. \n     Until Bishop Graves' appointment in 2006, a Memphian had \n     never served on the TVA board.\n       Your actions are an affront to more than one and a half \n     million African Americans in the seven--state TVA region. \n     Until the appointment of Bishop Graves the presiding Bishop \n     of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church--an African \n     American had never served on the TVA board.\n       Your actions are the kind of disheartening playpen partisan \n     politics that disappoint the American people and are causing \n     them to cry out for change in the way Washington does its \n     business.\n       Since the founding of TVA in 1933, federal law has never \n     required presidents to appoint TVA directors from one \n     political party or another.\n       Almost always, presidents have appointed members of their \n     own political party. As is the case with Bishop Graves, \n     members have often been political independents.\n       TVA is the nation's largest public utility, with more than \n     $9.2 billion in annual revenues and 8.7 million customers. In \n     2004, after several years of debate, Congress created a new \n     TVA board and a modern governance structure.\n       Bishop Graves and Susan Williams were original members of \n     the new board, nominated by the President and confirmed by \n     the Senate. They have served with distinction. The President \n     has now renominated them. The Senate Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works has again unanimously recommended them.\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\n       Tennessee Valley residents face no greater challenges today \n     than dealing with energy costs, clean air and climate change. \n     The Tennessee Valley Authority needs a full membership on its \n     board to solve those problems.\n       I respectfully request that you lift your roadblock, stop \n     trying to change seventy-five years of law and custom, and \n     allow these two outstanding nominees to go back to work on \n     the TVA board helping to provide the large amounts of clean, \n     low cost, reliable electricity Tennessee Valley residents \n     need to keep good jobs and clean air.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                  Lamar Alexander,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have said to the majority leader: This is an insult \nto Memphis. Bishop Graves is the first Memphian ever to serve on the \nTVA board in its history. It is an affront to the more than 1.5 million \nAfrican Americans in our region. Bishop Graves is the first African \nAmerican ever to be on the TVA board.\n  At a time when there is a stream of Democratic Senators coming to the \nfloor trying to find somebody to blame for high gas prices, why is the \nmajority leader locking up two of the most valuable players on our team \nwhose job it is to deal with high gas prices, high electric prices, \nclimate change, clean air, and national security?\n  I respectfully suggest that the majority leader, for whom I have the \ngreatest respect, lift this roadblock--stop trying to change 75 years \nof law and custom. Unlock our two players and let them out and let them \ninto the game against high gas prices and let them go to work.\n  This is disheartening playpen partisan politics--it disappoints the \nAmerican people and causes them to cry out for changing the way that we \ndo business in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, it is always an honor to be in the \npresence of the senior Senator from Tennessee who does such an \noutstanding job in this body of promoting bipartisanship.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has played a big role in that. I thank \nyou for that. I want to say I came here as did the Senator to solve big \nproblems for our country in a bipartisan way.\n  I just left a meeting that I think exemplifies that to the highest \nlevel, where Ron Wyden and Bob Bennett are cosponsoring a great piece \nof legislation in a bipartisan way, to solve the tremendous health care \ncrisis our country is dealing with today.\n  I am proud to be part of that and to join them in a bipartisan way to \nsolve this major problem. I know many of us are doing the same thing to \nfocus on the energy issues that are before us as a country. That is \nwhat I came here to the Senate to do. I know that is exactly the \nreason, Madam President, you came to the Senate.\n  That is why today I rise with tremendous frustration over the actions \nof our majority leader. I have enjoyed working with our majority \nleader, and he certainly has done a good job in many instances. But, \ntoday, strictly on a politically motivated basis, in a letter to the \nsenior Senator he stated he is not going to confirm TVA appointees \nbecause they are not Democrats.\n  We went through a tremendous amount of effort, or this body did prior \nto me being here, to make sure the TVA board was a professional board, \nthat people there were able to make decisions in the best interests of \nthat body and all the many people who are served by the TVA facility.\n  These two nominees are outstanding human beings. They have served \ntheir State, their cities, and our country with great distinction. \nBishop Graves is someone who recently was heralded here in Washington \nbecause of his tremendous leadership in making sure that the racial \ndivides that have been a part of our country were swept away.\n  Susan Williams has done the same, has been a leader in many other \nways, in business, and both of them have helped shepherd TVA through \nsome of the finest years TVA has had.\n  Both of these are reappointments. In other words, they have already \nserved as part of the TVA board, which recently has been expanded \ngeographically to bring in other States, which is a very good thing \nfrom the standpoint of board representation.\n  Both of these members were approved unanimously by EPW, again a \nbipartisan effort, which I might say also is controlled by the \nDemocratic Party. So I have to tell you while it is frustrating to me \nto see this body become a proxy in some cases for the Presidential \nraces, I hate to see some of the things we deal with as a result, and \nthat diminishes this body.\n  I will tell you that our leader taking this position is a tremendous \ndisservice to this body; diminishes this body. I hope the leader will \ncome to his senses, will realize that not only is he doing something \nthat is of tremendous harm to TVA, it damages this body for the \nmajority leader to act in such a politically motivated way.\n  I hope very soon these nominees will be reappointed. I hope TVA can \nget about its business in serving the people of Tennessee and other \nsurrounding States in a proper way. I hope the majority leader again \nwill do the right thing, will cause these nominees to come to the \nfloor. I am sure they will be unanimously confirmed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3652-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3652-S3653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, we are facing a real problem as \nAmericans increasingly go to the gas pump to fill the need of energy \nfor their vehicles and they find that the prices at the pump are ever \nhigher, more onerous, and it makes the family budget more difficult to \nmanage. This is a problem for working families, to the typical American \nfamily trying to drive children to school, participate in carpools and \nother activities. It hits everyone at a time when other economic \nproblems are surrounding the American family. We have a problem, and we \nhave to act. Failure to act is not an option. At this point in time, we \ncannot offer immediate solutions, but we have to recognize where we \nare. We have to recognize what has not happened.\n  I recall many days sitting where the Presiding Officer sits today, \nwhen our party was in the majority. Democrats would come to the floor \nand talk about how, if they were in power, because they were not in \ncahoots with the big oil companies, then things would be better, they \nwould find a way to make things better. There was a bold announcement \nmade by then-House minority leader Nancy Pelosi on April 24, 2006:\n\n       Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down \n     skyrocketing gas prices.\n\n  That is when prices were tipping at $3 a gallon. They were $2-\nsomething a gallon. I wish today we were back to those moments in time.\n  A commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices? I ask, \nwhere is the plan? What happened to that plan? Democrats came into \npower to lead both Houses of Congress on January 4, 2007. The \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota proudly took her oath; many others \ncame into office. At that point in time, the price of gas was $2.33 a \ngallon. Today, it is $3.62 a gallon. Is this what the commonsense plan \nto bring down prices was supposed to bring us? Is this why someone had \na plan that was going to help America? Has it helped us? Have we gone \nup or down? The fact is, today prices are $3.62.\n  What we should do is have some plain talk. The fact is, it didn't \nmatter who was in control of Congress because the laws of economics go \nwell above the laws of politics. This is about supply and demand. The \nfact is, there is not a commonsense plan. The fact is, there is no \nplan, that America's energy policy continues to flounder for several \nreasons. We have to act, and we have to act as responsible leaders.\n  One of the things that is inevitable is that as long as supply and \ndemand stay where they are today, with demand ever increasing and \nsupply topping out, we will continue to have increasing prices. I \nsubmit that part of what has to occur is increased production. We have \nto find ways that we can, within our own borders, produce more energy.\n  I have been supportive of drilling in 2000 acres of the vast \nwilderness of Alaska in a way that would be safe. If it had been done \nback when President\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\nClinton vetoed it, today a million barrels a day would be flowing into \nthe stream of production and would help with this supply problem we \nhave today.\n  There may be other safe ways. A year or so ago, we made a deal. The \ndeal was that we would drill safely in areas well away from the Florida \ncoast in the Gulf of Mexico--8 million acres for new drilling that are \nalso available and will produce oil and gas.\n  These are helpful steps, but they are not enough. We have to \nconserve. We have to find ways to encourage Americans to conserve at \nthe pump, to save by carpooling, to save by finding a way of buying \nmore energy-efficient vehicles.\n  We as a government should be helping American consumers through our \ntax system to find a way they can purchase vehicles that are more \nenergy efficient. We know that a hybrid vehicle will get 35 to 38 miles \nto the gallon. We know that a standard vehicle of similar size would be \nlucky if it gets 17 or 18 miles to the gallon.\n  At the end of the day, it is a combination of strategies. The bottom \nline is, we have to have a multifaceted strategy. We have to work \ntogether, not suggesting that there is one party that has a secret plan \nthat, in fact, doesn't exist. We have to find a commonsense way to work \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, to increase production modestly \nand safely, to encourage conservation and new technologies, and to \ncontinue to boldly move forward toward a Manhattan-type project that is \ngoing to put all of the resources and energies of this country toward \nenergy independence and energy security so we can discontinue this \nhorrendous practice of wealth transfer that is taking place today \nbetween our country--the billions and billions of dollars we are \ntransferring to some of the worst enemies of our country, people such \nas Hugo Chavez and Ahmadinejad.\n  The day is coming when we have to find a way to pull together toward \na common goal of having a sensible, balanced energy policy, increase \nproduction safely, conserve more, and new technology. All working \ntogether, we can do this. America can meet this challenge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I can't quite believe what I just heard. \nBecause Democrats in 2006 said we need a different energy policy than \nthe White House, a President and Vice President who both come out of \nthe oil industry, both top energy executives, where much of the funding \nfor the President's party comes from the oil industry, and in 2006, the \nDemocrats said the Congress betrayed the American people because they \nlet the oil industry write the energy bill, now my friend from Florida \nis saying it is the Democrats' fault that gas prices are through the \nroof.\n  One of the best friends of the President was the CEO of Enron, a \nmajor funder to the President, close friend of the President who had a \npersonal nickname, and Enron had gamed the system through speculating \nand speculating. It cost consumers, especially on the west coast, \nhundreds of millions, even billions of dollars as people raked off \nprofits from their speculating. We are seeing the same kinds of things. \nI don't know if they are the President's friends doing it anymore, but \nI know there are people who have gamed the system. That is the reason, \nwith no major international incident in the last 2 years, no major \noutage of a refinery or fire of a refinery or pipeline disruption, that \nprices have spiked so much.\n  It is clear that a Justice Department working for the President of \nthe United States, that is not beholden to the oil industry, might \nactually take some action on price fixing and recommend an excess \nprofits tax--all the kinds of things we could be doing in this body and \nthat the executive could do. But in this body, we have seen \nfilibusters.\n  Every time we try to do something on oil prices, every time we try to \ndo something on long-term alternative energy, the Republicans \nfilibuster. They have filibustered more than 60 times. It is \napproaching 70. I am not sure of the number; it is hard to keep up. \nThey have filibustered more times already in this congressional session \nthan they did in any 2-year session in history by a lot, and they are \ncontinuing to do it.\n  We would love to sit down with my friend on the other side of the \naisle and work on real energy legislation and wean this body and wean \nthe White House from their addiction to oil company campaign dollars, \nand help wean the American people from our addiction to foreign oil. We \nwould love to work on that.\n  I introduced legislation yesterday that will help to jump-start the \ngreen energy industry in this country. It is clear we need to do a lot \nof that. But the American public is tired of finger pointing. It is \ntime this Congress did more on energy, and that the Republicans, \ninstead of filibustering--there are 51 Democrats in this body; we need \n60 votes to do anything because of the filibuster--instead of the \nRepublicans holding together and blocking things, instead of \nfilibustering, let us work together on energy issues and not have the \noil companies dictate to this body, as they did for year after year \nafter year.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives, the oil companies \ndictated to the House of Representatives leadership, and everybody in \nthose days in the majority party--which was the Republicans then--went \nalong with their leaders on writing an energy bill that had $18 billion \nof subsidies and giveaways and tax breaks to the oil industry. Yet they \nare the most profitable industry in America year after year after year.\n  Something gives there. It is time for something very different. I \nwant to work together. The finger pointing should end. Let's sit down \nand do this right, but don't block us to do things that will help \nstabilize gas prices now and help to bring them down over the short and \nmedium term and long term to come up with a real energy policy so we \nare not relying on--as my friend Senator Martinez said--not relying on \nVenezuela and Saudi Arabia and countries that are not so friendly to \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3653-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3653-S3654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SMALL BUSINESS EMPOWERMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, earlier this week, I spoke on the Senate \nfloor about Cover the Uninsured Week and a bill I was introducing that \nwould increase access to health coverage for small businesses and self-\nemployed individuals--a group we all too often forget about around \nhere. Today I am formally introducing the Small Business Empowerment \nAct. I wish to discuss this bill in a bit more depth.\n  First, why is it necessary?\n  It is necessary because 82 percent--82 percent--of the uninsured work \nfor a living. They have jobs. The overwhelming majority work in small \ncompanies--companies with 2 people, 5 people, 20 people--or they are \nself-employed.\n  In Ohio, my State--whether you are in Steubenville or Lima, whether \nyou are in Kent or Chillicothe--99 percent of firms with more than 50 \nworkers sponsor health insurance. So if you are at a relatively \nmidsized or larger company, you have 50 or more workers, 99 percent of \nthose firms offer some kind of fairly decent insurance for their \nemployees. That is for companies above 50 employees.\n  For companies under 50 employees, only 44 percent of those firms do. \nMany of them are self-employed. Many of them only have 5 or 10 or 15 \nemployees. Small employers who do offer coverage--and most of them \nabsolutely try to--I have talked to small businesspeople from \nSpringfield to Zanesville, from Bellaire to Delphos, and I hear \nrepeatedly from small businesses they want to insure their employees, \nbut it is getting harder and harder and harder. According to the well-\nrespected RAND Corporation--a nonpartisan group that dispassionately \nanalyzes these kinds of things--small businesses saw the economic \nburden of health insurance rise by 30 percent between 2000 and 2005. \nAnd it is getting worse.\n  The situation is even worse for the self-employed, who must contend \nwith staggeringly high premiums for individual coverage--they don't get \nany group-rate break--if they can find an insurer even willing to cover \nthem.\n  In these small pools, if you have 3 employees or 8 employees or you \nare self-employed, and there is anybody in this small pool of 1 or 20 \nwho has some major preexisting condition, you probably cannot get \ninsurance at all.\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\n  In the meantime, health insurers have been living large, their \nprofits increasing by more than a third over the last 5 years--not much \ndifferent from the oil industry, where the public recoils from \nstaggeringly high gas prices, and the oil industry is making record \nhigh profits. The public--particularly small business--is recoiling \nfrom higher health insurance premiums and higher copays and \ndeductibles. Yet health insurance companies are doing better and \nbetter.\n  Middle-class families are shouldering the burden of skyrocketing gas \nprices and ballooning food prices, even as the equity in their homes \nerodes and the cost of putting their children through college explodes.\n  It would be ideal if they could afford to pay a king's ransom for \nhealth insurance. They cannot. And they should not have to.\n  With those realities staring us in the face, inaction from this body \nis the same as indifference.\n  My legislation attacks the issue of health coverage access from \nseveral different directions.\n  To ensure widespread access, the bill would establish a national \ninsurance pool modeled after the successful Federal Employees Health \nBenefits program. The FEHB, Federal Employees Health Benefits program, \nwhich enables enrollees to choose from a variety of health plans, with \nrates and benefits negotiated by the Federal Office of Personnel \nManagement, has served Members of Congress and hundreds of thousands of \nFederal employees well for many years now.\n  So understand, there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of \nthousands of Federal employees--whether they work in the Celebrezze \nBuilding in Cleveland, whether they work in the Office of Management \nand Budget in Washington, whether they work in Bethesda for the \nNational Institutes of Health, whether they work at Wright-Patterson \nAir Force Base; any of these Federal jobs--Federal employees are in a \nhuge pool that negotiates price. So it obviously works in a way that \nkeeps rates in check.\n  Under my bill, an independent contractor would manage a program that \nlooks like FEHB, with a few modifications to accommodate the market \nsegment it would serve. A few of those modifications are designed to \nhold down costs.\n  The bill would establish a reinsurance program to pay claims that \nfall between $5,000 and $75,000. That is where small business gets hit \nthe hardest. When 1 or 2 or 3 employees, in a company of 50 or 40 or 30 \nor 100, get hit with a huge bill of hundreds of thousands of dollars, \nit affects the entire pool, and it affects everyone's premium and, in \nmany cases, it makes insurance for the small business employer simply \nout of reach.\n  This bill establishes a reinsurance program to pay claims that fall \nbetween $5,000 and $75,000. This approach minimizes premium spikes and \nit makes coverage affordable for companies regardless of the age and \nthe health of their employees.\n\n  The bill establishes what is called a loss-ratio standard for \ninsurers. This means that insurers would be required to spend most of \ntheir premium income on claims, and hold down their administrative \ncosts. We know what happens with small employers: the administrative \ncosts the insurance companies take are typically huge and have a major \nimpact on the per-employee cost of health insurance.\n  The bill would identify and apply strategies to ensure that providers \nemploy ``best practices'' in health care, which means they are \nproviding the right care at the right time in the right amount.\n  Finally, the bill would target price gouging by drug manufacturers \nand manufacturers of other medical products, including medical devices.\n  Price gouging occurs in U.S. health care when a company exploits \nAmerican consumers by charging them dramatically higher prices than \nconsumers in other wealthy nations.\n  Why are we paying so much more for prescription drugs in this country \nthan the Canadians pay, when the Canadians often are buying drugs \nmanufactured in the United States? It is the same drug, same brand \nname, same packaging, same dosage. Yet they are paying in Canada \nsometimes half as much.\n  In fact, for years, I used to take--when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives--busloads of constituents to Canada, about 2, 2\\1/2\\ \nhours away from Lorain, OH, where I lived, to buy prescription drugs at \na pharmacy in Ontario. The same drug, same dosage--everything was the \nsame, except for the price.\n  Other modifications in the bill are designed to ensure that health \ncoverage is nondiscriminatory. Think about it this way: If your next-\ndoor neighbor develops a mental illness such as clinical depression, \nand you develop a medical illness such as heart disease, why should \nyour next-door neighbor be denied health benefits that you get because \nthat is a mental illness versus a physical illness? We both have paid \npremiums. Your next-door neighbor and you have both paid premiums to \ncover your health care costs. You both need health care. Why is one \ncondition--the condition of heart disease--more worthy of coverage than \nthe condition of clinical depression?\n  My bill charges a group representing providers, businesses, \nconsumers, economists, and health policy experts with rethinking health \ncare coverage to eliminate arbitrary differences in the coverage of \nequally disruptive, disabling, or dangerous health conditions.\n  The bottom line is this: We have an opportunity to expand access to \nhealth coverage in a way that achieves fundamental goals.\n  One, we reach populations who cannot find a home in the current \ninsurance system because they are small businesses, typically, or self \nemployed.\n  We stand up for American consumers who are paying absolutely \nridiculous prices in many cases for essential health care.\n  We demand spending discipline on the part of insurers. They have \nchosen to play a pivotal role in the health of our Nation. They can \nlive with reasonable limits on their administrative costs, as their \nprofits go up and their executive salaries are in the stratosphere.\n  We can clean up duplication and random variation in the delivery of \nhealth care services.\n  We can end arbitrary coverage rules that turn health protection into \na health care crapshoot.\n  For the sake of small employers, for the sake of their employees, for \nthe sake of self-employed entrepreneurs--whom we need so desperately in \nthis country to compete globally--and for the sake of every American \nwho did not request, did not sign up for a particular health problem, \nand should not be penalized for having it, I hope Members on both sides \nof the aisle will support my legislation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3654-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3654-S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ``MISSION ACCOMPLISHED'' ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, 5 years ago today, President Bush stood on \nthe deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in front of a banner that said \n``Mission Accomplished'' and he told the Nation that major combat \noperations ended in Iraq. Those were his words. Now, listening to the \nradio reports today, I hear that the President's Press Secretary, Dana \nPerino, said we all--all of America--misunderstood. He didn't really \nmean the mission in Iraq was accomplished; he was just talking about \nthe fact that the particular aircraft carrier on which he landed, that \nthey had done their mission and that was accomplished.\n  I don't even know how to react to that. It is beneath the dignity of \na White House Press Secretary to reach in that fashion. I will tell you \nwhy. I read the speech the President made in its entirety, and I don't \nsee one thing that talks about a mission accomplished by the USS \nAbraham Lincoln, the carrier--not one word, not one thing.\n  I thought to myself: What would that be like? I thought: Maybe it is \nas if the Presiding Officer or I were giving a speech on health care, \nand behind us\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\nwe had a big banner and the speech was televised and it said: Health \ncare for all. Health care for all. We gave a speech, and then a few \ndays later someone who saw the speech said: Senator, I am really \nannoyed about your speech. You said health care for all. I already have \nmy health care. I don't like your system. Leave me out of it.\n  And I responded in this way: I didn't mean anyone outside this room. \nI only meant the people I was speaking to in the room--even though I \nhad a sign that said: Health Care For All.\n  So please, please, let's not make matters worse by distorting the \ntruth any more than it has already been distorted from day one of this \nnational nightmare.\n  What else did the President say on that aircraft carrier that day 5 \nyears ago today? He said: Other nations in history have fought in \nforeign lands and remain to occupy and exploit. Americans following a \nbattle--\n  Listen:\n\n       Americans following a battle want nothing more than to \n     return home. Americans following a battle want nothing more \n     than to return home.\n\n  He said:\n\n       That is your direction tonight.\n\n  Five years ago, the President said we won the battle; it is time to \ngo home. Where are we 5 years later? I just heard 48 deaths last month, \nwhich is the highest in 6 months. Since that day 5 years ago, 3,922 \ntroops have died in Iraq, including 796 either from or based in \nCalifornia, and almost 30,000 have been wounded. We have spent more \nthan a half billion dollars, and there is no end in sight.\n  When the President made his declaration, the price of oil was $26 per \nbarrel. It now stands at $113 per barrel. Remember, the oil was \nsupposed to pay for the war. Remember. Don't forget, the oil was \nsupposed to pay for the war. That is what the administration told us.\n  The words, ``Mission Accomplished,'' no matter how somebody tries to \ntorture it, have come to symbolize the dishonesty and the incompetence \nthat took our Nation into an ill-advised war of choice--a war with a \nprice in terms of lives and treasure and our Nation's standing in the \nworld only grows higher and higher and higher with each passing day. We \ncannot afford it.\n  We recognize the words, ``Mission Accomplished,'' as part of a sad \nand familiar pattern, another verse in the same song from the people \nwho warned us the smoking gun could be a mushroom cloud. Remember when \nSecretary Rice said the smoking gun could be a mushroom cloud, even as \nthey knew it wasn't true. They assured us we would be greeted as \nliberators. They swore we would be turning the corner and that the \ninsurgency was in its last throes.\n  Then they said, when we asked why isn't this war over: Well, we need \nto train enough Iraqis, and when they stand up, we will stand down. We \nhave spent so much training the Iraqis--I want to make sure I am right \non this--$20 billion we have spent training over 400,000 Iraqis.\n  I asked General Petraeus: How many al-Qaida are there?\n  He said: Very few left, a few thousand maybe--not even.\n  I asked General Petraeus: How many insurgents are there?\n  He said: In the thousands.\n  We have trained over 400,000 Iraqi soldiers, but our troops are still \ndying instead of playing a support role as they should.\n  I wish to talk about the money that we, the taxpayers, are spending. \nWe are spending $10 billion a month in Iraq. That is $2.5 billion a \nweek. That is $357 million a day. Now, remember, this is all borrowed \nmoney and the cost of this is going right to the debt that our \ngrandchildren and their children will have on their backs. The \nPresident's policy is being paid for on a credit card, and we are \nsticking future generations with the bill. That is irresponsible and \nimmoral.\n  We don't have a plan to get out of Iraq 5 years after ``Mission \nAccomplished.'' Everybody says this war cannot be won through military \nmeans; it has to be won through political means. Yet we sit back, and \nthe Government in Iraq makes very little progress, and they know, \nbecause of this President and this administration, they don't have a \nprice to pay for not being effective. They don't pay a price for that, \nfor not solving this politically. They don't pay any price because we \nare going to be there, and the blood and treasure of this country is on \nthe line.\n  The President says: Iran and al-Qaida are our biggest enemies. The \nPresident of Iraq holds hands with Ahmadinejad of Iran. They kiss each \nother on the cheek. We spend this money, we lose these lives, our \nPresident says Iran is our biggest enemy alongside al-Qaida, and we \njust keep on sending the money to a government that embraces Iran.\n\n  Now, I don't care how you figure this out, it doesn't add up to me. \nFor less than the cost of 3 months in Iraq, we could enroll every \neligible child in the Nation in the Head Start Program for a year. For \n3 months in Iraq, that is what we could do for our children, and we \nknow the waiting list is long.\n  For 2 weeks in Iraq we could provide health insurance for 6 million \nuninsured children for a whole year. The list goes on.\n  For 7 days in Iraq we could enroll 2.5 million kids in afterschool \nprograms. For 6 weeks in Iraq we could ensure full interoperability of \nall of our communications systems. We are not protected in America \nbecause we don't give our emergency workers the interoperability they \nneed. For the cost of 6 weeks in Iraq we could do that. Oh, no.\n  For 3 weeks in Iraq we could extend the renewable energy production \ntax credit for 4 years and see jobs from solar and wind and geothermal \nenergy. We could extend 13 additional weeks of unemployment insurance \nin this recession for 1 month in Iraq. The list goes on.\n  We have given so much on this 5-year anniversary. It is time for a \nchange in this country. We need to tell the Iraqis we will stand behind \nthem, but we are not going to stand in front of them, and we are not \ngoing to continue to pay these enormous costs. Our country cannot \nafford it.\n  I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3655-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2881, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2881) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to authorize appropriations for the Federal Aviation \n     Administration for fiscal year 2008 through 2011, to improve \n     aviation safety and capacity, to provide stable funding for \n     the national aviation system, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Rockefeller amendment No. 4627, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 4628 (to amendment No. 4627), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 4629 (to amendment No. 4628), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 4630 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 4627), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 4631 (to amendment No. 4630), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the work done on this piece of legislation \nto bring it to the floor is a good piece of work. Democrats and \nRepublicans worked together to move toward solving one of America's \nmajor problems, and that is dealing with our aviation system. Chairman \nRockefeller, Senator Inouye, Senator Baucus, Senator Stevens, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Hutchison, and their staffs understood that ensuring \nthe safety and efficiency of America's air traffic is too important to \nfall victim to politics, slow walking, or obstruction. It even appeared \nfor a while that this bill was on the path to a relatively smooth and \neasy final passage.\n  But now our Republican colleagues have signaled that they plan to let \nthis bipartisan legislation fall victim to more obstruction. We could \nhave moved to the bill yesterday, but the Republicans wouldn't let us \ndo that. They forced us to spend more valuable legislative time not \nlegislating, not trying to strengthen our country for the American \npeople but simply overcoming procedural roadblocks that have been \nthrown at us time after time.\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\n  As we have said on a number of occasions, but certainly it is worth \nsaying again, Republicans broke the 2-year filibuster record in the \nhistory of this Senate in just 10 months. We are now up to 68 \nfilibusters. That is not normal filibustering, it is filibustering on \nsteroids.\n  Democrats want to change our country for the better. We want to \nchange the status quo. We have an economy spiraling into recession. Gas \nand oil prices are at a record high. We have the war in Iraq that 70 \npercent of the American people want to end. The problems we have faced \nand now face can't be solved easily.\n  But it would not be solved at all if Republicans refuse to let us \nlegislate. The distinguished minority leader raised questions about \noffering amendments to the aviation modernization bill. As I said \nseveral times yesterday, we welcome their amendments. We want them to \noffer amendments. We understand there is a Bunning amendment dealing \nwith turning coal into aviation fuel. I don't know much about that, but \nit is something that appears to be germane and relevant to the bill. We \nshould start to debate that amendment. But it appears no matter what I \nsuggest, it is obvious the Republicans don't like this bill and are not \ngoing to let us pass it.\n  It is my understanding that today they are concerned about at least \ntwo provisions in the bill. One deals with strengthening the passenger \nrail system we have in America and also doing something about the \ndepleted highway trust fund, which is leaving States with no money to \ndo road repairs, construction, and modernization. If that is the case, \nit seems to me the logical thing to do is to offer an amendment to take \nthose provisions out of the bill.\n  Long ago, when I was an assemblyman in the Nevada State Legislature, \nit didn't take long to understand that if you don't like something, \njust move to take it out. If you can muster the votes, that works. If \nyour amendment doesn't pass, at least everybody knows you have tried. \nHere the Republicans don't even try. They want to just kill things by \ndoing nothing.\n  I told my Republican counterpart that Democrats are making every \neffort we can to allow amendments to be offered. We welcome relevant \namendments on both sides of the aisle. That is how the legislative \nprocess is supposed to work. I even offered to the Republican leader \nthat we can sit down and let him help me be the gatekeeper of what \namendments should be offered. That is fair.\n  Do I want to avoid amendments that have nothing to do with aviation? \nI don't even care much about that. I want to move this bill forward. \nThe Republicans' obstruction and claims of unfair dealings are not \nreflective of the facts or reality. I made it clear that the amendment \nprocess will be fair, open, and take place in the light of day. This \nlegislation is far too important to fall victim to the gamesmanship we \nare now seeing. Air travel is about getting from point A to point B, \nsuch as going from Las Vegas to San Francisco or from San Francisco to \nChicago. That is what it is about--connecting to family and friends, \ngetting goods to businesses, and connecting Americans to the global \ncommunity.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration is facing challenges like they \nhave never faced before. A record 770 million passengers flew on U.S. \ncommercial airlines in 2007--nearly double the number who flew just 20 \nyears ago.\n  If these trends continue, the FAA told us we will have 1 billion \npassengers in just 12 years.\n  Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport--the fifth busiest in \nAmerica--now hosts 4 million passengers every month. At this rate, \nMcCarran will reach maximum capacity in the next 3 to 5 years.\n  Every American who flies understands what this new congestion means: \nlonger lines, more delays, and a more stressful, less efficient trip.\n  If growth in air travel in Nevada and throughout America is managed \ncorrectly, it represents a tremendous opportunity for airlines, \ntourism, and our economy. But the risks we face if we don't bring our \naviation infrastructure up to speed are clear: Americans could be put \nat greater risk, our economy could suffer, and air travel could grind \nto a halt.\n  This Aviation Investment Modernization Act will help ensure that we \nmanage this growing challenge. It will help passengers take off sooner, \nland safer, help commerce flow with fewer interruptions, and help \ncarriers lower their fuel costs--which will save us all money.\n  The Aviation Investment Act will make air travel safer by upgrading \naging airport infrastructure, enhancing oversight of airlines and the \nFederal Aviation Administration, and improving runway safety. There was \nan article within the past week that most airline accidents--the close \ncalls--are on runways, not in the air.\n  Right now, the GPS in your car is more sophisticated than the system \nthat guides your flight in an airplane. That is why this bill \nmodernizes an obsolete air traffic control system with modern \ntechnology. That is why this bill requires airlines to give passengers \nbetter information about arrivals and delays. That is why the bill \nincorporates elements of the passenger bill of rights to protect \nconsumers and deal with the most egregious flight delays and \ncancellations. That is why this bill does things that make air travel \nsafer.\n  As Americans take to the skies in record numbers, they deserve to \nknow the Government is doing everything possible to keep them safe. \nThis legislation will give the American people that confidence. It will \nalso make flying not only safer but less stressful, more efficient, and \nmore enjoyable.\n  We must not let a crumbling infrastructure grind our economy to a \nhalt. That is what it is doing.\n  I urge my colleagues, once again, to put politics aside, put \nobstruction aside, and work with us to pass the Aviation Investment \nModernization Act.\n  Mr. President, if somebody wants to offer an amendment to this bill, \nthey can come down and do that. They can play all the political games \nthey want, saying: Senator Reid filled the tree. This is something that \nis way inside the beltway, Mr. President. On this vehicle now before \nthe Senate, people can offer amendments. All they have to do is come \nand give us an idea of what the amendment is. I have been in the Senate \na long time, and it is no new theory that you would like to know what \nthe amendment is. We always give our amendments to the minority and say \nhere is what it is going to be. They should see it firsthand. This does \nnot prohibit them from doing that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Motion to Commit with Amendment No. 4636\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to commit the bill to the Finance \nCommittee with the instruction to report back forthwith, with the \nfollowing amendment, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) moves to commit the bill \n     to the Committee on Finance, with instructions, with the \n     following amendment:\n\n       The provision of this act shall become effective 2 days \n     after enactment.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\n                            Spending Record\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to respond to some attacks relative \nto my integrity which were run today in a New York newspaper--I think \nit was the Daily News--which I presume were energized and orchestrated \nby the staff of the leadership--the Senate office of the senior Senator \nfrom New York. The editorial could not have had the fact pattern that \nit had, had it not been fed that information from the senior Senator's \nstaff. So I think it is appropriate to respond to it.\n  It implies, obviously, that I am inconsistent in my views on how I \napproach spending in this Congress. I think that will come as a \nsurprise to most people in this Congress because I doubt anyone in this \nCongress--I am sure there are a few--does not think my record in trying \nto control spending and having some resistance to spending which I feel \nis inappropriate is fairly strong.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee, I tried to discipline spending. \nI tried to make our Government more affordable for our children. I \ntried not to pass on to our children debts which they should not have \nto bear so our children can have the opportunity to live as fulfilling \na life and have as high quality a life as we have had.\n  There is in this bill a proposal to spend $1.6 billion on an air \ntrain to Kennedy Airport. That is not an aircraft issue. It is clearly \nan add-on. This proposal is, ironically, paid for using the Tax Code in \na very ingenious way. It gives a credit to the State of New York, or \nthe city, for taxes which they don't pay over a period of time, which \nis fairly extensive. I think it will run into the period 2020. That \ncredit totals about $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion. It is, under any \nscenario--I did not use this term when I spoke about it first, but I \nwill use it now--it is under any scenario an earmark, and not a very \ngood earmark, to say the least.\n  The representation is that my opposition to this is an attack on the \nefforts of this country to address the very serious and legitimate and \nappropriate concerns of the city of New York that resulted from 9/11.\n  After 9/11, the people of New Hampshire and the people of this Nation \nwere committed and remain committed to making sure the city of New York \nis made whole, to the extent it can be. Obviously, it could never be \nafter such a horrific event. We in our State were happy to take our tax \ndollars and put them toward the city to try to address those problems, \nand I voted for that. And we in our State were happy to support efforts \nto rebuild and continue to be happy to support efforts to rebuild \nGround Zero because that is a place which has taken on sacred meaning \nto our Nation. But we are not interested, in New Hampshire--and I \nsuspect most American citizens are not interested--in using dollars \nwhich were supposed to be used for 9/11 to help out some other, maybe a \nlegitimate need--but I don't know whether it is--in the city of New \nYork, and that is building a train. I call it the train to nowhere. It \nis a bit of an exaggeration, but since I was trying to put it in the \ncontext of an earmark that was of a questionable purpose, that seemed \nlike a reasonable term to use. That has become sort of like the term \n``Xerox'' when you talk about an earmark about which you have serious \nquestions. But building this air train to Kennedy Airport--by the way, \nI understand there is some significant disagreement within the city \nabout whether it should even be built, but certainly it should not be \non this bill as an attempt to basically get around an authorizing \nprocess or a process which would air whether this earmark is \nappropriate.\n  It should also not use a brand new exercise in tax policy, which is \ntotally inappropriate, of basically using the tax laws in a way that \ncreates an earmark by saying that you get a credit for a tax you don't \neven have to pay. That is very bad precedent--horrific precedent, quite \nhonestly.\n  This earmark should see the light of day, and I don't think it can be \ndefended on the grounds of 9/11. In fact, I think that really does \nserious damage to the historic and very human perspective of 9/11. To \ntry to defend building an air train to Kennedy Airport and stand behind \n9/11 as your reasoning, and then claim, in a way that is most \ninappropriate, in my opinion, if somebody opposes that proposal, they \nare attacking the memory and the purpose and the sacredness of the 9/11 \nevent and the Ground Zero reconstruction, is just, even by New York \nstandards of exaggerated politics, carrying it a step too far--more \nthan a step too far, in my opinion. But that is what was done here.\n  An earmark was created for something which has only marginal \nrelationship to even downtown Manhattan--I guess you have to get there \nfrom Manhattan, so I guess it has a relationship--certainly no nexus \nwith Ground Zero from the standpoint of an air tram construction to \nKennedy Airport. Using the tax laws in an abusive way to generate this \nearmark and then claiming, when anybody raises the question of the \nlegitimacy of it, that they are somehow acting in a way that is \ninconsistent with the commitment to the rebuilding of New York after 9/\n11 and they are degrading the name of the 9/11 event is beyond the \npale.\n\n  But that seems to be the goal, the style, and the approach of at \nleast the people who fed the information to the paper--which I presume \nwas the staff of the senior Senator from New York. Maybe it was not his \nstaff. I would like him to come down here and deny it if it wasn't. I \nwould like him to come to the floor and deny it if he didn't basically \ngive this information and set the tone of this position because, very \nclearly, in my opinion, he has.\n  Let's return to the fact pattern as it exists. I will stop using the \nterm ``train to nowhere'' because I can understand how that might \nirritate. I will accept that term was probably inappropriately applied. \nI will call it an earmark, a very questionable earmark for a lot of \nmoney which does not flow from the original commitment, in my opinion, \nto the rebuilding of New York--which the citizenry of America made and \nwhich we were happy to stand behind.\n  In fact, ironically, the plans for this train, this elevated train, \nwere begun in 1998, and the actual commitments that this train would go \nforward, as I understand it, were discussed as early as 1988. The claim \nthis is tied into Ground Zero is to extend credibility quite a bit, in \nmy opinion. To hide behind that and use it in such a personal way which \nbasically questions another Member's integrity is obviously \ninappropriate.\n  I think the Senator may have the votes to support his proposal to \nraid the Tax Code for $1.6 billion. Maybe he has the votes to do that. \nBut it should not be on this bill. It is not an airplane issue. I can \ntell you right now, if I have anything to say about it, this bill is \nnot going to move forward as long as it is on this bill.\n  It had not been my intention to engage at this level, but, as, you \nknow, people from New Hampshire know how to play politics. We know how \nto deal in this Chamber as well as people from New York. We may be from \nthe country, but we know how to engage. It appears engagement has been \ncalled upon, so let us go forward and see who is right, see who has the \nequities on their side, and determine whether the American people \nbelieve building a train which was designed in 1988, was committed to, \nI believe, in 1998, about which there is considerable discussion \nwhether it should even be going forward, which is an elevated train to \nan airport in, I believe, Queens, is an appropriate use of $1.7 or $1.6 \nbillion of their hard-earned income. Let's see what happens on that \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I remember those days in West \nVirginia when all the major airlines operating large jet aircraft \nserved all of West Virginia's airports--jets, actual jets coming into \nWest Virginia. Airline deregulation was a terrible mistake. It changed \nthe very nature of air travel in this country for all. For millions of \nAmericans in large urban areas, it ushered in an era of affordable air \ntraffic. A trip to New York and Los Angeles went down. In fact, at a \nnumber of points, it became much cheaper to go\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\nto Los Angeles from New York than to go from West Virginia to \nWashington. But for West Virginia communities, it meant a loss of \nservice and convenience and often higher prices. It seemed to me that \nthe big jets disappeared from West Virginia within days of \nderegulation. I remember those nice American, United, and Eastern jets \nsitting out there on the tarmac, people piling on. Deregulation--boom, \nthey were gone.\n  For 30 years, small and rural communities have had to cope with very \nlimited and unreliable service. The Presiding Officer knows exactly \nwhat I am talking about. Over the last several years, these problems \nhave been exacerbated by the weakened financial condition of the U.S. \nairlines, which is what this whole effort to get a bill going is about.\n  After September 11, dozens of communities saw a dramatic decrease in \nthe level of air service. It was measurable, noticeable, and \ndepressing. Many lost service altogether. As the industry recovered \nfrom the dramatic downturn in the air traffic that tragic day sparked, \nsmall communities did not see the benefits of that resurgence because \nonce they dropped something, it was easier to keep it dropped rather \nthan to help.\n  Small community air service is facing an unprecedented crisis. If we \nfail to act to address this problem, dozens of small communities across \nour Nation will face a future without air service. Consider that for a \nmoment--small communities, viable industries, institutions, people who \ncount. Americans are born equal, but then some don't have air service. \nThat is what we have now. Without access to reliable air service, we \nthrow into question their economic future.\n  I do not come to the Senate to represent the diminution of \npossibilities for West Virginia's economic future. I have spoken about \nthe weakened financial condition of our major airlines. But we must \nalso recognize that small regional carriers that provide the air \nservice to rural States such as West Virginia and Montana and parts of \nOhio, I am quite certain, also provide the vast majority of air service \nto midsize communities across the country, and they are teetering on \nthe brink of collapse because of high fuel prices.\n  As Senator Baucus knows all too well, small airlines across the West \nhave folded, leaving at least 17 communities with no air service at \nall. Seventeen communities would sort of make up the entire State of \nWest Virginia. That is a terrible blow. So few regional airlines are \nwilling to initiate service to small, isolated communities that, when \none withdraws service, it is very hard to find replacement air service. \nIn most cases, it is impossible. Hundreds of small and rural \ncommunities across our country are facing drastically reduced air \nservice because of this financial turmoil in the industry. Even in the \nbest of times, these communities face a difficult time maintaining and \ndeveloping new air service options. Today, their challenge is \npreventing the complete loss of air service. That is effort No. 1: Hold \non to whatever you might have. No matter if it is one flight a day, \nhold on to it. Fight for it.\n  I strongly believe the Federal Government must continue to assist our \nmost vulnerable communities stay connected to the Nation's aviation \nnetwork, a network paid for by all Americans.\n  The reduction or elimination of air service has been devastating in \nterms of its effect on the economic well-being of many of our \ncommunities across the country. Having adequate air service is not only \na matter of convenience, it is a matter of economic survival. Without \naccess to reliable air service, businesses will not locate their \noperations in these areas of the country, no matter how attractive the \nquality of life or the quality of the workforce. We have, for example, \nextremely low housing prices, low property taxes, and an \nextraordinarily highly productive workforce, with an average in \nmanufacturing of 1 percent annual turnover. That is almost unheard of. \nAirports are economic engines that attract critical new development \nopportunities and the people who can make those things happen or \ncontinue to grow.\n  West Virginia is a very good place to do business. Toyota and a \nnumber of other large industries, chemical and otherwise, have found \nthat out. I can proudly state that countless large U.S. and \ninternational companies have facilities in my State. I can even point \nout that 20 Japanese companies have industries in the State of West \nVirginia, three in Wayne County, which the Presiding Officer is \nfamiliar with. From West Virginia, a business traveler can get to seven \nairline hubs and from these seven cities can get to any point on the \nglobe. One-stop service to Tokyo, London, Dubai is critical if my State \nis going to compete in the global economy. West Virginia has been able \nto attract firms from around the world because corporate executives \nknow they can visit their operations with ease. That is why we have air \nservice. Rural and smalltown America must continue to be adequately \nlinked to the Nation's air transportation network if its people and \nbusinesses are to compete with larger urban areas and around the world.\n  When Congress deregulated the airline industry, we promised small and \nrural communities we would make sure they would remain connected to the \naviation system. We have failed in our commitment to those promises. \nThe Essential Air Service Program, which Congress established when we \nderegulated the airline industry, is not a huge program, but it \nprovides money to attract airlines into smaller communities and is \nincredibly valuable.\n  But, on the other hand, the essential air service has never met the \ntrue needs and expectations of rural air service or the necessary \nrequirements of rural air service.\n  In West Virginia, the essential air service has often been plagued by \nhigh fares and limited, sporadic service. For 10 years, I have worked \nto strengthen small community air service. I do that because I \nrepresent a rural State with hard-working people who have an enormous \ndesire to succeed and to work and are deprived of what many other \nAmericans take for granted. That is not fair in Internet connection; \nyou cannot have a rural and urban divide. It is just as true in airline \nservice; you cannot have urban doing well, rurals being left out \nbecause we are all Americans, all created by God to be equal.\n  So I have worked to strengthen small community air service. In the \nAviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, which Congress \nenacted into law in the distant past of the year 2000, we began to \naddress the need to improve air service in small and rural communities.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues, supported the creation of \nsomething called the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot \nProgram, a competitive grant program to provide communities with the \nresources they needed to attract new air service to their town. We try \neverything we can. We try absolutely everything we can. Over 100 \ncommunities now have used these grants to secure and retain new air \nservice options. That is good.\n  I wish to highlight two success stories which happened in my State. \nCharleston received money under the program I have described and has \nused it successfully--Charleston is our capital--they have used it very \nsuccessfully to attract a new service connection for our chemical \nindustry to Houston. Why is that important? Well, our chemical \ncompanies do a lot of the training of their people in Houston and then \nthey come back and they work in our chemical companies. Air service to \nHouston gave West Virginians an important gateway, in addition, \ntherefore, to the markets of Latin America.\n  Over the past 2 years, Tri-State Airport in Huntington has been \nreborn because of the money it received under this Small Community Air \nService Development Grant Program. Prior to attracting a low-cost \ncharter operator, the airport had seen a steep decline in the number of \npassengers using the airport. With fewer passengers, airlines cut back \nflights. Fewer flights meant fewer passengers. It was a death spiral.\n  Once the community was able to secure a grant, matched with almost as \nmany local dollars, airport officials were able to attract a new \ncarrier that served the critical markets local residents wanted. For \nthe first time in 20 years, large jets roared off the runways in West \nVirginia, in Huntington. The airport will have 100,000 passengers pass \nthrough its gates for the first time in decades.\n  Now, that is not very impressive if you are from New York or Los \nAngeles,\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\nbut in West Virginia it shakes the world, and it gives people new hope. \nI was there when all this happened, and you could see a new sense of \nvigor and determination in the population. Air service attracts \ncommunity ambition.\n  Improving air service must be a collective effort. Communities are \nmost successful in creating new air service options when everyone--\nincluding the Federal and the State governments, airports, airlines, \nbusinesses, and citizens--works together to attract, promote, and use \nthe service.\n  One of the things we learned the hard way in West Virginia was you \ncannot treat an airport similar to something which is out there which \npeople will automatically go to. We used to have a lot of our people \nfrom Charleston driving all the way to Cincinnati and actually not \nunderstanding that the cost of traveling to Cincinnati and the fuel and \nthe overnight and all the rest of it actually did not give them that \nmuch of a financial break, but they looked at the cost of the airline \nand off they went. So 16 percent of Charleston's traffic disappeared.\n  I am now proud to say West Virginia communities have been able to use \nthis important program to rethink their air service needs, to think \nabout marketing airports. You market airports like you market anything \nelse. People have to be aware of it. You have to attract people to it. \nIt is not something which is there. It is something which has to sell \nitself. LaGuardia does not have to do that. Newark does not have to do \nthat. In West Virginia, we have to do that, and we are doing that.\n  The FAA bill that is before us extends the authorization for these \nimportant programs for 4 more years.\n  Four West Virginia commercial airports rely solely upon the Essential \nAir Service program for any service at all. We are extending that and \nenlarging the amount. No community wants to be dependent on essential \nair service. It is not a badge of honor. But it is a fact of survival. \nBut for many, it is their only option to maintain air service.\n  But as I mentioned earlier, the program has not met the needs of many \ncommunities. In 2003, as part of the last FAA reauthorization bill, I \ncreated a number of new voluntary pilot programs for essential air \nservice communities. I modeled these initiatives after the Small \nCommunity Air Service Pilot Program by focusing on incentives rather \nthan punitive approaches.\n  Under this new plan, a community could receive funds to develop its \nown marketing plans rather than rely on the airline for one. It could \nuse funds to increase service levels, opt to use different types of \naircraft or investigate the use of alternative transportation service. \nIn other words, it said: What is our problem? What are we going to do \nabout it? We cannot wait on other people. We have to make these \ndecisions ourselves. We are doing that in West Virginia.\n  This year, we have added a number of provisions to strengthen the \nEssential Air Service program. We have increased the authorization \nlevel for the program by $58 million to $175 million a year. We have \nincluded provisions to help carriers that provide the essential air \nservice so they can meet the cost of high fuel. It is essential. We \nhave increased the flexibility of the program even further so \ncommunities can work with the Department of Transportation and air \ncarriers to find air service that works for them.\n  Small and rural communities are the very first to bear the brunt of \nbad economic times. It has always been so. It shall always be so. The \nPresiding Officer knows exactly what I am talking about. We are always, \nin West Virginia, at the end of the food chain on everything. We \nunderstand that. We do not like it, but that is our current \ndestiny, and so that is why we have to fight harder and try to be more \nimaginative.\n\n  The general economic downturn and the dire straits of the aviation \nindustry have placed exceptional burdens on air service to our most \nisolated communities. The Federal Government must provide additional \nresources for small communities to help themselves attract air service. \nIf you have to do the work yourself, you do it. You just do it. The \nFederal Government must make sure our most vulnerable towns and cities \nare linked to the rest of the Nation. It is an easy statement to make, \nbut it is a huge statement. We have an obligation in this country to \nmake sure all of our communities and our people are linked to the broad \nair service opportunities, hubs and spokes. It has to happen.\n  My legislation builds on existing programs and strengthens them. We \nmust continue to provide our constituents the tools and resources \nnecessary to attract air service, and we are doing that.\n  So, in closing, I should say a subsidy alone does not solve the \nproblems of small community air service. If our constituents do not use \nthat service, or the airlines take it away--airlines cannot operate \nunprofitable flights or flights that are marginally profitable, for \nwhich they could do better elsewhere. They make a little bit of money \nor they do not make a little bit of money, and they are gone because \ntheir situation is so dire.\n  I do not know what the future of the U.S. airline industry will look \nlike in 6 months, but our Nation needs a strong airline industry. Our \ncommunities need to be connected to the aviation system.\n  That is why we are going through this most extraordinary exercise of \nno amendments to be voted on, a good deal of time to sit and talk, a \ngreat deal of frustration. But we are trying to pass something called \nthe Federal aviation bill that will provide service to our people. If \nthere is anything in the national interest, it is that. I will not go \nso far as to say it is more important than the interstate highway \nsystem, in terms of economic development and also reaching out to the \nworld, which all our States need now to do on a two-way basis.\n  So we fight. We continue to fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, while the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is on the floor, I wish to, first of all, commend him for \nhis efforts on behalf of aviation in the United States. I associate \nmyself with his remarks about rural and underserved areas. I associate \nmyself with all the remarks he made in support of our aviation system.\n  I am one of those people who are frustrated with our inability to \ndeal right now with amendments. I understand a substitute was offered \nlast night and the tree was filled so there are no germane amendments \nthat were--the amendments that were filed yesterday are no longer \ngermane; am I correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I say to my good friend, the \nSenator from Georgia, things have changed a bit this morning and \ndecisions are being made on that side of the aisle that will determine \nwhether we can move forward. I am hopeful about that process.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, in the hopeful event we can move \nforward, I wish to, for a minute, with the distinguished Senator, make \nhim aware of an amendment I submitted yesterday but is not pending. It \ncannot be pending right now. I agree with the Senator entirely on the \nimportance to the American economy of U.S. aviation. In the bill they \nput out, there is one element that was not addressed that I think \nshould be.\n  On December 31 of this year, the United States providing terrorism \ninsurance to the airlines sunsets. If it is, there will be no access to \nterrorism insurance by U.S. domestic carriers because the only private \ninsurers that will offer terrorism insurance offer it with an advanced \ncancellation provision, which basically means if we went to a code \nlevel orange or a code level red, the insurance company in advance of a \nterrorist attack could actually cancel the insurance. So the aviation \nindustry would be without insurance.\n  Our competition in Europe does not have that problem. They still have \nprivate insurance available for coverage of aviation terrorism. I \nsubmitted an amendment yesterday that would extend the date of December \n31 of this year--which is the expiration date--to make it December 31, \n2011, so airlines can continue to pay the U.S. Government for insurance \nagainst terrorism.\n  If my understandings are correct, those premiums totaled $160 million \nin the last year and are a revenue source to the United States of \nAmerica, as it should be. We should not be providing it without cost.\n  So I would hope, when the meetings that are going on are concluded, \nand if\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\nwe can get back to the base bill and if amendments again become \nrelevant, that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the \nSenator from Alaska, and the others who have worked so hard on this \nlegislation will look favorably on an extension of terrorism insurance \navailability to domestic U.S. carriers.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I say also to my very dear friend \nfrom Georgia with whom I have a long and wonderful background because \nof his strong reaction to our plight in West Virginia with the coal \nminers--he doesn't have coal in his State but he came into our State \nand adopted it as his own and we adopted him.\n  I also wish to tell him that what he is suggesting is something I \nvery much support.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4642 to Amendment No. 4637\n\n  Madam President, I believe there is an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4642 to amendment No. 4637.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment, strike ``1'' and insert ``3.''\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Healthy Americans Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, there is now an historic coalition here \nin the Senate, a group of 14 Senators. Seven Democrats and 7 \nRepublicans are sponsoring a health bill guaranteeing all Americans \nquality, affordable health care coverage. There has never been such a \ncoalition in the history of the Senate.\n  Today our group got some historic news. The Government's go-to \nofficials for budgeting and taxes have thrown decades of conventional \nwisdom into the trash can. They have informed our group that all \nAmericans can have quality, affordable health care coverage without \nbreaking the bank.\n  Briefly, here is what the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation have found. They found that our legislation, the \nHealthy Americans Act, can be up and running in 2012. They found the \nlegislation would become budget neutral in 2014. That means our \nlegislation is self-financing in the first year that universal health \ncare coverage would be fully implemented in our country. In the years \nafter 2014, because the legislation holds down health cost increases, \nit starts to generate budget surpluses for the Federal Government.\n  This analysis is fresh, independent evidence that health care can be \nfixed without massive tax increases or boatloads of additional \nGovernment spending. It is a chance, in my view, for Congress and our \ncountry to look at the issue of health care reform with fresh eyes, \nbecause what the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation have analyzed doesn't involve a set of lofty principles or \nsome of the oratory from the campaign trail, but it is actual \nlegislation.\n  Because this report is a historic document, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the letter dated today from the Congressional Budget Office and \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation be printed in the Record. The report is \navailable on the CBO Web site www.cbo.gov.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 1, 2008.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert F. Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: At your request, the staffs of our two \n     organizations have collaborated on a preliminary analysis of \n     a modified proposal for comprehensive health insurance based \n     on S. 334, the ``Healthy Americans Act,'' which you \n     introduced last year. That modified proposal includes various \n     clarifications and changes that you have indicated you would \n     like to examine as part of the consideration of that bill. \n     Attachment A summarizes our understanding of your modified \n     proposal.\n       The staffs of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have worked closely \n     together for the past several months to analyze your modified \n     proposal; this collaboration reflects both the novelty of the \n     undertaking and the intimate connection between the revenue \n     and expenditure components of this proposal. We have \n     summarized our conclusions in this joint letter; its purpose \n     is to give you preliminary guidance regarding an approximate \n     range of revenue and cost results that might be expected from \n     your modified proposal. This joint letter does not constitute \n     and should not be interpreted as a formal estimate of your \n     proposal's budgetary impact, which--for the purposes of \n     scoring under the Congressional Budget Act--would ultimately \n     be provided by CBO and would incorporate revenue estimates \n     prepared by the JCT staff.\n       The basic thrust of your modified proposal is to require \n     individuals to purchase private health insurance and to \n     establish state-run purchasing pools and a system of Federal \n     premium collections and subsidies to facilitate those \n     purchases. The system's premium collection and subsidy \n     mechanisms would be based largely on income tax filings, and \n     the required benefits would initially be based on the Blue \n     Cross/Blue Shield standard plan offered to Federal workers in \n     2011 and then allowed to grow at the rate of growth of the \n     economy. Although employers would have the option of \n     continuing to offer coverage to their workers, nearly \n     all individuals who were not enrolled in Medicare would \n     obtain their basic health insurance coverage through this \n     new system. Most enrollees in Medicaid and all enrollees \n     in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) \n     would have their primary insurance coverage shifted to the \n     new system.\n       Your proposal also would replace the current tax exclusion \n     for employer-based health insurance premiums with a fixed \n     income tax deduction for health insurance. (In addition, \n     employers that had provided health insurance would be \n     expected to ``cash out'' their workers--that is, to increase \n     workers' wages by the average contribution that the employers \n     would have made for their health plan.) The proposal also \n     would require new tax payments from employers to the Federal \n     government and further would seek to recapture the savings to \n     state governments from reduced expenditures on Medicaid and \n     SCHIP.\n       There are several important distinctions between the \n     proposal we analyzed and S. 334 as it was introduced. For \n     example, our analysis was limited to the operation of the new \n     health insurance purchasing system and did not take into \n     account most of S. 334's provisions regarding the Medicare \n     program or other provisions that would not directly affect \n     the new system. More fundamentally, the modified proposal \n     would tie the premiums collected through the tax system--as \n     well as the premium subsidies for lower-income households--to \n     the cost of the least expensive health plan available in an \n     area that provided required benefits, not to the average \n     premium amount, as under S. 334. Furthermore, the value of \n     the new tax deduction would not vary with the premium of the \n     insurance policy that was actually purchased, and the \n     schedule of employers' payment rates would range from 3 \n     percent to 26 percent (rather than 2 percent to 25 percent) \n     of the average premium. Attachment B describes in more detail \n     the main differences between your modified proposal and S. \n     334.\n       The preliminary analysis reflected in this letter is \n     subject to three important limitations. First, the staffs of \n     both JCT and CBO are in the process of enhancing our \n     capabilities to estimate the effects of comprehensive health \n     care proposals. Improvements in our methodologies or more \n     careful analysis of your modified proposal's provisions--\n     particularly as you translate those concepts into formal \n     legislative language--could change our assessment of its \n     consequences.\n       Second, any formal budget estimate will reflect the \n     macroeconomic assumptions and the baseline projections of \n     current-law tax and spending policies in effect at the time \n     it is issued. That baseline could differ materially from \n     today's baseline.\n       Third, we focused our analysis on a single future year in \n     which the proposed system would be fully implemented. For \n     that purpose, we settled on 2014, the sixth year of the \n     current 2009-2018 budget window. Under an assumption that the \n     proposal is enacted in 2008, that timeline for full \n     implementation seems to us to be achievable but could be \n     optimistic, as we expect that it would probably take until \n     2012 for the new system to begin operation, and several \n     years after that for various phase-ins and behavioral \n     adjustments to take place. The new system would involve \n     temporary net budgetary costs in its initial years; we \n     have not analyzed the magnitude of those early-year \n     transition costs.\n       Overall, our preliminary analysis indicates that the \n     proposal would be roughly budget-\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\n     neutral in 2014. That is, our analysis suggests that your \n     proposal would be essentially self-financing in the first \n     year that it was fully implemented. That net result reflects \n     large gross changes in Federal revenues and outlays that \n     would roughly offset each other.\n       More specifically, under your proposal, most health \n     insurance premiums that are now paid privately would flow \n     through the Federal budget. As a result, total Federal \n     outlays for health insurance premiums in 2014 would be on the \n     order of $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion. Those costs would be \n     approximately offset by revenues and savings from several \n     sources: premium payments collected from individuals through \n     their tax returns; revenue raised by replacing the current \n     tax exclusion for health insurance with an income tax \n     deduction; new tax payments by employers to the Federal \n     government; Federal savings on Medicaid and SCHIP; and state \n     maintenance-of-effort payments of their savings from Medicaid \n     and SCHIP. Attachment C provides more information about the \n     approximate magnitudes of those components.\n       For the years after 2014, we anticipate that the fiscal \n     impact would improve gradually, so that the proposal would \n     tend to become more than self-financing and thereby would \n     reduce future budget deficits or increase future surpluses. \n     That improvement would reflect two features of the proposal. \n     First, the amount of the new health insurance deduction would \n     grow at the rate of general price inflation and thus would \n     increase more slowly than the value of the current tax \n     exclusion.\n       Second, the minimum value of covered benefits that all \n     participating health plans had to provide would initially be \n     set at the level of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield standard \n     option offered to Federal workers in 2011 (we assume that the \n     system's inaugural year would be 2012); but under your \n     proposal that average value would from that point forward be \n     indexed to growth in gross domestic product per capita rather \n     than growth in health care costs. Because Federal premium \n     subsidies would be based on the cost of providing that level \n     of coverage, the cost of those subsidies would grow more \n     slowly over time.\n       We hope this analysis is useful to you. Not surprisingly, a \n     number of uncertainties arise in attempting to predict the \n     effects of such large-scale changes to the current health \n     insurance system. Although we have provided a range of \n     results that reflect our current expectations about likely \n     outcomes, actual experience--and the results of a formal cost \n     estimate--could differ substantially in either direction. If \n     you have any questions about this analysis, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us; the staff contacts are Pam Moomau and \n     Nikole Flax for JCT and Philip Ellis for CBO.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peter R. Orszag,\n       Director, Congressional Budget Office.\n     Edward D. Kleinbard,\n       Chief of Staff, Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to touch on a few points with \nrespect to this report. Obviously, the key to fixing health care is to \ncontain costs. Our bipartisan legislation does that by making sure all \nAmericans have more clout in the marketplace. We achieve that by making \nsure that everyone goes into a big pool, because if they are off by \nthemselves, they don't have a lot of ability to get the best deal for \ntheir health care dollar. But if they belong to a bigger group, they \nhave a lot better chance of containing costs. We cut the administrative \ncosts of health care. We use a State and regional pooling approach that \nhas been found to cut administrative costs. We get patients out of \nunnecessary hospital emergency room visits because more would get seen \non an outpatient basis. We make progressive changes in tax law and we \nempower consumers, because for the first time, if they have employer-\nbased health coverage, they could actually find out what is being spent \non their health care. Right now, basically all they know is they are \nnot seeing their wages go up because health care costs are eating up \nall of the employers' resources. We think making sure that the worker \nknows what is being spent on health care provides them a new set of \nopportunities to get more for their health care dollar.\n  My view is that today's health care system is largely driven by \nemployers and insurance companies. Clearly, there is a significant role \nto play for them. But what we do in our legislation is provide a bigger \nrole for individuals and especially their health care providers--the \nthousands of doctors and nurses and physician assistants. We make sure \nthat everybody under our legislation could have a health care home. So \ninstead of being lost in an incredibly complicated health care system, \nthere would be one person who would coordinate each individual's care.\n  A big part of what we are doing in this bill is to modernize the \nemployer-employee relationship in the health care field. What we are \ndoing in 2008 in health care as it relates to employers and employees \nisn't much different than what was done in 1948. The Chair can remember \nall of the efforts of President Truman to make changes in American \nhealth care. So we modernize that relationship. We continue to let \nemployers who choose to offer coverage, but we give the workers more \nchoices with respect to their health care and we give the employers \nmuch needed cost relief, which is especially essential at a time when \nthey are competing in tough global markets.\n  I want to mention all of my colleagues who are sponsoring this \nlegislation with me. Senator Bennett of Utah, a member of the \nRepublican leadership, is the principal cosponsor. Senator Bennett's \nknowledge of economics, in my view, has few equals and I could not have \na better partner for this whole effort. We have seven Democrats and \nseven Republicans who are on the effort. I am particularly pleased that \nso many from the Senate Finance Committee, where Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley have worked in a bipartisan tradition for years, are \npart of our effort. From the Senate Finance Committee we have Senator \nGrassley and Senator Crapo and Senator Stabenow cosponsoring the \nlegislation, all of them making a great contribution in this area.\n  As we go forward in the days ahead, Senator Stabenow's expertise and \ninterest, particularly in health information technology, is going to be \ninstrumental. For example, Dr. Orszag, the director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, who brings great professionalism to this \neffort to look at health care, this morning when he briefed eight of us \nin the Senate on the legislation, mentioned the fact that the evidence \nsuggests as much as 30 percent of the health care dollar is spent in a \nfashion that produces very little value. So what Senator Stabenow is \ntrying to do with health information technology, electronic medical \nrecords, and other innovative approaches is to wring more value out of \nevery health care dollar. Her contribution is so very important.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together on many health care \nissues. Of course, the partnership we have on the Finance Committee \nbetween Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley is a very rare and a very \nbeneficial alliance here in the Senate, and I so appreciate Senator \nGrassley's involvement.\n  Senator Crapo is my partner in the West who has a great interest and \nlong-standing involvement in rural health care, and we are very pleased \nthat he is an additional voice on the Senate Finance Committee for the \nlegislation.\n  I would also like to credit the other Senators who are involved. We \nare very pleased that Senator Landrieu, who is helping to reinvent \nhealth care in her State as a result of destruction caused by Hurricane \nKatrina and all of the challenges they face, has been particularly \ninterested in and creative in thinking about opening up new \nopportunities for entrepreneurship in her State and elsewhere. Senator \nLandrieu correctly points out that if you modernize the employer-\nemployee relationship in health care, that is going to mean we are \ngoing to have more entrepreneurs. It is going to be good for business. \nIt is going to be good for our economy. We are going to be able to grow \nour economic base in the country. Senator Landrieu argues very \neloquently, in my view, that if you provide some cost relief for the \nemployers who got into the business of driving health care by accident \nin the 1940s, you are going to be able to create jobs and strengthen \nour economy.\n  Senator Nelson, a former insurance commissioner, is one of our \ncosponsors. He has great expertise in insurance regulation. In fact, he \npointed out this morning some of the tools that are going to be \nnecessary to prevent price gouging in health insurance and is making a \ngreat contribution there.\n  Senator Lieberman has a long-standing interest in this and is a \ncosponsor. Of course, his involvement is particularly critical because \nhis State is a center of health insurance and technology and there are \na variety of major economic concerns involved.\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\n  We are very glad to have Senator Gregg, who is the ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee and a driving force on keeping down health costs \nto make health care more affordable and available to all. We're also \npleased to have the support of Senator Inouye, who as chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, has shown his leadership in health \ncare research for our soldiers and sailors with benefits for all \nAmericans. We also appreciate the support of Senator Corker, who has \nbeen a leading advocate for reforming the tax code to make health \ninsurance more available and affordable. And we're grateful for support \nfrom Senator Coleman, who has the world renowned Mayo Clinic in his \nstate and himself has been a leader in the area of health technology. \nAnd we are especially pleased to have the support of two former \ngovernors, Senator Carper and Senator Alexander. The Healthy Americans \nAct gives a major role to the states in reforming our health system and \nit's critical to have the support of Senators with the knowledge of \nstate government and executive leadership experience they have \nsupporting our legislation. It is a group unlike any other we have seen \nin the history of the Senate. Fourteen Senators--seven Democrats, seven \nRepublicans--actually cosponsoring together a piece of legislation that \nwill guarantee all Americans affordable, good quality coverage.\n  This legislation ensures that all of our people have choices such as \nwe have here in the Congress. We have choices among a number of very \ngood private sector packages. It ensures that coverage for the first \ntime will be portable. You can take your coverage from job to job to \njob, which is something that millions of Americans desperately want.\n  It is our future. The fact is that today, by the time you are 35 \nyears old, you are likely to change your job 7 times. Yet the system \nalmost locks you into your present position. You cannot move. You \ncannot go to another opportunity. I think to have a portable health \nsystem where you can take your coverage from job to job to job and not \nworry about losing your coverage if you want to take a promotion or \nstart your own business is particularly important.\n  The best part about it is that the Joint Committee on Taxation and \nthe Congressional Budget Office have said this can be done in a \nrevenue-neutral way.\n  We have had a number of Senators involved who have longstanding \ncredentials in terms of being tougher on budgets and concerned about \nfiscal discipline. Now, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the \nCongressional Budget Office have said that, contrary to popular wisdom \nthat universal coverage is going to break the bank and require tax \nhikes and new spending, it can be done in a budget-neutral kind of \nfashion.\n  Finally, I want to add since I think I really didn't do him justice \nearlier--Senator Inouye has been a wonderful addition to our group. He \nand his staff have had a great interest in looking at a number of \nhealth reform issues, particularly ones that make better use of our \nworkforce, focused on prevention and quality. We are thrilled to have \nhim as well.\n  Madam President, I note that one of our colleagues has come to the \nfloor. I will wrap up simply by saying that I think the entire Senate \nshould be very grateful for the outstanding work done by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office, led by Peter \nOrszag and Edward Kleinbard. Those two organizations have never \nissued--in the history of their organizations--an analysis like the one \nthey made available today. Never in the history of the organizations \nhas there been such an analysis.\n  I submit that if there had been an analysis like this done the last \ntime the Congress debated universal coverage back in 1993 and 1994, if \nthere had been a report like this one from the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Joint Committee on Taxation, they could have moved \nforward on a bipartisan basis to actually pass legislation, see it \nsigned into law, and end the disgrace that a country such as ours, \nwhich is good and strong and talented, hasn't been able to fix American \nhealth care.\n  This time, I think we are up to it. Senator Bennett and I have kept \napprised the leadership in the Senate on both sides of the aisle. It is \nour determination to work with colleagues of both political parties. We \nintend to work with the Presidential candidates. I have talked with \nSenators Clinton and Obama many times about the Healthy Americans Act. \nI talked to Senator Graham last night about the Congressional Budget \nOffice briefing. We know of his involvement with Senator McCain. If you \nare going to deal with a big, important issue, it has to be bipartisan.\n  Today, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation have made a significant contribution to our effort to move \nforward and actually enact universal health coverage that works for all \nAmericans. We are indebted to their organizations.\n  I am particularly grateful to colleagues who have joined as \ncosponsors in this effort. Senator Bennett and I will continue to work \nwith colleagues like Senator Baucus, Senator Kennedy and others over \nthe next 6 or 7 months so that this can be ready to go for the next \nPresident of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, what is the current state of the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering H.R. 2881.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig pertaining to the introduction of S. 2953 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the statement by the Senator \nfrom Idaho with regard to the need for drilling has been articulated by \na very respected columnist, Robert J. Samuelson, who recently wrote his \ncolumn, published in the Washington Post, that in essence said we ought \nto put oil rigs off the protected shores of Florida and in the \npreserved wilds of Alaska.\n  Once again, we are going to hear statements such as that of the \nSenator from Idaho and read statements in the written press by Mr. \nSamuelson as gas prices are hitting record highs. We are going to see \nthe renewed push by the Bush administration and by the oil industry to \ndrill in areas that are protected, such as the Gulf of Mexico off \nFlorida, as articulated by the Senator from Idaho, as well as the area \nknown as ANWR, which is in the preserved wilderness of Alaska. Drilling \nright away in environmentally protected areas was the centerpiece of \nMr. Samuelson's solution to the rising gas prices.\n  There is not one of us in this Chamber who does not want to do \nsomething about those gas prices. What Mr. Samuelson said in his column \nwas that to oppose drilling in those protected areas--as indicated also \nby the Senator who has just spoken--to oppose drilling in those \nprotected areas, he said, is sheer stupidity. And he said further it is \na ``prejudice against oil companies.''\n  That is the same thing the oil companies say every time there is a \nspike in prices. They have their long-term remedy that would expose \nthese wilderness areas, and Florida's beach and tourism-driven economy, \nour areas of an environmentally sensitive nature, as well as the \nmilitary interests I asked the Senator from Idaho to acknowledge, and \nthey would put all that at risk. It is these same oil companies that \nare now, because of the high price of gasoline, going to make another \nend run--very possibly next week--and try to bust the ban, the \nlongstanding ban on coastal drilling. Of course, they are going to cite \nwhat they do every time the oil prices spike high. They are going to \ncite the high gasoline prices.\n  I am basing my predictions of what is going to happen in the next \ncouple of weeks, I am basing this assertion on the oil industry's track \nrecord and on the comments made Tuesday by the President, renewing his \ncall for drilling. I am basing it on the suggestions we see in this \nnewspaper column.\n  In advance of this likely new assault, this Senator wants to make \nclear oil that is still deep in the ground has no direct link--none--to \ntoday's pump\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\nprices. Any oil in the ground will not be in the marketplace for \nanother 10 years. More important, no matter what anybody says or what \nanybody writes, the United States only has 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves while the United States consumes 25 percent of the world's oil \nproduction. In other words, it is, to use Samuelson's term, ``sheer \nstupidity'' to think the United States can somehow drill its way out of \nthe energy crisis.\n  We are a nation that is hooked on oil. Drilling along the Florida \nshore or in wildlife preserves will not break the habit. By the way, \none of the main reasons oil prices have gone up so sharply in recent \nyears is the volatility of major producer nations, such as Iraq and \nIran--not even to mention Venezuela and Nigeria. History reflects \nsimilar spikes, circa 1973, when we had an OPEC oil embargo related to \na war in the Middle East; then again in 1979 with the Iranian \nrevolution; again in 1990 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the first \ngulf war; and again, since 2003, with the war in Iraq, concomitant with \nincreasing Asian demand.\n  The common denominator in all these spikes is they are fueled by the \nsubsequent increase in oil speculation. The common denominator is \ntrouble in the Middle East and especially in Iraq and Iran. More \ndrilling along protected U.S. coasts, in bays and harbors and in the \npristine wilderness of Alaska, will not stabilize Iraq and it will not \nguarantee Saudi Arabia's long-term friendship. Nor will it end the \nunregulated speculation that has driven the price of oil to more than \n$118 a barrel when the price should have been no more than $55 a \nbarrel, based on present supply and demand, according to an industry \nleader's testimony before Congress. That means the law of supply and \ndemand has been broken and we are paying at least $63 per barrel over \nand above what supply and demand would produce--a price of $55. We are \npaying that extra $63 per barrel to enrich investment bankers, \nspeculators, and oil companies.\n  As Mr. Samuelson says in his column: ``What to do?''\n  The U.S. failed in the 1970s to enact a real energy program to get us \noff oil. The result is it is Brazil that runs on ethanol today--not the \nUnited States. Germany leads the world in solar power, not the United \nStates. In the meantime, oil companies are awash in record profits, \nmore than $155 billion in profits alone last year, at the same time not \nspending enough on refineries or alternative energy, while guess who is \ngetting it in the neck: the consumers at the pump.\n  Then, even worse, it took the United States more than 30 years to \nraise mileage standards on cars and trucks to a paltry 35 miles per \ngallon, something that will not even be in effect until the year 2020. \nAnd is it not interesting that most of Europe and the cars U.S.-based \nmanufacturers sell there already average 43 miles per gallon, and in \nJapan the cars are approaching 50-miles-a-gallon.\n  In other words, we are wasting, flat out wasting billions and \nbillions of gallons of oil. So, again, what are we to do? Well, about \nhalf of the oil we consume goes into transportation, and it should not \ntake a rocket scientist to realize that is where we ought to focus. So, \nfirst, if we start to enact serious conservation measures, and things \nsuch as a 40-miles-per-gallon mandate for the fleet average of our \npersonal vehicles, and if we provided greater tax breaks for hybrid \ncars, and ultimately hydrogen-powered and electric-powered cars, then \nwe are going to start making a difference.\n  Second, the Government, our Government, led by our next President, is \ngoing to have to enact and subsidize a national energy program to \ntransform us from our energy dependence on oil, especially foreign oil, \nto alternative and synthetic fuels to power much of the transportation \nsector.\n  Members of the Senate, it has been done before. Remember in the \n1960s, President Kennedy led us to conquer the bounds of Earth, to go \nto the Moon and return, and all of that occurred within a decade. So we \nhave got to act with the same urgency. And while we are at it, we are \ngoing to have to make ethanol, ethanol that we will make from things we \ndo not eat so we do not reduce our food supply.\n  While we are at that, we are also going to have to pay attention to \nhow we power not only our cars and our trucks, but our homes and our \nindustry. We are going to need to develop solar, wind, thermal energy, \nand hydroelectric. And who knows the advances of technology in \nharnessing renewable energy sources. We are going to have to look for \nelectricity that is from safer nuclear power.\n  Now, this is what our Presidential candidates ought to be hearing and \nultimately before this election they ought to be making a pledge to the \nAmerican people that they are going to do this. In the 10 years going \nforward that it would take to bring in new oil rigs fully to market, in \nthat 10 years, if we are good stewards of what we have, we will have \nconserved more oil than we ever get out of the ground, and we will be \nmostly free from foreign oil by enacting this energy plan.\n  Our future will not be realized by looking backward to the short-term \npolluting and dirty energy solutions of the last century, solutions \nthey still offer for the future, solutions by people who do not want to \nchange their ways, such as oil companies.\n  So should we start drilling right now in very environmentally \nsensitive areas? To use Mr. Samuelson's words in his column, ``That is \nsheer stupidity.''\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the provision \nrelated to the New York liberty zone that appears in the FAA \nreauthorization bill. A few of my friends on the other side of the \naisle have called this provision an earmark. They have called it a fund \nto create a train to Kennedy Airport, even though that is not even \nmentioned in the legislation.\n  I wish to fill in on the facts. First, after the devastating attacks \nof 9/11 which scarred my city and our country, Congress and the \nPresident generously agreed to provide $20 billion in assistance toward \nthe rebuilding of lower Manhattan. It was a promise the President made \nto me and Senator Clinton the day after the attacks. It is a promise \nthat, to his everlasting credit, the President has kept and has never \nwavered from. The President understood, I think all of my colleagues \nunderstand, what happened in New York. But we still live with the \nscars. That downtown has not recovered. There are fewer square feet of \noffice space today than there were then in downtown. And the families \nwho lost loved ones still grieve every day, as does just about every \nNew Yorker.\n  There has always been talk about wearing flags. I put this flag on my \nlapel on 9/12/2001. I have worn it every day since and, God willing, I \nwill wear it every day for the remainder of my life in remembrance of \nwhat has happened.\n  Now, of the $20 billion, the money was divided for various purposes. \nSome, of course, was to help the families who have lost loved ones. \nSome was for the cleaning up of the World Trade Center site. It was a \nmassive undertaking--to visit the rubble a day later, to smell death \nand the burnt flesh in the air, and then to realize that people, not \nonly from New York but from around the whole country came to help us \nhelp heal those wounds.\n\n  Some of the money was put aside specifically so that downtown would \nrecover; incentives to bring business back and money for \ntransportation, because the entire subway nexus had been destroyed. At \nthat point in time, people worried that people would desert downtown \nand never come back.\n  New Yorkers, through efforts and valiance, have struggled, and so \nthat is how the $20 billion came about. Was any part of the $20 billion \nan earmark? Is there any reason to equate it with a bridge to nowhere? \nPlease. Please, my colleagues, I do appreciate that my friend from New \nHampshire--I do consider him my friend--has retracted that specific \nstatement. But to call the $20 billion, or a significant part of it, an \nearmark is unfair labeling, to be kind. Or the tax preferences for the \ngulf opportunity zone after Katrina,\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\nwere they earmarks? They were a benefit, a large benefit, designated \nfor a specific region. When we help a disaster area, is that an \nearmark? No. And all the hallmarks of earmarks done for only one \nmember, slipped in in secrecy, none of that applies here.\n  In fact, this exact proposal is in the President's budget this year \nin the light of day for all to study because the President himself, as \nI said, has kept his word. Has it been done secretly? Obviously, no. \nThis provision has been around for a while.\n  As I will show in a few minutes, many of my colleagues who oppose it \nnow have voted for it in other legislation. Why has New York had to \nwait so long for this provision? It is because it has passed the House \na couple of times, it has passed the Senate once, but the bills that \npassed never hooked up and never made it to the President's desk.\n  Are we going to tell those who argue that this is an earmark that any \naid to any region, no matter how publicly talked about, no matter how \ndesperate the need, is an earmark? With all due respect to my \ncolleagues, it is not fair. It is not right. It is not up to the level \nof this body or this discourse. It is using a word that has a bad \nconnotation and inappropriately labeling something that has been part \nof America's nobleness since 9/11.\n  Let me give you a little bit of history here. After the $20 billion \nin aid was passed, some of the provisions were not fully realized, \nothers were, and exceeded the amounts of money. So the New York \ndelegation had talked with the President and with OMB leaders about how \nto make sure those dollars were most wisely spent, and in some places, \nthe amounts of money changed.\n  A consensus emerged as we went through this that the best way to \nsupport private enterprise, or one of the best ways to support private \nenterprise and rebuild lower Manhattan, was to improve transportation \nin and around the liberty zone.\n  As a result, the city and State proposed supporting improvements in \ntransportation infrastructure in or connected with the liberty zone. If \nyou look at the Treasury blue book, my colleagues, it is on pages 47 to \n49. This is not something that was slipped in by any Member of the \nSenate, not by me or anyone else. It was the President who proposed it \nin this budget, as he has proposed it in previous budgets.\n  It is not something that was slipped into the bill in the middle of \nthe night. And to equate it with wasteful porkbarrel projects is an in \ninsult to the families of those who survive, to every New Yorker, and I \nbelieve to every American.\n  When New York was struck, we all rallied together. We have sort of \nkept that tone since, when it comes to helping areas that need help. So \nthis is not about funding porkbarrel projects. This is about keeping \nour promises and our faith.\n  Second, my colleague insists that this is a train to Kennedy Airport. \nI refer him to the language in the FAA bill. There is no reference to a \ntrain to Kennedy Airport. There is no reference to an air rail. As I \nsaid, it sounded good, but I appreciate the fact that the Senator from \nNew Hampshire has pulled back from calling it a train to nowhere. I \npersonally called him 2 days ago and read the language of the bill to \nhim. It does not mention a rail project. There has been talk in \nManhattan, among the mayor and Governor and the city leaders who would \nbe in charge of spending this money, that that is a possibility. But \nthere are many other possibilities as well.\n  The one thing the legislation states is about improving and \nrebuilding transportation in the liberty zone. That is all. There is no \nspecific project mentioned in the language. There is no particular \nproject or projects I am supporting. To say otherwise is untrue. It \nwould be totally within the law to use this for some subway \nimprovements or other types of spending. That will be what the city \nwill decide, in consultation with the Governor and the appropriate \nlegislative bodies.\n  As for the mechanism of funding which allows the city and State to \nkeep part of the Federal income taxes withheld from city and State \nworkers, we have tried various ways of designing this aid, and this is \nwhat the administration came up with, with our agreement and consent. \nIf any of my colleagues would like to suggest another way for \nfulfilling the promise they would support, I am happy to listen. But I \nremind them that this is a solution supported by the administration. In \nfact, the Bush administration has supported the $2 billion trade-in for \nthe liberty zone in four consecutive budget proposals. The details of \nhow to do it, again, of how to spend the money, will be left up to the \ncity and State. This is not new money, I remind my colleagues. It is \nthe last part of a solemn promise made by President Bush and supported \nby this Congress in 2001.\n  The current version of the language passed the full House in the most \nrecent energy bill. It was part of a Senate energy bill that received \n59 votes last year and 58 votes earlier this year. It was also part of \nthe FAA reform package that passed out of committee by broad bipartisan \nvote. This is not something that was snuck into the bill as it reached \nthe floor of the House. It was passed and debated in the Finance \nCommittee. In fact, two of my colleagues who have raised questions \nabout this--my friends from New Hampshire and South Carolina have both \nvoted for legislation in favor of enacting the liberty zone provision, \nwhen it has been previously considered as part of other legislation.\n  So now to object to this, to the whole FAA bill because it has this \nprovision in it, is a change of view. There was no objection to other \nlegislation that had it on that basis.\n  The junior Senator from South Carolina voted yes on final passage of \ntwo bills in the 109th Congress--S. 2020, and H.R. 4297--that both \ncontained the liberty zone provision. Unfortunately, the provision was \nnot in the final versions of these bills, and the remaining funds for \nGround Zero were not allocated. By advocating against this current \nposition, it is clearly a change. There was no specific vote on this \nrail link, but there were votes on larger packages that contained it, \njust as this FAA package is a larger package that contains it. The \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire has voted in favor of the liberty \nzone tax provisions at least three times: First, in favor of the \noriginal bill, H.R. 3090; again, in favor of two separate bills--S. \n2020 and H.R. 4297--to complete the funding in the 109th Congress.\n  So it is hard to understand, since this is not an earmark. This is \nnot a specific project. This is supported by the President. It fulfills \na promise that, frankly, this Nation made to New York, the last part of \nit. It is hard to understand why the views have changed. We have been \nworking 4 years to finally complete this promise. Each time objections \nare raised. If someone doesn't like it on this bill, then make a \ncommitment on what bill we can finally get it done because I am going \nto try to get this on any piece of legislation that moves in the Senate \nuntil the promise to the people of my city and, frankly, the people of \nAmerica is finally fulfilled.\n  I say this to the 98 other Senators not from New York: If 9/11 had \nhappened in your State, you would be down here on the floor of the \nSenate making the same fight we are making. You would not allow \nanything to get in the way of a promise that had been made to a city or \nState, particularly when the arguments made don't really apply--not an \nearmark, not a train to nowhere, and not something that was done in the \ndark of night.\n  I want to note again that the Bush administration has been \nsupportive. I have many disagreements with the White House on a host of \nissues, but they have been helpful and true to their word on this \nissue. President Bush himself has. I have thanked him for it \nrepeatedly. The President believes it is important to keep his promise. \nThis body should feel the same way. That is why he put his proposal in \nfour consecutive budgets. That is why when the administration issued \nits statement of administrative policy on this bill, they did not note \nany objection to this provision.\n  I know there can be objections. That is part of what we do around \nhere. But I haven't seen a good argument against this other than you \ndon't believe New York City should get the money that was promised to \nit. This is about keeping a promise. I am going to make sure, to the \nbest of my ability in this body, that this promise is kept. My \nconstituents demand it. Fairness demands it. If this were about your \nState, you would demand it too.\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment that \nI hope to offer on the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. It is an important amendment, and I want to discuss it \nso that my colleagues understand what this amendment is about.\n  This is a picture of an airplane that was provided to my office by a \nU.S. safety inspector. A pilot for a Chinese carrier requested \npermission and landed in Frankfurt, Germany, for an unscheduled \nrefueling stop. They were running low on fuel. This is what the U.S. \nsafety inspector provided us. This is what German workers found--\nseatbelts wrapped around fan blades.\n  There is a seatbelt. There is a seatbelt, as you can see, and the \nstructure behind. They did this to minimize turbulence because there \nhad been an engine that had failed. The inspection found that a total \nof three engines had to be replaced before the plane was going to be \nallowed to take off again.\n  What does this have to do with the amendment? In the latest audit, \nthe Department of Transportation inspector general found that 67 \npercent of the heavy maintenance--not talking about kicking the tires \nor changing the oil--of U.S. commercial aircraft is now being performed \nby foreign repair stations. In a series of reports, the inspector \ngeneral has identified many gaps in FAA oversight for these foreign \nrepair stations.\n  What this amendment does is seek to apply the same standards of \nsafety and security to all of these foreign repair stations that U.S. \ncarriers are using. That is a pretty reasonable proposition. If you \nhave a commercial carrier that is serviced in the United States at an \nFAA certified facility, it is likely an FAA inspector is onsite, a \nconstant presence. There are requirements of drug and alcohol checks. \nThere is perimeter security. There are standards that must be met in \nterms of these repair stations. How does it make sense that we don't \ndemand those same standards for American carriers that are using \nforeign repair stations? Most Americans would be surprised to find out \nthat we don't. That is what this amendment is going to fix.\n  I thank Senator Specter for cosponsoring this amendment. I want to \nspend a little bit of time talking about what the amendment contains, \nbut I want to make sure that not only is the problem just whether the \nwork being done is not up to the standards we would expect in some of \nthese foreign repair stations, I want to talk about security issues.\n  My mom is going to be 80 this summer. She has had two knee \nreplacements. She can't go through an airport without being wanded, \nmany times her suitcase being opened. We all know that we have to check \nour shampoo. We have to not carry water bottles through security \nanymore. I think the American flying public understands and has \naccepted these incredibly intrusive measures because they want safety. \nThey want security. They want to make sure that when they fly, they are \nsafe. So they have said: OK, I am going to take a bunch of time at the \nairport. I will stand in lines. I will have a wand. I will have people \npatting my body. I am going to do all this because I want safety and \nsecurity.\n  In 2003, an inspector general report found that there was an al-Qaida \nmember working at a foreign repair station in Singapore. The report \ndiscovered easy access to facilities by outsiders and found the FAA was \nleaving employee background checks and drug and alcohol testing up to \nindividual airlines.\n\n       We note that in December 2001 a senior aircraft technician \n     at a foreign repair station was found to be a member of the \n     terrorist organization Al Qaeda. . . .The aircraft technician \n     photographed U.S. aircraft as potential targets for a \n     terrorist attack.\n\n  Really, is it fair that we all are worrying about whether we have 1 \nounce too much of shampoo when we have not taken the basic steps to \nmake sure al-Qaida is not under the hood? I think most Americans would \nbe shocked to see this inconsistency in our sense of urgency and \ncaution when it comes to the safety of the flying public.\n  What does this amendment do? It is pretty simple. First, it requires \nidentification and oversight of foreign repair facilities that are \nnoncertified. The FAA must submit a plan to Congress within 6 months of \nenactment to identify and expand its oversight of all noncertified \nfacilities used by U.S. air carriers. Keep in mind, these U.S. air \ncarriers are not just outsourcing the labor to foreign repair stations \nthat are FAA certified in foreign nations. They are also outsourcing \nthe work to noncertified FAA facilities.\n  I keep asking the FAA in hearings: Why do we have certification? I \nwill say: Do you think certification is important?\n  The FAA officials will say: Yes, we think it is important.\n  I say: Then why do we have it, if we don't require everybody to have \nit? What is the point? Why are we letting carriers use noncertified \nfacilities if the certification is important to our safety and \nsecurity? It doesn't make sense.\n  This amendment would, in fact, require that those carriers use \ncertified facilities if they are, in fact, going to use foreign repair \nstations. It will require the FAA to do two inspections a year. I do \nnot think that is a heavy lift: two inspections a year of their \nfacilities, wherever they may be.\n  It will require drug and alcohol testing of employees performing \nmaintenance at foreign repair stations. It has been interesting to me \nbecause we have had some push-backs from some places about this because \nof some countries that want us not to require this because they \ncurrently have work of U.S. carriers and they do not want America to \nrequire FAA oversight to this degree. One of the things they protest \nmost--some of these nations--is the drug and alcohol testing. Well, \nwith all due respect, I really do not think Americans are excited about \nthe idea that we would waive drug and alcohol testing for people who \nare working on airplanes. I think that is a basic. It certainly would \nbe a basic in this country. I think it is certainly something the \nAmerican people would expect.\n  It will also enforce the TSA requirements that foreign repair \nstations comply with security standards issued by the Transportation \nSecurity Administration.\n  It will update foreign repair station fee schedules to ensure \ntaxpayers are not subsidizing the outsourcing of this work.\n  Here is the part that gets me a little bit cranky about this whole \nsituation. It is one thing for companies to want to outsource labor to \nother countries because it is cheaper. Now, other than the need to fix \nour Tax Code, we do not encourage the outsourcing of jobs. It is not as \nif we can require corporations in our country to keep all their jobs in \nthe United States. That is a tough thing for us to do in an open \ndemocracy, in a free market economy. I will tell you what we can do, \nthough. We can sure make absolutely certain these companies are not \ndoing it with the help of taxpayer dollars.\n  Right now, as to the certified repair facilities that are in foreign \ncountries, the U.S. taxpayers are underwriting the bill for those \ninspections and that certification. In other words, the companies can \noutsource the labor to a country where it is less expensive, and \ntaxpayers are footing part of the bill for the safety and security of \nthose facilities.\n  Now, if you are going to go for a less expensive labor cost, it seems \nto me that you, at a minimum, ought to add to that savings the cost of \nthe inspections by the U.S. Government. Why should the taxpayers foot \nthe bill for FAA inspectors to fly over to Singapore to inspect a \nfacility? That does not seem fair. So this makes sure the people who \nare using the foreign repair stations are absorbing the costs of \ninspecting and keeping those foreign repair stations up to our \nstandards. Obviously, it requires the regular inspector general \noversight of the implementation of this provision.\n  This is very reasonable. The House has similar language in its bill. \nI think this makes sense. I think it is something, frankly, the \nAmerican public would be surprised to understand, that we have this \nhuge gap in our safety and security oversight for the flying public.\n  I look forward to an opportunity for the Members to have a vote on \nthis amendment. I think we all want trade. We all want to make sure we \ncan export American products. We do not want trade agreements that put \nus at a\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\ndisadvantage or, frankly, we want to make sure we still have access to \nother markets. But we cannot outsource safety. We just cannot. This \nadministration is willing to do that. This administration is willing to \nsay: We are going to let these other countries worry about whether \ntheir facilities are safe. I do not think this is one area where the \nAmerican people want this function of our Government outsourced. I \nthink they want us to be on top of it. I think they want to make sure \nit is being done right. I think they want to make sure it is being done \nfairly. I think they want to make sure they are not paying the bill to \noutsource this work.\n  At the end of the day, I think they have been cheerful, as Americans \nalways are about what is asked of them, but I do not blame them for \nbeing a little worried that there has not been more sense of urgency \nabout the safety and security of this situation in light of all of the \nmoney we have spent in the name of national security and, importantly, \nhomeland security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \ntoday to discuss what is a catastrophe all across our Nation--and it \ncertainly is in West Virginia--because of the price of gasoline and \nother transportation fuels.\n  My State is not wealthy. I think it is either the third or fourth \npoorest State in our country, and I do not say that with shame, I say \nthat with pride because it was, in a sense, one of the reasons I was a \nVISTA volunteer. I went there as a VISTA volunteer because I saw a \nplace where I could at least try to help. The people are the best ever. \nWhen people have to struggle to make it, day-in and day-out, they are \npretty solid people.\n  As I am sure it is the case for all of my colleagues, for the past \nfew weeks and months I have been hearing from my constituents \nconstantly about rising gasoline prices and the resulting rise in the \nprices for goods and services throughout our economy.\n  West Virginians are hurting. West Virginians will always find a way \nto persevere--always--but right now many are struggling to juggle \nexpenses, making enormous sacrifices to feed and clothe their families, \nwhile trying to pay the cost of going to work. We have plants in West \nVirginia which people drive hours and hours every day to get to. Work \nis not easily found, so where it is, people have to drive. We are 96 \npercent mountains, 4 percent flat. We have a lot of roads. People \npretty much have canceled the occasional splurge for a movie. We have a \nbaseball team in West Virginia. That has pretty much been pushed off. \nIn other words, if it is a nonemergency purchase, they bypass it. It \ntakes away from their happiness, their stability as a family, but they \nhave no choice. Belts have been tightened just about as far as belts \ncan be tightened.\n\n  Yet, this week, we hear that oil company profits are again nearing or \nexceeding record highs and that these companies have no plan and these \ncompanies have no desire to increase domestic refining capacity--one of \nthe very few things we know would actually help bring down prices.\n  The Energy Information Administration and private sector energy \nexperts tell us to expect gasoline and diesel fuel prices to continue \nto rise for the foreseeable future. I do not know what that means. I do \nnot think West Virginians care very much what that means. It just means \na long time. And a week, a month, is a long time. This is well beyond \nthe usual cyclical annual price fluctuation. And the so-called summer \ndriving season is not even here yet. But other than a brief dip in \nJanuary, the price West Virginians have been paying at the pump has \nbeen climbing steadily since before Christmas--not as noticeable at \nfirst, now catastrophic.\n  The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in West Virginia \nhas risen from just over $2.70 a gallon in August 2007 to a price on \nthe last day of April 2008 of $3.71. I do not have new wage data for \nworkers in my State. I wish I did. But I am willing to stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and assert that nobody's salary has risen to match \nthat 37-percent increase.\n  The idea of $4-a-gallon gasoline--which 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago would \nhave sounded crazy--really now is a matter not so much of ``if,'' but \n``when.'' The timeframe I just mentioned is relevant, of course, \nbecause we are a country that has been at war in Iraq for more than 5 \nyears--spending money, letting people do corruption at all levels. I am \nalways suspicious of oil companies. When our brave American forces set \nout to impose regime change on that country based upon the false--or at \nleast unforgivably imprecise; I prefer the word ``false''--\nintelligence, West Virginians were paying, on average, $1.63 for \nregular gasoline. That was not that long ago. It had been as low as \n$1.26 in the months leading up to the invasion.\n  It should come as no surprise to anyone within the sound of my voice, \nbut in that time oil industry profits have risen steadily: almost $60 \nbillion in profits in 2003, just over $80 billion in profits in 2004, \napproximately $110 billion in profits in 2005, just under $120 billion \nin 2006, and just over $120 billion so far in 2007. ExxonMobil, Shell, \nand ChevronTexaco have each had increasingly larger profits each of the \nlast 5 years. BP and ConocoPhillips have done nearly as well. In all, \nthe five largest integrated multinational oil companies have reaped \nalmost $560 billion in profits since President Bush and Vice President \nCheney came into town. I don't particularly want to do it that way, \nbecause I blame the companies more than I blame them, but there is lots \nof blame to go around.\n\n  Anyone who looks at the numbers can make this about politics, of \ncourse. It is easy to do. But this is, in essence, for me, a former \nVista volunteer in my 44th year in West Virginia, all about people. It \nis simply all about people and families who have been struggling \nanyway. The average salary for the average working family of four in \nWest Virginia is $31,000. That is not a lot of money, before you get to \nall of this, and then it is even less.\n  Today, if you are lucky enough to live or work near Sam's Club in \nVienna, WV, which is on the Ohio River, and you can afford to become a \nmember there, you can get a gallon of gasoline for $3.49. It is hard \nfor anyone I know in West Virginia to think of that as cheap, but it is \nthe lowest price reported in the entire State. Frankly, based on the \ndata I have seen, it is so much lower than the rest of the State that \nyou almost have to consider it an anomaly.\n  If you are running low in Spencer, WV, a rural community, however, \nyou need to be prepared to pay $3.82 at the Exxon station on Main \nStreet. It is $3.79 in South Charleston. Residents of Huntington are \npaying $3.75. In Berkeley Springs, not far from Washington, it is \n$3.69. No West Virginia county--none--is reporting an average price per \ngallon of regular gasoline that is below $3.61. Only three of my \nStates' 55 counties are reporting average gasoline prices lower than \n$3.67.\n  Individual price quotes at individual stations are ominous enough, \nbut the real stark numbers, the real telling calculation, is how much \nmore West Virginians are paying for gasoline than they were in years \npast, and that is not even getting into the meteoric rises in food \nprices and the other costs essential to daily living. Even those in \nWest Virginia who travel by air, which is the subject of the bill we \nare meant to be on, those prices have gone up.\n  Since 2001, West Virginia households are paying almost $2,500 per \nyear more for gasoline. If it is a household with children, that makes \nit $3,000. I take my colleagues back to the average salary for the \naverage family of four, working family of four in West Virginia: \n$31,000. When you add on health care, food, rent, and all the rest, \neverything else, it is an enormous matter. If it is a household with \nteenagers, it is just below $3,600 more. Families, businesses, and \nfarmers in West Virginia will spend $153 million more on gasoline in \nApril 2008 than they spent in January 2001.\n  If prices remain at current levels, $1.83 billion more will be spent \non gasoline in West Virginia this year than\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\nwas spent in 2001. West Virginia consumers, farmers, and businesses are \non a track to pay $2.96 billion for gasoline this year.\n  So West Virginians are asking two questions: How did we get here; but \nto them, much more importantly, what can be done to fix this.\n  Nobody in Government, academia, or the private industry can give us a \nsingle definitive equation for what makes the price of oil go up and \ndown. We don't know why, but we can't. Generally, increased demand from \nChina, India, and much of the developing world has set the stage \nobviously for prices that we have to take into consideration.\n  Much of our oil comes from an unregulated and unresponsive cartel \ncalled OPEC. We also know that since the tragic terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, the world price for petroleum has been affected by \na global struggle against stateless thugs.\n  The instability brought about by the invasion in Iraq has done \nnothing but raise the pump price. I don't know a single benefit to our \nNation that has been accomplished there. But smaller factors have also \nhad huge consequences. Instability in Nigeria and the outrageous \nbehavior in Venezuela have contributed in similarly negative ways. The \nrecent strike by refinery and pipeline workers in Scotland, unbeknownst \nto many of our citizens, will not help. Likewise for the very serious \nrefinery explosion in Utah this week.\n  Economists cannot pinpoint how much speculation in the commodities \nmarket is adding to the price of oil, but a congressional study in 2005 \nsuggested it was in the $20 to $25 per barrel range. A more recent \nstudy announced by Public Citizen said it is now closer to $30 a \nbarrel. It doesn't matter. Every cent of that is being seen at the gas \npumps in West Virginia and around the country, and it hurts, and trying \nto give a worldwide economic explanation for it doesn't solve anybody's \nproblems or anybody's pain.\n  We know, too, that the price is manipulated up and down the supply \nchain. Nobody will ever convince me that there is not a large amount of \ncorruption and manipulation, deliberate, cozy and easy, that goes on \naround boardrooms in oil companies. From the huge oil companies that \nfind the oil, through more markets and middlemen than we can keep up \nwith, every player has the ability to force the price up for their own \nbottom line. There is manipulation beyond the reach of my people in \nWest Virginia or the Presiding Officer's people in the State of \nColorado. We are at their mercy. We pay the price, we are at the \nmercy--at the mercy of oil. Federal investigators cannot usually \npinpoint collusion, but those acting independently to manipulate prices \ncost the people of West Virginia all the same. There are a lot of \nthings Federal regulators never manage to find.\n  In the long term, the things we need to do sound basic--and this is \nthe final part of my remarks and the important part, other than the \noverriding theme of anger--such as increasing supply and \nreducing consumption, but achieving these goals has proved to be very \ndifficult.\n\n  I have long supported efforts to improve automobile fuel efficiency, \nand so have most other people--not all. We made a small and long \noverdue change last year, and I believe we will do more. I think CAFE \nstandards are going to go up and up, as they should; cars will get \nsmaller and smaller, as they should. That will not be good for my legs, \nbut it will be good for my people. But even when Detroit catches up \nwith the rest of the world's automakers on fuel efficiency--I repeat, \ncatches up--we do need to add to our supply now.\n  That is why in 2006, I supported Senator Domenici's legislation to \nincrease oil and gas exploration in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. When \nthese new fields are fully on line, they will add 1.26 billion barrels \nof oil to our domestic supply. Now, I say that, but I also have to say \nin all honesty that I voted against virtually every other attempt to do \ndrilling offshore and in ANWR, for example. ANWR to me has always been \na shibboleth. People say: Well, we can get lots of supply there, just \nas many people or more say it is technically feasible or maybe it is \neconomically feasible, but it is not both. In the meantime, the tundra \ncontinues to melt.\n  That is why I have also consistently supported holding off on \nadditional deposits in our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is more than \n97 percent full as it is, and there is no economic rationale for \nfilling it to the brim with $120 per barrel of oil. That product should \nbe making its way into the market some place.\n  I joined my colleagues earlier this year to ask the President to \nsuspend deliveries into the petroleum reserve until the price of oil \ndrops below $75 a barrel. Since the President persists in refusing to \nstop taking oil off the market, I will support legislation to force him \nto do it.\n  I also support, as I have in the past on several occasions, the \nimposition of a windfall profits tax on integrated multinational oil \ncompanies. People say this won't have any effect. I would like to try \nthat out to show that they are wrong and to send a message. The oil \ncompanies are making so much money maybe they won't even notice it. But \nI doubt that, because there are now 300 million Americans who are very \nangry about what very few of them are doing. As I have said, these \ncompanies are making huge, perhaps unconscionable--not perhaps--totally \nunconscionable profits off the hard-working people in my State and off \nthe wages of struggling Americans everywhere. If they refuse to \nreinvest in additional refining capacity, which has been their habit, \nthe least we can do is use some of those profits to shore up the \nhighway trust fund for the road infrastructure and transportation \nprojects that we need for the 21st century, and perhaps even for \nsomething called aviation. Those projects would create jobs.\n  I will also reintroduce legislation this week that I first introduced \nin 2001. It is called the Low Income Gasoline Assistance Program, or \nLIGAP. This will provide some relief to Americans hardest hit by any \nrise in prices; to wit, the working poor, which describes a lot of my \nState. For many West Virginia seniors who have no means of getting to \nwork, the grocery store, or to a doctor's appointment other than their \ncars or trucks, if they have them, LIGAP assistance for gasoline \npurchases will enable them to weather this crisis with a little more \npeace of mind. I say ``if they have them'' because many people in \ncommunities I have worked in throughout West Virginia don't have \nautomobiles, so when they have to go somewhere, usually a pretty long \ndistance, they have to hitch a ride. Even though our people are \ninnately good and generous, because they depend on others as others \ndepend on them, they will usually charge a fee for that ride. In any \nevent, whether they can even take that ride will depend on whether they \ncan afford the gasoline price to get there.\n  So LIGAP eligibility would be linked to and modeled after LIHEAP, the \nvery successful and efficient home heating and cooling assistance \nprogram. Funds would be distributed to States as additions to \nallocations under the existing community development block grant \nprogram.\n  It makes sense. For everyone who qualifies, LIGAP would give stipends \nof between $100 and $165 a month. Hopefully, this may mean not having \nto scrimp on their children's food or cut back on prescription drugs \nand other family needs.\n  Families are the basis of our country. People are the basis of \neverything we do. It is just that there are some sectors of our economy \nthat choose to avoid that because they don't have to depend upon those \npeople because those people have no choice but to buy their products.\n  It is time for Congress and the administration to come together and \nstop bickering--it would be a majestic accomplishment--and stop \nfighting over turf, as we are doing on the aviation bill. While we \nengage in parliamentary tactics that most Americans don't give a hoot \nabout--in fact, they hate us for doing it--West Virginians and citizens \nin every State are suffering, while oil companies are laughing all the \nway to their many banks. This must stop. I ask my colleagues to work \nwith me to make this stop.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we import more than 12.5 million barrels \na day of petroleum--over 60 percent of\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nour petroleum energy needs. As a matter of fact, I think it is higher \nthan that now, in the last 2 or 3 days. This is why our economy and the \nvalue of the dollar has weakened and our energy costs have skyrocketed. \nWith oil at $117 a barrel--and it is more than that today--the United \nStates spends nearly $1.5 billion each day on foreign oil. That is $533 \nbillion each year that was not invested in our own economy.\n  Instead, that money is being sent--along with jobs--to other \ncountries, such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Venezuela. For every \nmillion barrels of oil we import, 20,000 American jobs are lost.\n  Our country needs a real economic stimulus now. That stimulus will \ncome when we stop spending hundreds of billions of dollars each year to \nimport oil and, instead, invest that money in our own economy by \nincreasing domestic production of our energy resources.\n  The area known as ANWR is a million and a half acres that was \nreserved for oil and gas development on the Arctic slope in 1980; it is \nthe largest untapped oilfield in North America. We believe that is the \nlargest trap for oil in North America. Oil companies estimate they will \nspend between $45 billion and $60 billion to develop this area. \nCombined with the construction of the Alaska natural gas pipeline, \nwhich is expected to start soon, it will cost about $40 billion. These \nresources would deliver a massive influx of jobs and capital investment \nin the United States. Our economy would be stabilized, and the dollar \nwould be strengthened.\n  ANWR and the Alaska gas pipeline are only the beginning. This \ninfrastructure would help lead to further development of Alaska's Outer \nContinental Shelf. We have more than two thirds of that Outer \nContinental Shelf. It has been expanded another 100 miles north of \nAlaska, as we discovered a further extension of the shelf. The Chukchi \nSea holds an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil, and there is an \nestimated 7 billion barrels in the Beaufort Sea off our State. Bringing \nthese resources on line would add even more jobs and capital to our \neconomy.\n  Full development of ANWR would result in at least 60,000 jobs. \nOpening ANWR alone would require the construction of a fleet of 19 new \ntankers to transport the oil to the Lower 48. Those would be American-\nbuilt tankers. Under the law, they must be--under the Jones Act. This \nalone would create at least 2,000 direct jobs in the U.S. shipbuilding \nindustry and approximately 3,000 additional jobs in other sectors of \nour economy. The energy industry estimates the Alaska gas pipeline \nalone will create 400,000 new jobs nationwide.\n  Senator Schumer made an interesting statement the other day. He \nsuggested that opening ANWR would reduce gas prices by only pennies. He \ntook a shot at the President, saying he takes out the old saw of ANWR, \nthat ANWR would not produce a drop of oil in 10 years, and it is \nestimated that if we drilled in ANWR, in 20 years, it would reduce the \nprice one penny.\n  I am afraid that shows how little the Senator from New York \nunderstands the oil industry. He ignores the long-term economic \nstimulus domestic production will bring through investment in our own \ncountry--raising household incomes and individual buying power, rather \nthan sending money overseas. Senator Schumer would ask other nations, \nsuch as Saudi Arabia, to increase their production as a solution to our \nenergy crisis.\n  I agree that increased production would help solve our problem but \nthat production should occur in our own country. I think the Senator \nshould realize what is happening in terms of the oil industry, and the \nkey driver now to the cost of gasoline is not the supply and demand, it \nis the value of the dollar and the value of oil per se. The value of \noil now is represented by paper on the New York Stock Exchange, which \nhas replaced gold. People are speculating in oil. That is also what is \ncausing the price of gasoline to go up at the pump. Senator Schumer \nshould visit NYMEX and ask them to do something about that and stop the \nspeculation in oil. I think it should be unlawful to speculate in \nanything related to energy in this country. I think soon we will do \nthat.\n\n  This production has to come from our own country. The position of the \nSenator from New York would send more money in tax and royalty revenues \noutside our economy. I don't know how that will strengthen our dollar \nor lower prices at the pump at all. It is not a question of supply and \ndemand, it is a question of a long-term commitment to restore our \ncapability to produce oil and gas in this country.\n  Had President Clinton not vetoed the ANWR bill before, we would be \nproducing at least 2 million barrels a day more out of Alaska right \nnow. I don't like to be chided by the Senator from New York about why \nwe don't have more production in this country. He is suggesting we ask \nthe foreign producers to produce more oil and send it to us. That will \nsend more money out of the country and take more of our jobs. I don't \nunderstand that.\n  In 1995, when we approved the amendment allowing development of the \nArctic Plain, President Clinton vetoed that legislation, and we are \npaying for the consequences of that today. Had he not vetoed the \nlegislation, the Trans Alaska Pipeline--which currently operates at \nless than 50 percent of capacity--as a matter of fact, it is even worse \nthan that, about 38 percent of capacity. We are sending out about \n700,000 barrels a day instead of 2.5 million barrels a day. We could \neasily have that pipeline--we call it a barrel--full and offset imports \nand keep our trade deficit down and keep jobs and money in our economy. \nIn the long run--not short run--increased production does affect the \nprice at the pump. We would continue to increase domestic production of \noil and that, in effect, would give us competition against the price \nset by foreign producers, and we would be able to reduce the price at \nthe pump in the long run.\n  Between the Outer Continental Shelf, ANWR, the National Petroleum \nReserve in Alaska--which is now ready to be leased--and the resources \nremaining in Prudhoe Bay, we believe we would have at least 45 billion \nbarrels of oil left to produce. That is an estimate. When they \nestimated how much oil was in Prudhoe Bay, they estimated 1 billion \nbarrels. We produced 18 billion. I remind the Senate of that. So we \nhave produced more than that, and it is still producing. At full \ncapacity, we ought to be able to deliver at least 2.5 million barrels \nto the daily market. We have oil from outside the Arctic, by the way. \nWe can reduce the impact of sending more and more money out of the \ncountry and affect the American economy as we spend that money here at \nhome. That money would generate tax and royalty revenues, fund research \ninto alternative energy sources, create jobs, help strengthen the \ndollar, and lower our energy prices in the long run.\n  The weak dollar is what is causing speculation in oil futures and \nincreasing the price of oil and gas at the pump. We need investment in \nour own country, which develops our own resources, instead of relying \non those from other countries. By increasing domestic production, we \nwould meet our own Nation's needs, strengthen the economy, and begin \ncreating jobs and generating revenue, which would be reinvested back \ninto our economy. That is the way to a strong economy, a stable dollar, \nlower energy prices, and to reduce the demand on foreign oil and the \ncost of gasoline at the pump. We have to stop sending our money abroad \nand sending jobs abroad to pay for energy resources, when we can use \nthe money at home to develop the vast resources we have.\n  Alaska is the storehouse of energy for the future. It should not be \ncast aside as it has been. I hope we will find a way to vote on ANWR \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the pending business \nis on the FAA reauthorization bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I hope no one is out of breath this week \nas a result of working on this bill. We had\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\none vote on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and have not voted since. With \nlegislation this important to this country, why are we not able to move \nahead and cast votes and finish this legislation?\n  This is about FAA reauthorization which includes the issue of \nmodernization of our air traffic control system, which is very \nimportant. We read in the newspapers these days about the additional \ninspections that are required of airlines. We read about airlines going \nbankrupt because of fuel costs. We read that the FAA system for air \ntraffic control is archaic. We are told that the GPS system in your car \nis more sophisticated than the system by which we move airplanes around \nthis country in the air traffic control system. We hear the problems \nwith the air traffic controllers, the contract problems they have had \nwith the FAA, the shortage of air traffic controllers, the number who \nwill retire in the near future, and the need for training of additional \ncontrollers. We read about all these things in the news. We read about \nsystems that still use vacuum tubes in the air traffic control system \nbecause it is that old.\n  The question for this Congress is, can we pass legislation that \nreauthorizes the FAA functions and then provides the funding to \nmodernize this system of ours?\n  We have a lot of people who visit this Capital city, and most of them \nfly in by airplane. This country moves back and forth quickly from \ncoast to coast using, in most cases, commercial air transportation. \nThey don't think very much of it, frankly. You can fly from one coast \nto the other in 5 or 6 hours. It is not unusual to leave one part of \nthis country and end up in another part before lunch. It is a wonderful \nthing to have this system of commercial air travel. The fact is, this \nsystem will not survive for a number of reasons under the current \ncircumstances.\n  As I indicated the other day, I believe there are four airlines that \nhave declared bankruptcy in recent weeks. We also understand, in \naddition, what high fuel costs are doing to the airlines, and we are \ntalking now about the airlines in this legislation before us. But I \ncould talk about the trucking industry, or I could talk about families \nand farmers. I can talk about what the high fuel prices are doing to \nall of this country. There is no heavier user of fuel than an airline.\n  What is happening is the fuel prices are undermining the opportunity \nfor many of these airlines both to continue operating, in some cases, \nand, in other cases, to continue operating serving smaller areas or \nless populated areas of the country. So fuel prices are a serious \nproblem.\n  The other issue is the modernization of the air traffic control \nsystem, the system by which we provide for the safety of the American \npeople. There is going to be a catastrophe one of these days, and then \neverybody is going to stand around thumbing their suspenders, \nscratching their heads, and saying: Why didn't we do something about \nit?\n  We have a bill on the floor of the Senate right now to try to address \nthis situation, to try to modernize this system, and we have been at \nparade rest since Monday because we are not allowed to move forward. \nEverything is blocked. Everything is plugged up. This is unbelievable.\n  This is important. Some people around here treat the serious things \nfar too lightly and then treat the light things too seriously and never \nunderstand the difference. Why is it on a Thursday that legislation as \nimportant as this, that should have been passed in previous years, \ncannot even get amendments up and cannot get votes off because we have \npeople who have decided they are just going to block everything?\n  I told a group in North Dakota a while back about Mark Twain. Mark \nTwain once was asked if he would engage in a debate. He said: Oh, sure, \nas long as I can take the negative side.\n  We haven't even told you the subject of the debate.\n  He said: It doesn't matter, the negative side is going to require no \npreparation.\n  The negative side never requires preparation. Those who are out here \nsaying, no, you can't, they want to block it. That requires no \npreparation. What requires preparation is to advance public policy that \nis in the interest of this country. Does anybody really think \nmodernizing our air traffic control system is somehow a back-burner \nissue? We see what is happening in the skies in this country. They are \nabsolutely clogged. In fact, because of fuel prices and other reasons, \nwe have airlines now switching to smaller planes, these little regional \njets skirting around the sky, hauling as many people but just takes \nmore planes to do it. So that puts an unbelievable strain on the air \ntraffic system.\n  The question is, Are we going to modernize it? Are we going to do \nwhat is necessary? Are we going to provide the funding? Are we going to \nfinally get off this delaying nonsense that is going on and allow \nlegislation to move forward that is essential for the safety of the air \ntraveling public?\n  I hope the answer at some point soon is yes. This includes items such \nas the Airport Improvement Program, what is called the AIP, investing \nin infrastructure in this country. That is very important. Land at some \nof these airports and take a look at the infrastructure and ask \nyourself whether we need this investment.\n\n  It is interesting, if you travel around the world. If you go to \nTegucigalpa, Honduras, and then get in a car and drive to Juticalpa. \nTake a look at the roads and ask yourself whether infrastructure \nmatters. Land in some of the airports in some of these remote areas and \ntake a look at what you are landing on and the infrastructure needs of \nthat airport. Then ask yourself whether infrastructure is important.\n  We have always prided ourselves in this country on the investment in \ninfrastructure. When you come to America, you see infrastructure that \nis maintained. We have always prided ourselves on that until recently, \nand now somehow infrastructure doesn't matter. It takes a back seat.\n  In my little subcommittee on appropriations that I chair, the \nPresident says: Let's cut water funding by $1 billion from last year's \nlevels for the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These \nagencies fund much of the nation's water projects and were cut by $1 \nbillion, even as we have 950 water projects in this country which we \nare paying for in Iraq. Think of that. Let's cut water projects in this \ncountry and investment in the future of this country by $1 billion, the \nPresident says. However, let's have 950 water projects that the \nAmerican taxpayers will pay for in Iraq.\n  I think it is time to start taking care of a few things at home. One \nof them is the legislation on the floor of the Senate right now, and \nthat is the FAA Reauthorization Act and the investment and the \nmodernization of the air traffic control system. If we do not pay \nattention to that, we are going to run into very serious problems. I \nmight also say, tragic problems because there is going to be some sort \nof spectacular tragedy, and then we are all going to sit around and say \nthat somebody should have done something.\n  We are trying to do something. The fact is, we cannot even get a vote \non an amendment on the floor of the Senate. It is unbelievable. As I \nsaid in the Mark Twain example, the easiest thing in the world is to \noppose. It takes no talent, it takes no time to prepare, just oppose, \noppose everything.\n  My hope is in the next couple of hours, perhaps there will be some \nhere who wish to move ahead. I know Senator Reid has been on the floor \noffering unanimous consent requests. He has talked with the minority to \nsee if there are conditions under which we might be able to move \nforward and get something done on some legislation. I understand it \ntakes a while to get things done. I understand we should be \ndeliberative. I understand there should be enough research so we don't \nhave unintended consequences to what we do. Nobody has ever accused \nthis body of speeding, ever, But this is ridiculous. This makes a \nglacier look fast.\n  My hope is that those of us who are elected to come here, who try to \nmake some improvements in this country, who do what is necessary for \nthe health and safety of the people of this country will soon \nunderstand that the FAA reauthorization bill is not just some other \npiece of legislation, that it is an optional piece of legislation. The \nmodernization of the air traffic control system is not some option that \nwe ought to consider like any other bill. This is urgent and necessary \nand timely, and we ought to do it now.\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about energy. Several \ncolleagues have spoken about energy prices, and I related energy prices \nto the airline industry a few moments ago. I mentioned several \nbankruptcies that have occurred recently, intensive heavy users of \nenergy in the airline industry, and what it might mean. This country \nneeds a commercial airline industry that works. Without it, there will \nbe devastating consequences to our economy. The question is, What do we \ndo here?\n  My colleague from Alaska made a point with which I agree. He talked \nabout the speculation in these markets with respect to energy. I wish \nto talk about that issue. I have some charts.\n  This is a chart that shows the speculator activity in the oil futures \nmarket from January 1996 to April 2008. This is the activity by \nspeculators in the futures markets. These are not people who want to \nbuy oil or hold oil. They have no tanks in which to put oil. They are \nnot interested in oil. They want to buy what they will never get from \npeople who never had it. This is what speculating is about.\n  Here is the increase in speculation in the commodities market for \noil. It is an unbelievable ramp-up, an orgy of speculation, having \nnothing to do with the fundamentals of oil supply and demand. There is \nno justification for the current price of oil if we simply look at \nsupply and demand. Supply is up a bit; demand is down a bit. There is \nno justification with the current fundamentals of supply and demand \nthat would seriously justify the current price of oil.\n  So then what has changed? What is different? Why is this price $115 \nor $120 a barrel for oil, acting like a yo-yo at the upper end? A \ncouple issues have changed, especially this. We have hedge funds that \nare now neck deep in the commodities markets speculating on oil. We \nhave investment banks that are speculating on oil. For the first time \nin history, I believe, investment banks are actually buying oil storage \ncapacity to buy oil and take oil off the market to sell it later when \nit is more expensive. This is speculation, raw speculation. I suppose \neverybody is making money. The brokers are making money, the investment \nbanks, the hedge funds--they are all wallowing to the bank full of \ncash, driving up the price of oil beyond what the fundamentals would \nsuggest the price should be.\n  We know those people who are winning, but who are the losers? Well, \nour country. This is something that is providing great damage to our \ncountry's economy. Families drive up to the gas pumps, and it hurts to \nfill the tanks. Farmers, heavy users of energy and fertilizer that \ncomes from energy, are losers. It is an unbelievable burden on family \nfarmers. Airlines, they just cannot fly through this storm. They go \nbelly up. The list goes on and on.\n  If this is what is happening with the ramp-up of speculation and it \nis causing an increase in prices, here is what has happened to oil \nprices. No one needs a chart to know this, but oil prices doubled in \njust over one year. Speculation goes up, up, way up, and oil prices \nhave doubled in one year.\n  Let me cite some folks who have talked about this issue. Stephen \nSimon, senior vice president of ExxonMobil, April 1, a month ago:\n  ``The price of oil should be about $50-$55 per barrel.'' This from an \nexecutive in the oil company. I do not think his company is complaining \nabout where the price is. He is just being candid. According to him, \nthe price of oil ought to be about $50 or $55 per barrel, assuming \ncurrent fundamentals.\n  Clarence Cazalot, CEO, Marathon Oil, October 30, 2007:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n       Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy market has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent or \n     more to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  Think of that.\n  Speculation in the energy markets has grown so much over the last 30 \nyears that it now adds 20 to 30 percent or more to the price of a \nbarrel of oil.\n  I understand the need for a marketplace futures market. It is \nrequired for hedging. It is required for liquidity. I understand it is \nnecessary, and I understand we want one that works so there needs to be \na futures market, but I also understand that when the futures market \nbecomes something much more than just something that provides for \nhedging and liquidity. When it becomes an object of intense \nspeculation, then there is a requirement for some intervention. No one \nquite knows what that intervention should be, but everyone ought to \nknow that it is unhealthy when you have an unbelievable amount of \nspeculation.\n  There are books written about bubbles in speculation. We have been \nthrough recent speculations. The tech bubble that occurred almost a \ndecade ago. The bubble in housing prices is occurring. We have seen and \nunderstand about bubbles. This is a bubble of speculation.\n  Go back 500 years and read about tulip mania. If you have not read \nabout it, I encourage to you do it. Yes, tulip mania. There was a time \nyou could buy a tulip bulb for $25,000. With the hindsight of 400 or \n500 years, we can understand how unbelievably absurd it was, but it was \na bubble, a financial speculative binge that was almost indescribable.\n  What is happening in this marketplace now--and most experts will \nagree--is we have this unbelievable amount of speculation in the \nfutures market that does not justify the current price. The American \npeople and American industry deserve to have a government, in those \ncases, that steps in and says: There is something wrong here, and we \nare going to find a way to set it right. This is one of the areas.\n  This man--in fact, I talked to this man last evening--Mr. Fadel \nGheit, the top energy analyst for Oppenheimer Company. He has been \nthere 30 years, he has testified before the Congress, and he is a very \ninteresting fellow.\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil . . . I'm absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices should not be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel. . . . Oil speculators include the largest financial \n     institutions in the world.\n\n  He said further:\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall . . . it's open \n     24/7 . . . unfortunately it's totally unregulated . . . this \n     is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit and \n     everybody's going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  That is pretty well said, it seems to me. It describes this bubble of \nspeculation that does damage to our economy and needs to be addressed \nby this Government. It is not the case that everybody hurts as a result \nof this.\n  This is a Wall Street Journal article of February 28, 2008. This is \nAndrew Hall. I wouldn't know Andrew Hall from a cord of wood. I just \nsee his picture here. Over the past 5 years, Mr. Hall's compensation \nhas totaled well over a quarter of a billion dollars.\n  What does Mr. Hall do? He makes money by speculating in the \ncommodities market, according to this article. He is not alone. I \npulled this because it is an article about him and he has made a lot of \nmoney. He has made a lot of money as someone who speculates in these \ncommodity markets.\n  Is speculation something that is good for these markets? Absolutely \nnot. When you have a speculative binge that drives these prices way out \nof sight, well above that which would be justified, it can be \ndevastating to the country's economy.\n  That describes what is happening with respect to speculation. To \naddress the issue of energy, it requires a lot of things. We must do \nthis. If we do not address the issue of speculation, we are not going \nto solve the problem. We are just not.\n  But there are other things to do. For example, this administration is \nputting close to 70,000 barrels of oil a day, every single day, \nunderground. It is being put in something called the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a pretty good \nidea because it saves some oil for a rainy day. But just not for any \nrainy day, for an emergency, strategic emergency, something \nunanticipated, so we developed it for this purpose. That makes sense to \nme. But should we take oil when it costs $115 or $120 a barrel and \nstick it underground, 70,000 barrels? Of course not. That is absolutely \nnuts. Why would you take the highest priced oil in history, take it out \nof the supply, stick it underground and by doing so increase the price \nof oil and increase the price of gasoline?\n  A man named Dr. Philip Verleger testified before the Congress. He is \nan economist and energy expert. He said that, by taking a \ndisproportionate amount of oil, a subset of oil called\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nsweet light crude, out of the supply chain, it has increased the price \nof oil by 10 percent. You know, with more than $100 a barrel oil, that \nis at least $10 a barrel for light sweet crude. It is the most \nByzantine thing one can imagine.\n  I have a piece of legislation to stop it. There are now 67 U.S. \nSenators who have declared themselves to be in support of my approach. \nThere is also a very similar bill that was introduced just the other \nday by some in the minority, and John McCain running for President out \nin the country said he supports it. So I have 51 who have signed a \nletter saying they support suspending the SPR fill for 2008. On top of \nthat, some Republican Senators numbering 15, led by Senator Hutchison, \nalso sent a letter to the President. That takes it to 66. John McCain \nis out there saying he doesn't believe we should do it, so there are at \nleast 67. That makes it a veto-proof margin. So I say let's do it. End \nthe speculation, and there are ways to do that. Second, stop putting \noil underground. That ought to be important.\n\n  In addition to all of that, let me just say the other menu of issues \nis not really very complicated either. Should we produce more? My \ncolleague from Alaska says you have to produce more. I don't disagree \nwith that. I was one of four Senators here in the Senate who introduced \nlegislation, now law, that opens up Lease Sale 181 of the Gulf of \nMexico. It opens up an opportunity to substantially increase our \nproduction of both oil and natural gas in a new region of the Gulf of \nMexico. Frankly, if you look at the offshore capability of the Gulf of \nMexico and compare it to the offshore options off the West Coast, East \nCoast or in Alaska, by far the most significant reserves that are \nachievable by us are in the Gulf of Mexico. We have not even tapped the \npotential of the Eastern Gulf either.\n  I and three others initiated the legislation that opened up a portion \nof the Gulf of Mexico, Lease Sale 181. But there is a lot more to do \nbecause it got too narrow. Ought we go back there and produce? You bet \nwe should. There is more production to be had.\n  In addition to that, conservation is unbelievably important and so is \nefficiency. Production, conservation, efficiency, and then renewable \nenergy.\n  Again, we have new technology that allows us to take energy from the \nwind. I come from a state that has the most wind potential in America. \nMy state has a distinction of being No. 50 in trees, so we are last in \nAmerica in trees, and we are first in wind. I am not sure where the \nmerits are there, but all of us who live there lean to the northwest \nbecause it blows almost every day. We are the Saudi Arabia of wind, as \nthe Department of Energy suggests, and with the new modern wind \nturbines, we will continue to take energy from the wind and produce \nelectricity.\n  We have a great experiment going on in which we produce electricity \nfrom wind energy and use that electricity in the process of \nelectrolysis, separating hydrogen from water and storing hydrogen for \nvehicle fuel. It all makes a lot of sense and helps contribute to our \nenergy future.\n  There are a lot of things we can and should do. This is not some \nmysterious illness for which we do not know the cure. This is not some \nstrange disease for which we have no cure. We understand what is \nhappening here, and with a little common sense, perhaps a deep \nreservoir of common sense, we could begin to fix it. At the very least, \nwe ought to begin to take immediate action to stop putting oil \nunderground, and stop it now. It is time to take some action to stop \nthe unbelievable orgy of speculation in the futures market, and do that \nsoon. Those are the first two steps, and they will reduce the price of \ngasoline. There is much more to do beyond that, but those are the first \ntwo sensible steps we ought to accomplish now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to speak on climate \nchange. Before I do that, I commend my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for \nall of his good work on this oil and gas issue. We have been working \ntogether on a number of things he talked about and I do believe that, \nwhile I will talk today about the long-term solutions to our energy \ncrisis and the way this can work hand in hand with climate change if we \nshow the kind of leadership we need to show, there are also short-term \nissues. That means, as he said, cutting down on the speculation, \nputting things in place, closing down the Enron loophole. In terms of \nenforcement, to have the Justice Department get some meat on the bone--\nas a former prosecutor, I know how important that is--and pushing those \nOPEC nations with which we have business dealings. If we are going to \nhave business dealings with them, then they should not be cutting down \nor artificially keeping low the production of oil.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I think there are a number of things we \ncan do in the short term, but I am here today to talk about the long-\nterm energy future and climate future for this country.\n  In 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt invited delegates from \nthe Allied Powers to a remote New Hampshire resort called Bretton Woods \nto discuss the future of the global economy. Although the world was \nlocked in a terrible war, these leaders had fresh memories of the Great \nDepression, a worldwide panic that had left the world's major economies \nin tatters. They wanted their countries to emerge from World War II on \na more stable financial footing.\n  Over the course of 3 weeks, they created the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund to battle world poverty and to avert \ncurrency crises of the sort that had led to the worldwide economic \nmeltdown in the 1920s. It worked. Both the World Bank and the IMF have \nhad their share of controversies in the last decade, but they succeeded \nin stabilizing the world's financial systems so that in the ensuing six \ndecades there has never been a global financial disaster comparable to \nthe Great Depression.\n  I draw on this chapter of history because today the world faces \nanother grave international threat that demands imagination and \nleadership. This time, the threat is environmental. I am speaking, of \ncourse, of global climate change.\n  The heating of the Earth is a threat every bit as grave as the \nfinancial catastrophe that threw the developed world into chaos 80 \nyears ago. The science is clear. Global temperatures are up 1 degree in \nthe last century. That doesn't sound like much, 1 degree in the last \ncentury. To put it in perspective, they have risen only 5 degrees since \nthe height of the ice age. The Environmental Protection Agency of this \ncountry predicts that temperatures could rise another 3 to 7 degrees in \nthe next 100 years. The consequences are frightening: rising ocean \nlevels, which we are already seeing, increased drought, wildfires, and \ndestructive weather patterns.\n  The Presiding Officer knows from being in the Midwest that our \nconstituents aren't as focused on rising ocean levels. But I can tell \nyou, in Minnesota they are focused on the fact that last year Lake \nSuperior was at the lowest level in 80 years. Why would the oceans be \nhigh and Lake Superior be low? That is because Lake Superior, as you \nknow, is a lake, and when the ice that forms on that lake melts \nquicker, the water evaporates and the water level goes down. Why do we \ncare about that? You think, are you going to swim in that cold lake? A \nlot of Minnesotans, probably not, but it matters because our barges \ncannot get through and it has had a severe economic impact for barge \ntraffic and the economy in the Duluth area.\n  You can see the rising impacts of global warming and what we are \nseeing across the country: increasing wildfire risk--remember the fires \nwe had this year in California? We had some in northern Minnesota as \nwell--decreasing water availability. That is in 2007. You go up to the \n2020s, increased mortality from heat waves, floods, and droughts; in \nthe 2050s, millions more people face flooding. You go up, if we do not \ndo anything, to some profound and very serious consequences.\n  Two weeks ago, President Bush gave a speech in the Rose Garden to \nannounce a new initiative on global warming. To be perfectly blunt, I \nreally didn't see anything new in the President's announcement and no \ninitiative that had not been discussed before. The President has \nproposed that we wait\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nuntil the year 2025 before we even stop the increase in the emissions \nof greenhouse gases.\n  He did not call for a cut in emissions that was immediate. He did not \ncall for concrete steps to meet the goals. He said it would be unwise \nto do it at this time.\n  I believe Americans are leaders not followers. When the world faces a \ncrisis, they do not wait for someone else to go first. Our country has \nalways stepped in and taken leadership. When we see a problem in our \nown backyard--and my people in Minnesota see shrinking wetlands and \nendangered wildlife, they have seen what has been going on with our ski \nresorts and ice fishing--they do something about it.\n  Our friends across the seas in Europe have recognized the challenge. \nThey have introduced a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions covering 27 \ncountries. It is a plan covering more than 12,000 industrial sites in \n27 countries. And they did it using a concept known as cap and trade.\n  This was actually started in our country. That is how we reduced acid \nrain. The European Union did not do everything right. They will be the \nfirst to admit that. Their emissions targets were too high. They issued \ntoo many carbon permits. But they are getting it back into equilibrium. \nI believe we are going to learn from what they did, and we will do \nbetter when we do it in this country. But the point is, many of these \nEuropean countries rose to the challenge and took leadership.\n  Here at home, our country's private investors and business leaders \nalready recognize this challenge. Nationally, venture capital \ninvestments in green and clean technologies have increased \ndramatically. In 2006, venture capital investment in green technologies \nin the United States reached $2.9 billion, up 78 percent from a year \nearlier.\n  Not only is clean technology the fastest growing venture capital \nsector, it is now the third largest category of venture capital \ninvestment. So when we talk about some of the things Senator Dorgan and \nI have been talking about with energy, and we mentioned wind, we \ninvented a lot of that wind technology in our country. But now we have \nfallen behind in wind production to other countries that have \ngovernment policies in place that pushed that investment.\n  From what I can see, wind is going to bring jobs across our country. \nSo is solar. So is biofuels. All of these things that cut our \ndependency on foreign oil and invest in the next generation of new \ntechnologies, that money is starting to filter into that area. But I \nthink we can do better in our country.\n  CEOs from major corporations such as DuPont, Duke Energy, and General \nElectric see the opportunities, and they are making investments of \ntheir own. More than 200 major U.S. corporations such as American \nElectric Power and DuPont have started buying carbon offsets that are \nnow traded on the new Chicago Climate Exchange. You can see the global \ninvestments I talked about in renewable technologies that have been \nincreased in wind, in solar, and other kinds of renewable technologies.\n  A company subsidizes a project that reduces greenhouse gas pollution, \nbuilding a wind turbine, for example, then recoups its investments by \nselling that offset to another company on the Chicago Exchange. The \nChicago Exchange is new, but it reports that it kept 10 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide out of the atmosphere over the last 4 years.\n  Meanwhile our Nation's Governors and mayors have also stepped up to \nthe challenge. Governors in five Western States, including California \nand Arizona, have announced they will work together to reduce \ngreenhouse gasses by setting regional targets for lower emissions and \nestablishing a regional cap-and-trade system for buying and selling \ngreenhouse gas credits.\n  California alone plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent \nby the year 2020. The Western Greenhouse Gas Initiative builds on other \nregional initiatives, especially the landmark New England Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative, with seven Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic \nStates that have also agreed to a regional cap-and-trade system set to \ntake effect next year. You can see all of the States that have been \ninvolved.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, we have one of the most aggressive \nrenewable electric portfolio standards in the country; a 25-percent \nreduction. We did this on a bipartisan basis. We did it with the \nsupport of ExelEnergy, our biggest electricity company. We did it the \nway we do things in Minnesota, with a focus on results and getting \nthings done--Leadership.\n  There is also the U.S. Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement. More \nthan 400 mayors representing over 59 million Americans have pledged to \nmeet or beat the Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gas reduction goals in their \nown communities. Among the signatories to this agreement are cities in \nmy home State of Minnesota: Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester, and \nDuluth.\n  I admire these States and communities that have signed onto this \nagreement for their initiatives and what they are doing. They should be \nan inspiration for this Congress for national action. There is a famous \nphrase, ``the laboratories of democracy.'' That is what Justice \nBrandeis said in one of his most famous opinions when he described the \nspecial role of States in the Federal system.\n\n  He said:\n\n       It is one of the happy incidents of the Federal system that \n     a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve \n     as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic \n     experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\n\n  But Brandeis did not mean this would serve as an excuse for inaction \nby the Federal Government. We have States all over this country, \nGovernors, legislatures that have been brave, that have been courageous \nin taking action on climate change. But never, when Justice Brandeis \ntalked about the one courageous State going above the norm, doing \nsomething different, did he mean there should be inaction by the \nFederal Government. Good ideas and successful innovations are supposed \nto emerge from the laboratory and serve as a model for national policy \nin action. That is now our responsibility in Congress.\n  In about 1 month we will have the chance to take up that \nresponsibility. We will have the opportunity to vote in the Chamber on \nlandmark climate change legislation, the Lieberman-Warner bill. I thank \nmy colleagues, Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman, for their hard \nwork on this bill. I thank our chairwoman, Senator Boxer for her \nleadership as it moves forward. At this very moment we are listening to \nMembers make changes to the bill, doing everything we can to make the \nbill as strong as possible.\n  The truth is, we can no longer delay. I have been to Greenland and \nhave seen those humongous icebergs melting in the ocean, and I have \nseen the effect of this in my own State.\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates if we start today and cut \nemissions by just 4 percent a year, we could achieve an 80-percent \nreduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But if we wait just 10 \nyears, we would have to double that annual rate of reduction.\n  This is forward-looking, bipartisan legislation. It is comprehensive, \nand it is carefully tailored. It is our opportunity to show the \nleadership for which Americans have always been known.\n  I pledged last week I was going come to the Senate floor and give a \nspeech about this legislation on different aspects of why it is so \nimportant to move forward and to show leadership on climate change. \nToday, I think it is obvious that as we face these long-term \nconsequences of doing nothing with our energy policy, when it comes to \nelectricity or oil, this is our chance. This climate change legislation \nwill play a major role in developing the new technologies we need.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota talked about \nthe importance of renewable energy, which I certainly agree with her. \nIs it the case with renewable energy that we have done a pretty \npathetic job as a country to incentivize renewable energy?\n  In 1916, we put in place tax incentives to produce oil and gas. They \nhave been in place permanently for almost a century now, tax incentives \nto produce oil and gas. By contrast, with wind and solar and renewable \nenergy, we put them in place in 1992 short term incentives. We have \nextended them short\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\nterm five times and have let them expire three times. It has been a \npathetic response to renewables.\n  The current tax incentives expire at the end of this year, and I have \nintroduced legislation to extend the production tax credit for 10 \nyears. I believe our country ought to say to the world and to \ninvestors: Here is where America is headed for a decade. Count on it. \nBelieve in it. Renewables, solar, wind, and so on need a clear signal \nfor investment. You can count on these investments because this is \nwhere America is going.\n  Is it not the case, I would ask the Senator from Minnesota, that we \nhave not nearly done the job in incentivizing renewables and \nestablishing a national policy. Does she agree?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Senator Dorgan, that is completely accurate. When you \nlook at what we have done with oil companies, with the giveaways that \nwe had for years and years and years, this Senate was one vote short of \nblocking a filibuster. We tried to change that, tried to take some of \nthose oil giveaways and put them in the hands--we see record profits \nfrom the oil companies--put them in the hands of some of these \nrenewables producers.\n  We were one vote short, but we have another opportunity. That is what \nthe Senator from North Dakota is talking about, extending the tax \ncredits for wind energy, solar, geothermal, and other kinds of \nrenewables.\n  We did it in the last bill we passed through this Senate. We were \nable to, with some of the economic work we did with the mortgage \ncrisis, extend that tax credit for 1 year. But we would like to do it \nfor longer. Senator Dorgan has a bill for 10 years. I have a bipartisan \nbill with Senators Snowe and Cantwell expanding it for 5 years. The \nproblem is, it has been a game of red light, green light. It goes on \nagain, off again. It is hard to follow that investment, to follow in \nthe way that we would like and the way that happens in other countries \nbecause they never know. You can show, 8 months before these tax \ncredits go off, that the investment decreases.\n  This is no way to run a national energy policy. It is no way to run a \nnational environmental policy. And that is why today I spoke about the \nleadership and the potential for leadership in this country.\n  We once put a man on the Moon. With that came not just winning the \nrace against Russia, with it came all kinds of technology: the CAT \nscan, the space sticks that my family would take on camping trips in \nthe 1970s. With that came technology. That is what we are trying to do \nwith this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                          Drugbusters' Summit\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nMinnesota and the Senator from North Dakota for their comments on \nrenewable energy and climate change. That is definitely an issue I hope \nwe take up sooner rather than later, and hopefully we will have some \ncommonsense solutions to the problem so we can move this country \nforward both in the area of reducing our effects on climate but also \neconomically because it is a tremendous opportunity with the right \npiece of legislation.\n  I rise today to urge the inclusion of the JAG/Byrne grant funding in \nthe emergency supplemental that we will consider in the coming weeks. A \nweek ago, I organized a summit of drugbuster law enforcement in my home \nState of Montana. I asked all of the leaders of Montana's drug task \nforces to come together to talk about Federal funding. It is a \ncritically important issue.\n  Many of them drove hundreds of miles across the State in a spring \nblizzard to take part in this summit. The drug task forces are made up \nof dedicated law enforcement officers from every part of Montana: \nsheriffs' deputies, narcotics officers, local and State police, and \nundercover agents. They work together across jurisdictions to bust drug \nsmugglers, as well as those who grow or manufacture instate.\n  Our State of Montana has 56 counties. There are, of course, a lot of \ndifferent regions that deal with the task forces, that deal with \ncatching the drug manufacturers and smugglers. It is critically \nimportant that these folks work together.\n  There is cause for concern because the President proposes slashing \n$350 million from the drug task forces nationwide. If that happens, \nMontana will lose a staggering 70 percent of its national drug fighting \nmoney for the upcoming year, and the task forces would probably have to \nlay off 27 agents, leaving only 22 agents to battle drugs statewide. In \na State the size of Montana that is impossible.\n  We should not let that happen. We should find a way to fund these \ndrug task forces in this supplemental, this spending bill that we are \ngoing to be considering in a few weeks. If we do not, these cuts will \ncripple the progress that we have made up to now in the war on drugs in \nrural States such as the State of Montana.\n  These drug task forces are success stories. The officers who are on \nthe front lines keep drugs, the drug smugglers, and the drug dealers \noff our streets. They make our communities safer; they reduce crime, \nand they make a place like Montana a whole lot safer to live and raise \na family. These drug busters work together to get the job done.\n  Because drugs are not limited by borders, these tasks forces rely on \nFederal funding to facilitate the cooperation across the many \njurisdictions of Montana, and it works.\n  Last weekend, folks picking up some trash in Havre, MT, stumbled \nacross a dumped meth lab. They called the police, and within minutes \nthe task force agents were there on the scene to help clean it up and \nkeep the community safe.\n  A week ago Monday I heard about a drug operation busted in a remote \npart of southeastern Montana; so remote, in fact, the task force needed \nthe help of the National Guard helicopter to find it. Officers found 3 \npounds of methamphetamine.\n  Last summer, the Northwest Montana Drug Task Force investigated a \ncase that took them across State lines to Salt Lake City, UT. In the \nend, they seized 2 pounds of cocaine. They took 20 illegal weapons off \nthe streets, and they say they couldn't have done it without their \nability to work across jurisdictional lines and work together. For \nexample, one task force busted a meth lab in a home. Through \nsurveillance, they knew children were present. They took the \nprecautions not to put the children in any more danger. When the bust \nwas made, one child inside tested positive for meth because he was \nliving in a house where they were cooking meth. Even his toys were \ncovered with meth resin. This case set the standard for the way \nofficers deal with and protect children in harm's way. In only 1 year, \nMontana'a drug task forces rescued 84 children from homes where they \nwere being exposed to drugs and drug dealers.\n  To me, restoring this funding is a no-brainer. As one of the officers \nput it: We will end up spending much more money in the future if we \nhave to play catchup.\n  During the summit last week in Montana, officers told me again and \nagain that without Federal funding our small communities will be \ndevastated. Our children will be exposed to more drugs and, therefore, \nmore crime, and families will be torn apart.\n  I hope we can all work together to restore this funding. Montana and \nthe Nation cannot afford to do otherwise. Americans deserve better.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Prices\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss what has become a very tortured topic for the entire country; \nthat is, the prices for oil and gasoline and diesel.\n  I would like to respond, first, to the President's misstatements \nabout Congress's role in this situation. These\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\nare misstatements he made on Tuesday at his press conference. Then I \nwould like to talk about what I believe are some of the real causes of \nthe energy situation and what constructive steps we can take to address \nthose causes.\n  First, with regard to the President's statements, on Tuesday he \nsuggested the Congress is to blame for the current price situation \nAmericans are seeing when they go to fill up at the gas pump. He cited \nthree reasons to conclude that.\n  First of all, he was blaming Congress for preventing oil companies \nfrom exploring for oil and gas in the United States. Second, he was \nblaming Congress for blocking efforts to build more refineries in the \nUnited States. Third, he was blaming Congress for blocking increases in \nthe U.S. nuclear electricity production capacity.\n  Frankly, I think the President's comments are disappointing in \nseveral regards. First, of course, they are very partisan. But second, \nthe charges the President made are simply not borne out by the facts.\n  On exploration and production of natural gas in this country, \nCongress has taken significant steps on a bipartisan basis to enhance \noil and gas production. Through enacting the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act of 2006, Congress made available 4.74 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas and 1.26 billion barrels of oil off the Florida \nPanhandle.\n  Ironically, Congress was required to pass that law because of steps \nthat were taken early in the Bush administration. In her first year in \noffice, in 2001, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton cut the size of \nthe scheduled Outer Continental Shelf lease sale in the area by 75 \npercent. So with the stroke of a pen, the Secretary of the Interior, in \n2001, put off limits over 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and over \n1 billion barrels of oil from an area that had been proposed for \nleasing by the Clinton administration, I would say, with the \nconcurrence of our former colleague, Lawton Chiles, who was then the \nGovernor of Florida.\n  So while, undoubtedly, a politically popular stance for the Bush \nadministration in Florida when this action was taken by Secretary \nNorton, this was hardly an action that was intended to enhance oil and \ngas production in the country.\n  In fact, large areas of the Outer Continental Shelf are currently off \nlimits to oil and gas development and production not just because of \ncongressional moratoria but because of Presidential withdrawals that \nwere first put in place, in 1990, by the first President Bush. This \ncurrent President Bush could exercise real leadership in this area, if \nhe wished to, by eliminating these Presidential withdrawals that were \nfirst put in place by his father.\n  We are talking about a significant area. There are some 574 million \nacres of the OCS, or Outer Continental Shelf, that are unavailable for \nleasing, and virtually all that is covered by Presidential withdrawals, \nwhich could be eliminated by this President with the stroke of a pen.\n  The Arctic Refuge is another issue raised by the President. He failed \nto mention drilling in the Refuge will do nothing to address the high \nprice of gas people are faced with today. I think everyone who has \nlooked at the issue recognizes that not a single drop of oil would come \nto the lower continental United States from the Arctic Refuge for at \nleast 10 years.\n  The Energy Information Administration has estimated that production \nfrom the Arctic Refuge would, at its peak, reduce our reliance on \nimports by about 4 percent, from 68 percent to 64 percent. That is the \nestimate the Energy Information Administration has given, which, of \ncourse, is part of our own Department of Energy.\n  Other areas of Federal lands that are much more appropriate for \ndevelopment can and should be drilled. In fact, of the 45.5 million \nacres of Federal onshore lands currently under lease by industry, there \nare over 31 million acres of those lands that are not currently being \nproduced. Likewise, there are 33 million acres of Federal Outer \nContinental Shelf that are under lease; that is, the Government has \ndone what it should do to make these areas available, but they are not \nbeing produced.\n  The processing of drilling permits on Federal lands has surged over \nthe past several years. It has more than doubled between 2001 and 2006. \nAt the same time, the administration reported that in five key basins \nin the Rocky Mountain States, 85 percent of oil resources and 88 \npercent of natural gas resources are currently available for leasing \nand for development.\n  Congress has also funded important research and development programs \nto enhance the best of production. It is simply inaccurate finger \npointing to say that Congress is impeding oil and gas development in \nthis country.\n  On refinery capacity, which is the second point the President made in \nhis press conference, refining capacity has increased by about a \nmillion barrels per day during President Bush's tenure, from 16.6 \nmillion barrels per day in 2001 to 17.5 million barrels per day in 2007 \nthrough capacity expansion and existing refineries. There have been no \nefforts from Congress to try to slow down that expansion. Refiners have \nbeen asked whether they would like to build new refineries as opposed \nto expanding capacity at existing refineries, and those refiners have \ntold us in hearings before our Energy Committee that they would rather \nexpand capacity at existing refineries. We have never heard support \nfrom anyone inside the oil industry regarding the President's curious \nplan to build refineries on former U.S. military bases. As far as I \nknow, no Member of Congress objects to that; it is just that the \ncompanies that are in the business of constructing refineries have not \ndecided that it makes good sense for them from an economic point of \nview.\n  The economics of refining are not very good at the moment, as \ngasoline prices are not yet fully reflecting the jump in crude oil \nprices. U.S. refining capacity is at about 85 percent utilization at \nthe current time, as many refiners are losing money on every gallon of \ngasoline they produce. Clearly, constraining refinery capacity is not \nour current problem.\n  The third issue the President attacked the Congress about was nuclear \nenergy production. Here again, Congress is not standing in the way of \nincreasing nuclear production capacity. In fact, Congress over the past \n3 years has put in place one of the most favorable sets of incentives \nfor nuclear power development anywhere in the world.\n  For example, if a nuclear plant is proposed for licensing and is \ndelayed because of a lack of action by Federal regulators, the \nproponents of the plant can get Federal payments to compensate for that \ndelay. Now, that was part of the 2005 legislation we passed. No wind \npower developer can get that kind of a subsidy. No solar power \ndeveloper can get that kind of a subsidy. We also provided tax \nincentives for the construction of new nuclear powerplants. So if the \nCongress passes global warming legislation--I know the administration \nand the President are opposed to that, but if we do, according to the \nEnergy Information Administration, the most significant impact of that \nglobal warming legislation would be to provide a powerful new incentive \nto promote more nuclear power development in this country.\n  So let me move on from the discussion of the President's charges to a \nshort discussion of what I consider the real causes of current oil \nprices. I think to understand what is going on here, it is critical to \nput these oil prices in the broader economic context. The current \nincrease in oil prices is, to a large degree, a symptom of our ailing \neconomy. Oil prices and the value of the U.S. dollar have been very \nstrongly linked over the last year. As the value of the dollar \ndeclines, oil prices go up.\n  We have heard recent testimony before our Energy Committee that \nconfirms that investors are seeking protection from inflationary risks \nassociated with the weak dollar and from credit and wider financial \nmarkets in which they have lost confidence. As one witness put it, oil \nhas become the new gold, and that is why speculators and others are \ninvesting in oil. Higher oil prices in turn weaken our economy, so we \nare caught in a downward spiral in which a weak economy is resulting in \nhigh oil prices, and high oil prices are, in turn, further weakening \nthe economy.\n  So the question is how do we stop this downward spiral. This is a \nlarge task. It requires, first and foremost, a return to rational \nfiscal policy that will restore balance and investor confidence in our \nmarkets. That includes\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\nan honest accounting of the costs of the war in Iraq, a figure that we \nnow know is going to be in the trillions of dollars. Spending has also \nbeen accompanied by the administration's tax policies which have been \nextremely damaging to the country's long-term fiscal health. Every \nAmerican family that sits around the kitchen table and tries to balance \na budget recognizes the simple fact that spending more than you earn or \nmore than the revenue you can bring in results in, after a period, your \ncreditors eventually coming calling. That is what is happening to the \ndollar today. Apparently, the stewards of the U.S. economy and this \nadministration have failed to absorb that simple reality.\n  Let me talk a little about policies to reduce oil prices in the short \nterm. There are modest but important measures we can enact to increase \nour oil supply and reduce our demand. On the supply side, we need to \nimmediately stop removing oil from the market to fill the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. It simply makes no sense to be putting $120 per \nbarrel oil underground. According to the most recent Energy Information \nAdministration forecast, oil demand in the United States is expected to \ndecline by 90,000 barrels per day in 2008. This is the kind of signal \nwe need to send to the market in order to see some relief from current \nprices. However, we are taking 70,000 barrels per day off the market to \nadd to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which we all recognize is about \n97 percent full right now. We are basically wiping out any positive \neffects from the decrease in demand. This is a policy completely \nwrongheaded and should be stopped immediately. I compliment all three \nof the candidates for President for embracing this recommendation that \nwe eliminate the filling or we suspend the filling of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. I wish the administration would support that simple \nmeasure.\n  On the demand side, we need to decide whether we are ready to get \nserious about educating consumers to take more responsibility to reduce \nconsumption. We know that 5 miles per hour slower that a person drives \nwill increase our fuel efficiency for that individual by about 7.5 \npercent. We also know that energy-efficient, properly inflated tires \nincrease fuel efficiency by about 4 percent. Regular car maintenance \ncan increase fuel efficiency by about 2 percent. So Americans \nindividually could use about 10 to 15 percent less gasoline by adopting \nthese commonsense measures. But to see we do that, we will need \npublicity out there to educate folks on the simple steps they can take \nto reduce consumption. In the medium term, we need to ensure there is a \ncop on the beat on the oil markets.\n\n  There are two key steps we should take to improve Government \noversight of the oil markets. First, the Secretary of Energy needs to \nhave a role in overseeing oil markets. It troubles me that the people \nat the New York Mercantile Exchange on which oil is traded and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission which regulates that exchange seem \nto be the only people who think that speculators are not influencing \noil prices.\n  Here is a quote from the Wall Street Journal on March 21 of 2006. It \nsays:\n\n       Hedge funds are taking ever-larger bets in a futures market \n     that is smaller than the stock or bond markets, and the funds \n     are using borrowed money to maximize their bets, magnifying \n     the impact on energy market prices.\n\n  So clearly, the Secretary of Energy and the 500-plus employees he has \nthere in his Energy Information Administration who work every day to \nanalyze energy data, forecast energy supply and demand, and prices \nshould at a minimum provide insight and advice to market regulators at \nthe Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Perhaps this could help the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission come to understand the role of \nspeculators in that market.\n  Second, we need to shed light on the so-called dark markets. Markets \nthat trade U.S. oil or are located in the United States should be \nsubject to U.S. regulation. It is unacceptable that an exchange that is \nbased in Atlanta, GA and trades U.S. crude oil that is delivered in \nOklahoma is regulated in the United Kingdom, not subject to the laws \nand regulations that we in Congress put in place to govern the U.S. \nfutures market. It is also unacceptable that over-the-counter markets \nare regulated neither here in the United States nor in the United \nKingdom. There is simply no regulatory body that can see these over-\nthe-counter transactions.\n  Let me also say a few words about policies that will not reduce \ngasoline prices. First, there is a proposal to suspend the tax on gas \nand diesel. While I can appreciate the temporary public relations \nsuccess that might accompany this tax suspension, it would come at the \nexpense of fiscal common sense and sound energy policy. I agree that \nhigh gasoline and diesel prices are hurting consumers, but additional \ndeficit spending will only help accelerate the downward trajectory of \nour economy as a whole. This is simply the latest in a long line of \nproposals that seek to score political points during an election year \nat the expense of good energy policy.\n  There are three main objections to the proposal. First, it would \nincrease deficit spending by nearly $10 billion while saving motorists \nabout $25 per person. If you do the math, you find that even if all of \nthe savings are passed on to the consumer, which is a very unlikely \noutcome, the savings per person is negligible.\n  If you assume that the average motorist drives 12,000 miles per year \nand gets 22 miles per gallon, you can calculate that the amount the \naverage person would save in a 3-month period is $25.50. So adopting \nthe fuel efficiency measures I have discussed earlier, including \nshaving a few miles per hour off the top highway speed, would be much \nmore effective in reducing the cost of gasoline to the average \nconsumer.\n  Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I believe the Senator has used his \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, the second argument I wanted to raise \nrelated to this proposed suspension of the gas tax is the idea that it \nwould be reinstated in September when prices might well be as high or \nhigher than they are today would be very difficult and very unlikely to \noccur, frankly. We are talking about reinstating the gas tax in \nSeptember. I think that is the proposal the Senator from Arizona has \nmade: Let's suspend the gas tax now, or at Memorial Day, and let's \nreinstate it on Labor Day. Well, the problem with that is Labor Day is \nabout 2 months before the election. It would not be politically \nfeasible to have a single-day price increase on September 1st of 18.4 \ncents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel. I don't think \nanybody--any politician in his or her right mind--would vote to impose \nthat kind of a tax increase at that time. Prices could easily be as \nhigh or higher on September 1 as they are today. It is simply not \npossible to me that Congress will then choose to increase the price \nthat consumers pay at the pump.\n  The third argument is that this tax suspension would stimulate demand \nfor motor fuels without increasing supply. In fact, we would see \nsomething in the nature of a price increase. The best explanation of \nthis was done by Paul Krugman, a respected economist who writes for the \nNew York Times and teaches at Princeton, in an article he did on April \n29. He said in that article, I think the conclusion was, the McCain gas \ntax plan is a giveaway to oil companies disguised as a gift to \nconsumers.\n  The obvious point he was making is that under the basic rules of \neconomics, the fact that Congress would suspend the gas tax would do \nnothing to ensure that consumers benefited from the suspension of the \ngas tax. The whole notion that you are going to see the price of gas at \nthe pump drop 18 cents because Congress says the tax is all of a sudden \nsuspended is not realistic.\n  In conclusion, we as a country and we as a Congress need to get \nserious about energy policy. It is an election year. While there is \nalways a tendency to take rhetorical stands in the runup to an \nelection, the American people understand that. I think they discount \nwhat they hear from Washington as the\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\nelection date begins to arrive. That is one reason they don't always \nhold Congress in the highest esteem. Proposals that are mostly feel-\ngood propositions do not fool voters for long--if they fool them at \nall.\n  That said, there are a number of concrete steps we can take that will \nhelp. We should freeze the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--\nsuspend that for the time being. We should take some effective actions \nto bring the oil markets under better control with U.S. laws and \nregulations. Let's be sure consumers know what they themselves can do \nto reduce their own demand. I hope that with oil at $110 to $120 per \nbarrel, which it has been for several weeks and which it may well be \nfor several more weeks or months ahead--or even a longer period--I hope \nwe will give this topic the serious attention it deserves.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, today, marks more than 2 years--by my \ncount, 738 days--since Speaker Pelosi said:\n\n       Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down \n     skyrocketing gas prices.\n\n  That was on April 24, 2006--738 days ago. I think it is important to \nlook at what has happened to the price of gas and to see whether her \nprediction was correct.\n  Lo and behold, we find the average price of a gallon of gasoline in \nAmerica at $3.62, up $2.33 from the time when Speaker Pelosi became \nSpeaker in January of 2007. Again, that is a rise from $2.33 a gallon \nto $3.62 a gallon.\n  I will tell you we have been asking and waiting, and the American \npeople have been waiting and watching, to see what Congress is going to \ndo to help relieve some of this pain at the pump. The American people \nwant us to work together to try to find commonsense solutions to help \nthem with this increasing pain they are feeling in the family budget.\n  Do you know that taking the difference between $2.33 a gallon and \n$3.62 a gallon represents roughly a $1,400 increase in the cost for \ngasoline for the average American family? Of course, I don't have to \ntell anybody here, or anybody listening, that this is necessary for \ndriving the kids to school, driving to work; it is necessary also to \nprovide fuel for the airplanes Americans fly in. This is an American \nproblem, and I suggest we need to come up with an American solution.\n  The problem has been that about 60 percent of our energy needs in \nthis country are now satisfied by imported oil and gas from other parts \nof the world. That is a national security challenge because, of course, \nto the extent which others supply our energy needs, it means they can \nturn off the spigot; or if hostilities were to occur that would, let's \nsay, for example, block the Strait of Hormuz, there could be an \neconomic body blow to the United States as a result of the restriction \non our energy supply.\n  We need to recognize there are certain things that are irrefutable \nor, I should say, maybe unchangeable by Congress. We can pass a lot of \nlaws and repeal laws, but we cannot change the law of supply and \ndemand. Try as we might, Congress has neglected that for these many \nyears. While we have done some good things on conservation, passing \nfuel efficiency standards recently, and we have also supported \nrenewable fuels, which are an important part of the energy supply, you \ncannot put wind energy in your tank to drive your kids to school.\n  We need to recognize that with a fixed supply of oil, which is 70 \npercent of the price of gasoline, we are competing globally with \ncountries such as China and India, rising economies where people want a \nbetter quality of life, and they realize one key to that is affordable \nenergy. America has not had that exclusively, but we have had it pretty \nmuch to ourselves, and others want what we have, which is a good \nquality of life and standard of living. That comes with affordable \nenergy.\n  So what are we going to do about satisfying the laws of supply and \ndemand? Of course, we know Congress is the primary culprit when it \ncomes to obstructing access to American natural resources. I remember \nthat when I was growing up, we would talk about different countries in \nschool and about how some were blessed with abundant natural resources \nand how that was a good thing because the citizens of that country \ncould use those natural resources to enhance their quality of life--in \nthis case, provide for affordable energy. But we have simply, by our \ninaction--and I would say to the extent it applies--actually acted \naffirmatively to place our natural resources out of bounds in a way \nthat has exacerbated and not solved the problem.\n  I know how popular it is these days to say it is all big oil's fault. \nThe blame game. Then we have people saying we need another \ninvestigation. Well, the blame game and investigations are important, \nand investigations and oversight is for Congress, but that is not \nproducing a single drop of additional energy. We need to do that and we \nneed to act today.\n  A moment ago, a group of Senators announced an omnibus energy bill \nthat would satisfy America's need for more American solutions to our \nenergy supply. My hope is that by taking advantage, for example, of the \nmillion-barrel-a-day capacity Alaska could supply, by taking advantage \nof the Outer Continental Shelf, such as we have in the Gulf of Mexico, \nwith the vast oil deposits there, and by taking advantage of our \nabundant natural resources in the form of oil shale in the West, we \ncould relieve our dependence upon imported oil in this country to the \ntune of some 3 million barrels a day.\n\n  I know there are environmental and safety concerns with developing \nour oil and gas resources right here at home. But I invite the people \nwho are concerned about that and who do not believe we can do so to \ncome to Fort Worth and see the Barnett shale, which is an abundant, \nplentiful source of natural gas being developed right in the city of \nFort Worth. As a matter of fact, if you fly into DFW Airport, you will \nsee drilling rigs on the airport property. The tract of land in Alaska \nthat is going to be explored and used for producing this million-\nbarrel-a-day-plus oil that is located in the Arctic is going to be on a \npostage stamp-size piece of property.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member of the Energy Committee. I was \nsaying the city of Fort Worth is producing the Barnett shale and \nactually drilling gas at DFW Airport and that you can see the rigs \nthere.\n  I suggest that if we can produce those natural resources in Texas and \nin Fort Worth on the DFW Airport property, American energy producers \ncan do it in Alaska. People are concerned, as they should be--and I \nwish they would act on those concerns and not just complain about it--\nabout $120-a-barrel oil. It has been projected that if we were to take \nadvantage of the natural resources God has blessed us with in the \nArctic, we could produce oil there that costs roughly $55 a barrel. So \n$120 a barrel or $55 a barrel? You pick.\n  If we are talking about developing oil resources from the Outer \nContinental Shelf, even beyond the horizon, as we did in lease sale 181 \nin the Gulf of Mexico--it is 300 miles off the coast of Texas. You \ncannot even see it. Yet we have a way of producing those abundant \nresources. If Congress will simply quit the blame game, the finger-\npointing and wake up to the fact that the American people are feeling \npain not only at the pump but in their family budgets--they are looking \nfor Congress to get out of the way and let the American people produce \nthe natural resources we have been blessed with, in a way that will \nsatisfy the laws of supply and demand, by producing as much as 3 \nmillion barrels of additional oil, which will then have a dramatic \nimpact at the pump and help American families meet their energy needs \nat a reasonable price.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Extension\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, tomorrow we are going to have the \nreport by the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the unemployment figures \nin this country. Those unemployment figures may be statistics to some, \nbut they are lost hopes and dreams to millions of our fellow citizens. \nThey are a key indicator of the state of our economy. I think most of \nus who have had the opportunity to travel our States and listen to \nworking families understand the extraordinary pressures these families \nare under, the incredible anxiety that goes to the heart and soul of \nthese families. They really wonder if somehow they are guilty in some \nway for not being able to deal with the economic challenges they are \nfacing, whether it is the increased cost of gas at the pump, or whether \nit is the increasing cost of tuition, the increasing cost of health \ncare, or the challenges they are facing with their mortgages.\n  This afternoon I want to speak for a few minutes about the issue of \nunemployment and how that has impacted so many of our fellow citizens \nand what the implications are for so many of our fellow citizens. Even \nthough we do not have the figures, I think we can reliably suggest \nthere is going to be a further increase in the number of unemployed \nAmericans when we get the figures tomorrow morning. These are the \nfigures so far this year: we see 76,000 jobs lost in January; in \nFebruary, 76,000; some 80,000 in March--232,000 jobs were lost over the \nperiod of these 3 months. There were 50,000 construction jobs lost. \nThat sends a message in and of itself.\n  If we look at this chart, we see the total number of unemployed. \nThese are the Bureau of Labor Statistics figures. In March of 2008 we \nhave 7.8 million unemployed and only 3.9 million jobs. That's two \nworkers for every job. Here we have individuals, Americans, who have \nworked hard, played by the rules, and, through no fault of their own, \nbecause of the failure of fiscal and monetary policy, they have lost \ntheir jobs. Yet when we look back at the total number of job openings, \nthey are limited. These Americans are getting squeezed. How are they \ngoing to be able to find jobs when the jobs are not available even if \nthey have the skills? We are going to come back to that in just a \nmoment.\n  These families are hurting. That is why it is so important that we \nhave an increase in the unemployment compensation program that is now \nin surplus of about $35 billion. That fund has actually been paid into \nby American workers. They have paid into the fund $35 billion, and the \nreason they paid in was for circumstances such as this, a fiscal and \nmonetary economic policy which has failed them. They are entitled to \nreceive the unemployment compensation. Yet we have an administration \nwhich has consistently opposed extending unemployment benefits. I am \ngoing to come to that in just a moment too.\n  Here are recent veterans who having served, are having a hard time \nfinding work. The total workforce, 5.1 percent unemployed; for these \nveterans serving after 2001, we can see their unemployment is 6.1 \npercent. And the young male veterans, serving after September 2001, are \nat 11.2 percent. These are all veterans, but this is young men--11.2 \npercent. These young Americans were the ones who had the burden of \nconflict and now they are facing the burden, at home, of an economy \nthat will not serve them and serve their interests. Where is the burden \nfalling? It is falling on our young veterans, and it is falling \nparticularly hard.\n  This chart indicates where the burden of this economy is falling. We \nare finding out it is increasingly falling on adult women, who are \nseeing a sharper rise in unemployment rates than men. There is a 21-\npercent increase for women, and 15 percent for men, between March of \n2007 and March of 2008. Do we understand how it is squeezing women? \nWomen are more likely to have subprime mortgages than men, despite \nhaving slightly better credit scores. Women are having their homes \nforeclosed at a more rapid rate than men, their unemployment rates are \ngoing up, and their savings are lower. They are the ones who are taking \nthe brunt of this recession along with young veterans.\n  Here we find women's earnings are falling faster than men's. Men's \nmedian income in 2007 fell one-half of 1 percent for men, women's fell \n3 percent. We see increasing numbers of women are unemployed, and the \nwages of women who have jobs are being adversely impacted to a much \nhigher and more significant degree.\n  We see what has happened generally with regard to the economy. The \nstock market lost $2.7 trillion in value since May of 2007. This crisis \nhas wiped out $2.7 trillion in home values. The dollar has lost one-\nthird of its value, and the Federal debt has nearly doubled since this \nPresident took office. Again, we are looking at home values, which is \nthe wealth for so many middle-income and working families--$2.7 \ntrillion effectively has been wiped out during this last year.\n  All these figures show middle-income families, working families, are \ntaking the heavy brunt of the recession we are facing. We should ask \nourselves what are we doing about this. If we look at what we have done \nat other times, we have granted extended unemployment benefits. Look at \nthe last recessions we have had, from January 1980 to July 1980, and \nthen July 1981 to November 1982, the average number of weeks of \nunemployment was 16 weeks. And we extended unemployment compensation.\n  The next recession we had was July 1990 to March of 1991. The average \nweeks of unemployment was 13.9 weeks, but we had an extension of \nunemployment compensation.\n  In March 2001 to November 2001, 15 weeks was the average number of \nweeks of unemployment, and we had an extension of the unemployment \ncompensation.\n  Here, look at this: 16.2 weeks is the average number of weeks workers \nare unemployed today--16.2 weeks--and this administration refuses to \nsay the $35 billion that is in the unemployment compensation fund that \nyou have worked for and contributed into that fund, should be available \nto you when we have adverse economic conditions. These are just the \nkind of conditions that they are there for. This administration refuses \nto do anything about it. It is a striking difference for working \nfamilies who are trying to make it and provide for their families.\n\n  Very briefly, this chart demonstrates that during a recession, among \nthe limited economic stimulus measures, unemployment compensation is \namong the most promising investments--every dollar we invest in \nunemployment compensation has the effect of $1.64; for infrastructure \nit is $1.59 for every dollar invested; and it is $1.73 in food stamps. \nThis is from Moody's chief economist. There is much less impact, \nobviously, for the Bush extended tax cuts.\n  We should look at what is happening in food stamps--we do not \nfrequently think about the numbers of our fellow American citizens who \nare dependent on food stamps, but we should pause now. We certainly \nshould if we have been back home and listened to those who have been \nrunning the food banks in our States and we find out the condition of \nthose food banks. 28 million Americans are projected to receive food \nstamps in fiscal year 2009--28 million Americans are going to be \neligible for food stamps in 2009. Look at the indicators. This is \nanother indicator\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\nabout what is happening in the economy, the kind of pressures that \nmiddle-income and working families have.\n  We could also ask, Why aren't we trying to provide training for these \nworkers who are struggling to find a job? If we improve their skills, \nthey will be able to find a job--is that right? No, it is wrong. What \nwe are finding is Americans cannot access job training programs. This \nadministration has been cutting back virtually every year on job \ntraining programs.\n  Look at this. In Massachusetts alone, for every available slot in a \njob training program there are 21 workers on a waiting list. Do we \nunderstand? There are 21 workers on a waiting list. These are American \nmen and women who want to work, have worked, want to provide for their \nfamilies, and they cannot even get the training in order to be able to \nfill the jobs. We have 83,000 jobs in my State that are not being \nfilled today, but we have cut back. This administration has cut back on \nthe training programs. This is the kind of misstep this administration \nhas taken time in and time out.\n  I just remind the Senate about action that we took just yesterday \nwith regard to students and the student loan program. One urgent step \nthat we must take to ensure that the slumping economy does not prevent \nyoung people from going to college is to provide some help and \nassistance, and we did yesterday.\n  Right now, in May, students and their parents are applying for \nfinancial aid and the loans they need to attend college in the fall. \nThis is happening just as some banks have said they are no longer \noffering student loans. We cannot allow the slumping economy to limit \nthe horizons of a new generation of Americans. Students and parents \nneed to know we will do everything we can to guarantee that every \nsingle student who needs a loan to go to college in the fall will get \none, even in these troubled economic times. We will increase the amount \nof grant aid available to relieve the debt burden on needy students.\n  Yesterday the Senate passed legislation to do just that. The House of \nRepresentatives also passed the legislation just a few hours ago, and \nPresident Bush has indicated that he will sign it into law. This is \nwhat the emergency legislation does: For students, if private loans \nthrough the banks dry up, they can get lower cost government-guaranteed \nloans to take their place. So no matter what happens in the private \nloan market, the government loans will be there, and they will be there \nfor them.\n  This guarantee comes in two ways. First, the bill expands the amount \nof Federal loans available for a student for 4 years of college from \n$23,000 to $31,000, an $8,000 increase. Second, it ensures that \nstudents will have easy access to Federal loans.\n  If banks are not willing to make these loans to students, State-\nbased, nonprofit agencies, called the guaranty agencies, will take \ntheir place.\n  So for every student, there will always be someone to provide the \nloans, either through the private sector or through the Government.\n  Also, for thousands of low-income students, we increased the grant \naid by up to $1,300 a year for underclassmen and $4,000 a year for \nupperclassmen. That is not a lot, but it is a part of an ongoing \ncommitment to help low-income college students avoid the crushing \nburdens of debt that inevitably distort their choices for the future.\n  The bill also helps parents by providing them with better options and \nbetter access to the low-cost Federal PLUS loans alternative. This \nprovides help to parents. It allows the parents to delay the repayment \non the loans until their child has graduated from college. It makes it \neasier for parents who have been hit by the mortgage crisis to obtain \nthese low-cost loans; help for the students, help as well for families.\n  Finally, the bill helps stabilize the overall student loan market by \nauthorizing the Secretary of Education to purchase outstanding federal \nloans, allowing private lenders to replenish their capital so they can \nmake new loans to students and parents.\n  For the 6 million students and over 700,000 parents currently relying \non low cost federally subsidized loans, these steps mean they will \ncontinue to have ready access to these funds, even as the credit \nmarkets discourage lender participation in the Federal program. In \nother words, students and parents will now have multiple avenues to \nobtain low-cost Federal loans.\n  Fortunately, Congress has taken prompt action to prevent college \nstudents from becoming the next victims of our failing economy, and I \ncommend President Bush for urging us to do so. I am grateful to Senator \nEnzi, Congressman Miller, Congressman McKeon for their partnership on \nthis legislation, and for the support and assistance of the Secretary \nof Education.\n  I hope we can replicate this bipartisan effort in tackling other \nurgent economic issues. There is much work to be done to ensure that \nMain Street is insulated from the problems of Wall Street. It is clear \nthat the Nation faces a serious ongoing economic challenge. We know \nwhat we have to do to put our economy and our country back on track. To \ndo that we need to seize the moment and act immediately to help the \nmillions of Americans who need our help the most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I see the Senator from Michigan on the \nfloor. I know she is here to address the same topic as the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and she has a 5 o'clock conference committee on an \nimportant bill pending before the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that \nshe be allowed to speak in my place and that I follow her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank our distinguished assistant majority leader for \nallowing me to do this. It is very important. I thank my colleague and \nfriend, the champion from Massachusetts, for all of his efforts as they \nrelate to the efforts to make sure college loans are available. Also I \nwant to speak to the fact that we are working together to extend \nunemployment insurance benefits, and I greatly appreciate his \nleadership.\n  I want to specifically today speak to that piece of the effort we are \nworking on together. Because since my colleagues across the aisle \nblocked extending critical unemployment benefits from the part of our \nfirst stimulus package, frankly, the situation has only gotten worse \nfor families in Michigan and all across the country.\n  National unemployment is on the rise, with our Nation losing 80,000 \njobs in March. It is stunning to me when we look at what is happening \nacross the country. I have to say, these are not new kinds of numbers \nfor us in Michigan. We have been seeing these kinds of numbers now for \na number of years but we see nationally, in this last January, 76,000 \njobs were lost; in February, 76,000 jobs were lost; in March, the \nhighest number, 80,000 jobs were lost; 232,000 jobs cut in the past 3 \nmonths.\n  I remember coming to the floor and having colleagues say: Well, \noverall unemployment is not high. We do not have a problem. It is below \n5 percent. Well, now it has crept up above 5 percent, and we are being \ntold by Goldman Sachs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics that by \nJanuary, this coming January, the national unemployment rate will be \n6.5 percent.\n  We in Michigan would actually consider that a decrease, because ours \nis at 7.2 percent. But nationally when we look at that kind of steep \nincrease in those people who are out of work, we need to be paying \nattention to this. Families, middle-class families, who have worked \nhard all their lives are finding themselves in a situation, due to no \nfault of their own, where they are looking for work, trying to keep \ntheir family together and, in fact, are looking for us to do what we \nhave always done in times such as these, which is to extend \nunemployment benefits across the country for families, and particularly \nfor those States that are hardest hit.\n  We have 10,000 people right now in Michigan every month who are \nlosing unemployment benefits. That for us relates to the fact that we \nare one of the highest States in mortgage foreclosures, why people \ncannot afford to pay for their mortgage. So the ripple effect \nthroughout the economy is staggering when we look at the fact that on\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\ntop of what is happening to people who are losing their jobs and cannot \nafford their mortgage, their gas, when we look at what is happening \nwith gas prices.\n  We in the majority have been coming to this floor and have been doing \neverything we can in putting forward proposals to deal with the high \ngas prices. We have not been able to get support from colleagues to \ntruly address this, what needs to be addressed, and even putting food \non people's tables and health insurance.\n  Everything is going up in the wrong direction, including the fact \nthat people are now losing their unemployment benefits. We have been \nsuffering in Michigan through several years of high unemployment, as I \nmentioned. We have 7.2 percent unemployment right now. In the first \nhalf of this year, over 72,000 people exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits. But we are not alone. This is not only a Michigan problem \nanymore. Alaska, California, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Nevada, \nMissouri, Oregon, South Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, all have unemployment \nrates at or above 5.7 percent. Across the country, millions of \nAmericans are losing what are insurance benefits. We are not talking \nabout public assistance, we are talking about an insurance system that \nthey paid into, that employees come into for these circumstances.\n  We have not seen the President's willingness, up to this point, to \nsupport extending unemployment benefits and, subsequently, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. This makes absolutely no \nsense. Frankly, from an economic standpoint, it makes no sense.\n  Moody's economy.com chief economist Mark Zandi estimates for every $1 \nspent on unemployment benefits, the economy is stimulated by $1.4. We \nknew that when we passed the original stimulus package. Rather than a \nrebate, many of us were arguing that the best way, the fastest way to \nstimulate the economy was to give dollars directly to people out of \nwork, struggling to make their payments, who on average make 40 percent \nof their wage from this unemployment insurance system. The people would \nhave to turn right around and go to the grocery store, buy clothes for \ntheir children, spend the dollars they receive in unemployment benefits \nin order to be able to keep going. What we have heard over and over \nagain from colleagues on the other side of the aisle is: We should \nwait; we should wait; it is not that bad; it is not bad enough. I do \nnot know how many times we have heard the President say, up until \nrecently, ``Well, the underlying fundamentals of the economy are good'' \nor ``Things really are not as bad as people think.''\n  Well, they are. They are. The American people know that when they are \nbeing hit on all sides with rising costs and lower wages. So I am here \ntoday to urge my colleagues to come together to understand what \nAmerican families are going through, and to support, strongly support, \nan extension of unemployment compensation.\n  Let me say in conclusion that this unfortunately is a pattern we have \nseen over and over again when it comes to blocking those programs that \nare critically important for American families. Over and over again we \nsee colleagues filibustering issues, stopping us from moving forward on \nwhat makes a real difference in people's lives.\n  It is not only extending unemployment insurance for families and \nworkers in Michigan and across the country, but it is part of a pattern \nof blocking and obstructing what is important to families in this very \ndifficult economy. Last year my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle blocked an energy tax bill that would have increased the \nproduction of renewable fuels and helped bring more advanced technology \nvehicles to the marketplace to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nbegin to address what is happening on the gas price side of things.\n  But, unfortunately again, these efforts were blocked time and time \nagain when we brought forward proposals that relate to energy and \npricing and accountability for the industry. Moving tax breaks from oil \ncompanies to alternative fuels or to consumers, we have been blocked. I \nhave to say also in conclusion today that once again, a critical issue \nto this safety of the American public has been blocked, and that is the \nquestion of whether we are going to modernize air service in this \ncountry; whether we are going to truly have a passenger's bill of \nrights; whether we are going to update a system that is clearly \noverloaded, clearly in crisis. We have been trying all week to bring to \nthe floor critical changes to upgrade the American airline system, and \nonce again these efforts have been blocked and blocked and blocked. We \nhave a whole range of needs in this country that are urgent for the \nsafety of those of us who are flying with our families and are counting \non the fact that everything that is being done to make sure that system \nis the best in the country and it is safe.\n  We see that families are struggling with gas prices. We see in my \nhome State again 10,000 people a month losing unemployment insurance \nwho are trying to figure out how to make ends meet while we see \nblocking after blocking, filibuster after filibuster, here in the \nSenate stopping us from moving forward on important legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the folks at home and what they are \ngoing through, and to join us to extend unemployment insurance, to \naddress what are outrageous gas prices, and also make sure we are being \nserious and responsible about important issues such as airline safety.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My thanks to my colleagues from Massachusetts and \nMichigan for bringing to our attention the struggle this economy \npresents to many families across the United States.\n  You would almost find it hard to imagine that this Senate could meet \nwith such regularity and not address these issues directly. But this \nadministration and its economic policies have not focused on working \nfamilies. They have focused on tax breaks for those in the highest \nincome categories in America. That is something they do without \nembarrassment. They suggest that if the wealthy people in America have \nextra money to spend, it will be good for everyone else. That is a hard \nmessage to deliver and even harder to believe.\n  Elizabeth Warren is a professor of law at Harvard Law School in \nCambridge, MA, and has become a good friend and adviser to many of us. \nShe recently made a presentation to a number of Senators and showed an \nanalysis which she had done relating to the middle of the middle class. \nProfessor Warren took a look at real middle-income families and \nbasically asked the question: What has happened to them during the last \n7 years?\n  Her findings are troubling. From 2000 to 2007, she writes, the \nAmerican family lost ground. Measured in real dollars, incomes declined \nwhile basic expenses skyrocketed. By the time today's family makes a \nfew basic purchases--housing, health insurance, food, gasoline, and \nphone--it has about $5,700 less than it had been in 2000.\n  Now, this is a family that is making in the range of $40,000 to \n$45,000. So a decline in buying power of $5,700 over the last 7 years \ncauses real hardship. By every measure, incomes are down for the same \nhypothetical family for this same period of time; down for fully \nemployed males, fully employed females, down for households.\n  Adjusted for inflation, median household income has declined across \nAmerica by $1,175. Prosperity has not arrived to the working class, the \nworking families of America. In fact, the opposite has been true.\n  Of course, the biggest thing we face going home is the increasing \ncost of gasoline. The increase in the cost of gasoline has more than \ndoubled since President Bush became President. In that same period, the \nprofits of the oil companies have more than quadrupled. It is no \ncoincidence. They are making more money as families, rich and \nespecially poor, reach deeper into their pockets to pay for gasoline. \nFamilies have reduced driving. They have to spend an average of $2,000 \nmore a year for gasoline than they did back in the year 2000, when \nPresident Bush was elected. Our friends on the Republican side of the \naisle like to talk about cutting people's taxes, sending out rebate \nchecks. Of course, those are all well and good. But it turns out the \nexpense which has been passed along to working families for the cost of \ngasoline\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\nsince President Bush became President is more than $2,000 a year. There \nis a tax. It is a tax families have to pay if they have to drive to \nwork or if they want to take their family on vacation.\n  Increases in mortgage costs took another big bite out of middle-\nincome families, almost $1,700 each year. Health insurance, food, \ntelephone, appliances, another $750 a year knocked out of the family \nbudget. The increases mean the average family is spending $4,564 more \nfor basic expenses now than they did in 2000. How about families with \nkids? Childcare costs under this President have gone up by $1,321 a \nyear, more than $100 a month; afterschool care, $511 a year. All \nparents, regardless of the age of children, see the rising cost of \ncollege. Under this Presidency, the net cost of college, including \nscholarships and grants, has increased by more than $1,000. Is it any \nsurprise, when Members of the Senate and the House go home over the \nweekends and run into these families, they want to talk about the \nlatest outrage, which happens to be the price of gasoline?\n  My understanding is ExxonMobil made its report of quarterly earnings \npublic today. It was a little bit off for them. Their earnings only \nincreased 17 percent, hardly keeping pace with the recordbreaking \npercentage increases of the past. But trust me, there will be no tag \ndays for those CEOs and members of the executive board and management \nof the biggest oil companies in America. They are doing quite well. The \nquestion is whether this Congress can do well by American families who \npay the price for those profits. That is a challenge we will face.\n  President Bush is going to send us a supplemental appropriations \nbill. It is because of the emergency in Iraq. He is going to ask for \n$108 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. He is not going to ask for the \nemergency in America, and there is one. He will not be asking for \nincreasing unemployment compensation for families out of work, watching \nunemployment rates rise by the day. He will not be asking for tax \nbreaks for those struggling families I have described. He focuses on \nthe Middle East.\n  I am from Illinois. I focus on the Middle West. I try to look at the \nwhole Nation, but I start with my obligation at home. When I look out \nthe window in the morning, I see America. When this administration \nlooks out the window in the morning, it sees Iraq. So when it comes to \nemergency spending, drop everything, highest priorities, it is not \nabout America. This administration focuses on the Middle East.\n  I think that is unfortunate. We need to understand a strong America \nbegins at home. It begins with a strong economy, strong families, \nstrong churches, strong temples, strong neighborhoods, strong cities, \nstrong communities that build a great nation. They are suffering at \nthis moment.\n  During the course of this week, there has been precious little done \non the floor of the Senate. Senator after Senator has come to talk \nabout their concerns about energy costs. That is good. We should raise \nawareness of this particular issue. But we need to do more than give a \nspeech, come up with a quick gimmick or a quick idea. We have to focus \non changing some fundamentals, and it ought to start with the Tax Code \nand programs that help working families.\n  Mr. President, I have a friend in Illinois whose name is Harold \nRamis. Harold Ramis and I share a birth date and a lot of friends. \nHarold Ramis has done quite well for himself. He ia a writer, a \nproducer of movies. Harold got started writing ``Animal House,'' went \non to write ``Caddyshack'' and a few others. But one of his most famous \nmovies, which he released over 15 years ago, was a movie called \n``Groundhog Day.'' I bet every American has seen it. It is hard to \nbelieve it has been more than 15 years since it was released. In that \nmovie another Chicagoan, Bill Murray, wakes up every morning in \nPunxsutawney, PA, and looks over at the clock radio as Sonny and Cher \nare singing ``I Got You, Babe,'' and relives the same day over and over \nagain, until finally it stops at the end. A fascinating movie, it has \nbeen analyzed by so many people. What is the message of the movie? I am \nnot sure. I sure enjoy it and continue to watch it. I drive my wife \ncrazy when she says: How many times have you seen that movie? But I \nlike it a lot.\n  I am reminded of that movie when I think about what is going on in \nthe Senate. It is almost like ``Groundhog Day'' around here because \nevery day that you get up in the Senate and every week, it is the same \nmusic playing. It is the same script playing. The script that is \nplaying is the strategy on the other side of the aisle, on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Their strategy is very simple. It \ninvolves the use of a filibuster.\n  A filibuster is a uniquely Senatorial institution that says, \nhistorically, any Senator can stand up at any time and stop anything--a \nnomination, a bill, anything. It gives us a lot of power. But \nunfortunately, that power can be misused. ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' Jimmy Stewart on that famous set, the brandnew Senator \nwho stood up and filibustered until he dropped right next to his desk, \nwe all remember that image. It doesn't quite happen that way anymore. I \nhave not seen anybody fall to the floor in the middle of a filibuster, \nbut it does eat up a lot of time, and it slows things down.\n\n  In the history of the Senate, there is a record book. The record book \nsays that in the history of this great body, in a 2-year period, the \nmaximum number of filibusters is 57; 57 times in 2 years there was an \neffort to stop the debate, stop a nomination, and a filibuster was \ninitiated.\n  For those who follow the history of the Senate, they are watching a \nhistoric session. Because in the last year and 4 months, the \nRepublicans in the Senate have broken the record. They have gone beyond \n57 filibusters. At this point, they are now up to 68 Republican \nfilibusters and still counting. On 68 different occasions, they have \ninitiated a filibuster to stop us from taking up legislation.\n  You say to yourself: Maybe that had to be done. Not until you look at \nthe legislation involved. Two weeks ago, we had something called a \ntechnical corrections bill. This is a bill that notices there were \nspelling errors and grammar errors in a highway bill that passed \nseveral years ago. They change it with technical corrections. It \nusually is a bill which passes with no debate, no comment, and not even \na record vote. It just goes through when we have to clean up some \nproblems we had in previous legislation.\n  In this new era of Republican filibusters, they decided to filibuster \nthe technical corrections bill. If there was ever an embarrassing \nmoment in the history of the Senate, it is the notion that we would \nfilibuster a bill that corrects grammatical and spelling errors, but \nthey did it. They held the Senate in session for a full week while we \nwaited to complete the technical corrections bill. Then came the \nveterans' health benefits bill. Veterans' health benefits? Is this an \nissue anyone contests, that we would not provide all the benefits \npromised and all we can afford to the men and women who have served our \ncountry so valiantly and continue to? We brought this bill to the floor \nfiguring this was an easy one, a bipartisan bill. It would pass. It was \nthe subject of a Republican filibuster that held that bill on the floor \nfor a full week.\n  Time and again, we came to the floor and said to the Republicans: Let \nus call up this bill. If you have an amendment, if there is something \nyou want to change, then let's do it. No. Day after weary day this \n``Groundhog Day'' script played out. We got up every morning. We didn't \nhear Sonny and Cher. We heard the Republican minority leader singing \nthe same song every morning: We are going to try to get around to \nlooking at this bill. Days passed.\n  If the Senate was paid for piecework as opposed to a general annual \nsalary, we would be hurting at this point. We don't do much around \nhere, and that is unfortunate. By the end of the week, after they had \nburned another week off the calendar, a week where we didn't consider \nthe problems with our Nation's energy policy, where we didn't do a \nthing about gasoline prices but were stuck in a Republican filibuster, \nwe had one vote on one amendment and passed the bill virtually \nunanimously when it was all over.\n  There was no controversy.\n  The object from the Republican side: Slow everything down. Stop it if \nyou can.\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\n  So this week comes another bill. This bill is 288 pages. This is the \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. Unfortunately, \nit is now subject to a Republican filibuster. A motion for cloture is \nabout to be filed. This week in the Senate, for those who want to keep \nup with the ongoing and developing saga of our ``Groundhog Day'' \nscript, Republicans are blocking safer, more efficient air travel. We \nhave spent the entire week here and had one vote. I know it is not a \nsecret. It is in the Congressional Record. But it is embarrassing. We \ntried time and again to get Senate Republicans to give us an amendment, \ncall it up for a vote. Let's get moving on this bill. No, let's wait \nuntil next week.\n  Is there anything else we could have been considering in the Senate \nthis week? We should have passed this in a hurry. First, it is a \nbipartisan bill. Is it necessary or important? For those of us who live \non airplanes, you bet it is. Twenty-five million more passengers flew \non U.S. commercial air carriers last year than the previous year. \nAlmost 800 million passengers flew on U.S. commercial carriers in 2007, \ndouble the number of 1985. The FAA predicts the aviation system will \ntransport more than 1 billion airline passengers annually by 2020. \nThere is a problem though. As modern as the airplanes may be, as new as \nsome of the airports may be, we are running our air traffic system on \nradar that was established during World War II. This technology is not \nequipped to handle the volume increase in air travel we anticipate. We \nare already seeing it in airports across the country. Passengers are \nfeeling it in my home State in the great airport at O'Hare, where I \nspend a large portion of my waking hours.\n  U.S. News and World Report placed O'Hare recently at the top of the \nairport misery index. In defense of that great airport, we are in the \nprocess of modernizing it and things will get better. But it is fat. \nThe magazine cited that almost 30 percent of flights in and out of \nO'Hare are delayed. One of the main reasons is the incapacity of our \nair traffic control system to deal with this increase in volume. We \nneed to move to a more modern, satellite-based air traffic control \nsystem. This technology, known as NextGen, will give pilots and air \ntraffic controllers the ability to accurately pinpoint aircraft in the \nsky to avoid any problems, to monitor traffic, to move things more \nsmoothly and efficiently.\n  The second reason for the increase in delays comes from the lack of \ncapacity in our airports. O'Hare Airport was designed in the 1950s and \nbuilt in that era. It doesn't handle, as it should most efficiently, \nthe aircraft of today. We have a big expansion under way. But the bill \nthat has been held up all week in the Senate, a bill that was brought \nto us on a bipartisan basis by Senator Jay Rockefeller of West \nVirginia, who has worked his heart out to pass this bill, and Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who helped in crafting this bill, will \nprovide funding for programs to give airports the money they need to \nexpand and handle the growth in air traffic.\n  Lastly, the FAA bill also provides important provisions giving \npassengers rights when they are stuck in airplanes on the tarmac. Has \nit ever happened to you--stuck out there for an hour, if you are lucky? \nIt used to be a lot longer. There are some horror stories that have \ncome out of this. I will not go into the details other than to tell you \nwe try to provide in this bill basic protections for airline \npassengers. We never want an airline to hurry into a circumstance that \nmight compromise safety, but we do believe they should inform their \npassengers about what is going on and be mindful of the need for basic \nhuman comforts that passengers need when they are stuck on the runway \nfor hour after weary hour. That is in this bill. You will not get a \nchance, if you look at the Congressional Record of this week, to hear \nany debate about it. We did not get to it. We were stuck in a \nfilibuster--stuck for I think it will be the 69th filibuster of this \nsenatorial session.\n  I believed when I came here that this was the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. Maybe it is self-promotion for us to continue to say \nthat because we have precious few amendments, very little debate, and \nwe really lack the kind of legislative activity that has, I guess, been \nthe hallmark of the Senate for as long as it has existed. We have \nground to a halt because we are facing the slowdown strategy from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  When you think about how many important issues we need to work on for \nthis country, for the families of this country, important decisions we \nneed to make, it is sad that the Senate rules allow this to continue.\n  Well, we will return next Tuesday, after a long weekend. After having \none vote this week, we need a rest. I hope you understand. We will come \nback Tuesday in the hopes we can start up this bill again. Maybe in the \nsecond week this bipartisan bill just might draw an amendment from the \nother side of the aisle, just might draw some debate on the floor, and \njust might get passed, so we can move on to the next issue, which I \nbelieve will be energy policy. And I can just guarantee you, it is \nlikely to face another filibuster from the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  The GOP is the, I guess, nickname for the Republican Party. It stands \nfor the ``Grand Old Party.'' When you watch the progress, or at least \nthe strategy of the Republicans in the Senate, you come to believe that \nGOP stands for ``Graveyard Of Progress.'' That is what they see the \nSenate. That is unfortunate.\n  There is a lot of work we need to do. The American people sent us \nhere to do it on a bipartisan basis. I hope we can get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the custom is to alternate to each side. \nSenator DeMint is here. After he has concluded his remarks, I ask \nunanimous consent to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I need to start by expressing my disappointment at the \nmisleading and distorted information that was just presented on the \nfloor. Actually, I was amazed at what was just said.\n  The Commerce Committee had come up with an aviation modernization \nbill with strong bipartisan support. But, like many other bills we have \nfaced with our Democratic colleagues in the majority, some of my \nDemocratic colleagues chose to add special provisions for some interest \ngroups and very wasteful and questionable earmarks, tax earmarks, using \nunprecedented methods to fund things through changing our Tax Code, \nthings that there is a lot of consternation about: changing a pension \nplan.\n  The reason this bill has been held up is the majority decided to add \nthings to it that had nothing to do with aviation. We want this bill to \ncome through, and it has strong support.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, no, I will not. I have been down here \nseveral times today, and I will continue my remarks. But I will be glad \nto have the Senator say anything after I complete my remarks.\n  The Senator mentioned the technical corrections bill for \ntransportation. He said this was just typos. This bill added hundreds \nof millions of dollars of new earmarks to our transportation budget. It \nwas not a technical correction bill. It was an opportunity for the \nmajority and some others to add things that did not need to be a part \nof this bill. The Senator even knows, on bills such as consumer product \nsafety where special provisions were added for manufacturers in that \nbill, we had to slow the bill down in order to get those things taken \nout.\n  So there is a reason the majority has not been able to move any \nsignificant legislation. It is because they tend to clutter it up with \nwasteful special interest earmarks that need to be taken out. \nHopefully, we can come to an agreement to take out these unnecessary \nand unprecedented tax provisions in our aviation modernization bill so \nwe can get this thing done.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, I did not come down to talk about aviation \nmodernization, as I hope the majority will clean this bill up so we can \nget it through. But I want to talk a little bit about health care.\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n  Health care is a priority for the Nation. Americans deserve access to \naffordable health insurance. Yet we are wasting time here and not doing \nanything to help with the health care crisis in this country today.\n  Fortunately, one of our colleagues, John McCain, has come out this \nweek strongly for a health care plan that would help every American to \nbe insured. He talks about guaranteed access to health insurance--plans \npeople can own and can afford and keep, plans they choose for \nthemselves and that are not chosen by the Government. This is the \ndirection we need to move.\n\n  Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues--at least many of them--do \nnot want everyone to be insured with personal health insurance \npolicies. They would much rather the Government take over the whole \nhealth insurance industry and decide for us what type of health plans \nwe are going to have. The evidence of this is abundant.\n  There are a number of efforts Republicans have made to try to improve \naccess to private health insurance. One is to allow people in this \ncountry to buy health insurance from anywhere in the country. Right \nnow, they are restricted to buying it in the State where they live. So \na few insurance companies have a monopoly on the business. We have had \na Health Care Choice Act that would give Americans a chance to shop \nanywhere in the country. Yet the Democrats have blocked this bill.\n  Only a couple weeks ago, we had an amendment to the budget bill that \nwould allow individuals to deduct the cost of health insurance, just as \nbusinesses do. But I believe every Democrat in the Senate voted against \nthat, to give some kind of fair tax treatment to individuals who are \nbuying health care. They blocked it. Yet they complain about \nindividuals being uninsured. They do everything they can to keep \nindividuals from owning health insurance.\n  Now the Democrats are trying to destroy health savings accounts. It \nstarted in the House with a bill that will change the way health \nsavings accounts are set up. The fastest growing way for the uninsured \nto get insurance is new types of health plans that have health savings \naccounts and insurance, where people can buy most of their health care \nwith their own dollars or in dollars their employers put in this health \nsavings account that is tax free. It gives them a lot more choices and \nflexibility, and it takes out, importantly, the cost of third-party \nadministration.\n  Health savings accounts are a way to restructure health insurance \nplans so that every time you go to the doctor or the hospital, there is \nnot a third-party insurance company filing claims or dealing with \nbilling and running up the cost of administration. We know today there \nare more administrative people in a doctor's office or a hospital than \nthere are health care providers. The reason for that is, every time we \nuse the health care system, there is a third party involved, whether it \nis private health insurance or Medicaid or Medicare, and there are a \nlot of administrative costs.\n  Health savings accounts not only give people more flexibility, but \nthey begin to take the cost of administration out of health care. It \nallows an individual to make their own decisions with their doctors or \nwith their pharmacists as to their health care, and they do not need \napproval from some health insurance company or from some Government \nbureaucrat whether they are going to spend this money. Certainly, the \nway health savings account dollars are spent is restricted to real \nhealth care, and that is the way it is working.\n  But, unfortunately, a company that provides this service of \nsubstantiating the way health care dollars are spent has come to \nWashington and convinced Democrats that we need a third party to \ndetermine whether a health savings account spending event can be \nsubstantiated. This is definitely a special interest provision that the \nDemocrats have bought into. But what it does is it adds the \nadministrative costs back to health savings accounts and takes away the \nflexibility we are giving to individuals.\n  Keep in mind, people who are uninsured and people who did not have \ninsurance before and a number of people who are switching from \ntraditional plans--and we have gone from 1 million people covered by \nhealth savings account-type plans to over 6 million in the last few \nyears. It is the fastest growing type of health care plan because that \nis the kind of plan people want.\n  Let me just read some statistics. The reason for all this is the \nDemocrats have inserted, on the House side, in the bill they call the \nTaxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act, provisions that would put \nan administrative burden on health savings accounts. They are trying to \nkill health savings accounts so we will all end up with Government \nhealth care.\n  I already mentioned that we have gone from 1 million people covered \nby health savings account plans in 2005 to over 6 million today. \nThirty-one percent of the people who have these health savings account \nplans plus insurance were previously uninsured. Eighty-four percent of \nhealth savings account policies in the group and individual market \nprovide first-dollar coverage for preventative care. So this claim that \nhealth savings accounts keep people from seeking preventative care is \ntotally bogus because the plans are designed that when someone seeks \npreventative care, diagnostic care, the insurance pays for it and it \ndoes not come out of the health savings account.\n  Health savings accounts give people better access to the type of \nhealth care they want. We found that it even helps with chronic-disease \nmanagement. If people have access to $1,000 or $2,000 more per year to \nuse the way they need to for their own health, then they can manage \ntheir diabetes or congestive heart failure or other types of illnesses \nthat are often restricted by traditional health insurance.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues--my colleagues who really believe \nAmericans should have the freedom to own their own health insurance and \nnot have to go to the Government for their health care--to help us \npreserve and promote and expand health savings accounts for those who \nwant them.\n  I want to make it clear, health savings accounts are health \ninsurance. They are just health insurance plans that have savings and \ninsurance with them, so that most of health care can be accessed with \ndollars of patients doing direct business with their physician, with \ntheir pharmacist, with the hospital. It will save millions--even \nbillions--as a nation in administrative costs. Already, Americans have \nwell over $3 billion saved in health savings accounts for future health \ncare needs.\n  This is an idea we need to expand across the country, not to destroy. \nI would ask particularly my Democratic colleagues on the Senate side \nnot to take up this provision that the House included that will hurt \nand probably destroy the whole idea of health savings accounts.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for allowing me to speak, and I \nyield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are here today in the midst of another \nfilibuster in which the FAA reauthorization bill is before us, but we \nhave to wait for a cloture vote and we have to wait many, many days \npast, I think, what was appropriate. But it does give us an opportunity \nto talk about the issue that is of most concern to Americans at this \nmoment; that is, the economy.\n  We have an economy that is heading, unfortunately, toward recession. \nSome economists have already declared it here. Over the last few \nmonths, I have spoken about the situation and particularly, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer, in our home State of Rhode Island where, as we \ngo about, we are stopped constantly by our constituents, our neighbors, \nour friends who, quite rightly, complain about the current economic \nsituation.\n  The Senator from Illinois was very accurate and very insightful when \nhe noted that the incomes of most Americans have not risen over the \nlast decade or more and that these individuals--and we are not talking \nabout low-income Americans, entry-level workers; we are talking about \ngoing way up close to $100,000 or more--they have seen no real income \ngrowth. But what they have seen is accelerating prices.\n  Now, for several years, they thought they would be buttressed against \nthese\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\naccelerating prices and slow income growth by the value of their homes. \nBut, as we know now, we are seeing a huge recession in the real estate \nmarket. The values of homes are beginning to fall. They certainly are \nnot rising as they were. The foreclosure situation is deepening \neverywhere. Again, in Rhode Island, there were traditionally a few \nnotices each week in the paper. Now it seems there is a whole section \ndevoted to foreclosures in the Providence Journal. It is evidence of \nthe worsening of the economic situation.\n\n  Now, the pressure of flat wages, flat incomes, housing values \nfalling--these accelerating prices are becoming very difficult to \nendure by Americans everywhere.\n  According to a review, a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, \nfewer Americans now than at any time in the past half century believe \nthey are moving forward in life.\n  One of the great aspects of my youth in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s \nis not only did families deal with moving forward, they also were of an \nunshakeable belief that their children would have a much better life \nthan they enjoyed. That belief is being shaken today, seriously. Many \nparents--again, we are not talking about low-income workers; we are \ntalking about a range of Americans--believe that unless we take \npositive and effective action, we are going to be in a situation where \nthe next generation of Americans will have it even more difficult than \nwe do today. That is why it is very difficult to bear these filibusters \nbecause ultimately, this is not about parliamentary maneuvering. It is \nabout whether we can provide the leadership and the policies to reverse \ncourse in America today and provide for that better future for our sons \nand daughters tomorrow.\n  Seventy-nine percent of Americans today believe it is more difficult \nto maintain their middle-class standard of living. In fact, one of the \ngreat hallmarks of this country in the last century was the creation \nand the expansion of the middle class. Again, there are many people who \nare sensing that the middle class is not expanding any longer, but that \nit is shrinking. It is shrinking on the load of increasing prices, flat \nincomes, and decelerating housing values. That is not just the sum of \nstatistics and analysis and reports; that is what people are talking \nabout everywhere in this country.\n  In Rhode Island, for example, with respect to prices, the average \nprice of gasoline is soaring to record levels. Regular unleaded is \ncurrently at more than $3.60 per gallon. Diesel is getting close to \n$4.50 per gallon. For our trucking industry, for all of the businesses \nthat depend on moving their goods around, for the service people who \nhave to get to their service calls, when prices go up--gasoline and \ndiesel--that is an additional business cost. It is an additional tax on \nthem because of, I think, the failed policies of this administration, \nand it is a tax that is taking a big bite out of their well-being and \nthe welfare of their families.\n  One thing we can do, and I think we should do--we could do it \nimmediately--is we can refrain, at least temporarily, from filling the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. That seems to be a very simpleminded \napproach to lessening, at least in a small way, demand for oil at a \ntime that oil is surging to around $119 per barrel. I think it also \nwill send a signal that we are at least doing something to relieve the \npressure on working families, and that can be done with the signature \nby the President and ordered by the President, and it should be.\n  At the same time families across this country and businesses across \nthis country are seeing extraordinary price increases, oil companies \nare seeing extraordinary profits. I think we have to take action, and \nthat action, once again, stalled on the Senate floor several months ago \nto eliminate some of the tax breaks that oil companies are receiving. I \nthought that at $119 a barrel, there would be sufficient incentives to \ngo drill, but apparently the oil companies need tax incentives as well. \nI thought the market would be working in this case, but apparently it \nworks in strange ways for these oil companies.\n  I think we also have to think about a windfall profits tax. We have \nhuge expenditures. The President, as the Senator from Illinois pointed \nout, is sending up a supplemental appropriations bill for Iraq for \nbillions of dollars. All of that is expended, and yet we can't tax some \nof the extraordinary profits of companies that are doing very well and \ndon't seem to be reinvesting it robustly in drilling or searching for \nalternative sources.\n  I think we also have to protect consumers from price gouging at the \npump, and something else--and that is speculation in the world oil \nmarkets. There are experts who suggest that more than 25 percent of the \ncost of crude oil may be the result not of supply and demand but of \nmarket speculation. We need to give the principal regulator for the \nenergy-commodities markets, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, \nthe tools they need to review these transactions and to ferret out \nunscrupulous conduct in speculation.\n  That is why I support the Close the Enron Loophole Act that has been \nintroduced by Senator Levin. It has been included in the Senate-passed \nfarm bill, and I continue to advocate that provision should be adopted \nvery quickly because without it, I don't think we can effectively \nprovide regulation to a market that is exacting, in some estimates, a \n25-percent premium, not because of supply and demand but because there \nare financial forces at work speculating in these commodities, and that \nspeculation will go on until we authorize the appropriate regulatory \nauthority to begin to supervise, regulate, and review those \ntransactions.\n  The price of food is also, in many cases, spinning out of control for \nso many working Americans. Since March 2007, the price of eggs has \njumped 35 percent, a gallon of milk is up 23 percent, a loaf of white \nbread has gone up 16 percent, and a pound of ground chuck is up 8 \npercent. Overall, food prices in 2008 are expected to rise 4 to 5 \npercent, about double the increase of recent years.\n  Again, this is not just an economic statistic. Talk to the bakers--\nand the Presiding Officer knows these families, such as the Calise \nfamily and other families in Rhode Island who have been baking \nItalian bread for 70 or 100 years--they have never seen the increase in \nwheat prices they have seen over the last several months. It is \naffecting their ability to make ends meet for their businesses. When \nyou have accelerating energy prices, oil prices, gasoline prices, \naccelerating commodity prices such as wheat, a business such as that, a \nfamily-owned bakery, it is very difficult. It is extremely difficult \nfor those families who are struggling to get by to get, frankly, to the \nsupermarket, fill up their basket, and not walk out very much \nimpoverished by the experience.\n\n  That is why I have requested the Senate Agriculture Committee to hold \na hearing on the food versus fuel balance in U.S. agriculture policy. \nWe have been encouraging ethanol production. That would bar us using \nsome of our commodities, our agricultural commodities, but I believe we \nhave to begin to focus on the tradeoff between energy production and \nfood production.\n  I have also sent a letter to the Agriculture Secretary expressing \nconcern with the cost of wheat, as I indicated, based upon comments I \nreceived from our bakers in Rhode Island, and requested that the \nSecretary work with the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nDepartment of Energy to look at the need to develop a mechanism to \nbalance this tradeoff between food production and fuel production, and \nrequesting information about how the Department of Agriculture is \nmanaging the wheat stockpile--which is something that will influence \nthe price of wheat--as well as requesting information on how it is \nmonitoring new speculative investment in commodities and its impact on \nprices. All of this has to be done.\n  What is becoming also more difficult to bear on top of everything we \nhave talked about--flat income, rising prices, declining home values--\nis the fact that now we are seeing unemployment begin to accelerate. In \nRhode Island, we are unfortunately experiencing a 6.1-percent \nunemployment rate--higher than the rest of New England. It is causing \nreal problems, and it is something we have to address. I think we have \nto begin to recognize that as we lose jobs, we have to think seriously \nabout employing people again.\n  As I mentioned, Rhode Island has a 6.1 percent unemployment rate \nright\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nnow. It is close to the highest unemployment rate in the United States, \nonly behind Michigan, Alaska, and California. It is the highest \nunemployment rate in Rhode Island since August of 1995, more than 12 \nyears ago. There are 35,100 people in Rhode Island who are unemployed, \nand this is a trend that has been going up, unfortunately, not down.\n  We have also seen a shift in employment recently from February to \nMarch of 2008. In just a single month, 3,100 less people were without \njobs in Rhode Island, a decrease in 3,100 jobs. For a State with a \npopulation of just 1 million, that is a significant factor. It adds not \nonly to the decline in the unemployment, but the velocity of that \ndecline. Things seem to be trending much quicker downward than \nrebounding.\n  Now, it is no wonder that the Labor Department announced today that \nthe number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose to \n380,000 nationwide. That is the highest level in 4 years. Today's \nannouncement concluded that Rhode Island had one of the largest \nincreases in initial claims numbering 1,779. The direction is \nunfortunate, and it is the wrong direction. Approximately half of those \nunemployed workers were eligible to collect unemployment insurance \nbenefits, and of this number, nearly 19 percent face long-term \nunemployment.\n  The number of Rhode Islanders in 2008 who continue to collect \nunemployment benefits has also increased--14.1 percent above the number \nof the same period last year. As a result of this situation of \ndeteriorating employment and longer term unemployment, a significant \nnumber of Rhode Islanders are exhausting their benefits. They are \nreceiving their final payment. That has occurred for more than 1,900 \npeople, and that percentage is increasing also.\n  All of these numbers suggest something very obvious: more and more \npeople need unemployment insurance. More and more people are on \nunemployment longer. The economy is not responding to their needs. This \neconomy is not generating jobs, it is shredding jobs. That ultimately \nleads to the fact that the benefits run out if we do not extend \nunemployment insurance benefits.\n  Now, I think that is something we have to do. I think we have an \nobligation in this economy--which is getting worse, not better--to go \nahead and provide extended unemployment benefits. By the way, these \nbenefits are one of the best stimulus programs we have because the \nproportion of the money that is expended that gets reinvested quickly--\nrespent in the economy--is significantly higher than other programs.\n  I was pleased the Senate passed and the President signed into law the \nEconomic Stimulus Act in February. I voted for this package. It will \nprovide tax rebate checks. They are on their way out to many families \nacross the country. But given the historically high unemployment in \nRhode Island and in other parts of the country, I believe we need to do \nmuch more. This is a national problem. It needs attention. That is why \nI believe we have to extend unemployment benefits. In those States that \nare hit hard by this economic crisis, individuals should be eligible \nfor benefits for an additional 13 weeks and another 13 weeks of \nemergency benefits in States where the unemployment rate is \nexceptionally high.\n  I pressed, as so many did, for inclusion of these extended \nunemployment insurance benefits last February, and I commend my \ncolleagues who have fought also for this benefit, including Senators \nKennedy and Durbin and Stabenow.\n  As I indicated, many economists have also pointed to the extent of \nunemployment benefits as not only something that helps the individual, \nbut it provides further stimulus for our economy. An extension of these \nbenefits provides a very high rate of return on the money expended, \ngenerating approximately $1.64 in gross domestic product per dollar \ninvested in this program. This is especially helpful when we are \nlooking for ways to get the economy moving again.\n  We get news each day of declining economic statistics. The last \nnotice of our gross domestic product for the last quarter was a very \nunimpressive .6 percent. We need urgent action to move the economy. We \nneed urgent action to help families who are struggling. They have \nworked. They have worked hard, and they are running out of their \nbenefits. We can't run out on them.\n  That is why we need an economic stimulus package that will not only \nrecognize obligations overseas, but we will recognize obligations at \nhome. I hope we will enact a very robust extension of unemployment \nbenefits for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                                Ethanol\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate hearing my colleague from \nRhode Island. I am standing here thinking: Thank goodness we have \nethanol. Without ethanol--we are supplying 8 percent of our fuel \nneeds--it would drive up gasoline prices another 15 percent. I am \ncertainly pleased we have that.\n  We had a hearing in the Joint Economic Committee today on the price \nof corn and its impact on food prices. It is interesting from the \nstandpoint that economists are putting it in front of us that a 40-\npercent increase in corn prices would only lead to a 1.3-percent \nincrease in the price of food, and that is because corn goes into a \nwhole bunch of different substances. Thankfully, with the corn-based \nethanol we have, we are holding gasoline prices down approximately 15 \npercent.\n  A Merrill Lynch analyst estimated oil and gasoline prices would be 15 \npercent higher, or $4.14 a gallon at today's prices, if biofuel \nproducers weren't increasing their output. That is significant in this \nmarketplace. Thankfully, we have that.\n  I also note that on wheat prices something is significant in Kansas. \nWe have had a fall of $4 a bushel in the price of wheat since January, \nfrom $12 a bushel to $8 a bushel. Plus, in a loaf of bread, you \nprobably have 10 cents' worth of wheat. I hope they would say the farm \nis not the problem in the system.\n  Our oil prices are high and we need to hold them down. Part of the \nanswer to that is domestic production--more oil and gas production in \nthe United States but also biofuels. That is not the reason I came to \nthe floor to speak. It was a good use of time to be able to put that in \nthe Record, though, because we are going to debate, apparently, the \nrole of biofuels in the economy and around the world. I wanted to note \nit has a positive impact.\n  Mr. President, I will speak on the FAA reauthorization bill. I thank \nthe chairman and ranking member of the relevant committees for bringing \nto the floor a balanced FAA reauthorization bill. It takes into account \nthe needs of the air traffic control system and pays for them and \ndistributes that in a fair manner.\n  I am not pleased we are not able to move the bill forward. I wish it \nwasn't loaded up with extraneous provisions but, rather, that it would \nstay with the FAA.\n  I am particularly happy to see the bill contains no user fees for the \ngeneral aviation industry. It would have placed an inordinate burden on \nwhat has been and continues to be a thriving American industry, a true \ndomestic manufacturing success story. I might note to people here and \nthose watching, we are recruiting for jobs. We need people in this \nindustry. We have a number of manufacturing jobs in my State. I have \ntraveled around and they are saying we need more people coming in to \nwork. Some in Hays, KS, were telling me they need a thousand people for \njobs they have.\n  The aircraft industry is recruiting individuals and, hopefully, we \ncan keep that moving forward with a good FAA reauthorization bill. I \nthink it helps the industry further if you don't put a tax on the \nindustry; it will hurt it. This is a domestic industry, and we need to \ntake care of it.\n  Importantly, however, this bill provides for the needed upgrade of \nour Nation's air traffic control system, which has been outdated for \nmany years and the technology is outpaced by many countries around the \nworld. That should not be the case.\n  Aviation and manufacturing are very important to my State. We have \nfive major aviation companies located there, including Cessna, Hawker \nBeechcraft, Bombardier Learjet, Spirit AeroSystems, and Boeing \nIntegrated Defense Systems.\n  The aviation industry has a huge ripple effect. Every manufacturing \njob\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\ncreated adds 2.9 other jobs. It is a vibrant industry that, for the \nfirst time this past year, exported more of its product than it sold \ndomestically. This is the first time we have been able to do that.\n  However, I wish to note some disturbing trends on things I think we \nneed to attack so we don't lose this domestic industry. This is one \nthat a lot of people in the world are trying to get a big piece of. \nHonda is coming into the aviation manufacturing sector, and others are \ncoming into it. It has high-paying manufacturing jobs of a key product \nused around the world.\n  In 1985, the United States produced 80 percent of the world's new \naircraft. This past year, that number was down to 60 percent--from 80 \nto 60 percent. There is increasing competition, and I hope we can \naddress this trend as we move forward. To that end, I intend to offer \nan amendment to the bill that would create a blue-ribbon commission of \nexperts in aviation manufacturing to study the current trends in the \nindustry and recommend ways in which we, as a Government, can respond \nto those trends and ensure the vibrancy of this important commercial \nsector.\n  Parenthetically, one of the things we should not be doing is \nexporting our aviation defense jobs--such as sending the major tanker \ncontract to Europe and to Airbus, rather than having it done in the \nUnited States. This is a major battle that will engulf this Congress--\nwhether that $40 billion contract, that the base plane should be an \nAirbus plane, made primarily in Europe, or if the base plane should be \na plane primarily made in the United States. It is a key part of the \nlong-term trends of this industry, and we are already losing a lot of \nthat, even as the industry continues to do well and is exporting well. \nWe are not maintaining the market share we have had internationally \nbecause the Europeans, through government subsidies, are buying into \nthis, and other countries are following as well.\n  I think as we look for what can help support our overall exports in \nour economy, aircraft sales can continue to be that. Presently, they \nprovide a $56 billion trade surplus for our country. We sold $76 \nbillion in airplanes and parts to foreign buyers. I think we need to \nwatch and I think we need to be very aggressive to protect and see that \nthis industry grows. One of the needed things is the FAA \nreauthorization program. We need a modern air traffic control system, \nand we need to have a fee structure that doesn't penalize general \naviation.\n  There is one final note. One of my colleagues from Missouri is \ntalking about bringing up an amendment that I think would have some \npositive impact on a repair and maintenance program but would have in \nit some features--if it continues in the way I have seen it--that could \nharm our aviation industry domestically. If that amendment comes up, we \nare going to look very critically at it, with the possibility of \nputting forward second-degree amendments to make sure we don't \nunintentionally harm the domestic U.S. aviation industry.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Military Housing\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there is a colossal waste of \ntaxpayers' money that is occurring at Patrick Air Force Base in the \nState of Florida near my home of Melbourne, FL. Happily, the Senate \nArmed Services Committee has addressed the issue to try to expose the \nspotlight on the problem to get the U.S. Air Force to come clean as to \nwhat has happened in this huge fiasco of waste of taxpayers' money.\n  It is born out of the privatization of housing for military families. \nThroughout the country, there has been some success at other military \nbases, but on a particular contractor, a contractor who got the \ncontract to build housing for the Air Force on four Air Force bases, \nincluding Patrick Air Force Base and three others in other places such \nas Georgia and Arkansas, the contractor went belly up and now, in order \nto try to keep some semblance of housing being built, what is happening \nis the Air Force now wants to use all of the land that is supposed to \nbe for housing at Patrick Air Force Base as the equity to build the \nhouses on the other bases in three other States.\n  You will be surprised when I tell you how bad this is. There were 300 \nacres on the barrier island south of Patrick Air Force Base. This is in \nthe town of Satellite Beach in Florida. It is near Cape Canaveral and \nthe Cape Canaveral Air Force station. The 300 acres were basically \ngiven by the Air Force to a joint venture, a corporation, that included \nthis developer that ultimately went bust. The deal was so bad that the \nAir Force agrees, of the 300 acres, they are going to outright give 100 \nacres to the developer. The developer goes off and sells it for \nsomething like $13 million or $15 million and pockets the cash. On the \nremaining 200 acres the developer is supposed to build 550 new homes \nfor airmen and their families and commensurately tear down the old \ndilapidated housing that had been there for several decades.\n  The developer only builds 163 houses and then stops, and all these \nother old dwellings are there, of which the developer has the authority \nto rent on the market, and since they are run down, almost slum-like \nconditions, you can imagine the kind of tenants you are now getting \nliving next to Air Force families.\n  The Air Force's idea of rescuing this is to say we are going to take \nthat remaining 200 acres, we are going to give it to a new developer, \nand that equity is going to help that developer build additional \nhouses, but not at Patrick, no, in these three other States.\n  So Patrick Air Force Base and our Air Force families who thought they \nwere going to get 550 new homes now only have 163 homes sitting next to \nslum dwellings, and the Air Force is going to give away the rest of \nthis 200 acres?\n  Well, something smells awfully fishy. Fortunately, this has come to \nthis Senator's attention. I am happy to say I had to strain and grunt a \nlittle bit to get my point of view across to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee yesterday in a markup, but when the test came on a recorded \nvote, it was 22 to 0 in favor of the amendment that would require the \nAir Force to do a cost-benefit study before they can transfer the \nproperty. That is the policy set forth in the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  I want to say a word to the U.S. Air Force: No, technically, you \ndon't have to pay attention because legally you can go on and transfer \nthat property now because our Defense authorization bill is not law. It \nhas only been passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But it \nis going to be law once it gets through the House and the Senate and \ngoes to the President for signature.\n  I strongly suggest to the U.S. Air Force, and I am memorializing \nthese comments in a letter to the Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary \nWynne: Withhold, forbear on any transfer of the title to a new \ndeveloper utilizing that very valuable asset of barrier island, \noceanfront land until you do the cost-benefit analysis so we can bring \nthis out into the full light of day and we will know how we can best \nprotect the taxpayers' investment.\n  We want to serve the U.S. airmen and their families, we want to serve \nthe U.S. taxpayers and their families, and the best way to do that is \nget this story out in the open with this cost-benefit analysis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The distinguished \nSenator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in the last several weeks in a number of \nvenues, I have met with hundreds, in fact thousands, of Vermonters, and \nto nobody's great surprise, the issue that is uppermost on their minds \nis the very high price of gas and the price of oil. I know that is true \nin all 50 States in this country and in thousands of communities. It is \nespecially true in rural States because in rural States, especially \ncold-weather States, it is not uncommon for people to travel 50 miles \nto their jobs and then 50 miles back. If you drive 100 miles to work, \nthe mileage runs up.\n  I should mention, I know it probably didn't snow in Florida, but it \ndid snow\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\nin Vermont. We had a small amount of snow. That simply indicates that \npeople know when it gets cold in Vermont it gets very cold. We have a \nlot of elderly people right now wondering how they are going to heat \ntheir homes next winter. We have a combination of working people in a \nrural State--this is true all over rural America--paying outrageously \nhigh prices in order to get to work and, in colder weather States, \npeople very worried about whether they can stay warm next winter.\n  The arithmetic is not really hard to figure out. If you put 25,000 \nmiles on your car going to work every year and you are paying a buck \nmore than you used to and you get 25 miles per gallon on your car, that \nis a thousand dollars. If you make $30,000 a year and you get a 3-\npercent raise, that is 900 bucks. So all of your raise, all of your \ncost-of-living increase on your job is now in your gas tank. That is \nhappening to millions of American workers. Then these same workers are \npaying more for health care, are paying more for food, more for \neducation, which, added together, is why the middle class in America is \ncollapsing.\n  For many years, as good-paying jobs have gone to China, as our people \nare struggling to make ends meet, people have been worried about how \nthey are going to survive economically. On top of that, we now have the \nforeclosure crisis and we have the escalating cost of gas and oil in \nthis country, which then leads some 80 percent of the people in this \ncountry to believe this country is going in the wrong direction, and \none wonders, really, what the other 20 percent are thinking. Clearly, \nfor the middle class in this country, we are facing a very serious \nproblem.\n  I did an interesting thing a few weeks ago in Vermont. We were having \nsome town meetings on the economy. We brought a professor from Harvard \nLaw School, one of the best writers in America on the economy. Her name \nis Elizabeth Warren.\n  In preparation for that meeting, we sent out an e-mail to people in \nmy State and said: Tell me what is going on in terms of the collapse of \nthe middle class and how that impacts your life. Frankly, we expected a \nfew dozen people to reply. As of today, we have received over 700 \nresponses. This is doubly surprising because in Vermont people are \nquite reticent, not wanting to talk about personal aspects of their \nlives--700 people. I recommend you and Members of the Senate read some \nof these responses. They are up on our Web site. The tales people are \ntelling are heartbreaking, they are poignant, they come from the heart, \nand there are hundreds of them.\n  Let me just read a few segments of some of the letters we have \nreceived and how they touch on gas prices and the general collapse of \nthe middle class in our country.\n\n       We are hard-working people. We want to pay our bills. We \n     want to keep what we worked so hard for. The constantly \n     increasing cost of gas, oil, groceries are drowning us. I \n     hear the same thing from most of our friends on a daily \n     basis--hanging on by a thread, robbing Peter to pay Paul. It \n     is such a stressful way to live. There are days when I get so \n     discouraged I just want to call the banks and say just take \n     it all. I don't have it in me to fight for it anymore.\n\n  This is a family in the State of Vermont.\n  Here is another one. This comes from an elderly couple in Vermont:\n\n       My wife and I are both 77, retired and living on a very \n     limited income. We live in the country, and driving the 60-\n     plus miles round trip for shopping and health care has become \n     a financial hardship.\n\n  Traveling 60 miles for shopping and health care has become a \nfinancial hardship.\n\n       Even though we drive a car that gets 35 miles to the \n     gallon, a tankful of gas eats up an awfully large amount of \n     our disposable income.\n       That is true all over America. You have older people who \n     get in their car, they go out to buy groceries, they go to \n     the doctor, and suddenly they are finding that just getting \n     into their car and going where they have gone their whole \n     lives is now a very expensive proposition, in this case \n     eating up a large part of their disposable income.\n\n  Another family writes:\n\n       I live in the Northeast Kingdom, which is a very rural area \n     in the northern part of Vermont near the Canadian border, and \n     I have to drive a 30-mile round trip to work in Morrisville \n     and even farther to Stowe, where most of the jobs are now. \n     With the gas prices high and most employers paying $8.50 to \n     maybe $10 per hour, you spend much of your paycheck traveling \n     to and from work.\n\n  In other words, in the real world, there are millions of people in \nrural Vermont and all over this country and in Florida who are making \n$8.50, $9, $10 an hour, and if you are paying $3.50 a gallon to get to \nwork and you have to travel any kind of distance, what do you have \nleft? Not a lot.\n  The average price for a gallon of gas recently hit a recordbreaking \n$3.62 a gallon, which is more than double what it was when President \nBush first took office. The price of diesel fuel is now averaging over \n$4.17 a gallon, which is more than $1.36 higher than it was just a year \nago. The price of oil is now $110 a barrel. I think these prices say it \nall. They tell every Member or should tell every Member of Congress \nwhat the American people understand, which is that we have a national \nemergency on our hands. If we do not act boldly and rapidly to lower \ngas and oil prices, the economic situation for millions of working \nfamilies will only deteriorate even further.\n  What we are talking about is not just the worker who can't afford to \nfill up his gas tank, it is the entire economy. It is small businesses, \nit is farmers, it is truckers. The trucking industry is convoluting \nright now with these high prices. It is the increased cost of \ngroceries, it is tourism. People come to Vermont and people go to \nFlorida to enjoy vacations. They are not going to be able to drive \nthere with these prices. In fact, what we are looking at is a major \neconomic crisis impacting every segment of our economy.\n  Sadly, as in so many other areas regarding the needs of ordinary \nAmericans, when it comes to gas prices the Bush-Cheney administration \nis just not there. This is an administration where, in area after area, \nyou can count on them to stand up with the large multinational \ncorporations. You can count on them protecting the wealthiest people in \nthe country. Now, when the middle class is in crisis, when people \ncannot afford the rapidly rising costs of gas and oil, they are nowhere \nto be found.\n  What is particularly interesting, of course, as most people know, is \nboth President Bush and Vice President Cheney have backgrounds in the \noil industry. That is what they did before they assumed the Presidency \nand Vice Presidency.\n  Ironically--and this would really be almost funny if it weren't so \nsad--when President Bush ran for office in the year 2000, he touted his \nexperience in oil as one of the reasons he should be elected President. \nHe knew the oil industry. He would make the energy situation better \nbased on his experience.\n  Here is a direct quote from what candidate Bush said in the year \n2000, in his first campaign, regarding how he would improve our \nrelations with some of the OPEC countries. This is what he said:\n\n       I will use the capital that my administration will earn \n     with the Kuwaitis or the Saudis and convince them to open the \n     spigot.\n\n  That is what candidate George Bush said in the year 2000.\n  Then he said, also in that campaign:\n\n       The President of the United States must jawbone OPEC \n     Members to lower the price.\n\n  End of quote from candidate George Bush in the year 2000. That was 8 \nyears ago. When then-candidate Bush made those comments, the price of \noil was $30 a barrel. Today, after 7\\1/2\\ years of the Bush-Cheney \nadministration, the price of oil is now $110 a barrel.\n  It seems to me that it is imperative that among many other things, \nmany other actions Congress must take, one of them is to do what \nPresident Bush talked about in 2000 but never did, and that is we must \ndemand that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait produce the kind of oil they can. \nWe must also move forward as a Congress to address the reality that \nOPEC is a cartel. That is their reason for existence. A cartel is \nformed in collusion in order, in this case, to prevent production of \noil, control the production of oil in order to artificially keep prices \nhigh.\n  This Congress must demand two things: that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \nand other OPEC members increase their production so we can lower \nprices, and second, we must be aggressive in telling the World Trade \nOrganization that OPEC is a cartel; it must be disbanded.\n  Back to President Bush.\n  In 2004, when Saudi Arabia led the fight within OPEC to cut \nproduction\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\nand raise prices, the Miami Herald reported that President Bush \n``refused to lean on the oil cartel'' and ``refused to even personally \nlobby OPEC leaders to change their minds.''\n  It is true that last January President Bush did visit Saudi Arabia to \nask OPEC nations to increase production, but guess what. The Associated \nPress reported that President Bush's request was ``ignored.''\n  In 2000, as a candidate, he told us he was going to open the spigot, \nhe was going to get them to produce more oil, but that, of course, has \nnot happened.\n  Last March, after meeting with Saudi Arabia's oil minister, the Wall \nStreet Journal reported that ``Vice President Dick Cheney suggested \nthere is little more Saudi Arabia can do to increase oil production and \nrelieve price pressures in global markets.'' But Stephen Brown, the \nenergy economist at the Federal Reserve, has disputed this. He has said \nthat ``Saudi Arabia is restraining its production, probably by about \n1.8 million barrels a day. And OPEC is probably holding back 2.3 \nmillion barrels a day altogether.'' In other words, despite all of the \nrhetoric from President Bush, all of his experience in the oil \nindustry, the reality is that Saudi Arabia is not producing the kind of \noil it should be producing and we are hurting as a result of that.\n  Many of us are tired of waiting for the Bush administration to act. \nCongress must act. There are a number of things we must do in order to \nlower the price of gas and oil in this country. One of them is to \ndemand that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other OPEC countries start \nproducing the quantity of oil we know they can produce.\n  That is one thing we can do, but it is certainly not enough. The \nnational oil emergency we currently face in our country and in many \nother countries demands both short-term and long-term solutions.\n  Long term, I think many people in the Senate and the vast majority of \nthe American people understand that we must break our dependency on \nfossil fuel. We must move to energy efficiency. We must move to such \nsustainable energies as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and others. \nIn my view, the potential is absolutely staggering in terms of the \namount of energy we can produce through sustainable energy and the \namount of energy we can save through energy efficiency.\n  Not only that, obviously we need to significantly improve public \ntransportation. Our railroads today lag far behind Europe and Japan. In \ndoing that, building a broad mass-transportation system, we can break \nour dependency on the automobile.\n  In terms of automobiles, people are just now beginning--and we must \nhelp them--to move to electric cars, move to hybrid plug-in cars. There \nis just enormous potential out there. Clearly, that is the long-term \nsolution of where we have to go.\n  But I sometimes hear my friends coming here and they talk about a \nlong-term solution and yet they forget about what is going on in \nAmerica today for a family making $30,000 or $40,000 a year, and maybe \nthey have two cars because they have two workers, and those people are \ngoing broke today.\n  So I do not think it is an either/or. I think we have got to be \naggressive right now in moving toward energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy, but we have also got to be aggressive today in lowering the \nprice of gas and oil. It is not an either/or. We move forward in \nparallel tracks.\n  One of the steps we have to take is to put pressure on OPEC nations \nto increase the production of oil. I think also we have got to break up \nOPEC, and let the free market work in that area. But that is only one \nof the things we have got to do.\n  Second, I believe it is absolutely imperative that we impose a \nwindfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry. The American people \ndo not understand, nor do I understand, why they are paying record-\nbreaking prices at the gas pump, while ExxonMobil has made more in \nprofits than any corporation in the history of the world for the past 2 \nconsecutive years.\n  I know ExxonMobil and their propaganda machine will no doubt explain \nit. But the average person does not believe it and the average person \nshould not believe it. ExxonMobil and the other major oil companies are \nripping off the American people. That is clear. We need a windfall \nprofits tax to address that.\n  Last year alone, ExxonMobil made $40 billion in profits, and rewarded \nits CEO Rex Tillerson with a $21 million compensation package. That is \nnothing. He is getting shortchanged, because the guy who went before \nhim, when he retired--his name was Lee Raymond--got a $400 million \nretirement package. So my suggestion to Mr. Tillerson is: Go back to \nyour board. You are getting ripped off 21 million bucks. How are you \ngoing to make it on that?\n  Here you have a company charging record-breaking prices, having given \nits former CEO a few years ago $400 million in a retirement package. \nBut ExxonMobil is not alone. Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and BP \nhave also been making out like bandits. In fact, the five largest oil \ncompanies in this country have made over $600 billion in profits since \nGeorge W. Bush has been President. Not bad, $600 billion in profits in \n7.5 years. And people in Vermont and Florida cannot afford to fill \ntheir gas tanks.\n  Last year alone, the major oil companies in the United States made \nover $155 billion in profits and, not surprisingly, those profits \ncontinue to soar. Today, ExxonMobil reported a 17-percent increase in \nprofits, totaling $10.9 billion, $10.9 billion for one quarter.\n  Earlier this week, however, BP, British Petroleum, announced a 63-\npercent increase in their profits. Shell's first quarter profits jumped \nby 25 percent to over $9 billion; one quarter, 3 months. \nConocoPhillips' profits increased by over 16 percent in the first \nquarter to over $4 billion.\n  It is hard to come up with the words to describe it, because I know, \nand I am sure you know, Mr. President, the problems middle-class people \nare facing today and what these high oil and gas prices are meaning to \nfamilies, and at the same time this is going on, these major oil \ncompanies are enjoying obscene levels of profit. With their profits, \namong many other things, they are very lavish in the kind of benefits \nand salaries they provide their CEOs. Last year, Occidental Petroleum, \none of the ``smaller'' companies, gave its CEO $34.2 million in total \ncompensation. The CEO of Anadarko Petroleum received $26 million. \nChevron's CEO made $15 million, as did ConocoPhillips' CEO. He made \n$15.1 million in compensation.\n  Let me be clear. I believe oil companies should be allowed to make a \nreasonable profit and CEOs of big oil companies should enjoy decent \ncompensation. That is a tough job and they should earn a good salary. \nBut they should not be allowed to rip off the American people at the \ngas pump, especially at this moment in our history when the middle \nclass is stressed out and in many ways collapsing.\n  The time has come to impose a windfall oil tax on those companies so \nthey cannot continue to gouge the ordinary people of our country. \nUnfortunately, however, imposing a windfall profits tax on big oil will \nnot be easy. I think we all know the reason, and that is, since 1998 \nthe oil and gas industry has spent over $616 million on lobbyists.\n  And dare I say that right now on the floors of the Senate, and on the \nfloors of the House, you have very well paid lobbyists, former \ncongressional leaders, big-time law firms, floating all over this place \nright now trying to convince Members of the House and the Senate to \nleave big oil alone. Not only have they spent, since 1998, $616 million \non lobbying; since 1990 they have spent over $213 million in campaign \ncontributions. That is the way the world goes--lobby, campaign \ncontributions from powerful multinational corporations.\n  What is the end result? Their profits are soaring and ordinary \nAmericans are hurting. The time has come, it seems to me, for the \nSenate to stand with working families all over this country, to have \nthe courage to stand up to this very powerful industry and say ``yes'' \nto a windfall profits tax and ``no'' to the continued urges of the oil \nand gas industry to pat them on the back and do nothing.\n  While it is true that oil companies and their executives are making \nmoney hand over fist, it is also true they are not the only culprits in \nthis situation. We must begin focusing on the very powerful speculators \nand hedge fund managers who have also been making obscene sums of money \nby speculating\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\non futures and driving an unregulated market up and up and up.\n  There are some people who estimate, in fact, that half of the \nincrease in oil costs is attributable to the cost of production but to \nthe speculation that takes place.\n  In my view, Congress must act to rein in greedy speculators by \nclosing what has been referred to as the Enron loophole and increasing \noversight over the energy futures industry.\n  The Enron loophole was created in 2000 as part of the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act. At the behest of Enron lobbyists, a \nprovision in this bill was inserted in the dark of night and with no \ncongressional hearings. Specifically, the Enron loophole exempts \nelectronic energy trading from Federal commodities laws. Virtually \novernight, the loophole freed over-the-counter energy trading from \nFederal oversight requirements, opening the door to excessive \nspeculation and energy price manipulation. Since the Enron loophole has \nbeen in effect, crude oil prices jumped from $33 a barrel in 2000, \nafter adjusting for inflation, to over $110 a barrel today.\n  Last January, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer estimated there is \nas much as a $57 a barrel ``speculative premium'' on the price of oil. \nIn other words, he estimates that about half of the price of a barrel \nof oil is due not to the production and distribution of that product \nbut simply to speculation.\n\n  The CEO of Marathon Oil said late last year that $100 oil is not \njustified by the physical demand in the market. In other words, those \nguys see that the price of oil is being driven up by speculation.\n  Closing the Enron loophole would subject electronic energy markets to \nproper regulatory oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation.\n  I thank Senators Levin and Feinstein. I know Senator Dorgan and \nothers have been involved in producing legislation and ideas to close \nthis loophole. We must move forward and pass that type of legislation \nas soon as possible.\n  In addition--and this is an issue where there appears to be a degree \nof bipartisan support--some of our Republican friends also agree the \nBush administration must stop the flow of oil into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, and in my view, my view, immediately release oil \nfrom this Federal stockpile to reduce gas prices.\n  This action has been taken in the past. It is not a new idea. Goldman \nSachs has estimated that continuing to fill the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve has increased gas prices at the pump by as much as 25 cents a \ngallon, and that clearly is unacceptable.\n  Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the past, under \nboth Democratic and Republican administrations has, in fact, lowered \nthe price of gas and crude oil. For example, when President Clinton \nordered the release of 30 million barrels from the SPR in 2000, the \nprice of gas fell by 14 cents a gallon in 2 weeks.\n  When President George H.W. Bush, the first President Bush, released \n13 million barrels of crude oil from the SPR in 1991, crude oil prices \ndropped by over $10 per barrel.\n  Let me conclude by saying that the issue we are dealing with today, \nin my view, is not only the high price of gas and oil. As serious as \nthat is, and as much impact as that is having on our economy, the \ndeeper issue here is the degree to which people in our country, the \nhard-working citizens of our country, will or will not continue to have \nfaith that their Government represents them.\n  It is no secret that President Bush will likely go down in history as \nperhaps the least popular President and, in my view, one of the worst \nPresidents we have ever had. But it is also true that the ratings of \nthis Congress are extraordinarily low; they are even lower than where \nPresident Bush is.\n  I think the reason for that is people are suffering terrible problems \nright now. In almost every area you can think of, this country is going \nin the wrong direction. The middle class is hurting. We talked about \noil prices, food prices, the loss of good-paying jobs, the health care \nsystem, Social Security falling apart, people are paying 25, 30 percent \ninterest rates on credit cards. People are in trouble. In a Democratic \nsociety, when people are in trouble, they look to the people whom they \nelected, to their Government, to protect their interests. They are \nlooking to Washington right now. They are looking here. They are \nhurting, and they are asking whether the Congress of the United States \nhas the courage to stand up to the very powerful financial interests \nwhich have so much influence over what goes on here.\n  So I hope very much we have the courage to once again earn the \nconfidence of the American people, that we understand the pain they are \nfeeling, and that we act properly, that we lower gas prices, that we \nlower oil prices.\n  We can do this with bold action, and we can move this country to a \nnew energy policy dealing with energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy. I think the American people want us to do that. I think that \nis, in fact, what we should do.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is really difficult for me to comprehend \nthe reasoning of my friends on the other side of the aisle. All week we \nhave done nothing. One of the most important bills that has been \nbrought before this body this year, the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization, as we speak there are thousands of airplanes going all \nacross the United States. The equipment that allows those airplanes to \ntake off and land is antiquated and way out of line for making air \ntravel in America as safe as it should be. This legislation is very \nimportant and would be good for America, good for passengers.\n  We have in this legislation the passengers bill of rights, money to \nreplace antiquated equipment. But the Republicans have stopped us from \nlegislating. We have tried virtually everything.\n  I wanted to have an orderly process, which I think is not \nunreasonable. So last night I said: We have filled the different trees \nto allow amendments, but if you want to offer one, come on. No.\n  I said: Well, give us a list of the amendments you want to offer. No. \nThey said: Bunning has an amendment. Let us see it. That went on all \nday yesterday. Finally, they told us today the subject matter of that \nparticular amendment. When I learned about the subject matter, I said \nfine. It is something about coal being changed so they can use the fuel \nfor flying airplanes. No.\n  I said: I will tell you what we will do. We will take down the tree. \nYou can offer anything you want. No.\n  We heard what they didn't like were provisions that would allow rail \nservice in this country to be updated and modernized. They didn't want \nthat. There was some language in the bill that would do something to \nhelp make highway safety paramount. Don't want that. Offer an amendment \nto take it out. No.\n  Finally, I came to the conclusion that their objection was to a \nprovision contained in the President's budget. I couldn't make up a \nstory that is more ridiculous than the one I am relating, which is the \ntruth. There is a provision in this bill that gives the State of New \nYork the final amount of $20 billion that was promised them after 9/11 \nby President Bush. That amount of money is in his budget for this year, \nwhich he gave us. I talked to the distinguished Republican leader and \nsaid: Offer an amendment to take it out. This is in the President's \nbudget. We still oppose it, is what I was told.\n  So it is obvious. The Republicans don't want to do anything to \nimprove, to modernize the Federal Aviation Administration. I hope \npeople who are within the sound of my voice think about that when they \nare flying across the country.\n  We are not going to be able to do it this year, more than likely. \nThere will be room made in the schedule by the Republicans to take up \n$170-odd billion for funding the war in Iraq from now until a year from \nthis June. With glad hands, they will all come to the Senate floor and \nspend more money in Iraq. I\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\nguess they don't want to pull the plug on spending $5,000 every second. \nMaybe they are trying to up the ante. I will have more to say about \nthis tomorrow, but it is really a disappointment.\n  This is not a victory for the Republicans to maintain the status quo, \nis it? Of course not. Would it be a big victory for the Democrats to \npass the Federal aviation reauthorization? No. It would be something \ngood for the American people. I hope the American public sees this for \nwhat it is. We Democrats are in the majority. It is a slim majority. It \nis 51 to 49. The Republicans obviously are upset over the fact that we \nare in the majority. They want the record to show that this Congress \naccomplished nothing.\n  In spite of the obstacles and their obstruction, we have still \naccomplished quite a few things. We are proud of what we have \naccomplished, considering all the hoops we had to go through to get \nwhere we did.\n  I never give up hope. I hope there will be a new day in Washington \nstarting next week. One way we can have a new day: We give all the \nblame to the Republicans in the Senate. They certainly are the ones who \nare on the firing lines. But do you know how much it would mean if the \nman down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would call the Republican leader \nand say our country needs this FAA reauthorization? We need it. The \nPresident could call down here and break this logjam, as he could have \ndone on all the other legislation they have stopped. How in the world \ndo these people go to bed at night not worrying about the air traffic \nsystem falling apart, because it is going to. It is in desperate shape.\n  Out in this parking lot there are new automobiles that have GPS \nsystems in them. That is better equipment than the FAA has moving all \nthe airplanes around the country.\n\n\n                            Cloture Motions\n\n  I send a cloture motion to the desk to the substitute amendment No. \n4627.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

KILLIAN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am saddened to learn that Mr. Johnny H. \nKillian has passed away. Mr. Killian was a highly regarded, highly \nadmired, and highly utilized specialist in American public law at the \nCongressional Research Service. For more than four decades, he advised \nMembers of Congress and our staffs on constitutional issues.\n  He had an encyclopedic knowledge of constitutional principles that \nwas based on his astute mind, his many years of unbiased research, and \nhis keen analytical skills. With his prodigious memory, he could \nprovide guidance and cite, in detail, case law pertaining to nearly all \nof the key constitutional issues that came before the Senate. My staff \nand I depended on him for assistance and advice on a number of issues, \nincluding the line-item veto, the War Powers Act, eminent domain, \nprayer in schools, federal funding for education, and privacy \nprotections under the fourth amendment.\n  I always appreciated the level of dedication and pride Mr. Killian \ntook in his work. He was never too busy to answer the phone or return a \ncall. He worked tirelessly to make certain that lawmakers and their \nstaffs stayed always attuned to the original intent of the Framers. \nWhen presented with a question or a request, he responded quickly and \nwith an amazing grasp of specifics, and with thorough information, even \nwhen presented with an unusual inquiry late in the evening, on a \nweekend, or even during a holiday or when he was ill at home.\n  All of this professionalism was enhanced by the fact that Mr. Killian \nwas such a pleasant person with whom to work. He was soft-spoken, \ncourteous, and a dedicated public servant. He was a man of incredible \npatience and kindness, with a warm sense of humor.\n  Mr. Killian will be truly missed by his Senate family, but his legacy \nas an academic, and a researcher, blessed with an extraordinary legal \nmind will be with us for a long time. Senators will remember him for a \nlifelong, commitment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I extend my most heartfelt condolences to his family \nand many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3689-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3689-S3690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ROTUNDA COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today as this Congress commemorated our \nNational Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance for 2008 in the \nRotunda of the Capitol of our Nation, Joshua B. Bolten, the Chief of \nStaff of President Bush, delivered the keynote address.\n  I note that Josh Bolten noted he will travel with President Bush \nlater this month to Israel to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the \nfounding of Israel, which he pointed out occurred just 3 years after \nthe Holocaust.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Bolten's remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [Remarks by Joshua B. Bolten, May 1, 2008]\n\n                          Days of Remembrance\n\n                    (United States Capitol Rotunda)\n\n       I am deeply honored to be at this podium today, to speak \n     about anniversaries and the moral obligation of memory.\n       Many who have stood here before me have spoken from their \n     own memory, telling their most personal of stories--the years \n     of suffering, the loss of loved ones, survival and the \n     anguish of haunting memories. I have no such stories to tell. \n     My Jewish grandparents left Europe before the Holocaust, \n     bestowing on my parents the gift of being born in this land \n     of freedom.\n       But I do stand here as the proud son of a brave young \n     American soldier, decorated for the valor that led to his \n     capture by Nazi forces. Imprisoned in a German POW camp for \n     two years, he refused to hide the dog tag that bore the \n     letter H (for Hebrew). Twenty-five years later, working at \n     the White House near the end of a distinguished career of \n     national service, my father shepherded the work of the \n     President's Commission on the Holocaust and helped bring to \n     fruition the\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\n     first of these National Days of Remembrance ceremonies, and \n     ultimately the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum itself.\n       We gather at this 29th Days of Remembrance ceremony in a \n     year and season of grim anniversaries. It has been almost \n     exactly 75 years since the Nazis organized a massive \n     nationwide boycott of Jewish businesses that inflamed anti-\n     Semitism throughout Germany. 70 years since Kristallnacht, \n     the night of brutality that, as Fred Zeidman eloquently \n     described, exposed to the world Nazi intentions toward the \n     Jews. 65 years since the Warsaw uprising, as Joel Geiderman \n     reminded us, the best known of many episodes of heroic \n     resistance.\n       Passover, which ended just a few days ago, commemorates the \n     liberation of Jews from slavery in Egypt thousands of years \n     ago. So 65, 70, even 75 years in our history is not so long a \n     time. But it is almost a lifetime. Had Mordecai Anielewicz, \n     the young commander of the Warsaw uprising, survived, he \n     would be almost 90 today.\n       With the passage of time, the Rescuers, the Liberators, and \n     the Survivors--like those whom we're blessed to have with us \n     today--are naturally dwindling in numbers. Earlier this year, \n     we lost the beloved Congressman Tom Lantos (so well \n     remembered just now by Ambassador Meridor), whose experiences \n     as a Survivor gave extra gravity to his powerful calls to \n     conscience.\n       We are transitioning from living memory to historical \n     memory, and that places a great burden of responsibility on \n     the rest of us. As the witnesses to the witnesses, we carry \n     the moral obligation of memory.\n       And what is that obligation? Surely it is more than fixing \n     blame--for just as the generation of Survivors, Rescuers and \n     Liberators dwindles, so must the Perpetrators, Collaborators \n     and Bystanders. But why must we remember in such painful \n     detail?\n       In his introduction to the presidential commission report \n     that my father helped shepherd, Elie Wiesel gave an eloquent \n     answer: First, Wiesel wrote, ``we cannot grant the killers a \n     posthumous victory. Not only did they humiliate and \n     assassinate their victims, they wanted also to destroy their \n     memory. They killed them twice, reducing them to ashes and \n     then denying their deed.''\n       A Nazi guard once told Simon Wiesenthal that, in time, no \n     one would believe his account of what he saw. Many in this \n     room have devoted a lifetime to proving that prediction \n     wrong. Yet there are still those who challenge the facts \n     surrounding the Holocaust, or even brazenly deny its reality. \n     Whatever form it takes--from cartoons in a newspaper owned by \n     the Syrian government, to statements by leaders of Hamas, to \n     an international conference hosted by the President of Iran--\n     we must stand against every attempt at denial. We have an \n     obligation to condemn these lies for what they are--and \n     remind people of the truth.\n       Wiesel's second explanation for the moral obligation of \n     memory is that ``we cannot deny the victims the fulfillment \n     of their last wish . . . to bear witness.'' This wish is \n     captured in Emanuel Ringelblum's ``Oneg Shabbat'' project, \n     which Sara Bloomfield just described. When we read the \n     victims' stories in those long-buried milk cans, we relive \n     their suffering. We honor their defiance. And we fulfill \n     their request never to be forgotten.\n       Third, and most important, Wiesel wrote, ``we must remember \n     . . . for the sake of our own humanity,'' because \n     ``indifference to the victims would result, inevitably, in \n     indifference to ourselves.''\n       We saw this indifference on shameful display at the Evian \n     Conference, which also marks its 70th anniversary this year. \n     At that conference, powerful nations gathered in the heart of \n     Europe to consider the plight of Jews in Nazi Germany. Yet \n     they mustered only excuses for inaction, refusing to make the \n     changes in refugee laws that could have rescued millions of \n     Jews with a simple stamp on a paper. Five years later, with \n     the full horror of the Holocaust primed to unfold, nations \n     again gathered in Bermuda. This time, they produced a mere \n     joint statement--along with a bureaucratic report that \n     arrived long after the killing machines of Auschwitz and \n     Treblinka were operating at full force.\n       Tragically, the international community has repeated this \n     indifference in the decades since the Holocaust. In Rwanda \n     and elsewhere, the innocent have paid the price.\n       Our generation has an opportunity--and a moral obligation--\n     to be different. When we say, ``Never again,'' we must mean \n     it. Not in our moment of history and responsibility. We must \n     call evil by its name, and confront it with purpose and \n     courage. We in government service especially must challenge \n     those who have become enamored with process that substitutes \n     for action and who shrink from the hard choices.\n       This commitment is being tested in Darfur. President Bush \n     is the only world leader to call the killing there \n     ``genocide.'' He has ordered sanctions on those responsible \n     for violence. And he has pledged to provide training and \n     equipment to help African troops deploy to Darfur. Yet \n     America remains too lonely in this effort. In the past three \n     years, the United Nations Human Rights Council has passed \n     more than six times as many resolutions against Israel as it \n     has against Sudan. And despite repeated urging, the UN \n     peacekeeping force has yet to deploy. It is not too late to \n     set this right.\n       In answering Wiesel's three calls--to deny the killers a \n     posthumous victory . . . to fulfill the last wishes of the \n     victims . . . and to affirm our own humanity--we uphold the \n     moral obligation of memory. And in our responsibility as \n     witnesses to the witnesses, we are blessed to have remarkable \n     assets.\n       First, of course, are the Survivors themselves, who \n     comprehend evil with a clarity that comes only from direct \n     experience. As they share their stories, they do more than \n     deepen our knowledge of history--they advance the cause of \n     justice.\n       We are also blessed with the efforts of individuals like \n     Father Patrick Debois. Going door to door, Father Debois has \n     collected the testimony of more than 700 witnesses and \n     bystanders to the Nazi terror in Ukraine. He has identified \n     the burial sites of countless victims shot execution-style in \n     what has been called the ``holocaust of bullets.'' Thanks to \n     this good priest's work, names and stories are replacing the \n     cold anonymity of mass graves. And witnesses who have held \n     these memories in their hearts for 60 years are finding \n     healing. Father Debois, we are honored by your presence \n     today.\n       For generations to come, a lasting source of learning and \n     memory will be the museums. In the past year, I have had the \n     privilege to visit three with the President--Yad Vashem in \n     Israel, the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center in Rwanda, and \n     the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum here in Washington. These \n     museums commemorate loss in distinct ways. Yet they all \n     recognize that genocide is possible only by the denial of \n     individuality. And they recognize that the best way to \n     restore humanity is to retell the victims' stories, one by \n     one.\n       At Yad Vashem, exhibits commemorate not only the victims \n     lost--but also the lives lived. They show loving homes and \n     cherished possessions--reminders of the richness of humanity \n     stolen away.\n       At the Kigali Center, a communal grave holds nearly a \n     quarter million victims, and that number continues to grow as \n     Rwandan authorities gather remains from the 1994 genocide. \n     God only knows--literally, only God knows--the identities of \n     those who rest on the site. Yet inside the museum, exhibits \n     display vivid Polaroid photographs of individual victims, \n     most of them children. Beneath the photos are descriptions of \n     simple things like a favorite sport or food--personal details \n     that capture the uniqueness of each unfinished life.\n       At the U.S. Holocaust Museum, each visitor receives the \n     identity card of a victim--the tragedy of the Holocaust on a \n     personal scale. Already, 27 million visitors there have \n     pursued their obligation of memory. Now and always, the \n     witnesses will far outnumber the victims.\n       This year marks the 15th anniversary of the Holocaust \n     Museum. Later this month, I will travel with President Bush \n     to commemorate another proud anniversary--the 60th \n     anniversary of the founding of Israel. The birth of Israel \n     just three years after the Holocaust reminds us that the last \n     word need not be death and destruction. When Air Force One \n     touches down at Ben-Gurion airport, we will see the American \n     and Israeli flags waving side-by-side. And we will hear two \n     national anthems: the Star Spangled Banner, and ``Hatikvah'' \n     . . . ``The Hope.''\n       Hope is at the center of Israel's existence. It is at the \n     center of the Jewish faith. And it is at the center of our \n     task during these Days of Remembrance. The Holocaust shows \n     that evil is real--but hope, goodness, and courage are \n     eternal. When we carry this truth in our hearts, we uphold \n     the moral obligation of memory. And we summon the strength to \n     meet our solemn pledge: Never again. Not in our moment of \n     history and responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3690-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3690-S3691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF FRANKLIN D. BARCA\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to \nFranklin D. Barca, a loyal member of my staff who has chosen to retire \nafter being a public servant to our country for more than four decades. \nA graduate of Braintree High School in Braintree, MA, and Northeastern \nUniversity, Frank served a full career as a civilian within the \nDepartment of Defense at locations such as the U.S. Army Natick Soldier \nSystems Center, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the Pentagon. To my \ngood fortune, Frank was assigned to my office as a detailee in 1997 and \nlater agreed to join my staff as my military legislative assistant, a \nposition he has dutifully held ever since.\n  Serving as my adviser on national security issues, Frank's greatest \nlegacy will be his work as the clerk of the caucus created to save the \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard during the 2005 round of base realignment and \nclosure. His tireless work ethic, attention to detail, and leadership \nwere instrumental in our efforts to show the Department of Defense that \nPortsmouth truly is the gold standard of the Navy. During his work on \nBRAC, Frank was affectionately given the nickname of ``The General.''\n  Walking through the Capitol with Frank you understand his love and \nrespect for history. Whether it's showing someone Lincoln's catafalque \nfor the first time or telling stories of the District during the Civil \nWar, Frank\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nseems to have a bit of trivia for every corner of this building. In the \nwords of another man whom the states of New Hampshire and Massachusetts \nlay claim, Daniel Webster, ``The dignity of history consists in \nreciting events with truth and accuracy, and in presenting human agents \nand their actions in an interesting and instructive form. The first \nelement in history, therefore, is truthfulness; and this truthfulness \nmust be displayed in a concrete form.'' I will certainly miss Frank's \nadvice, straightforwardness, and willingness to go the extra mile to \nhelp me serve the people of New Hampshire.\n  I hope that Frank Barca will enjoy his retirement. It is an \nachievement that he certainly has earned. I know that Frank will get \npleasure from being able to spend more time with his wife Elaine, his \ndaughters, and his four grandchildren Katie, Meredith, Michael, and \nSarah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3691-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3691-S3692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAUL BRUHN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the people who has done the most to \nprotect so much in Vermont is Paul Bruhn. We Vermonters know that Paul, \nas the executive director of the Preservation Trust, has done an \nenormous service by leading conservation efforts to save the very best \nof our State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full article by Virginia Lindauer \nSimmon, from the April edition of Business People Vermont, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From Business People Vermont, Apr. 2008]\n\nPast Perfect: Guiding the Conservation of One of the Country's 11 Most \n                           Endangered Places\n\n                     (By Virginia Lindauer Simmon)\n\n       Paul Bruhn hasn't strayed far from his roots. What he has \n     done is continue to tweak them, to the benefit of us all.\n       Bruhn is executive director of the Preservation Trust of \n     Vermont, which he helped to found in 1980. The list of \n     properties the organization has helped since then--more than \n     1,500--reads like a compendium of places that make Vermont . \n     . . well, Vermont.\n       The organization's story is much broader than preserving \n     historic structures. The work involves, for example, a \n     partnership with Mad River Glen to reconstruct and \n     rehabilitate the single lift chair, an icon of skiing in \n     Vermont; helping people in Starksboro establish a village \n     store--so crucial to community life in small towns and \n     villages; acquiring a geologic site in Isle LaMotte; \n     encouraging large-scale retailers such as Wal-Mart to \n     consider building smaller-scale stores in Vermont's \n     downtowns; underwriting publications that speak to the \n     Vermont way of life; aiding community-supported agriculture \n     or a group in Hardwick that, says Bruhn, with contagious \n     enthusiasm, ``figured out that if you're going to have a good \n     community and downtown revitalization project, you need a \n     great small restaurant and pub that serves the entire \n     community.''\n       Bruhn's passion for his work makes perfect sense, \n     especially when it comes to downtowns. He grew up in \n     Burlington, where his family owned Bruhn Office Equipment on \n     Church Street--in the same building where Bruhn's office is \n     today. ``I used to hang out this same window when I was a \n     little kid watching parades,'' he says.\n       After graduating from Burlington High School in 1965, Bruhn \n     studied at Fairleigh Dickinson and the University of Vermont. \n     ``I left without graduating, and just before they were \n     probably going to throw me out,'' he says with a grin.\n       At the time, he was working for the Suburban List community \n     newspaper and its founders, Proctor and Ruth Page. ``I \n     started out selling advertising at $25 a week,'' he says, \n     chuckling. ``I was a reporter and took care of the paper when \n     they were on vacation. They really gave me my start in \n     life.''\n       That start included backing him when he launched Chittenden \n     Magazine, a monthly publication he poured his life into from \n     1969 to '73, including mortgaging his house for living \n     expenses. ``Proc and Ruth backed it for four years, and it \n     was arguably an artistic success and not a real financial \n     success.'' He laughs heartily. ``That was my real `college' \n     education.''\n       When the magazine folded, Bruhn found work with his friend \n     Patrick Leahy, the state's attorney for Chittenden County, as \n     a consumer fraud investigator. A year later, he was tapped to \n     run Leahy's campaign for the U.S. Senate.\n       ``That, obviously, was an amazing experience. I went down \n     to Washington and served as his chief of staff for four \n     years. I was 27, and fortunately lots of people took me under \n     their wing and helped me through the intricacies of the \n     operation of the Senate.''\n       Bruhn planned on staying two years, but lasted four, during \n     which his interest in historic preservation grew.\n       Returning to Vermont in 1978, he went into consulting, \n     first helping to organize the restoration of the Round Church \n     in Richmond. In Washington, he had worked with Leahy on \n     obtaining federal funding for the development of the Church \n     Street Marketplace. Back home, he helped put together the \n     campaign for the required local 10 percent match.\n       When a group he had encountered during the Round Church \n     project--the Vermont Council of the Society for the \n     Preservation of New England Antiquities--decided to start a \n     statewide preservation organization, Bruhn was hired to run \n     it, ``because I was available and inexpensive,'' he says with \n     typical humility.\n       The Vermont Division for Historic Preservation had provided \n     a good infrastructure for preservation work in the state, \n     having worked since the early 1970s on the state survey of \n     historic places. More than 30,000 buildings and numerous \n     historic districts are on the state register in Vermont, and \n     10,000 of those are also on the national register.\n       Grant-making has been a piece of the organization's work \n     since the early days, starting with small seed grants of $250 \n     to $500. Funding comes from various sources. In the late \n     1980s, the organization started the Fund for Vermont's Third \n     Century to encourage people to celebrate the bicentennial in \n     ways that would last. It ran for four years leading up to and \n     through Vermont's bicentennial in 1991.\n       In 1994, a special partnership was developed with the \n     Freeman Foundation. ``It would be impossible to overstate how \n     important it's been,'' Bruhn says. ``We're the nudge, the \n     supporter, the enabler--and are lucky to have partnerships \n     like this.'' Funding from the Freeman Foundation has provided \n     grants to more than 300 projects and played a key role in \n     over $115 million worth of rehabilitation work, he says.\n       Bruhn's lively, creative mind, good sense of humor, and \n     ability to inspire affinity have served him well in his \n     chosen career. James Maxwell, a Brattleboro attorney and a \n     member of the board of the Brattleboro Arts Initiative, has \n     seen this first-hand. He was president of the board in 2000-\n     2001, when the BAI became involved in buying the Latchis \n     hotel and theater complex.\n       ``Paul is a man of wide comprehension as to the needs of \n     downtowns in Vermont, and I would venture to say in the \n     country as a whole,'' says Maxwell. ``Not only is his \n     knowledge comprehensive, but he is a feeling human being, \n     someone who resonates with groups that he works with and is \n     of incredible assistance, not only in the nuts and bolts of \n     how you go putting together a deal, but also how you move \n     things along.\n       ``He is a congregator. Without getting up on the pulpit and \n     giving a sermon, he is able to congregate people in a \n     situation.''\n       This talent and Bruhn's understanding of the benefit of \n     being willing to change with the times have helped keep the \n     organization strong.\n       He inspired change 10 years ago, when the organization \n     entered a nationwide competition sponsored by the National \n     Trust for Historic Preservation and the Mellon Foundation, \n     seeking ideas on how to improve the delivery of services and \n     the effectiveness of the historic preservation movement \n     nationally.\n       Vermont was one of two states whose submissions were \n     chosen, says Bruhn. ``We were selected for developing a \n     program for providing field services, so instead of providing \n     support to local organizations via telephone calls and some \n     visiting in the field, we would hire two part-time people who \n     would spend the vast majority of their time in the field \n     working with local organizations helping them move their \n     projects along.''\n       The Preservation Trust of Vermont received a significant \n     grant ``It was $170,000, and that was 10 years ago,'' says \n     Bruhn--which provided full funding the first year, 70 percent \n     the second year, and 30 percent the final year.\n       The program so impressed the National Trust, it recently \n     dedicated a $5 million grant it received to helping other \n     statewide organizations establish their own field service \n     programs.\n       Another big change came, says Bruhn, when Robert Hoehl, the \n     co-founder of IDX, and his wife, Cindy, purchased the former \n     Camp Marycrest from the Sisters of Mercy, then donated it to \n     the Preservation Trust in 1997. ``We had not owned property \n     prior to that--hadn't dreamed of owning property--but this \n     was an amazing opportunity.''\n       The organization gratefully accepted and formed a \n     partnership with caterer and former restaurateur and \n     innkeeper Beverly Watson, who leases the property. ``We use \n     it largely for weddings on weekends during the summer. During \n     the week, it's used for retreats and training.''\n       A big turning point was in 1993, when Vermont was named an \n     endangered state by the National Trust. This brought the \n     issue of sprawl to the fore. ``We became a much more visible \n     organization,'' he says, and work very closely with citizen \n     groups and partners like the Vermont Natural Resources \n     Council and Smart Growth Vermont on the issue of sprawl and \n     the negative impact that big-box retailing can have on our \n     downtowns and village centers and how they change downtowns. \n     In 2004, the National Trust again named Vermont one of the 11 \n     most endangered places in the nation.\n       Bruhn was the only staff person early on, and even today, \n     the staff is small, with the equivalent of four full-time \n     employees.\n       The other full-timers are Elise Seraus, the office manager/\n     administrative assistant, and\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\n     Ann Cousins, who splits her hours between field services and \n     fund raising. Bill Polk, the financial officer, works one day \n     a week. Eric Gilbertson, who was deputy director of the \n     Vermont Division for Historic Preservation and recently \n     retired after almost 30 years, works half time in field \n     services. Meg Campbell, also half time, manages the facade \n     easement program, does field services in Bennington County, \n     manages the Web site, and produces the electronic newsletter.\n       Because he's been with the organization for so many years, \n     Bruhn says, ``there are people who say, `Well, the \n     Preservation Trust, it's just Paul Bruhn.' It's not even \n     close to that.''\n       ``I've always had a very strong, very involved board of \n     directors who provide a lot of the direction for the \n     organization.'' The directors, he says, genuinely like each \n     other, are very proud of the organization, ``but that doesn't \n     stop them from having good disagreements and good debate.''\n       The secret to keeping a board active and involved, he says, \n     is to have two-day board meetings four times a year. ``In \n     February, in the middle of a snowstorm, we went on a two-day \n     tour around the northern part of the state.'' He counts off \n     eight towns (and multiple projects within them). ``We talked \n     all the while on the bus, a great discussion about what's \n     happening in Vermont, how the community's doing, and this \n     work--the support we try to give to local organizations.\n       On the importance of the organization's downtown work, \n     Bruhn is adamant. ``I love downtown Burlington. I grew up \n     here, helped secure funding for the Marketplace when I was \n     working for Sen. Leahy; but downtown Burlington has become \n     one that focuses on entertainment, high-end retail and \n     tourism. We get that there are a lot of people in Vermont who \n     need to be able to shop at a place like Wal-Mart, but \n     wouldn't it be terrific if Wal-Mart would be interested and \n     willing to build a smaller-scale store in downtown \n     Burlington? It would insure that downtown Burlington would \n     serve the entire community.''\n       Bruhn pauses and takes a breath. ``We're not in favor of \n     pickling Vermont,'' he says. ``On the other hand, we've got \n     to find ways to grow that reinforce what's important about \n     our place. It's essential that we are good stewards of our \n     place.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3692-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3692-S3693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO CON HOGAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Marcelle and I have a good friend in \nVermont named Cornelius Hogan, although everyone knows him as Con \nHogan.\n  In our State, we have been fortunate to have people, of both \npolitical parties, who have given a great deal of themselves to serve \nthe people of Vermont, and Con is an excellent example of that.\n  Recently, the newspaper the Times Argus published an excellent \nprofile of him. I called Con and Jeanette to say how much I enjoyed it. \nI would like to share the piece with my fellow Senators, and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n A Life Well Served; Plainfield's Con Hogan Remininsces About Time in \n                          Government, Business\n\n                            (By Susan Allen)\n\n       Plainfield.--Every Thursday a 4 p.m., the late Gov. Richard \n     Snelling would invite some of his cabinet members to his \n     office and put a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon and glasses on \n     his desk.\n       ``You could talk about anything you wanted,'' recalled Con \n     Hogan last week, seated at the kitchen table in his \n     Plainfield home, with an expansive view that includes the ski \n     slopes of Sugarbush and Mad River Glen.\n       That was a new one for me. I thought I'd heard most of the \n     behind-the-scenes stories from past--and present--\n     administrations. I've been in the Vermont press that long, \n     and collect interesting and odd-ball recollections like some \n     people collect stamps. I'm fascinated by the people who \n     devote their lives to serving the state.\n       But Hogan's reminiscences during our conversation proved \n     how many good stories I've missed.\n       Hogan is retired from his extensive tenure in state \n     government and we started talking about how busy he is during \n     his so-called retirement (more on that later), but quickly \n     began trading accounts of political personalities. Most of \n     his tales were gathered during his professional journey from \n     serving as a guard in a prison in Annandale, N.J., to heading \n     Vermont's massive Human Services Agency under Snelling and \n     former Gov. Howard Dean.\n       That journey included two significant side trips: An 11-\n     year stint in the private sector helping International Coins \n     and Currency slog its way out of bankruptcy in the 1980s, and \n     an ``ill-thought,'' unsuccessful run for governor as an \n     independent against incumbent Jim Douglas and Democrat \n     Douglas Racine in 2002.\n       ``That was a period of temporary insanity,'' he said of the \n     gubernatorial race, which almost certainly burned some \n     bridges with the GOP hierarchy. ``I don't regret it, but I \n     don't consider it a high point.''\n       Hogan received a degree in psychology from Rutgers, married \n     wife Jeanette in 1965, and took a job as a prison guard in \n     Annandale, rising quickly through the ranks to eventually \n     serve as a division head with the New Jersey Department of \n     Corrections, focusing on the budget.\n       ``I loved it,'' he recalled of those 7 years. ``The people \n     who work in that line are under such professional pressure \n     that you become fast friends, the closest friends.''\n       Hogan and his wife regularly visited a good friend in \n     Vermont who lived on an apple farm in Bennington, and in 1972 \n     at age 28, he applied for the job of corrections commissioner \n     in this State. He chuckles at his own audacity, and the \n     outcome.\n       Then-Secretary of Administration Richard Mallary (who went \n     on to serve in the U.S. House for Vermont) wrote Hogan a two-\n     page, handwritten letter thanking him for his interest, \n     letting him know the job was already filled, but urging him \n     to contact the new commissioner to talk about becoming his \n     deputy.\n       Hogan is amazed at the thought of Mallary writing such a \n     long, personal note. But back in 1972, he did apply for \n     deputy commissioner post and got the job.\n       Those were tumultuous years in corrections, he said. Then-\n     Gov. Thomas Salmon, trying to control a huge state deficit, \n     issued a 10 percent cut in all budgets, to be executed in \n     60 days--a staggering assignment, Hogan knew.\n       And the Windsor prison, which had opened in 1808 during the \n     U.S. presidential administration of Thomas Jefferson, was \n     closed in the early 1970s, leaving the State without a \n     maximum security prison for a number of years.\n       With Snelling's first election in 1976, Hogan moved into \n     the post of commissioner of Social and Rehabilitative \n     Services, again during a difficult time. The Weeks School for \n     juvenile offenders closed, forcing the State to redistribute \n     the 400 youth to smaller group facilities around the State.\n       Hogan recalled that all but 15 were placed at one point. \n     Those 15, he said, were sent to stay with a Vermont couple \n     who--without the State's knowledge--packed them all into a \n     Winnebago and headed off to see the country.\n       ``The dad called me from New Orleans,'' Hogan said. ``I \n     said, `What are you doing in New Orleans?' ''\n       Four of the young Vermonters had run off, and the state \n     scrambled to fix the mess. Fortunately the story ended well \n     for everyone and never (until now) became public, Hogan said \n     with a grin.\n       After his 11-year foray with ICC in the 1980s, Hogan once \n     again received a call from Snelling, who was considering a \n     run for governor and wanted Hogan to head his transition team \n     if elected. Snelling was elected and appointed Hogan his \n     secretary of Human Services in 1991.\n       ``During the transition, I was working from 6 a.m. to \n     midnight, staying in the office--sometimes I slept over,'' he \n     said. During a meeting one day, Hogan was called out because \n     Jeanette was outside with fresh clothes for her husband. ``I \n     need to explain to my wife why I'm spending more time with \n     you than her,'' Hogan told Snelling, who didn't like meetings \n     interrupted.\n       ``He lit up. `Let's go meet your wife,' '' Hogan recalled. \n     Jeanette had just been to the dentist and had a front tooth \n     removed, flashing a smile that showed a gaping hole. Hogan \n     said Snelling never missed a beat and made a ``big show'' of \n     graciousness to his wife.\n       Hogan recalled Snelling's impatience with long \n     presentations. So, as Human Services Secretary, Hogan created \n     a game where he took a deck of cards, and on each wrote a \n     one-line synopsis of a proposed program, the cost, and the \n     supporters and opponents. Fifty-two suggestions.\n       Snelling loved it; he'd flip through the cards quickly and \n     make two piles: Yes and No. And Hogan knew how to proceed.\n       ``He was at the top of his game,'' said Hogan of Snelling \n     during that second trip to the governor's office. His \n     recollections of his former boss are nostalgic and reflect \n     his respect and deep admiration for the late governor.\n       Snelling died in office on Aug. 13, 1991. During his brief \n     second tenure as governor, he worked with Democratic House \n     Speaker Ralph Wright to craft a plan to retire an enormous \n     state deficit, another point of pride for Hogan.\n       The day after Snelling's death, new Gov. Howard Dean called \n     Hogan into his office for a briefing on the Human Services \n     Agency.\n       ``I was in no shape to go,'' Hogan recalled. Not only was \n     he mourning Snelling's passing, he didn't know Dean or what \n     to expect from the former lieutenant governor.\n       Hogan arrived with a list of 50 issues to discuss, and \n     spent an hour running through them all. ``Dean didn't say a \n     word, he just listened. He was either getting it . . . or not \n     getting it and he did,'' Hogan recalled.\n       The two worked well together for 8 years until Hogan left \n     the administration in November 1999. ``There's a half-life to \n     that kind of job,'' he said of Human Services secretary. \n     After making progress on many social issues, ``I had begun to \n     see some of the same problems again.''\n       Then came the ill-fated gubernatorial run.\n       Followed by retirement--or Hogan's version of retirement: \n     He travels the world working with countries that include \n     Australia, Israel, Chile, Norway, Northern Ireland, Scotland, \n     and in May, Holland, to improve their government structure \n     and programs for children.\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\n       He has also become involved in informal lobbying efforts \n     for universal health care (the number of uninsured Vermonters \n     has climbed from 42,000 in 2001 to 69,000 today, he noted; he \n     predicts the increase will continue without serious action). \n     He considers high health care costs a ``serious economic \n     threat'' to the State.\n       He serves on the board of Vermont College in Montpelier, \n     which is seeking certification and funding. Hogan also \n     continues to play the banjo with his band, Cold Country \n     Bluegrass (Jeanette plays the string bass).\n       And he helps Jeannette around the family horse farm, which \n     she started but is now run by their daughter, Ruth.\n       That's Con Hogan's idea of retirement.\n       His son lives next door with Hogan's two grandchildren, and \n     Ruth lives around the corner. And in the end, that is his \n     life's ambition achieved.\n       ``Having my family close enough to enjoy their successes, \n     and watch the kids grow up,'' he said. ``Nothing comes close. \n     This to me is what it's all about.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3693-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3693-S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO REEVE LINDBERGH\n\n  Mr. President, Marcelle and I have many wonderful friends in Vermont. \nSome were born in Vermont, and others have come to enjoy our very \nspecial State. In the latter capacity is our friend Reeve Lindbergh, \nwho lives with her husband, Nat Tripp, in Vermont.\n  Like her parents, Reeve is a terrific author, and a conversation with \nReeve is a conversation worth having. You always learn something from \nit, but, more importantly, you always leave with a greater sense of \nwhat is essential in life. I am extremely proud of her.\n  Kevin O'Connor recently wrote a profile of Reeve, which I would like \nto share with my fellow senators. This profile does a good deal to \ncapture her essence, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Mar. 30, 2008]\n\nOnward and Upward: Daughter of Legends, Reeve Lindbergh Looks ``Forward \n                              From Here''\n\n                          (By Kevin O'Connor)\n\n       Vermonter Reeve Lindbergh wrote her first memoir about \n     growing up with her father, aviator Charles Lindbergh, and \n     her second memoir about the final months of her mother, \n     author Anne Morrow Lindbergh. Recently turning 60, she began \n     a third memoir--this one about aging. She aimed to leap \n     fearlessly into the future right from its title: ``Forward \n     From Here: Leaving Middle Age--and Other Unexpected \n     Adventures.''\n       That's when she found herself pulled every which way by the \n     past.\n       First she thought about all the unlisted phone numbers \n     still ringing in her memory--one of many safeguards \n     instituted by her parents after the 1932 kidnapping of her \n     late brother, Charles Jr.\n       ``When you are taught to memorize your home phone number \n     and never to reveal it except to close relatives and maybe \n     the family doctor, you don't forget that number.''\n       Then she thought about the day in 2001 when, after the \n     death of her mother, she drove from her Northeast Kingdom \n     home to a storage building in Stamford, Conn. There she \n     opened box after box to find her parents' 1929 wedding gifts \n     in their original wrappings. Pausing for lunch at a nearby \n     diner, she glanced at a television to discover, 30 miles \n     south, the smoldering remains of New York City's World Trade \n     Center.\n       It was Sept. 11.\n       Finally she thought about what her publisher bills as her \n     book's ``shocking surprise.'' Lindbergh long described \n     herself as the youngest of five children. Then in 2003 she \n     learned her late father--the first person to fly solo and \n     nonstop from New York to Paris--later crisscrossed the \n     Atlantic out of a too-literal interest in foreign affairs.\n       ``In one essay that is sure to attract much attention, the \n     author writes about her reaction to learning that her father \n     had three families in Europe, a fact that remained a secret \n     for 50 years,'' publicity promises. ``This is the first time \n     any member of the Lindbergh family has discussed in detail \n     their reaction to the controversial and surprising \n     revelation.''\n       Lindbergh, angry at her father upon learning the news, now \n     can laugh at such hype. New book in hand, she not only has \n     made peace with all her discordant memories but also arranged \n     them into a mosaic of ``sly, gentle humor'' and ``quiet \n     resolve'' (says Publishers Weekly) that's reassuringly human.\n       The modest yet gregarious 5-foot-3 daughter of the 6-foot-3 \n     flyer is drawing the attention of Vanity Fair and the New \n     York Times. But the 40-year Vermonter would be just as happy \n     sticking out mud season at home with her husband, her monthly \n     End-of-the-Road Writers Group (named less for its \n     participants than its location) and her menagerie of dogs, \n     chickens and sheep.\n       ``I'm not so interested in being confessional, but in what \n     certain experiences are like,'' she says in an interview. \n     ``When you're pretty honest and not too fancy, it seems to \n     help people.''\n\n\n                           Hippie flatlander\n\n       Lindbergh has long had a thirst for life. Tiny and anemic \n     at birth, she required a pint transfusion of her father's \n     blood. She still remembers her thoughts upon receiving the \n     newly invented polio vaccine as a 1950s schoolchild: ``I'd \n     hope that death would be wiped out by the time I grew up.''\n       Alas, mortality remains uncured. So what does aging mean to \n     a 60-year-old woman, wife and mother? Lindbergh put her left \n     hand to yellow-lined paper to pen a series of essays. \n     Reflecting on the present, she found herself rewinding to the \n     past.\n       Growing up in a Connecticut suburb where ``tea hour'' led \n     to ``sherry hour,'' Lindbergh nevertheless found her family \n     didn't drink up fame. Her father--a Midwest farm boy who \n     focused on the moment rather than on memories--never talked \n     about his historic 1927 flight. Her mother therefore had to \n     offer reassurance when they watched Jimmy Stewart re-create \n     his grueling 33\\1/2\\-hour crossing on the movie screen at \n     Radio City Music Hall.\n       ``Does he make it?'' his little daughter asked.\n       Her father didn't fly to escape the earth, she knows today. \n     As a conservationist, he just wanted a bird's-eye view. With \n     a similar love of the land, she moved to the Green Mountains \n     upon graduating from Radcliffe College in 1968, taking a \n     teaching job in the southern Vermont town of Readsboro before \n     retreating north in 1971 to the countryside outside St. \n     Johnsbury.\n       ``The optimists among us thought they were harbingers of a \n     quieter, cleaner, saner way of life on the planet, returning \n     to past customs in order to create a better future,'' she \n     writes. ``Some native Vermonters, especially older ones who \n     had spent their early years on farms without electricity or \n     indoor plumbing and had been chopping, stacking and burning \n     firewood all their lives, smiled good-naturedly and shook \n     their heads.''\n       Others just labeled her and her like ``hippie \n     flatlanders.'' Reeve wed a man named Richard, then befriended \n     fellow transplants Nat and Patty. Soon came children, \n     midlife, divorce and a new couple: Reeve and Nat (Tripp, \n     himself an accomplished author). Today the last of the \n     offspring have flown the coop, leaving Lindbergh with a \n     teeming henhouse, sheep barn and sofa for two dogs.\n       ``Why not?'' she says of the canine couch. ``Nobody else \n     was using it.''\n       Entering the life stage her mother called ``the youth of \n     old age,'' she also faces countless questions.\n\n\n                           Sixties Generation\n\n       The first: Can a couple of ``hippie homesteaders'' who \n     harvest 600 bales of hay a year get a hot tub?\n       Her brain said no. But her achy right shoulder and her \n     husband's bad knee screamed yes.\n       What about her view of wrinkles?\n       ``When I say I don't mind looking at my face in the mirror \n     anymore, part of the reason may be that I can't see it,'' she \n     writes. ``Maybe I care less now than I did then about how I \n     look to other people, or maybe I know from long experience \n     that most people ignore our imperfections because they are \n     concentrating upon theirs.''\n       And drugs?\n       ``As I and the other members of this much-publicized \n     `Sixties Generation' go through our own sixties--and \n     seventies and eighties and (we secretly hope) beyond--the \n     least we can do for ourselves is live up to our own mythology \n     and take lots of drugs.''\n       (``Legal drugs,'' she clarifies.)\n       Lindbergh, seeking to comment on both the salvation and \n     side effects brought by modern-day pharmaceuticals, devotes a \n     full chapter to listing everything in her medicine cabinet, \n     from the anticonvulsants required after falling off a horse \n     to the antidepressants prescribed during the year her mother \n     was dying.\n       ``I realize there are people who are embarrassed about the \n     medications they take,'' she says in an interview, ``but it \n     was in no way difficult for me to write about that.''\n       Neither does she shy away from the topic of death--not that \n     she has made peace with it. Take the three fuzzy chicks on \n     her property that wandered from their mother and perished.\n       ``Even after 30-odd years of country living, with all the \n     dead chicks, dead lambs, dead dogs and dead horses, the \n     hamsters, the rabbits, the lizards and the turtles (not to \n     mention, dear God, the people!), I still get upset about \n     it.''\n       Lindbergh writes about the burial of her father, who died \n     of cancer in 1974 at age 72, and the cremation of her mother, \n     who died in 2001 at age 94. The resulting ashes led to a \n     question: ``Where do you put them?''\n       Family members scattered them in favorite places around the \n     world--but only after their matriarch, a gardener, first \n     considered a flower bed.\n       ``She said it would be so good for the lilies of the \n     valley,'' Reeve Lindbergh reports matter-of-factly.\n\n\n                            A private matter\n\n       Lindbergh has spent much of this new century wrestling with \n     the old one.\n       In 2004, she traveled to the Florida island of Captiva \n     where her mother wrote the 1955 book ``Gift from the Sea.'' \n     In that collection of essays, Anne Morrow Lindbergh found \n     meaning in shells--from the channeled whelk that represents \n     ``the ideal of a simplified life'' to the moon shell that \n     reminded her of solitude.\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n       A half-century later, Reeve Lindbergh discovered many of \n     the same shells--as well as discarded plastic cups, drinking \n     straws and cigarette butts. She tucked away the treasures and \n     threw away the trash. But she can't pitch other remnants of \n     her past so easily.\n       The kidnapping and death of her parents' first child, 20-\n     month-old Charles Jr., topped world news in 1932. Decades \n     later, people still write to say they're her long-lost \n     brother. That's why she was skeptical when, five years ago, \n     the European press claimed her father had affairs with three \n     German women who gave birth to five boys and two girls.\n       The headlines proved explosive: ``Lindbergh fathered \n     children by three mistresses.'' Adding fuel, the stories \n     reminded readers that some people had labeled the American \n     hero as a Nazi sympathizer when he opposed the United States' \n     entry into World War II.\n       Reeve Lindbergh replied with a public statement still \n     pinned to her bulletin board: ``The Lindbergh family is \n     treating this situation as a private matter, and has taken \n     steps to open personal channels of communication, with \n     sensitivity to all concerned.'' (Today she translates that to \n     mean: ``We don't know any more than you do, but we're trying \n     to figure this out while causing as little pain as \n     possible.'')\n       DNA tests proved the reports to be true. In her book, \n     Lindbergh recalls her initial feelings of anger and \n     bitterness.\n       ``How do I fold this story into my memories of my father?'' \n     she writes. ``I certainly could have done without his endless \n     lectures on the Population Explosion, with all those graphs \n     and charts on `exponential growth curves' (that's a direct \n     quote). How could he have done this with a straight face, let \n     alone a clear conscience? A man who fathered 13--I think, I \n     still have to stop and count us!''\n       Calmer now, she has visited her European siblings and \n     hosted them in Vermont. Meeting one half brother halfway \n     around the world, she shook her head just like he did, all \n     the while silently sharing the same thought: ``This is \n     absolutely normal and completely insane, too.''\n       Lindbergh devotes her book's last chapter to her \n     conflicting emotions about her father's secret. (Kirkus \n     Reviews hails it as ``a moving account.'') She didn't plan to \n     write about it so publicly. Then she found reason.\n       ``I've noticed how many things there are that people are \n     afraid to talk about,'' she says in an interview. ``If you \n     leave something in the realm of scandal and sensation, it \n     becomes very unreal. I just wanted to write about it and then \n     let it be. I've found, in spite of all the craziness, that my \n     new relatives are just great.''\n\n\n                              Lucky . . .'\n\n       Life, she has discovered, eventually puts everything in \n     perspective.\n       Lindbergh wrote one chapter about clutter in her mind. Ten \n     days later, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. It led to \n     surgery--and something equally unexpected.\n       ``I soon discovered that the effect the two words `brain \n     tumor' have on people is remarkable: `I'm sorry, I can't help \n     you/be there/send a contribution just now. I have a brain \n     tumor.' Stunned silence, then instant retreat. With these \n     results it's hard to resist taking advantage of the \n     circumstances.''\n       Even so, Lindbergh gladly agreed to serve as grand marshal \n     of the annual Lyndonville (village population 1,236) Stars \n     and Stripes Festival parade.\n       She isn't the first in her family to face a medical crisis. \n     Her older sister, Thetford writer Anne Spencer Lindbergh, \n     died of cancer 15 years ago at age 53.\n       ``I worry less and less, not more and more, about getting \n     old myself,'' Reeve Lindbergh says. ``I don't mind if I do. I \n     wish she could, too.''\n       Lindbergh faces a busy spring. She'll serve as narrator \n     next weekend for the Bella Voce Women's Chorus of Vermont \n     premiere of Braintree composer Gwyneth Walker's new work \n     ``Lessons from the Sea,'' inspired by Anne Morrow Lindbergh's \n     ``Gift from the Sea.''\n       She'll then appear at more than a dozen New England \n     bookstores as the national media rolls out profiles and \n     reviews. She finds such travel can be exhilarating and \n     exhausting--As a result, she'll no longer attend so many far-\n     flung celebrations of her father and instead stay closer to \n     home to read the unpublished writings of her mother.\n       ``With a family like mine, you have to be careful not to \n     let history take over too much of your life,'' she says. ``I \n     think I could let other people represent my parents at \n     ceremonies. My mother's work has always struck a spark, \n     especially with women. I would love to see some of that \n     unpublished material out in the world.''\n       Leaving middle age, Lindbergh hears the clock ticking. She \n     remembers two framed needlepoint phrases in her grandmother \n     Morrow's home. One said, ``It is later than you think!'' The \n     other said: ``There is still time.''\n       ``I don't know what further changes I will enjoy or endure \n     as I age, but I do know the answer to the question I asked \n     myself at 30, and 40, and 50: `How did I get to be this old?' \n     I was lucky.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3694-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL KENNEDY\n\n Mr. COCHRAN.

Bill has commendably fulfilled \nthe role of president during a time when Mississippi agriculture and \nthe economy of the State of Mississippi have faced significant \nchallenges.\n  As president of the Delta Council, Bill was called upon to commit \ntime and resources to the ever-pressing issues of Mississippi River \nflooding due to the delta's geographic location at the bottom of a \nwatershed funnel encompassing most of the United States.\n  Bill Kennedy has set the standard by which other agricultural leaders \nof the Mississippi Delta are measured. As past president of the MS \nGinners Association, past president of the Southern Cotton Ginners \nAssociation, and president of Duncan Gin, one of the oldest and most \nsuccessful agricultural enterprises in the Mississippi Delta, Bill has \nproven to be an effective advocate on behalf of delta agriculture. \nBecause of his unique understanding of the U.S. cotton industry, his \ncounsel is frequently sought when issues of national, statewide, or \nregional concern arise.\n  Additionally, the role which Bill Kennedy has played in wildlife \nconservation through his leadership as former president of Delta \nWildlife is inestimable. Bill is a true sportsman and conservationist \nwho has devoted thousands of hours to making the Mississippi Delta a \nbetter place for all those who live and do business in the region.\n  I congratulate Bill Kennedy, and thank his wife Lanny, his son \nLarkin, and daughter in law, Jenny Ruth, for the year which they have \nshared with the delta while Bill has served as president of Delta \nCouncil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3694-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3694-S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING BRYAN McDONALD\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \nservice of one of my constituents, Mr. Bryan McDonald. Bryan has served \nthe State of Mississippi and Governor Haley Barbour as director of the \nGovernor's Office of Recovery and Renewal. In his final week as \ndirector, I thank him for his outstanding contribution to Mississippi's \nprogress in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Prior to his appointment, Bryan worked with the Mississippi Emergency \nManagement Agency as director of accounting Oversight, where he helped \nprovide assistance to governmental and nonprofit applicants under the \nStafford Act. Bryan's extensive management experience as a CPA and \nauditor suited the State perfectly in our recovery efforts.\n  Bryan established a team and a process which ensured FEMA public \nassistance dollars were accounted for and complied with Federal \nregulations. The system expedited reimbursements to State and local \ngovernments and resulted in over 99 percent of projects being obligated \nby FEMA. Considering the unprecedented magnitude of this disaster, this \nwas truly a monumental task and one that had never before been \nundertaken.\n  As director of the Office of Recovery and Renewal, Bryan again put \nthe right people and processes in place to manage the Federal \nassistance entrusted to the State of Mississippi. Thousands of \nhomeowners have received direct financial assistance through the \nhomeowners assistance grant program; programs and policies have been \nimplemented which will result in the development of low income housing \nunits in excess of what was available before the storm, and Katrina \naffected cities and counties have received the much needed Federal \nresources to rebuild and revitalize their communities.\n  Bryan has worked to ensure that every Federal taxpayer dollar \nentrusted to Mississippi has been and continues to be spent efficiently \nand appropriately. The State of Mississippi and this country owe Bryan \na debt of gratitude for taking a leave of absence from his private \nsector career to serve our great State. As we know, public service can \nbe a strain on our families both financially and emotionally. I want to \nthank Bryan's wife Michelle and his two children, Matt and Laura Beth, \nfor their sacrifice and support while allowing Bryan to serve our \nState.\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\n  Bryan has reflected great credit on the State of Mississippi and I \nappreciate his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3695-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OMAHA STAR\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to honor \nthe Omaha Star, the largest and oldest African-American newspaper in my \nhome State of Nebraska. The Star is celebrating its 70th Anniversary \nthis year.\n  The Omaha Star is currently distributed in 48 States, as the paper \nhas become legendary for its civil rights work. Since its beginning, \nthe Star has been a champion in the struggle for equal rights.\n  The Omaha Star was founded in 1938 by the late Mildred Brown, a \nremarkable person in her own right, who was also the aunt of the \ncurrent publisher and editor, Dr. Marguerita L. Washington. Mrs. \nBrown's foresight and pioneering spirit in establishing the Star \nrequired not only a dedicated amount of time and effort, but also \ncourage and vigilance. Her efforts paid off, as the paper continues to \neducate and advocate; and Mrs. Brown was posthumously inducted into the \nNebraska Journalism Hall of Fame this past year.\n  In addition, the building housing the Omaha Star was listed on the \nNational Register of Historic Places in January. Mrs. Brown allowed the \nStar to provide a home for the De Porres Club, an active civil rights \norganization within the North Omaha community. The Star also kept its \nreadership apprised of the civil rights movement's successes and \nfailures across the country by researching the issues and urging \ninvolvement.\n  The Omaha Star's mission states that it is ``dedicated to the service \nof the people that no good cause shall lack a champion and that evil \nshall not go unopposed.'' My fellow Nebraskans and I take great pride \nin knowing that the Star has faithfully abided by this mission \nthroughout its 70 years of existence, and we will continue to follow \nthe Omaha Star on its spirited journey to provide a voice for civil \nrights and equality for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3695-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LTC JOHN LUCAS\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\n(the ``order'') that takes additional steps with respect to the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997, \nand expanded in Executive Order 13448 of October 18, 2007.\n  In 1997, the United States put in place a prohibition on new \ninvestment in Burma in response to the Government of Burma's large \nscale repression of the democratic opposition in that country. On July \n28, 2003, those sanctions were expanded by steps taken in Executive \nOrder 13310, which contained prohibitions implementing sections 3 and 4 \nof the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-61) \n(the \"Act\") and supplemented that Act with additional restrictions. On \nOctober 18, 2007, I determined that the Government of Burma's continued \nrepression of the democratic opposition in Burma, manifested at the \ntime in the violent response to peaceful demonstrations, the commission \nof human rights abuses related to political repression, and engagement \nin public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Burmese public \nassets or by misusing public authority, warranted an expansion of the \nthen-existing sanctions. Executive Order 13448, issued on that date, \nincorporated existing designation criteria set forth in Executive Order \n13310, blocked the property and interests in property of persons listed \nin the Annex to that Executive Order, and provided additional criteria \nfor designations of certain other persons.\n   The order supplements the existing designation criteria set forth in \nExecutive Order 13310, as incorporated in and expanded by Executive \nOrder 13448. The order blocks the property and interest in property in \nthe United States of persons listed in the Annex to the order and \nprovides additional criteria for designations of persons determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of \nState, to be owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly, the \nGovernment of Burma or an official or officials of the Government of \nBurma; to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in \nsupport of, the Government of Burma, the State Peace and Development \nCouncil of Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development Association of \nBurma, any successor entity to any of the foregoing, any senior \nofficial of any of the foregoing, or any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310, \nExecutive Order 13448, or the order; or to be owned or controlled by, \nor to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or \nindirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are \nblocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310, Executive Order 13448, or \nthe order.\n\n   The order leaves in place the existing prohibitions on new \ninvestment, the exportation or reexportation to Burma of financial \nservices, and the importation of any article that is a product of \nBurma, which were put into effect in Executive Order 13047 and \nExecutive Order 13310.\n   The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, after \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA and section 4 of the Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act of 2003 as may be necessary to carry out the \npurposes of the order.\n   I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to provide for the development and inventory of \ncertain outer Continental Shelf resources, to suspend petroleum \nacquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, during consideration of the reauthorization \nof the FAA, a great deal of conversation has gone on on this floor \nabout energy and the cost of energy. It is appropriate that we talk \nabout it at a time when our airlines are struggling and we are \nattempting to reauthorize FAA. Part of the reason our airlines are \nstruggling is the unprecedented aviation fuel prices. It is only one of \nthe many reasons they are having difficulty today, but clearly the \ndoubling of their costs are putting at risk their corporate structure \nand their ability to serve an American public.\n  But it is not just the airlines that are at risk. Every American \nconsumer and every business is finding the tremendous increase in the \ncost of energy a significant problem. For example, just a few minutes \nago, my BlackBerry buzzed. My wife Suzanne is out in Boise, ID. I got \nan e-mail about the temperature, which is 31 degrees in Boise this \nmorning. At the bottom of the e-mail, she said regular gas just hit \n$3.53 a gallon. That is a lot of money. Now, that is not as much as \nothers are paying across our Nation, but when an Idahoan fills their \ntank and they go from community to community, oftentimes they drive \nhundreds of miles--not just a few miles but literally hundreds of \nmiles. Idaho is a great big Western State. Our distance is oftentimes a \nsignificant part of our commerce and our ability to conduct economic \nactivity, and fuel prices have always been significant and important.\n  Idaho is also a large agricultural State. The cost of the production \nof foods today has gone up dramatically because of the cost of diesel, \nif you will, the cost of fertilizer, and all of those components that \ngo into the production of food and the transporting of the food.\n  Part of the reason food is going up on the retail shelf of the \nsupermarket today is the cost of getting it there, let alone the cost \nof producing and refining it. Many truckers are saying that just to \nfill up their truck now can be as much as $1,000. They are not able to \nchange their freight rates to adjust as quickly to the high cost of \nenergy, and they simply have to--this is the term--``eat it.'' Well, \nthey cannot afford to eat it. Oftentimes, those trucks are simply \nturning off their motors and sitting idle.\n  So the impact of energy costs on our economy can be dramatic. I came \nto the floor yesterday to talk about it and to say that, in large part, \nthe American consumer, in their frustration, is saying: Whom do we \nblame? I don't think they have to look any further than the U.S. \nCongress and the failure of this Congress--the House and Senate--over \nthe last 20 years to do the things that were necessary to continue \nproduction, to ensure refinery capacity, to ensure exploration and the \ndevelopment of reserves, while we were doing all of the other things in \nconservation, in CAFE standards, assuring that we had a new form of \ntransportation energy. But, no, we have failed to do the right things, \nand as a result of that, the American consumer is, in fact, paying a \ngreat deal for our failure.\n  What do we do to change that? Instead of just wringing our hands, \nthere are all kinds of ideas out there about changing it.\n  Some would suggest that you just tax the big oil companies; if you \njust tax those big oil companies and put that money somewhere else, \nthat will solve the problem. There is an old adage in economics that is \nquite simple: You usually get less of that which you tax. In other \nwords, the higher you tax something, the less you are going to get from \nit. Do you want to, by taxation, nationalize America's independent oil \ncompanies? Is that a way to get production and more oil and gas at the \npump? Remember, there are not any gas lines out there today. There \naren't the kinds of lines we saw in the 1970s during the last energy \ncrisis. There is supply. It is the cost of supply that we are \nfrustrated about and the impact that cost is having on our economy.\n  Here is one of the problems we have. I talked about a Congress that \nfailed, a public policy that failed, a policy that failed to continue \nto produce as demand went dramatically up--not just in this country but \naround the world.\n  The blue line on this chart is the supply line. As you can see, in \nthe 1990s it peaked and it began to drop. That is, of course, U.S. \nproduction versus U.S. consumption. In other words, as a nation we \nbegan to produce less and less crude oil into our refineries.\n  Today, we are near 60 percent dependent upon other sources of energy, \nfrom outside our country, to come into our refineries and to go out of \nthe gas pump to the consumer. In fact, you can see that the red line--\ndemand--has gone up dramatically as our economy continued to grow over \nthe years, as more people were driving cars, and as more cars consumed \nmore gas.\n  The only way you are going to keep price down is when the supply line \nand the demand line are somewhat in concert, somewhat tracking each \nother. That simply stopped in the 1950s, as we began to grow \nincreasingly dependent upon foreign nations.\n  We passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, but it wasn't really \ndirected at transportation fuels. Last year, we added to that and we \nbegan to address transportation fuels. We brought ethanol into the \nmarket by subsidizing that and allowing our farmers, and those who take \ncorn from them, to produce ethanol to become increasingly effective in \nthe market. That is working to some degree. In fact, it is estimated \ntoday that 20 cents would be put on the price of gas at the pump if\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\nit wasn't for national and rural ethanol production. Now, it has caused \nother problems. Some would argue that it has caused problems in the \nfood chain, and it probably has. I think the marketplace will work that \nout. So there are things we have been doing.\n  But I think, most importantly, it is the things we have not done. It \nis the failure of our country to recognize the increased dependency we \nwere developing from other countries around the world. I think that has \nbecome one of our greater frustrations. While you have some on the \ncampaign trail today talking about taxing the big oil companies, the \nbig oil companies don't own the oil. It is the cartels. It is the \nnations. It is not oil companies, it is oil countries that we have to \nworry about today.\n  I didn't coin the phrase, but I use the phrase quite often, ``petro-\nnationalism.'' If I am a country and I am small but I am sitting on a \npool of oil, I become rich overnight. The reason I become rich \novernight is because Americans will come and buy my oil. If I want to \nform a cartel and I want to control the supply of that oil, then they \nwill pay even more for it because Americans quit producing for \nthemselves.\n  Here is a statistic that I find fascinating, and some have said that \nif we don't stop this in the near future, we will spend our Nation into \npoverty as we spend all of this money on oil. We are now spending well \nover $1 billion a day outside our country to buy oil. That is a \nphenomenal figure. Our neighbors to the north, we send them $280 \nmillion a day; to Saudi Arabia, we send $190 million a day; to \nVenezuela and Dictator Chavez, we send $160 million; to Nigeria, we \nsend $140 million; to Algeria, we send $70 million. Do Venezuela and \nNigeria and Algeria have our best interests in mind? I don't believe \nso. They have their own interests in mind. We are literally making them \nwealthy because we are buying their oil.\n  Many of us talk about energy independence, and last year when we \npassed that legislation I was talking about, the Energy Independence \nand Security Act of 2007, we did some very good things in it. As I \nsaid, we looked at increasing production by conservation, by CAFE \nstandards, and by renewable fuels standards. We said to the automobile \nindustry: You have to design cars that burn less, and in doing that, we \nwill improve our overall position on dependency by dropping it \nsignificantly by 2030. But it takes a long time to redesign a car, make \nit efficient, produce it, and then sell it into the market.\n  Those are the realities of a problem where you cannot just fix this \ntomorrow. We cannot just change the price of gas at the pump tomorrow \nbecause we cannot fix the underlying problems instantly. But as I said \nearlier, if Congress is at fault, the problem in this, then Congress \nought to be doing more about it. And it is not just wringing your hands \nand wanting to tax. It is doing things that get us back into production \nwhile we learn to conserve, while we have cleaner automobiles, while we \nlook at alternative fuel sources, while we get more hybrid cars and \nelectric plug-in cars in the market. That is all coming, but that is 10 \nyears, 15 years, and 20 years out.\n  What do we do in the interim? I believe there is something we can do, \nand we ought to do. In America today and in our territorial waters we \nare sitting still on a lot of oil, a dramatic amount of oil. Some would \nargue under old U.S. Geological Survey analysis that we are sitting on \nat least 100 billion barrels of oil. If we are sitting on it, why \naren't we using it? Once again, the politics of Congress and the \npolitics of States enter into the debate.\n  A couple of years ago, I began to talk about an issue I called the no \nzone. What was I talking about at the time? I was talking about that \narea of the United States and Outer Continental Shelf of waters that we \nknew had large volumes of oil. But California said no. We said no in \nAlaska. We have said no off the east coast. We have said no around \nFlorida. Because we have said no, the American consumer today is paying \nthe highest price for gasoline ever. That is a fact. It is a simple \nreality. Our dependency on foreign nations grew. As I just expressed, \nover 60 percent of our oil is coming from outside the continental \nUnited States when we know there is a significant amount of oil outside \nthe continent.\n  When I introduced this chart a couple of years ago and I began to \ntalk about the no zone and there were a few folks wringing their hands, \nwe went to work. We went to work and we looked at oil sales in the gulf \nand the development in the Outer Continental Shelf in the deep waters \nof the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Thanks to our effort, we did something. The American consumer needs \nto know we went into lease sale 181 off the coast of Florida. We looked \nat and found a tremendous amount of capability there and we began to \ndevelop it and we are developing it today. We have allowed other lease \nsales to occur. That is tremendously important. We are beginning to tap \nsome of that oil supply that we know is out there and about which we \nought to be doing more. That is what I think is important, and that is \non what I think we ought to be focused.\n  To sit and wring our hands and tell the American people there is \nnothing we can do, and all we are going to do is go out and tax and \ntax, which will not produce--we ought to be talking about production. \nThe legislation I have introduced today talks about production. It \ntalks about production in a positive way.\n  I mentioned a few moments ago the action we took last year in lease \nsale 181. We were successful in bringing Florida along in their \ncooperation and understanding, which was phenomenally important.\n  We know there are millions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic \nfeet of gas out there. What is most significant about oil development \nin this region is that the infrastructure is in place. What do I mean? \nRefineries, pipelines, capacity. We don't have to wait 5, 6, and 7 \nyears just to build the infrastructure. It is there, and the oil is \nunder it. That is why we did lease sale 181. But there is a lot more we \ncan and should do. That is why the legislation I have introduced today \ndoes just that. It doesn't start drilling, but it says a couple of \nthings that are quite simple.\n  As we have heard others talk about the fact we are putting money into \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, we are buying oil off the \nmarket and putting it underground in the salt domes in the South for a \ntime of necessity, I suggest we stop doing that for the time being, and \nI suggest we take that money we are using for those purposes and we \nmodernize our inventory of our known reserves, our unknown reserves, \nand our capacity because the true SPR--SPR means Strategic Petroleum \nReserve--the greatest reserve in the world is to know what we have, \nwhere it is, and how we can access it. That is one of the most \nimportant things we can do for the consumers of America today.\n  I know it frustrated some of my Floridian friends when I talked about \nour inability because of policy to allow our companies to go in to the \nnorthern area off Cuba and drill because Cuba was allowing other \ncountries to come in and develop. Just 90 miles--45 miles until you hit \nthe zone--90 miles off our coast on the extreme of the Florida Keys \nthere are foreign nations drilling oil today. India is there, and India \nhas now discovered oil. China is there, and China has now discovered \noil. We are not there today because our policy is 45 years old and \nstill says: No, no, Americans cannot get involved with Cuba, even \nthough we believe Cuba has phenomenal potential oil reserves. Shame on \nus.\n  America, listen up: It is Government policy today in large part that \nhas caused you the pain at the pump, and it is very important that \nGovernment act today to reduce that pain.\n  The legislation I am offering would create an inventory that would do \njust that. It would allow us to know what our reserves are.\n  We have moratoriums off the coast of Florida, and yet we know there \nare huge oil reserves out there. Why are we not doing something about \nit? Well, it is local politics. It is national politics. It is green \npolitics. It is politics. That is why we have the price of oil we have \ntoday, nothing more and nothing less but politics, and our economy is \ngrowing more fragile by the moment because of it.\n  Is it demagogic to say that? I don't think so. I don't think so at \nall. I pulled out the sign, the no zone. The no is a result of \npolitics, whether it is the politics of the State of Florida or the\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\npolitics of the State of California or whether it is the national \npolitics of this Senate that will not allow for us to drill for the \nreserves in what is known as ANWR, the Alaskan national wildlife area, \nwhere we know there is phenomenal abundance.\n  It was all done, all of this no, this political no was all done in \nthe name of the environment. There was some reason at the time these \nold ideas were put in place. We had the oil spills off the coast of \nSanta Barbara, and as a result of that, Americans were concerned. So \nCalifornia said no more drilling there, and then we followed up.\n\n  A few years ago, we had a great national tragedy in the gulf area of \nour country. That tragedy was called Katrina. She came rolling up and \nthrough the gulf. We know what she did in New Orleans. She did \nsomething else nobody wants to talk about today. She knocked offline \nhundreds of oil wells that were producing out in the gulf--knocked them \noff. She even set some of the drilling rigs adrift. But not a drop of \noil was spilled. Why? Because modern technology today and American \nknow-how and a concern for protecting our environment has produced one \nof the cleanest deepwater oil drilling industries in the world. We are \nproducing in this area of the gulf off the coast of Texas, off the \ncoast of Louisiana, off the coast of Mississippi, and with 181, we just \nbrought into or soon will be bringing into production off the coast of \nAlabama. Why not off the coast of Florida? Why not off the coast of \nCalifornia? Why not off the coast of the Carolinas, Virginia, and on up \nwhere we believe there is significant gas and oil reserves?\n  It is old politics of the past that is caught in the ghosts of Santa \nBarbara of decades ago. Yet our technology today will take us there, \nbut our politics will not take us there. That is why I have introduced \nthe legislation I have. The least we can do is inventory with modern \ntechnology to know where our oil is.\n  I notice the president of Shell said in a press release the other \nday: If Americans sent a message to the world that we were going to \nstart drilling our own reserves and bringing them into production, the \nprice of gas at the pump would drop dramatically, 25 or 30 cents a \ngallon or more. That is significant stuff, both short term and long \nterm, to the economy of this country.\n  I say to my colleagues, I say to our country, and I say to our \nconsumers: Is it a time to act? You bet it is a time to act. While some \nsuggest we tax the big boys out of existence, we do not produce \nanything by doing that, while we can create all kinds of other \nstructures. Do we produce more, do we build refinery capacity, and do \nwe assure the American public while we are transitioning into hybrid \ncars and electric cars and hydrogen cars and all of those kinds of \nactivities that we support and are doing research and development on \ntoday that they will still have an abundant supply of energy? That is \nour job. That is the job we failed in doing over the last good number \nof years, and that is the job we ought to stop and start over and do it \nright and reward the States that are the boundary States to the \nproduction of the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  We have huge oil reserves in this country, and yet we are letting the \nrest of the world have our wealth. Why not keep our wealth in this \ncountry by the development of these reserves?\n  The first step is the legislation I have introduced today. Let's at \nleast in the next few years do the inventory, the modern, sophisticated \nseismographic inventory that USGS can do to let us know how much is out \nthere because what we know today is simply old stuff. Those efforts \nwere done years ago. Already out at the edge of this green line in the \ndeepest waters in the gulf under the newest drilling technologies, we \nare finding phenomenal oil that just a few years ago we did not even \nknow we could get to. We are getting to it. We are producing it. It is \nclean, and it is environmentally sound. We ought to be doing that \neverywhere else.\n  I have joined my colleague from Louisiana who just came to the floor, \nwho introduced legislation that says when oil gets to $125 a barrel, we \nought to give the States the option to allow the development of the \nOuter Continental Shelf off their State. You darn bet we ought to, and \nthose States ought to be rewarded for it.\n  There is so much this country can continue to do instead of standing \nstill and wringing our hands and trying to blame somebody else for our \nfailure over the last 20 years to continue to allow this great country \nto produce for its consumers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 10 seconds?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend him for this initiative, but I \nhope he says ``oil and gas'' because off the east coast there is an \nabundance of gas, as shown by the previous studies. As he says, they \nhave to be brought up to date. Do let us invoke gas because along the \nbeaches--and I, as the Senator knows, twice tried to get legislation \nthrough, and a collection of Senators--and I say this in a lighthearted \nway; I call them the beach boys--will not permit this for fear that \npollution could emanate from the drilling process onto their beaches.\n  I suggest let's start with gas. There would not be any potential for \nthe erosion of beaches as a consequence of an accidental spill. I do \nhope the Senator puts in the word ``gas.''\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Virginia. \nHe is absolutely right. When I think oil, I think gas because, \nobviously, in lease sale 181 and in other areas where there is gas, \nthere is oftentimes oil, and oftentimes where there is gas, there is no \noil. We believe that to be the case off the coast of Virginia.\n  The Senator from Virginia has been a leader, without doubt, in that \nvery kind of effort to allow at least the seismographic effort, the \nexploration that would determine for us the kinds of reserves we have \nand may have for the future.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Idaho. I also \nemphasize that the technology to do it safely and not be the victim of \na disruption by Mother Nature is there.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Without question it is there today, and we know that. We \nare the leaders of clean drilling in deep water for the world, no \nquestion.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I wish him well. He has my support.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator mind putting up his map with \nthe State of Florida on it?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am more than happy to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator recognize that the area in \nyellow there on the west coast of Florida that he indicates for future \ndrilling--would he recognize almost that entire area is the largest \ntesting and training area for the U.S. military in the world? The \nmilitary is on record at all levels, of all generals and admirals, that \ndrilling should not be done in that area to compromise our training and \ntesting mission for the U.S. military.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do recognize that. I do appreciate what our military has \nsaid.\n  I also understand a few years ago we took offline a naval training \narea in Vieques. Why? It was no longer a popular thing to do.\n  If there is oil under this area--and we believe there is--and it is a \ntraining area, why couldn't we train here? Or why couldn't we train \nover here? The reality is, what is at this time more valuable?\n  It is very easy to say don't do it. Or is it possible to say can we \ndo both? There are a good many experts and professionals in the field \nwho said that. We can have a military training area, and guess what we \nalso can do. We can pull the oil out from under. How do you do it? \nQuite simply. You put a location, a location and you slant drill \nthousands of feet and you do not have to pepper the area with all kinds \nof drilling rigs.\n  Today's technology is amazing. It is politically comfortable, I \nappreciate that, and I understand the State's politics and I do not \ndeny that--but this is not the oil of the State of Florida. This is the \noil of the citizens of our country. It is the politics of Florida today \nthat deny us the oil, not the politics of America. So it is a simple \nquestion: Should we inventory it? Should we know what it is? And should \nwe, under modern technology, reward the State of Florida for the \npotential benefit?\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\n  It is ironic we did not move at all to stop drilling 45 miles off the \nFlorida coast. We could even take a 45-mile zone here, or more, \nconsistent with what is going on in Florida today and still protect \nthis.\n  But the Senator is right. It is a military area. Guess what. I am \nkind of a modern guy. I believe in technology taking us where we can go \nand having the best of both worlds. But right now the American consumer \nhas the worst of the world we have created for them--a scarcity of a \nsupply that is driving costs and impacting our economy in a significant \nway.\n  I suggest the legislation I have introduced, while it will not impact \nthe State of Florida, will give us a base and an understanding and \nknowledge of what we have as a reserve. We are spending millions of \ndollars a day to buy oil and put it in the ground when, in fact, we \nought to spend a few million dollars and find out about all the oil we \nalready have.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2956. A bill to ensure that persons who form corporations in the \nUnited States disclose the beneficial owners of those corporations, in \norder to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations \nfor criminal gain, to assist law enforcement in detecting, preventing, \nand punishing terrorism, money laundering, and other misconduct \ninvolving United States corporations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, with my colleagues \nSenator Coleman and Senator Obama, the Incorporation Transparency and \nLaw Enforcement Assistance Act. This bill tackles a longstanding \nhomeland security problem involving inadequate State incorporation \npractices that leave this country unnecessarily vulnerable to \nterrorists, criminals, and other wrongdoers, hinder law enforcement, \nand damage the international stature of the U.S.\n  The problem is straightforward. Each year, the States allow persons \nto form nearly 2 million corporations and limited liability companies \nin this country without knowing--or even asking--who the beneficial \nowners are behind those corporations. Right now, a person forming a \nU.S. corporation or limited liability company, LLC, provides less \ninformation to the State than is required to open a bank account or \nobtain a driver's license. Instead, States routinely permit persons to \nform corporations and LLCs under State laws without disclosing the \nnames of any of the people who will control or benefit from them.\n  It is a fact that criminals are exploiting this weakness in our State \nincorporation practices. They are forming new U.S. corporations and \nLLCs, and using these entities to commit crimes ranging from terrorism \nto drug trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, financial fraud, \nand corruption. Law enforcement authorities investigating these crimes \nhave complained loudly for years about the lack of beneficial ownership \ninformation.\n  Last year, for example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sent a \nletter to the States stating: ``the lack of transparency with respect \nto the individuals who control privately held for-profit legal entities \ncreated in the U.S. continues to represent a substantial vulnerability \nin the U.S. anti-money laundering/counter terrorist financing, AML/CFT, \nregime. . . . [T]he use of U.S. companies to mask the identity of \ncriminals presents an ongoing and substantial problem . . . for U.S. \nand global law enforcement authorities.''\n  Last month, Secretary Michael Chertoff, head of the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, wrote the following: ``In countless \ninvestigations, where the criminal targets utilize shell corporations, \nthe lack of law enforcement's ability to gain access to true beneficial \nownership information slows, confuses or impedes the efforts by \ninvestigators to follow criminal proceeds. This is the case in \nfinancial fraud, terrorist financing and money laundering \ninvestigations. . . . It is imperative that States maintain beneficial \nownership information while the company is active and to have a set \ntime frame for preserving those records. . . . Shell companies can be \nsold and resold to several beneficial owners in the course of a year or \nless. . . . By maintaining records not only of the initial beneficial \nownership but of the subsequent beneficial owners, States will provide \nlaw enforcement the tools necessary to clearly identify the individuals \nwho utilized the company at any given period of time.''\n\n  These types of complaints by U.S. law enforcement, their pleas for \nassistance, and their warnings about the dangers of anonymous U.S. \ncorporations operating here and abroad are catalogued in a stack of \nreports and hearing testimony from the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \nNetwork of the Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue \nService, and others.\n  To add insult to injury, our law enforcement officials have too often \nhad to stand silent when asked by their counterparts in other countries \nfor information about who owns a U.S. corporation committing crimes in \ntheir jurisdictions. The reality is that the United States is as bad as \nany offshore jurisdiction when it comes to responding to those \nrequests--we can't answer them because we don't have the information.\n  In 2006, the leading international anti-money laundering body in the \nworld, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering--known as \nFATF--issued a report criticizing the U.S. for its failure to comply \nwith a FATF standard requiring countries to obtain beneficial ownership \ninformation for the corporations formed under their laws. This standard \nis one of 40 FATF standards that this country has publicly committed \nitself to implementing as part of its efforts to promote strong anti-\nmoney laundering laws around the world.\n  FATF gave the U.S. 2 years, until July 2008, to make progress toward \ncoming into compliance with the FATF standard on beneficial ownership \ninformation. That deadline is right around the comer, but we have yet \nto make any real progress. That is another reason why we are \nintroducing this bill today. Enacting the bill would bring the U.S. \ninto compliance with the FATF standard by requiring the States to \nobtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations formed \nunder their laws. It would ensure that the U.S. met its international \ncommitment to comply with FATF anti-money laundering standards.\n  The bill being introduced today is the product of years of work by \nthe U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which I, \nSenator Coleman, and Senator Obama serve together. As long ago as 2000, \nthe Government Accountability Office, GAO, at my request, conducted an \ninvestigation and released a report entitled, Suspicious Banking \nActivities: Possible Money Laundering by U.S. Corporations Formed for \nRussian Entities. This report revealed that one person was able to set \nup more than 2,000 Delaware shell corporations and, without disclosing \nthe identity of the beneficial owners, open U.S. bank accounts for \nthose corporations, which then collectively moved about $1.4 billion \nthrough the accounts. It is one of the earliest Government reports to \ngive some sense of the law enforcement problems caused by U.S. \ncorporations with unknown owners. It sounded the alarm sounded 8 years \nago, but to little effect.\n  In April 2006, in response to a Levin-Coleman request, GAO released a \nreport entitled, Company Formations: Minimal Ownership Information Is \nCollected and Available, which reviewed the corporate formation laws in \nall 50 States. GAO disclosed that the vast majority of the States don't \ncollect any information at all on the beneficial owners of the \ncorporations and LLCs formed under their laws. The report also found \nthat many States have established automated procedures that allow a \nperson to form a new corporation or LLC within the State within 24 \nhours of filing an online application without any prior review of that \napplication by a State official. In exchange for a substantial fee, two \nStates will even form a corporation or LLC within one hour of a \nrequest. After examining these State incorporation practices, the GAO \nreport described the problems that the lack of beneficial ownership \ninformation has caused for a range of law enforcement investigations.\n  In November 2006, our Subcommittee held a hearing further exploring \nthis\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nissue. At that hearing, representatives of the U.S. Department of \nJustice, DOJ, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of \nTreasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, testified that \nthe failure of States to collect adequate information on the beneficial \nowners of the legal entities they form has impeded Federal efforts to \ninvestigate and prosecute criminal acts such as terrorism, money \nlaundering, securities fraud, and tax evasion. At the hearing, DOJ \ntestified: ``We had allegations of corrupt foreign officials using \nthese [U.S.] shell accounts to launder money, but were unable--due to \nlack of identifying information in the corporate records--to fully \ninvestigate this area.'' The IRS testified: ``Within our own borders, \nthe laws of some states regarding the formation of legal entities have \nsignificant transparency gaps which may even rival the secrecy afforded \nin the most attractive tax havens.'' FinCEN identified 768 incidents of \nsuspicious international wire transfer activity involving U.S. shell \ncompanies.\n  In addition, last year, when listing the ``Dirty Dozen'' tax scams \nfor 2007, the IRS highlighted shell companies with unknown owners as \nnumber four on the list, as follows:\n\n       ``4. Disguised Corporate Ownership: Domestic shell \n     corporations and other entities are being formed and operated \n     in certain states for the purpose of disguising the ownership \n     of the business or financial activity. Once formed, these \n     anonymous entities can be, and are being, used to facilitate \n     underreporting of income, non-filing of tax returns, listed \n     transactions, money laundering, financial crimes and possibly \n     terrorist financing. The IRS is working with state \n     authorities to identify these entities and to bring their \n     owners into compliance.''\n\n  That is not all. Dozens of Internet websites advertising corporate \nformation services highlight the fact that some of our States allow \ncorporations to be formed under their laws without asking for the \nidentity of the beneficial owners. These websites explicitly point to \nanonymous ownership as a reason to incorporate within the U.S., and \noften list certain States alongside notorious offshore jurisdictions as \npreferred locations for the formation of new corporations, essentially \nproviding an open invitation for wrongdoers to form entities within the \nU.S.\n  One website, for example, set up by an international incorporation \nfirm, advocates setting up companies in Delaware by saying: \n``DELAWARE--An Offshore Tax Haven for Non US Residents.'' It cites as \none of Delaware's advantages that: ``Owners' names are not disclosed to \nthe state.'' Another website, from a U.K. firm called ``formacompany-\noffshore.com,'' lists the advantages to incorporating in Nevada. Those \nadvantages include: ``No I.R.S. Information Sharing Agreement'' and \n``Stockholders are not on Public Record allowing complete anonymity.''\n  Despite this type of advertising, years of law enforcement \ncomplaints, and mounting evidence of abuse, many of our States are \nreluctant to admit there is a problem with establishing U.S. \ncorporations and LLCs with unknown owners. Too many of our States are \neager to explain how quick and easy it is to set up corporations within \ntheir borders, without acknowledging that those same quick and easy \nprocedures enable wrongdoers to utilize U.S. corporations in a variety \nof crimes and tax dodges both here and abroad.\n  Since 2006, the Subcommittee has worked with the States to encourage \nthem to recognize the homeland security problem they've created and to \ncome up with their own solution. After the Subcommittee's hearing on \nthis issue, for example, the National Association of Secretaries of \nState, NASS, convened a 2007 task force to examine State incorporation \npractices. At the request of NASS and several States, I delayed \nintroducing legislation while they worked on a proposal to require the \ncollection of beneficial ownership information. My Subcommittee staff \nparticipated in multiple conferences, telephone calls, and meetings; \nsuggested key principles; and provided comments to the Task Force.\n  In July 2007, the NASS task force issued a proposal. Rather than cure \nthe problem, however, the proposal was full of deficiencies, leading \nthe Treasury Department to state in a letter that the NASS proposal \n``falls short'' and ``does not fully address the problem of legal \nentities masking the identity of criminals.''\n  Among other shortcomings, the NASS proposal does not require States \nto obtain the names of the natural individuals who would be the \nbeneficial owners of a U.S. corporation or LLC. Instead, it would allow \nStates to obtain a list of a company's ``owners of record'' who can be, \nand often are, offshore corporations or trusts. The NASS proposal also \ndoesn't require the States themselves to maintain the beneficial \nownership information, or to supply it to law enforcement upon receipt \nof a subpoena or summons. The proposal also fails to require the \nbeneficial ownership information to be updated over time. These and \nother flaws in the proposal have been identified by the Treasury \nDepartment, the Department of Justice, myself, and others, but NASS has \ngiven no indication that the flaws will be corrected.\n  It is deeply disappointing that the States, despite the passage of \nmore than one year, have been unable to devise an effective proposal. \nPart of the difficulty is that the States have a wide range of \npractices, differ on the extent to which they rely on incorporation \nfees as a major source of revenue, and differ on the extent to which \nthey attract non-U.S. persons as incorporators. In addition, the States \nare competing against each other to attract persons who want to set up \nU.S. corporations, and that competition creates pressure for each \nindividual State to favor procedures that allow quick and easy \nincorporations. It is a classic case of competition causing a race to \nthe bottom, making it difficult for any one State to do the right thing \nand request the names of the beneficial owners.\n\n  That is why we are introducing Federal legislation today. Federal \nlegislation is needed to level the playing field among the States, set \nminimum standards for obtaining beneficial ownership information, put \nan end to the practice of States forming millions of legal entities \neach year without knowing who is behind them, and bring the U.S. into \ncompliance with its international commitments.\n  The bill's provisions would require the States to obtain a list of \nthe beneficial owners of each corporation or LLC formed under their \nlaws, to maintain this information for 5 years after the corporation is \nterminated, and to provide the information to law enforcement upon \nreceipt of a subpoena or summons. If enacted, this bill would ensure, \nfor the first time, that law enforcement seeking beneficial ownership \ninformation from a State about one of its corporations or LLCs would \nnot be turned away empty-handed.\n  The bill would also require corporations and LLCs to update their \nbeneficial ownership information in an annual filing with the State of \nincorporation. If a State did not require an annual filing, the \ninformation would have to be updated each time the beneficial ownership \nchanged.\n  In the special case of U.S. corporations formed by non-U.S. persons, \nthe bill would go farther. Following the lead of the Patriot Act which \nimposed additional due diligence requirements on certain financial \naccounts opened by non-U.S. persons, our bill would require additional \ndue diligence for corporations beneficially owned by non-U.S. persons. \nThis added due diligence would have to be performed--not by the \nStates--but by the persons seeking to establish the corporations. These \nincorporators would have to file with the State a written certification \nfrom a corporate formation agent residing within the State attesting to \nthe fact that the agent had verified the identity of the non-U.S. \nbeneficial owners of the corporation by obtaining their names, \naddresses, and passport photographs. The formation agent would be \nrequired to retain this information for a specified period of time and \nproduce it upon request.\n  The bill would not require the States to verify the ownership \ninformation provided to them by a formation agent, corporation, LLC, or \nother person filing an incorporation application. Instead, the bill \nwould establish Federal civil and criminal penalties for anyone who \nknowingly provided a State with false beneficial ownership information \nor intentionally failed to provide the State with the information \nrequested.\n  The bill would also exempt certain corporations from the disclosure \nobligation. For example, it would exempt\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\nall publicly-traded corporations and the entities they form, since \nthese corporations are already overseen by the Security and Exchange \nCommission SEC. It would also allow the States, with the written \nconcurrence of the Homeland Security Secretary and the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral, to identify certain corporations, either individually or as a \nclass, that would not have to list their beneficial owners, if \nrequiring such ownership information would not serve the public \ninterest or assist law enforcement in their investigations. These \nexemptions are expected to be narrowly drafted and rarely granted, but \nare intended to provide the States and Federal law enforcement added \nflexibility to fine-tune the disclosure obligation and focus it where \nit is most needed to stop crime, tax evasion, and other wrongdoing.\n\n  Another area of flexibility in the bill involves privacy issues. The \nbill deliberately does not take a position on the issue of whether the \nStates should make the beneficial ownership information they receive \navailable to the public. Instead, the bill leaves it entirely up to the \nStates to decide whether and under what circumstances to make \nbeneficial ownership information available to the public. The bill \nexplicitly permits the States to place restrictions on providing \nbeneficial ownership information to persons other than government \nofficials. The bill focuses instead only on ensuring that law \nenforcement and Congress, when equipped with a subpoena or summons, are \ngiven ready access to the beneficial ownership information collected by \nthe States.\n  To ensure that the States have the funds needed to meet the new \nbeneficial ownership information requirements, the bill makes it clear \nthat States can use their DHS State grant funds for this purpose. Every \nState is guaranteed a minimum amount of DHS grant funds every year and \nmay receive funds substantially above that minimum. Every State will be \nable to use all or a portion of these funds to modify their \nincorporation practices to meet the requirements in the Act. The bill \nalso authorizes DHS to use appropriated funds to carry out its \nresponsibilities under the Act. These provisions will ensure that the \nStates have the funds needed for the modest compliance costs involved \nwith amending their incorporation forms to request the names of \nbeneficial owners.\n  It is common for bills establishing Federal standards to seek to \nensure State action by making some Federal funding dependent upon a \nState's meeting the specified standards. This bill, however, states \nexplicitly that nothing in the bill authorizes DHS to withhold funds \nfrom a State for failing to modify its incorporation practices to meet \nthe beneficial ownership information requirements in the Act. Instead, \nthe bill simply calls for a GAO report in 2012 to identify which \nStates, if any, have failed to strengthen their incorporation practices \nas required by the Act. After getting this status report, a future \nCongress can decide what steps to take, including whether to reduce any \nDHS funding going to the noncompliant States.\n  Finally, the bill would require the U.S. Department of the Treasury \nto issue a rule requiring formation agents to establish anti-money \nlaundering programs to ensure they are not forming U.S. corporations or \nLLCs for criminals or other wrongdoers. GAO would also be asked to \nconduct a study of existing State formation procedures for partnerships \nand trusts.\n  We have worked hard to craft a bill that would address, in a fair and \nreasonable way, the homeland security problem created by States \nallowing the formation of millions of U.S. corporations and LLCs with \nunknown owners. What the bill comes down to is a simple requirement \nthat States change their incorporation applications to add a question \nrequesting the names and addresses of the prospective beneficial \nowners. That is not too much to ask to protect this country and the \ninternational community from U.S. corporations engaged in wrongdoing \nand to help law enforcement track down the wrongdoers.\n  For those who say that, if the United States tightens its \nincorporation rules, new companies will be formed elsewhere, it is \nappropriate to ask exactly where they will go? Every country in the \nEuropean Union is already required to get beneficial information for \nthe corporations formed under their laws. Most offshore jurisdictions \nalready request this information as well, including the Bahamas, Cayman \nIslands, Jersey, and the Island of Man. Our States should be asking for \nthe same ownership information, but they don't, and there is no \nindication that they will any time in the near future, unless required \nto do so.\n  I wish Federal legislation weren't necessary. I wish the States could \nsolve this homeland security problem on their own, but ongoing \ncompetitive pressures make it unlikely that the States will reach \nagreement. We have waited more than a year already with no real \nprogress to show for it, despite repeated pleas from law enforcement.\n  Federal legislation is necessary to reduce the vulnerability of the \nUnited States to wrongdoing by U.S. corporations with unknown owners, \nto protect interstate and international commerce from criminals \nmisusing U.S. corporations, to strengthen the ability of law \nenforcement to investigate suspect U.S. corporations, to level the \nplaying field among the States, and to bring the U.S. into compliance \nwith its international anti-money laundering obligations.\n  There is also an issue of consistency. For years, I have been \nfighting offshore corporate secrecy laws and practices that enable \nwrongdoers to secretly control offshore corporations involved in money \nlaundering, tax evasion, and other misconduct. I have pointed out on \nmore than one occasion that corporations were not created to hide \nownership, but to shield owners from personal liability for corporate \nacts. Unfortunately, today, the corporate form has too often been \ncorrupted into serving those wishing to conceal their identities and \ncommit crimes or dodge taxes without alerting authorities. It is past \ntime to stop this misuse of the corporate form. But if we want to stop \ninappropriate corporate secrecy offshore, we need to stop it here at \nhome as well.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand put an end to incorporation practices that promote corporate \nsecrecy and render the United States and other countries vulnerable to \nabuse by U.S. corporations with unknown owners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n                                S. 2956\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Incorporation Transparency \n     and Law Enforcement Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Nearly 2,000,000 corporations and limited liability \n     companies are being formed under the laws of the States each \n     year.\n       (2) Very few States obtain meaningful information about the \n     beneficial owners of the corporations and limited liability \n     companies formed under their laws.\n       (3) A person forming a corporation or limited liability \n     company within the United States typically provides less \n     information to the State of incorporation than is needed to \n     obtain a bank account or driver's license and typically does \n     not name a single beneficial owner.\n       (4) Criminals have exploited the weaknesses in State \n     formation procedures to conceal their identities when forming \n     corporations or limited liability companies in the United \n     States, and have then used the newly created entities to \n     commit crimes affecting interstate and international commerce \n     such as terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, tax \n     evasion, securities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of \n     foreign corruption.\n       (5) Law enforcement efforts to investigate corporations and \n     limited liability companies suspected of committing crimes \n     have been impeded by the lack of available beneficial \n     ownership information, as documented in reports and testimony \n     by officials from the Department of Justice, the Department \n     of Homeland Security, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network of the Department of the Treasury, the Internal \n     Revenue Service, and the Government Accountability Office, \n     and others.\n       (6) In July 2006, a leading international anti-money \n     laundering organization, the Financial Action Task Force on \n     Money Laundering (in this section referred to as the \n     ``FATF''), of which the United States is a member, issued a \n     report that criticizes the United States for failing to \n     comply with a FATF standard on the need to collect beneficial \n     ownership information and urged the\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\n     United States to correct this deficiency by July 2008.\n       (7) In response to the FATF report, the United States has \n     repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their incorporation \n     practices by obtaining beneficial ownership information for \n     the corporations and limited liability companies formed under \n     the laws of such States.\n       (8) Many States have established automated procedures that \n     allow a person to form a new corporation or limited liability \n     company within the State within 24 hours of filing an online \n     application, without any prior review of the application by a \n     State official. In exchange for a substantial fee, 2 States \n     will form a corporation within 1 hour of a request.\n       (9) Dozens of Internet websites highlight the anonymity of \n     beneficial owners allowed under the incorporation practices \n     of some States, point to those practices as a reason to \n     incorporate in those States, and list those States together \n     with offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations for the \n     formation of new corporations, essentially providing an open \n     invitation to criminals and other wrongdoers to form entities \n     within the United States.\n       (10) In contrast to practices in the United States, all \n     countries in the European Union are required to identify the \n     beneficial owners of the corporations they form.\n       (11) To reduce the vulnerability of the United States to \n     wrongdoing by United States corporations and limited \n     liability companies with unknown owners, to protect \n     interstate and international commerce from criminals misusing \n     United States corporations and limited liability companies, \n     to strengthen law enforcement investigations of suspect \n     corporations and limited liability companies, to set minimum \n     standards for and level the playing field among State \n     incorporation practices, and to bring the United States into \n     compliance with its international anti-money laundering \n     obligations, Federal legislation is needed to require the \n     States to obtain beneficial ownership information for the \n     corporations and limited liability companies formed under the \n     laws of such States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to modernize credit union net worth standards, \nadvance credit union efforts to promote economic growth, and modify \ncredit union regularity standards and reduce burdens, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President today more than ever, credit unions are \na critical component of our nation's financial landscape. At a time \nwhen most financial institutions are retreating from the credit \nmarkets, credit unions are among the few lenders in the financial \nindustry demonstrating resiliency and strength. For example, while many \nmortgage lenders are struggling to stay afloat, the delinquency rate on \nmortgages issued by credit unions is less than one percent, and credit \nunions are still lending. Nonetheless, certain outdated regulatory \nrules impede the ability of credit unions to effectively carry out \ntheir role as savings and lending institutions for local communities \nand small businesses. Because I believe that credit unions are a \nstabilizing force in the domestic economy and play an important role in \nproviding financial services to local community and underserved groups, \nI am introducing the Credit Union Regulatory Improvements Act of 2008, \nCURIA.\n  The health of credit unions in today's turbulent economy is \nattributable to a business model that differs significantly from that \nof other financial institutions. Similar to banks and thrifts, credit \nunions act as intermediaries in the market for consumer finance. Credit \nunions, however, are governed by certain rules that take into account \ntheir position as cooperative lenders. Notably, credit unions operate \nas tax-exempt, nonprofit institutions. All credit union earnings are \nretained as capital or returned to members in the form of higher \ninterest rates on savings accounts, lower interest rates on loans, and \nother financial benefits. Second, credit unions are member-owned with \neach member entitled to one vote in selecting board members and other \ndecisions. Third, credit unions do not issue capital stock. Rather, \ncredit unions create capital by retaining earnings. Fourth, credit \nunions rely on volunteer, generally unpaid boards of directors elected \nfrom the membership. Lastly, credit unions are limited to accepting \nmembers identified in a credit union's articulated field of \nmembership--usually reflecting occupational, associational, or \ngeographical links or affinity.\n  In short, through a cooperative ownership structure, credit unions \noffer access to financial services to millions of Americans. As a \nresult of strong ties to their communities, credit unions help meet \nlocal needs, and in the process, encourage economic growth, job \ncreation, savings, and opportunities for small business owners. At the \nend of 2007, over 88 million individuals were members of state or \nfederally charted credit unions in the United States, including close \nto a million individuals in the State of Connecticut.\n  The legislation I am introducing will help modernize the Federal \nCredit Union Act, bringing antiquated rules into the era of twenty-\nfirst century consumer finance. CURIA would remove several instances of \nstatutory\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nmicromanagement that place unreasonable constraints on the ability of \ncredit unions and their boards to function efficiently and in the best \ninterests of their members. The first title would update current \ncapital requirements by implementing recommendations from the National \nCredit Union Administration, NCUA, the Federal regulatory body that \noversees credit unions. For purposes of setting capital requirements, \nCURIA would implement a rigorous, two-part net worth test that would \nmore closely track an institution's actual asset risk. The second title \nwould promote community development and local economic growth by \nproviding for modest expansion in credit union business lending. The \ntitle also includes provisions that would permit credit unions to \nextend services to areas with high unemployment and low incomes. The \nthird title would provide credit unions with relief from outdated \nregulatory burdens by authorizing the NCUA to increase maximum loan \nterms and raise interest rate ceilings in response to sustained \nincreases in prevailing market interest rate levels. The title would \nfurther allow greater credit union investment in credit union service \norganizations, allow limited investments in securities, and update \ncredit union governance rules.\n  Vigorous competition among financial service providers, new \ntechnology, and globalization have resulted in a financial marketplace \nwhere the products and actors are evolving at a much more rapid rate \nthan the statutes and regulations that govern them. While recent events \ndemonstrate that we must be prudent in our approach to financial \nregulation, we must not allow our rules to unjustifiably constrain \nthose actors, such as credit unions, that contribute to financial \nstability, community development, and long-term growth. The Credit \nUnion Regulatory Improvements Act is an important step toward \nmodernizing and calibrating our financial regulatory rules, I encourage \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a section-by-section analysis \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n          The Credit Union Regulatory Improvements Act of 2008\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       Section 1 would establish the short title of the bill as \n     the Credit Union Regulatory Improvements Act of 2008.\n\n\n                        Title I: Capital Reform\n\n     Section 101. Amendments to net worth categories\n       The Federal Credit Union Act presently specifies the amount \n     of capital credit unions must hold in order to protect their \n     safety and soundness and the solvency of the National Credit \n     Union Share Insurance Fund (``Insurance Fund''). Many \n     experts, however, have noted that this capital allocation \n     system is inefficient and does not appropriately account for \n     risk. Section 101 incorporates recent recommendations of the \n     National Credit Union Administration, NCUA, to provide a two-\n     tier capital and Prompt Corrective Action, PCA, system for \n     federally insured credit unions involving complementary \n     leverage and risk-based minimum capital requirements. Under \n     the proposed system, a well capitalized credit union must \n     maintain a leverage net worth ratio of 5.25% and a minimum \n     risk-based ratio of 10%. When a credit union's capital \n     deposit to the Insurance Fund (equal to 1% of insured \n     deposits) is added, a credit union's total net worth would \n     equal or exceed the capital requirements for FDIC-insured \n     banks and thrifts.\n     Section 102. Amendments relating to risk-based net worth \n         categories\n       Currently, only federally insured credit unions that are \n     considered ``complex'' must meet a risk-based net worth \n     requirement under the Federal Credit Union Act. Section 102 \n     would instead require all federally insured credit unions to \n     meet a risk-based net worth requirement, and it directs the \n     Board to take into account comparable risk standards for \n     FDIC-insured institutions when designing the risk-based \n     requirements appropriate to credit unions.\n     Section 103. Treatment based on other criteria\n       Section 103 would permit the NCUA Board to delegate to \n     regional directors the authority to lower by one level a \n     credit union's net worth category for reasons related to \n     interest-rate risk not captured in the risk-based ratios, \n     with any regional action subject to Board review.\n     Section 104. Definitions relating to net worth\n       Net worth, for purposes of prompt corrective action, is \n     currently defined as a credit union's retained earnings \n     balance under generally accepted accounting principles. \n     Section 104 would make three important revisions to this \n     definition. First, it clarifies that credit union net worth \n     ratios must be calculated without a credit union's capital \n     deposit with the Insurance Fund. Second, it provides a new \n     definition for ``risk-based net worth ratio'' as the ratio of \n     the net worth of the credit union to the risk assets of the \n     credit union. Third, it would permit the NCUA to impose \n     additional limitations on the secondary capital accounts used \n     to determine net worth for low-income community credit unions \n     where necessary to address safety and soundness concerns.\n\n    Section 105. Amendments relating to net worth restoration Plans\n\n       Section 105 would provide the NCUA Board with authority to \n     waive temporarily the requirement to implement a net worth \n     restoration plan for a credit union that becomes \n     undercapitalized due to disruption of its operations by a \n     natural disaster or a terrorist act. It would further permit \n     the Board to require any credit union that is no longer well \n     capitalized to implement a net worth restoration plan if it \n     determines the loss of capital is due to safety and soundness \n     concerns and those concerns remain unresolved by the credit \n     union.\n       This section would also modify the required actions of the \n     Board in the case of critically undercapitalized credit \n     unions in several ways. First, it would authorize the Board \n     to issue an order to a critically undercapitalized credit \n     union. Second, the timing of the period before appointment of \n     a liquidating agent could be shortened. Third, the section \n     would clarify the coordination requirement with state \n     officials in the case of state-chartered credit unions.\n\n\n                       Title II: Economic Growth\n\n     Section 201. Limits on member business loans\n       Section 201 would increase the current arbitrary asset \n     limit on credit union member business loans from the lesser \n     of 1.75 times actual net worth or 1.75 percent times net \n     worth for a well-capitalized credit union (12.25% of total \n     assets) to a flat limit of 20% of the total assets of a \n     credit union. This update would facilitate added member \n     business lending without jeopardizing safety and soundness at \n     participating credit unions, as the 20% cap would still be \n     equal to or stricter than business lending caps imposed on \n     other depository institutions.\n     Section 202. Definition of member business loans\n       Section 202 would give NCUA the authority to exclude loans \n     of $100,000 or less as de minimis, rather than the current \n     $50,000 exclusion, from calculation of the 20% cap on member \n     business loans. This change would thus facilitate the ability \n     of credit unions to make additional loans and encourage them \n     to make very small business loans. It also builds upon the \n     findings in a 2001 study by the Treasury Department that \n     found that ``. . . credit union member business loans share \n     many characteristics of consumer loans'' and that ``. . . \n     these loans are generally smaller and fully collateralized, \n     and borrower risk profiles are more easily determined.''\n     Section 203. Restrictions on member business loans\n       Section 203 would modify language in the Federal Credit \n     Union Act that currently prohibits a credit union from making \n     any new member business loans if its net worth falls below 6 \n     percent. This change would permit the NCUA to determine if \n     such a policy is appropriate and to oversee all member \n     business loans granted by an undercapitalized institution.\n     Section 204. Member business loan exclusion for loans to non-\n         profit religious organizations\n       To facilitate the ability of credit unions to support the \n     community development activities of non-profit religious \n     institutions, Section 204 would exclude loans or loan \n     participations by credit unions to non-profit religious \n     organizations from the member business loan limits contained \n     in the Federal Credit Union Act.\n     Section 205. Credit unions authorized to lease space in \n         buildings in underserved areas\n       In order to enhance the ability of federal credit unions to \n     assist underserved communities with their economic \n     revitalization efforts, Section 205 would allow a credit \n     union to lease space in a building or on property on which it \n     maintains a physical presence in an underserved area to other \n     parties on a more permanent basis. It would also permit a \n     federal credit union to acquire, construct, or refurbish a \n     building in an underserved community, then lease out excess \n     space in that building.\n     Section 206. Amendments relating to credit union service to \n         underserved areas\n       Section 206 would revise a provision of the 1998 Credit \n     Union Membership Access Act that has been incorrectly \n     interpreted as permitting only federal credit unions with \n     multiple common bond charters to expand services to \n     individuals and groups living or working in areas of high \n     unemployment and below median incomes that typically are \n     underserved by other depository institutions. The change \n     would reestablish prior NCUA policy of permitting all federal \n     credit unions, regardless of charter type, to expand services \n     to eligible communities that the Treasury Department \n     determines meet income, unemployment and other distress \n     criteria.\n     Section 207. Underserved areas defined\n       Section 207 would expand the criteria for determining \n     whether a community or rural area qualifies as an underserved \n     area. The\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\n     definition of a qualified underserved area includes not only \n     areas currently eligible as ``investment areas'' under the \n     Treasury Department's Community Development Financial \n     Institutions (CDFI) program, but also census tracts \n     qualifying as ``low income areas'' under the New Markets Tax \n     Credit targeting formula adopted by Congress in 2000.\n\n\n                  Title III: Regulatory Modernization\n\n     Section 301. Investments in securities by federal credit \n         unions\n       The Federal Credit Union Act presently limits the \n     investment authority of federal credit unions to loans, \n     government securities, deposits in other financial \n     institutions, and certain other limited investments. Section \n     301 would provide additional investment authority to allow \n     credit unions to purchase for the credit union's own account \n     certain investment grade securities. The total amount of the \n     investment securities of any one obligor or maker could not \n     exceed 10% of the credit union's net worth and total \n     investments could not exceed 10% of total assets.\n     Section 302. Authority of NCUA to establish longer maturities \n         for certain credit union loans\n       The Federal Credit Union Act was amended in 2006 to allow \n     the NCUA Board to increase the 12-year maturity limit on non-\n     real estate secured loans to 15 years. Section 302 would \n     further provide the Board with additional flexibility to \n     issue regulations providing for loan terms exceeding 15 years \n     for specific types of loans.\n     Section 303. Increase in 1 percent investment and loan limits \n         in credit union service organizations\n       The Federal Credit Union Act authorizes federal credit \n     unions to invest in organizations providing services to \n     credit unions and credit union members. Currently, an \n     individual federal credit union may invest in aggregate no \n     more than one percent of its unimpaired capital and surplus \n     in these organizations, commonly known as credit union \n     service organizations or CUSOs. Credit unions also are \n     limited in the amount they may loan to all CUSOs to one \n     percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 303 would \n     double the amount a credit union may invest in all CUSOs, and \n     the aggregate amount it may lend to CUSOs, to two percent of \n     credit union unimpaired capital and surplus.\n     Section 304. Voluntary mergers involving multiple common bond \n         credit unions\n       NCUA has identified ambiguous language in the 1998 Credit \n     Union Membership Access Act as creating uncertainty for \n     certain voluntary credit union mergers by requiring that \n     groups of more than 3,000 members be required to start a new \n     credit union rather than be incorporated as a new group \n     within a multiple common-bond credit union. Section 304 would \n     clarify that this numerical limitation would not apply to bar \n     groups of more than 3,000 members that are transferred \n     between two existing credit unions as part of a voluntary \n     merger.\n     Section 305. Conversions involving certain credit unions to a \n         community charter\n       In cases when a single or multiple common-bond federal \n     credit union converts to a community credit union charter, \n     there may be groups within the credit union's existing \n     membership that are located outside the new community \n     charter's geographic boundaries, but which desire to remain \n     part of the credit union and can be adequately served by the \n     credit union. Section 305 would require NCUA to establish the \n     criteria whereby it may determine that a member group or \n     other portion of a credit union's existing membership, \n     located outside of the community, can be satisfactorily \n     served and remain within the credit union's field of \n     membership.\n     Section 306. Credit union governance\n       Section 306 would provide federal credit union boards the \n     flexibility to expel a member, based on just cause, who is \n     disruptive to the operations of the credit union, including \n     harassing personnel and creating safety concerns, without the \n     need for a two-thirds vote of the membership present at a \n     special meeting as required by current law. The section would \n     also permit federal credit unions to limit the length of \n     service of their boards of directors to ensure broader \n     representation from the membership.\n     Section 307. Providing the National Credit Union \n         Administration with greater flexibility in responding to \n         market conditions\n       Currently, the NCUA Board may raise the usury interest rate \n     ceiling on loans by federal credit unions whenever it \n     determines that money market rates have increased over the \n     preceding six-month period and prevailing interest rates \n     threaten the safety and soundness of individual credit \n     unions. Section 307 would give the Board greater flexibility \n     to make such determinations based either on sustained \n     increases in money market interest rates or prevailing market \n     interest rate levels.\n     Section 308. Credit union conversion voting requirements\n       Section 308 includes several changes to current law \n     pertaining to credit union conversions to mutual thrift \n     institutions. It would increase the minimum member \n     participation requirement in any vote to approve a conversion \n     to 30% of the credit union's membership. It would require the \n     board of directors of a credit union considering conversion \n     to hold a general membership meeting one month prior to \n     sending out any notices about a conversion vote that contain \n     a voting ballot. It would also prohibit use of raffles, \n     contest, or any other promotions to encourage member voting \n     in a conversion vote.\n     Section 309. Exemption from pre-merger notification \n         requirement of the Clayton Act\n       Section 309 would give all federally insured credit unions \n     the same exemption that banks and thrift institutions already \n     have from pre-merger notification requirements and fees for \n     purposes of antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission \n     under the Clayton Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Bond, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Barrasso, \n        Mr. Bennett, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Thune, Mr.  Voinovich, Mr. \n        Allard, and Mr. McConnell).\n  S. 2958. A bill to promote the energy security of the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a few remarks about the energy \nsituation I would like to share with the Senate. Two months ago, I came \nto the floor to deliver a series of speeches on the State of our \nNation's energy security. I said then, unequivocally, that our Nation's \neconomic strength had been put in great peril by our growing dependence \non foreign oil.\n  I have been a member of the Energy Committee for 30 years and have \nserved as chairman of that committee, as well as the Budget Committee, \nfor a long period during that time. I have seen my share of serious \ndebate on energy and the economy, and I recognize how vital these \nissues are to our Nation's well-being.\n  Unfortunately, in these times of high gas prices and an approaching \nelection, I have also seen my share of not-so-serious debate. The \nAmerican people deserve better than false promises of short-term fixes, \ndriving season gimmicks, and empty threats to the Middle East.\n  I said in February--and I say it again today--the American people \ndeserve serious, thoughtful, long-term solutions to our ever-growing \nenergy crisis. If there are short-term solutions, or short-term aids, \nwe ought to share those, too, and get on with adopting them.\n  Investigating, taxing, and threatening our American oil and gas \ncompanies will do nothing to reduce the stranglehold foreign oil \ndependence has put on our economic strength, national security, and \nforeign policy agenda.\n  To blame either side of the aisle for the trouble this Nation is in \nmisses the point. The American people did not send us here to cast \nblame on one side or the other, and they certainly didn't send us here \nto put bandaids on serious illnesses that threaten our Nation.\n  My first year in the Senate was during a Republican administration, \nwhen a President set out an aggressive agenda to reduce our Nation's \noil imports.\n  At that time, we were importing 6 million barrels of oil a day, which \nrepresented 35 percent of our total oil consumption.\n  Fast forward 36 years to today. The aggressive agenda through several \nadministrations and Congresses under the control of both parties has \nfailed time and again. Today, we are more than 60 percent dependent on \nforeign oil which comes from some of the most hostile regimes in the \nworld. Over time, our consumption has grown at a moderate rate, but our \nimports have more than doubled to 13.4 million barrels per day. The \nresult is a rising cost of energy, a rising threat of disruption in our \nenergy supply, and a rising anger among our already burdened \nconstituents.\n  As I said today, the average price of gasoline is $3.62 a gallon, an \nalltime high for the 17th straight day. Crude oil closed above $113 per \nbarrel last night. The average approval rating of Congress has \nplummeted to 22 percent, and yet we continue to point fingers back and \nforth.\n  In the past few years, Congress has achieved significant success in \naddressing long-term energy security. We passed a 2005 bill that will \nbring us a nuclear renaissance, a 2006 bill that will bring us greater \ndomestic oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, and a 2007 bill \nthat will bring us increased fuel efficiency. That is a dramatic change \nin the CAFE standards.\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nThese were not little things, and they were hard to do. They were done \nwithout finger-pointing and with bipartisan support.\n  To face this new challenge, however, we must do even more. Debate \nabout energy, oil, and the environment has reached a fever pitch. The \nchallenge of our time will be how we meet a rising demand for energy \nfrom the literally billions of new consumers who wish to share in the \nbenefits of a global economy. I think we all know what that means. That \nmeans India, China, and other countries are adding to the demand part \nof the supply-and-demand cycles in mammoth ways. Already, China is \nmoving ahead as one of the largest importers of oil and users of oil in \nthe whole world. Just 10 years ago, or 12, they were hardly on the map. \nFor our Nation's future energy security and the world's, we will need \nto ensure our supply of energy is reliable, affordable, and abundant.\n  Today, I introduced the Domestic Energy Production Act of 2008. I ask \nunanimous consent that title be changed to the American Energy \nProduction Act of 2008.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that the clerk so change the bill, if they can. \nIf not, the Senator from New Mexico asks for the right to change it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the policies set forth in this bill \nwill begin to move us in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its passage and to look at it seriously.\n  First, the bill allows for States on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts \nto petition the Federal Government to opt out of the broad moratorium \nthat for two decades has locked up America's assets and forced us to \nturn toward unstable foreign nations to power our lives. I believe it \nis time that we ask the Atlantic and Pacific coastal States to take a \nreal look at whether we could drill distances from their shores without \ndoing any harm and adding substantially to the American supply for all \nour citizens, not just the coastal citizens. I believe the time is \nripe. I believe right-headed people will consider that might be a \nreality. If we were to do it, we were told just that contains literally \nmillions of barrels of crude oil and billions of cubic feet of natural \ngas for the American energy future.\n  First, this bill allows these Atlantic and Pacific coasts to petition \ntheir Government to opt out, as I said, and these are large quantities \nof assets that are American. Together, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans \ncontain oil reserves, and here are the numbers, what we know without \ndoing a detailed reconnaissance. There are reserves of up to 14 billion \nbarrels and natural gas reserves totaling 55 trillion cubic feet. Those \nare big enough for the American people to demand that everyone who \nrepresents States in this Senate look at this, whether they are coastal \nState Senators or not. America needs an honest evaluation because with \nthese States, if there was no damage--and I believe we can drill \nwithout any damage today--we might move in a direction, an honest \ndirection, of reducing dramatically what we must import overseas.\n  Opening them to leasing would literally bring billions of dollars to \nthe Federal Treasury and billions of dollars to the coastal States \nbecause they would share in it 37 percent, as we did with the coastal \nStates of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas when we, 2 years ago, did \nthe same thing for Gulf States and opened those areas for drilling. \nThose States abutting were positively impressed and helped by it \nbecause they wanted development and they also wanted to share in the \nroyalties. The new way we build platforms and drill is a far cry from \n20 years ago when coastal States were so worried. Actually, we can do \nit with little or no footprint, little or no seepage or damage, there \nis no question about it.\n  Next, the bill opens 2,000 acres of the 19 million acres of the \nArctic plain, or ANWR, for oil and gas leasing. In 1995, President \nClinton vetoed an ANWR bill, and the price of oil was $19 a barrel. As \na result, 1 million barrels of oil continue to sit beneath our ground \neach day instead of in our gas tanks. I believe the ultimate find, if \nwe are permitted to drill, would be much more than the million barrels, \nwithout a question. The footprint is so small, the new directional \ndrilling is so accurate that I believe it deserves an opportunity for \nthe Senate to look again and think again and for the American people to \nlook again and think again with us on what should be done. The price of \noil is now $113 a barrel. When we last voted, the price was somewhere \nabove $50 but certainly nothing like this.\n  Yesterday, I heard a colleague on the other side of the aisle urge \nOPEC nations to release 500,000 barrels of oil to the global market. \nToday, in introducing this bill, I respond to my colleagues to release \nmore than 1 million barrels to that supply, from our own lands, by \nsupporting my bill. We don't know how much more we will get if the \ncoastal States join in and begin lifting the moratorium. We may be able \nto send a message that more than the 500,000 barrels my colleague on \nthe other side sought and far more than the 1 million we would get from \nAlaska would be released into the American market.\n  This bill provides for a consolidated permitting process to ease \nconstraints on building refineries in this country. While we improved \nthe capacity over years, we consistently hear the criticism that no new \nrefinery has been built in our country for over 30 years. Our Nation \ncannot afford to go 30 more years without building additional \nrefineries.\n\n  The bill also provides a small measure of relief by suspending \ndelivery to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I ask my colleagues to \nconsider their views on certain issues. I remind them that this issue I \nhave reconsidered on my own. I believe it is appropriate in this \npricing environment that we stop filling the SPR for up to 6 months, \nthus providing 70,000 additional barrels of light sweet crude per day. \nThat might have an effect. Although it will be minor, it might be \nrecognizable on the price of oil. I think it is time to do that.\n  I told the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water \nDevelopment, with whom I serve and was the principal sponsor of this, \nthat I would join him in this when he was ready to move on the Senate \nfloor.\n  By its very nature, this is just a fraction of the oil that will be \ngained through OCS production. OCS is what I am talking about in the \nbill I introduced today, and ANWR, oil shale production, and coal-to-\nliquid production are in this bill. In today's environment, any small \namount helps the people of this country.\n  In the area of alternative resources, this bill requires studies on \nethanol to help ensure that smart decisions are made as we move toward \ncellulosic and other advanced biofuels. This bill provides incentives \nfor the advancement of breakthrough energy technologies, such as \nbattery-powered vehicles. That is important. It is obvious to everyone \nthat we have not moved ahead as rapidly as we should in battery \ndevelopment, and we ought to push hard with our greatest scientists \nbecause a change in the right direction there would be a dramatic \nchange in the right direction for automobiles that would be electric-\nmotored and that would be good for our country.\n  Our Nation is often called the Saudi Arabia of coal, and we should \nuse that domestic resource to help reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. This bill creates a mandate for up to 3 billion gallons of clean \ncoal-derived fuels over the next decade and 6 billion gallons over the \nnext 14 years. This will provide diesel and jet fuel to help power our \neconomy and create jobs throughout our coal-producing States.\n  Additionally, this provision requires that the mandated fuels have \nlife-cycle greenhouse gas emissions no greater than conventional \ngasoline.\n  This is a win-win for our economy and our environment. I don't know \nwhy it is so violently opposed by some in America. I think they just \ndon't want us to use our own if it means we are going to use it in \nautomobiles, diesel trucks, or the like. I don't understand. If we \ndon't do it, we will be using foreign oil unless and until we find a \ntotal new substitute, which will be years from now.\n  This bill also allows for the long-term procurement of synthetic \nfuels by the Department of Defense and repeals section 526 of last \nyear's Energy bill.\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\nThat provision ties greenhouse gas emission requirements to the types \nof fuels our Air Force can purchase. The practical translation is that \nin a time of war, this policy would direct our military to purchase oil \nfrom the sands of the Middle East rather than the oil sands of Canada.\n  While this bill takes many steps to strengthen our Nation's energy \nsecurity, it also repeals several provisions in last year's \nappropriations bills that threaten to damage our Nation's energy \nsecurity. At this point, most everyone knows what they are. I will \nmerely mention one of those that is big, and that is a mandate that was \nimposed on oil shale development in America.\n  Somebody in conference--I think we know which one but need not say \nsince it is not certain--put a rider on that bill that said the final \nregulations for shale development have a moratorium imposed. That comes \nat a time when Shell Oil and others are exploring the great potential \nof shale converted to oil. I don't see why we should do this. I believe \nwe should take that off and let them proceed. They will be bound by the \nlaws of our land, and obviously, with the high price of crude oil, it \nis clear to me that they are going to find a way to make oil shale \nequal to conventional oil and thus usable by Americans as American-\nproduced oil. We should let that happen as rapidly as possible and not \ndeter it. I know some will not agree, but I would think that debate, \ncarried to the American people, would be voted overwhelmingly in favor \nof letting it happen. That is why we put it in this bill.\n  Finally, this bill repeals a $4,000 fee for drilling permits. These \ncosts, slipped into a large Omnibus measure without notice or debate, \nhit the smallest oil and gas companies in our States. Making it more \ndifficult to produce domestic energy for domestic use will only serve \nto further increase the prices we pay at the pump.\n  As I complete my final year in the Senate, I look back on the many \naccomplishments this body has achieved for the American people. This \ngreat work has often been done when Members reached across the aisle \nafter thoughtful deliberation, serious debate, and reasoned judgment. I \nhope, as the Congress makes a serious effort to tackle the energy \nchallenges of our time, that we will address these challenges in the \nsame spirit.\n  As I said a few months ago on this floor that America faces a serious \nenergy crisis with vital implications for our national security, \neconomic strength, and foreign policy. The American people deserve a \nserious debate, for our present challenge will require thoughtfulness, \nvision, and judgment--not just today, but when the cameras are off, the \nelections are far away, and gas prices subside.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms.Klobuchar, Mr. Tester, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 2959. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \nStates to provide for election day registration; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce, along with \nSenators Klobuchar, Tester, and Harkin, the Election Day Registration \nAct of 2008, which would significantly increase voter participation by \nallowing all eligible citizens to register to vote in Federal elections \non Election Day.\n  In many ways, the machinery of our democracy needs significant \nrepair. We live in an age of low turnout and high cynicism. The \nAmerican people have lost faith in our election system, in part because \nthey are not confident that their votes will be counted or that the \nballot box is accessible to each and every voter regardless of ability, \nrace, or means.\n  What we see instead are long lines at polling places; faulty voting \nmachines; under-trained, under-paid, over-worked poll workers; partisan \nelection administrators; suspect vote tallies; caging lists; \nintimidation at the polling place; misleading flyers; illegal voter-\nfile purges; and now, the Supreme Court approving discriminatory voter \nID laws. If people cannot trust their elections, why should they trust \ntheir elected officials?\n  Two years ago, Professor Dan Tokaji, a leading election law expert, \ncalled for a ``moneyball approach to election reform.'' Named after \nMichael Lewis's book about the Oakland A's data-driven hiring system, \nTokaji's approach is quintessentially progressive, as that term was \nunderstood at the turn of the century. ``I mean to suggest a research-\ndriven inquiry,'' Tokaji wrote, ``in place of the anecdotal approach \nthat has too often dominated election reform conversations. While \nanecdotes and intuition have their place, they're no substitute for \nhard data and rigorous analysis.''\n  This bill embodies the moneyball approach to election reform. In \nstark contrast to many so-called election reform proposals, this bill \naddresses a real problem--low voter turnout--it targets a major cause \nof the problem--archaic registration laws--and it offers a proven \nsolution--Election Day registration.\n  The bill is very simple: it amends the Help America Vote Act to \nrequire every State to allow eligible citizens to register and vote in \na Federal election on the day of the election. Voters may register \nusing any form that satisfies the requirements of the National Voter \nRegistration Act, including the Federal mail-in voter registration form \nand any state's standard registration form. North Dakota, which does \nnot have voter registration, is exempted from the bill's requirements.\n  The bill itself is simple, but it addresses a significant problem: \nthe low voter turnout that has plagued this country for the last 40 \nyears. We live in a participatory democracy, where our Government \nderives its power from the consent of the governed, a consent embodied \nin the people's exercise of their fundamental right to vote. It is self \nevident that a participatory democracy depends on participation.\n  This may be a government of the people, but the people are not \nvoting. Since 1968, American political participation has hovered around \n50 percent for Presidential elections and 40 percent for congressional \nelections. Even in 2004, a record-breaking year, turnout was only 55 \npercent of the voting age population. The U.S. may be the only \nestablished democracy where the fact that a little under half of the \nelectorate stayed home is considered cause for celebration.\n  In fact, our predecessors in the Senate would be surprised to find us \ncelebrating such low turnout: a 1974 report by the Senate Committee on \nthe Post Office and Civil Service bemoaned the ``shocking'' drop in \nturnout in the 1972 election. And what was the number that so troubled \nthe Committee--55 percent.\n  The report went on: ``[i]t is the Committee's conviction that our \ndisquieting record of voter participation is in large part due to the \nhodgepodge of registration barriers put in the way of the voter. Such \nobstacles have little, if anything, to recommend them. At best, current \nregistration laws in the various states are outmoded and simply \ninappropriate for a highly mobile population. At worst, registration \nlaws can be construed as a deliberate effort to disenfranchise voters \nwho desperately need entry into the decision-making processes of our \ncountry.''\n  What a shame, that the Committee's findings are still valid. Our \narchaic registration laws have been reformed, but they are still \narchaic. We have passed a number of important bills designed to combat \nlow turnout, but turnout is still low. America is even more mobile than \nit was in 1974, and yet our registration laws are still out of touch \nwith the reality that more than 40 million Americans move every year. \nWorst of all, our registration laws still fall especially hard on the \nyoung, the old, and the poor.\n  We have long known that complicated voter registration requirements \nconstitute one of the major barriers to voting. In fact, many States \nadopted voter registration in order to prevent certain segments of the \npopulation from voting. Alexander Keyssar, the preeminent scholar on \nthe history of the right to vote in this country, writes that although \n``[r]egistration laws emerged in the nineteenth century as a means of \nkeeping track of voters and preventing fraud; they also served--and \nwere intended to serve--as a means of keeping African-American, \nworking-class, immigrant, and poor voters from the polls.''\n  It is time for a fundamental change. A large body of research tells \nus that unnecessarily burdensome voter registration requirements are \nthe single\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nlargest factor in preventing people from voting. Simply put, voter \nregistration restrictions should not keep eligible Americans from \nexercising their right to vote. The solution to this problem is \nElection Day registration.\n  Decades of empirical research confirm Election Day registration's \npositive impact on turnout. As one academic paper states, ``the \nevidence on whether EDR augments the electorate is remarkably clear and \nconsistent. Studies finding positive and significant turnout impacts \nare too numerous to list.'' Studies indicate that Election Day \nregistration alone increases turnout by roughly 5 to 10 percentage \npoints.\n  In general, States with Election Day registration boast voter turnout \nthat is 10-12 percentage points higher than States that require voters \nto register before Election Day. Turnout in Minnesota and Wisconsin, \nwhich implemented Election Day registration over 35 years ago, has been \nespecially high: in 2004, for example, 78 percent of eligible \nMinnesotans and 75 percent of eligible Wisconsinites went to the polls. \nThe last time national voter turnout was above 70 percent, it was 1896, \nthere were only 45 States, and the gold standard was the dominant \ncampaign issue.\n  Critics might worry about the possibility of fraud, but Election Day \nregistration actually makes the registration process more secure. \nVoters registering on Election Day do so in the presence of an \nelections official who verifies the voter's residency and identity on \nthe spot. Mark Ritchie, Minnesota's Secretary of State, points out that \nElection Day registration ``is much more secure because you have the \nperson right in front of you--not a postcard in the mail. That is a no-\nbrainer. We have 33 years of experience with this.''\n  In contrast to most election reforms, the cost of Election Day \nregistration is negligible. A recent survey of 26 local elections \nofficials in six EDR States found that ``officials agreed that \nincidental expense of administering EDR is minimal.'' In fact, Election \nDay registration may actually result in a net savings because it \nsignificantly reduces the use of provisional ballots. Provisional \nballots, which are required by the Help America Vote Act, are expensive \nto administer. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nprovisional ballots cost State and local governments about $25 million \na year.\n  In some states the number of provisional ballots cast is surprisingly \nlarge. For example, in 2004, more than 4 percent of California's \nregistered voters cast provisional ballots--that's 644,642 provisional \nballots. In Ohio, 157,714 provisional ballots were cast, about 2 \npercent of all registered voters.\n  In contrast, in 2004 only 0.03 percent of voters in EDR States cast a \nprovisional ballot. In Wisconsin, only 374 provisional ballots were \ncast. In Maine, only 95 provisional ballots were cast. In fact, only \n952 provisional ballots were cast in all the EDR States combined in \n2004. To be sure, this bill is no cure-all: it does not address long \nlines, deceptive flyers, and faulty voting machines. Other bills, good \nbills, address those issues.\n  The bottom line is this: the Election Day Registration Act would \nsubstantially increase civic participation, improve the integrity of \nthe electoral process, reduce election administration costs, and \nreaffirm that voting is a fundamental right. It has been proven \neffective by more than 30 years of successful implementation in \nMinnesota and Wisconsin and decades of empirical research. Election Day \nregistration is good for voters, good for taxpayers, and good for \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2959\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Election day registration.''.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak \nabout a fundamental right in this country: the right to vote. Although \nit is one of the greatest rights we have built this government on, we \nhave states across the country that still limit that right by not \nallowing people to vote if they have not met an arbitrary registration \ndeadline. A deadline that is sometimes set months in advance of \nElection Day. Since 1973, Minnesota has allowed citizens in the state \nto register to vote on the same day as the election, and, not \ncoincidentally, year after year, my state has the highest voter turnout \nin the country.\n  As the Presidential election is fast approaching, we need to ensure \nthat people across the country have the ability to vote when November \n4th, 2008, rolls around. This is why, Mr. President, I am happy that \nthis afternoon, Senator Feingold and I introduced legislation that \nenables voters in every state to register on Election Day for Federal \nelections. My colleague's home state of Wisconsin, like Minnesota, has \nput a high price on voter registration, and has allowed Election Day \nRegistration for over 30 years with great success. I am also pleased \nthat we are joined on this bill by Senator Harkin from Iowa and Senator \nTester from Montana. Both Iowa and Montana recently enacted same-day \nvoter registration laws--significantly improving voter turnout \nthroughout the state.\n  This legislation comes at a critical time--it is on the heels of a \nSupreme Court decision that tightens the ability of Indiana citizens to \nvote by requiring valid photo identification at the polling booth. And \njust this last week, several election registration volunteers in \nFlorida stopped their registration work for fear that they would be \nfined upwards of $1000 if they made a mistake.\n  In Minnesota, some credit the election of Jesse Ventura as Governor \nin 1998 to our same-day registration voting policy. Voters who had \nnever voted before showed up at the polls and voted in unprecedented \nnumbers. I can't say that I ever imagined that we would have a Governor \nwear a pink boa at his inaugural celebration, but the ability for the \ncitizens of Minnesota to cast their ballot and enact change is the kind \nof democracy this country is founded upon.\n  In the past decade, as states around the country are experimenting \nwith new and innovative ways to combat voter fraud, Election Day \nRegistration has actually helped eliminate voter fraud at the polls. \nI've worked a great deal with the Secretary of State in Minnesota, Mark \nRitchie, and he has found that registering at the polls, instead of by \nmail with a postcard, decreases the chance for fraud. When citizens are \nregistering right in front of the election official, on the day of the \nelection, chances of fraud are decreased. It's a pretty simple concept, \nbut a fundamental one. As Secretary of State Ritchie has said, it's ``a \nno-brainer.''\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\n  The myriad of voter registration laws across the country are mind-\nboggling. In Nevada, you must register by 9 p.m., on the fifth Saturday \nbefore the election. A handful of states require registration 25 days \nbefore the election, another handful require 29 days. Some have to be \npostmarked by that date, and others have to be received by the \ndeadline. A few set the cutoff at 20 days, a few at 10 days, and in \nVermont, you have until 5 p.m., the Wednesday before the election. If \nyou're in Utah, you must register 30 days before the election by mail, \nbut if you miss that, you can register in person on the 18th or 15th \nday before the election. Where we have one, national, election day of \nNovember 4th this year, it is hard to imagine voters, because of the \nState they reside, could miss their chance to vote.\n  There are 8 States that allow citizens to register at the polls: \nMaine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and now Iowa and \nMontana have joined the list. Historically, these first six States have \nseen voter turnout that is 8 to 15 percent higher than the national \naverage. In the 2004 Presidential election, only 64 percent of the \neligible population voted; but in Minnesota, 79 percent of the \npopulation turned out to vote. As Senator Feingold mentioned, the last \ntime we had turnout that high on a national level was 1896, and we only \nhad 45 states. No matter what side of the aisle, we are seeing an \nunprecedented interest in the upcoming Presidential election, and we \nneed to give the citizens the ability to register on Election Day.\n  This is a simple, yet fundamental bill. It amends legislation we \npassed in 2002, the Help America Vote Act, to allow voters to register \nand cast their ballot on the same day in a Federal election. Where \nAmericans across the country are facing skyrocketing gas prices, health \ncosts that many cannot afford, and an economy that is approaching \nrecession, we need to ensure that every citizen has the right to wake \nup on Election Day and decide they will cast their ballot for \nPresident.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Feingold, Harkin and Klobuchar in introducing a bill that \nwould significantly increase voter participation. The Election Day \nRegistration Act of 2008, EDR, would allow all eligible citizens to \nregister to vote in federal elections on Election Day.\n  Studies have shown a strong increase in voter turnout in those States \nwho have EDR. In 2004, 73.8 percent of all eligible voters in EDR \nstates voted, compared with 60.2 percent of eligible voters in states \nwithout EDR--a difference of 13.6 percentage points. The top four \nStates for turnout in 2004 had EDR--Minnesota 78 percent, Wisconsin 75 \npercent, Maine 73 percent, and New Hampshire 71 percent. The fifth \nhighest state was Oregon--the universal vote-by-mail state. Even more \ncompelling, the turnout is higher even when controlling for \ncompetitiveness--in terms of voter participation, ``safe'' states with \nEDR significantly outperformed ``safe'' states without EDR. Voter \nparticipation in those ``Battleground'' States with EDR was \nsignificantly higher than in those ``battleground'' states without EDR.\n  High voter participation is a fundamental part of a healthy \ndemocracy. This year we have seen record numbers of voters \nparticipating in the presidential primaries. The implementation of EDR \nfor federal elections would build upon this momentum. Montana is \nexpecting record turnout for our presidential primary on June 3rd.\n  EDR permits eligible citizens to register and vote on Election Day. \nThere are currently 9 states that have some form of EDR: Minnesota, \nMaine, Wisconsin, Idaho, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Iowa, North Carolina \nand of course my home state of Montana. Iowa adopted EDR in March 2007 \nand North Carolina has implemented Same Day Registration at early \nvoting sites. While the version in North Carolina isn't complete EDR, \nit is a strong move for increased access to the democratic process.\n  There is nationwide interest in EDR. Last year, 21 States had bills \nbefore their legislature to implement, or begin feasibility studies in \nsupport of, EDR.\n  In my home state of Montana we have had Election Day Registration. \nMontana adopted EDR in 2005 while I was president of the Montana state \nsenate. Montana's version is a little different from EDR in Wisconsin \nand Minnesota--in Montana, the voter registers, election day, at the \ncounty courthouse rather than at the polling place. Whether it is at \nthe polling place or the courthouse, the important fundamentals of \naccess are maintained.\n  With EDR, the use of and reliance upon provisional ballots would be \nminimized. Provisional ballots are useful and valuable tools, however \nwith EDR, the costly validation process that takes place after election \nday could be avoided, as eligibility considerations could be made on \nelection day and the voter would then use a standard ballot. EDR \nstreamlines the administrative process and makes sure that votes are \ncounted.\n  Enactment of EDR would be a major step in the right direction towards \ninclusive and fully participatory elections. It's clear that people are \nmore likely to vote when they know their votes will be counted. EDR has \nproven track record of increasing participation, and those concerns \nraised have been largely disproven or are easily addressed. In the end \nEDR allows more Americans to do that which is most fundamental to the \ndemocracy we love and the freedom we, as Americans, stand for--vote.\n  My cosponsors and I think this Election Day Registration Act of 2008 \nis necessary to strengthen our democracy. We welcome our fellow \nsenators to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2960. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, to \nestablish the Office for Bombing Prevention, to enhance the role of \nState and local bomb squads, public safety dive teams, explosive \ndetection canine teams, and special weapons and tactics teams in \nnational improvised explosive device prevention policy, to establish a \ngrant program to provide for training, equipment, and staffing of State \nand local improvised explosive device prevention, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nImprovised Explosive Device, IED, Preparedness and Prevention Act of \n2008. This bill will ensure that the brave men and women who are called \non to respond to bomb threats around the country have the necessary \ntools, training, and personnel to keep our communities safe.\n  Furthermore, this bill gives our State and local responders \nunprecedented access to the federal policy making committees directing \nthe national agencies that keep our homeland secure.\n  Regrettably, over the years, our people have suffered attacks from \nhome-made bombs, not only on distant battlefields of Iraq and \nAfghanistan, but here in America. From the 1983 truck bombing of the \nBeirut Barracks to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing in \nOklahoma City to the recent Times Square Military Recruiting Office \nbombing in New York City, we have seen the devastating effects such \nattacks wield.\n  These bombs, which have become known in the lexicon of the Pentagon \nas ``Improvised Explosive Devices'' or IEDs, are the number one cause \nof death and injury to our troops overseas. Whether it is in lives \nlost, economic damage, or the simple loss of feeling safe in our \ncommunities, IEDs pose a threat to American security.\n  We must therefore ensure that our state and local bomb squads, SWAT \nTeams, K-9 units, and public safety dive teams are sufficiently \nprepared to meet this challenge, as they most certainly will be the \nfirst on the scene to respond to the next IED scare. These courageous \npublic servants put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. \nThe least we can do is to make certain that they have the resources \nthey need and a seat at the table in critical IED policy making \ndiscussions. That is why I have introduced this legislation and have \nworked hard to address these very real needs.\n  Beginning in April 2006, I worked with Senator Robert Byrd to attach \na provision to a Homeland Security Appropriations bill requiring DHS to \nproduce a national strategy for IED preparedness.\n  After numerous delays, and a letter to Homeland Security Secretary\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\nChertoff from Senator Byrd and me, the National Security Council \nfinally approved the document in late 2007.\n  Unfortunately, the strategy did not include adequate detail on how \nstate and local input would contribute to the federal government's IED \nprevention and preparedness. It also failed to create an IED-specific \ngrant program to ensure that State and local governments can carry out \ntheir responsibilities under the strategy.\n  My bill will address the threat of IEDs by:\n  First, statutorily establishing the Office for Bombing Prevention OBP \nwithin FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate.\n  Second, tbe bill establishes a Senior Advisory Committee, SAC, for \nIED Prevention and Response as a subcommittee under the Homeland \nSecurity Advisory Council.\n  Third, the bill requires State, Local, and Practicing Professional \ninput in Advisory Committee Selection, giving voice to our First \nResponders who understand first-hand the needs of our communities.\n  Fourth, the legislation establishes a risk-based IED Prevention and \nResponse Grant Program within the Homeland Security Department's Grant \nProgram Directorate to specifically provide funds for equipment, \ntraining, and personnel in areas where DHS has identified shortfalls.\n  Last, my bill requires the Coast Guard to assess the preparedness of \nour Nation's Public Safety Dive Teams, PSDT, in the completion of Area \nMaritime Transportation Security and Facility Plans.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer afford to sit on our hands while many \nof our IED First Responders have to scrape by with antiquated equipment \nand training.\n  We have an opportunity to be proactive, to prepare for the \nunthinkable events that befell the people of London and Madrid, just a \nfew short years ago.\n  Our Nation needs demonstrated capability in this vital area, and we \nin Congress need to lead. I urge my colleagues to join me in this \nendeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2961. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance the \nrefinancing of home loans by veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will offer \nveterans more options for refinancing their mortgages. My legislation \nwould raise the guarantee on VA refinance loans and decrease equity \nrequirements for refinancing to a VA loan. These provisions would allow \nmore qualified veterans to refinance their home loans under the VA \nprogram.\n  At present, the maximum VA loan guaranty limit for all loans in \nexcess of $144,000, except regular refinance loans, is equal to 25 \npercent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit for a single family \nhome. Presently this is $104,250. This means lenders making loans up to \n$417,000 will receive at least a 25 percent guaranty, which is \ntypically required to place the loan on the secondary market.\n  However, current law limits to $36,000 the guaranty that can be used \nfor a regular refinance loan. This restriction means a refinance over \n$144,000 will result in a lender not receiving 25 percent backing from \nVA and probably not making the loan at all. This situation essentially \nprecludes a veteran from being able to refinance his or her existing \nFHA or conventional loan into a VA guaranteed loan if the loan is \ngreater than $144,000.\n  To assist veterans in overcoming this obstacle in refinancing, this \nlegislation would increase the maximum guaranty limit for refinance \nloans to the same level as conventional loans--25 percent limit for a \nsingle family home. Importantly, this increase would make the maximum \nVA home loan guaranty equal across the board.\n  This bill will also increase the percentage of an existing loan that \nVA will refinance from the current maximum of 90 percent to 95 percent, \nthus allowing more veterans to use their VA benefit to refinance their \nmortgages. Many veterans do not have ten percent equity and thus are \nprecluded from refinancing to a VA home loan. Given the anticipated \nnumber of non-VA adjustable mortgages that are approaching the reset \ntime when payments are likely to increase, it seems prudent to \nfacilitate veterans refinancing to VA loans.\n  In light of today's housing and home loan crises, these further \nrefinancing options will help some veterans to bridge financial gaps \nand allow them to stay in their homes and escape possible foreclosures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2961\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ENHANCEMENT OF REFINANCING OF HOME LOANS BY \n                   VETERANS.\n\n       (a) Inclusion of Refinancing Loans Among Loans Subject to \n     Guaranty Maximum.--Section 3703(a)(1)(A)(i)(IV) of title 38, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting ``(5),'' after \n     ``(3),''.\n       (b) Increase in Maximum Percentage of Loan-to-Value of \n     Refinancing Loans Subject to Guaranty.--Section 3710(b)(8) of \n     such title is amended by striking ``90 percent'' and \n     inserting ``95 percent''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mrs. Dole, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 2963. A bill to improve and enhance the mental health care \nbenefits available to members of the Armed Forces and veterans, to \nenhance counseling and other benefits available to survivors of members \nof the Armed Forces and veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is an issue that has been festering in \nour military ranks for quite some time that we must address now.\n  America's warriors voluntarily leave the comfort of their homes and \nfamilies to serve the greater good under very difficult conditions. \nThey are fighting an incredibly complex battle on an asymmetric \nbattlefield, against an enemy that is not bound by rules of war or \nhuman decency. They are courageously protecting our freedoms--each and \nevery day--against those who seek to do us harm. As the father of a \ntwo-tour Iraq War Veteran, this issue is very close to my heart, and \nshould be at the forefront of the Senate's day-to-day business.\n  Many of our military service members bear the physical scars of war. \nThanks to advances in modern medicine and the efforts of brilliant \nmedical personnel in the field, many of our war-wounded are able to \nreturn to a relatively normal life. Our practice of compensating \ndisabled veterans financially helps our heroes reintegrate and assume \nagain civilian status.\n  A growing concern revolves around those soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nMarines who return home with invisible injuries, the psychological \nwounds of war that have had a huge impact on a large percentage of our \nmilitary forces.\n  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, Traumatic Brain Injuries, TBI, \nare not quickly diagnosed because we cannot see them. But we know they \nexist, and they often manifest years later and wreak all sorts of havoc \non our military, on our military families, and on our society.\n  The recently-released Rand Study and American Psychiatric Association \nstudies acknowledge the issue and paint a bleak social and financial \nfuture. The question is: What are we doing to help these men and women? \nThe answer now is: Not enough. There are simply not enough resources \navailable to our combat veterans to deal adequately with the problem.\n  Today we are proposing legislation that will address this crisis. Our \nproposal will address both short- and long-term solutions for those \nsuffering from PTSD and TBI. We will increase our troops' access to \nqualified behavioral-health specialists and increase the number of \nthose specialists annually in an effort to treat our men and women and \nhelp them cope with their ailments.\n  My staff has worked closely with the VA on these proposals and our \nlegislation has the support of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans' \nAssociation and Veterans for Common Sense.\n  First, our bill improves veterans' access to care by expanding the \nuse of our Vet Centers. Currently, our Active, Guard, and Reserve \nmilitary personnel do not have access to the VA's Vet Centers, \ncommunity-based counseling\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\ncenters which are successfully providing mental health care to \nveterans.\n  An estimated 30 percent of troops return from combat suffering from \nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, or other mental \nhealth problems. But there are grossly insufficient numbers of military \nbehavioral health specialists to provide the care our troops need. \nRecent testimony from all military Surgeons General highlighted the \nshortage of mental health professionals service-wide.\n  This legislation will give our troops the same access to Vet Centers \nour veterans receive for mental health care, which not only opens the \ndoor to additional resources but also lightens the load on our \ncurrently over-tasked specialists. Additionally, the legislation will \nreduce the stigma associated with behavior disorders by allowing troops \nto seek treatment outside of conventional military channels.\n  We also propose to enhance the recruitment and training of Military \nBehavioral Health Specialists through a scholarship program that \ntargets former service members or service members preparing to separate \nfrom the military.\n  This legislation, overseen by the Veterans Health Administration, \nwill provide incentives for retiring or separating military personnel \nand veterans to pursue an education in the behavioral health field. \nOver time, that will alleviate the shortage of behavioral health \nspecialists who serve our troops and veterans.\n  The estimated cost to recruit an additional 80 to 90 behavioral \nhealth specialists a year is $1.5--$2 million annually. This program \nwould pay for itself if it were to save just one veteran from \ndeveloping 100 percent service-connected PTSD.\n  We also propose extending the survivor benefits for Service Members \nwho commit suicide and have a medical history of PTSD or TBI.\n  We know that mental-health issues often manifest long after the \nservice member has left active duty. As a result, Congress has extended \nfree health care to five years for recently-discharged veterans with \nany condition that may be related to their combat service.\n  Unfortunately, survivor benefits have not kept up with this logic. \nCurrent coverage for veterans who commit suicide does not take into \naccount the time it takes for PTSD and TBI to manifest.\n  This legislation guarantees benefits for any Service Member who \ncommits suicide within two years of separation or retirement from the \nmilitary, provided they have a documented medical history of a combat-\nrelated mental-health condition, including PTSD or TBI.\n  The Service Member's survivor will be entitled to the same Social \nSecurity, Survivor Benefit Plan, Veteran's Affairs Benefits, and active \nduty burial benefits that they would have received had the Service \nMember died on their last day of active duty.\n  Our legislation also creates a grant program for non-profit \norganizations to provide support services to the families of our \ndeceased Active, Guard, and Reserve Military personnel and Veterans.\n  The psychological impact associated with the loss of a loved one in a \ncombat zone is tremendous. Unfortunately, there are not adequate \nnumbers of military Casualty Assistance Officers to serve surviving \nfamilies. While norofit organizations have professional staff that \nprovide long-term and peer-based emotional support, Department of \nDefense Casualty Assistance Officers are only temporarily detailed to \nthese duties and often are unfamiliar with the regulations or the \nemotional needs of surviving families.\n  This legislation establishes a competitive federal grant program for \nnonprofit support organizations to provide vital support services to \nthe surviving families of deceased military personnel.\n  Next, our legislation will ensure the fair treatment and care of all \nof our military personnel, including those whose discharges may have \nbeen caused by combat-related mental-health condition, including Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury.\n  Many of those who are forced to leave the military because of \nperformance issues such as substance abuse or anger problems have \nunderlying mental health conditions such as TBI or PTSD that are not \nbeing properly diagnosed.\n  In many cases the military has inappropriately discharged these \nveterans, and they subsequently lose access to VA care and other \nbenefits.\n  No veteran that has served this nation in combat should be denied the \nbenefits they earned on the battlefield. This provision allows the VA \nto screen the veteran's discharge, and, if the veteran is found to have \nbeen improperly diagnosed, to take action to correct the problem \naccordingly.\n  Specifically, this legislation would reinstate the provision repealed \nfrom the law in 1996 giving the Vet Centers the authority to help the \nnew generation of war veterans to resolve any problems presented with \nthe character of their discharges.\n  Finally, our legislation will better prepare our troops for combat \nthrough the creation of a pilot program at Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri \nand Ft. Carson, Colorado. We will provide comprehensive training to \neducate U.S. military personnel on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder--how \nto prevent it, how to recognize it when it occurs, and what to do about \nit when it happens. We hope to build resiliency, enhance performance, \nand mitigate stress among the troops.\n  The rise in PTSD cases demands a new approach to preparing U.S. \nmilitary personnel and their families for the stresses associated with \ncombat.\n  The pilot program is designed to enhance the individual's \nneurophysiological understanding of stress and trauma resolution and to \nequip them with performance-enhancing skills drawn from both the \nmilitary special-operations community and the elite sports world.\n  The program will train and support an Army Brigade Combat Team and \ntheir families at all stages of a soldier's tour: pre-deployment, mid-\ndeployment and post-deployment.\n  Addressing PTSD head on through self-awareness training will teach \nmilitary personnel to cope better with combat-related issues and reduce \nthe need and cost for long-term treatment.\n  The long-term effects of untreated mental illness are severe: drug \nand alcohol abuse, job and marital problems, even suicide.\n  We can prevent much of this unfortunate legacy by prompt and \neffective treatment when our troops come home.\n  We are all the beneficiaries of the sacrifices of others. Our \nresponsibility is to continue to improve the ways in which we support \nour troops and their families.\n  They do not take our freedom for granted; we should not take their \nsacrifices for granted.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these \nproposals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2969. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance the \ncapacity of the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain \nnurses and other critical health-care professionals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress personnel issues in the Department of Veterans Affairs. This \nlegislation, proposed Veterans' Medical Personnel Recruitment and \nRetention Act of 2008, would help ensure that VA has the workforce \nnecessary to serve America's veterans most effectively.\n  Health care providers are the backbone of the VA system. Yet today, \nthe Department faces a shortage of these professionals. Around the \ncountry, too many facilities are understaffed, at the cost of services \nfor veterans. A recent report by the Partnership for Public Service \ngave the Veterans Health Administration poor marks for pay and \nbenefits, and for family support. VHA also rated poorly among younger \nemployees. To be the health care employer of choice, VA must be able to \noffer competitive salaries, work schedules, and benefits.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I held a hearing \non April 9, 2008, that focused on personnel issues within the VA health \ncare system. We heard detailed testimony from VA administrators and \nhealth care providers. Their testimony outlined the challenges VA \nfaces, and suggested possible solutions.\n  This legislation would benefit a wide range of positions within VA. \nHere are\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\nsome of the challenges VA faces, and the solutions I propose.\n  Local labor markets for health care providers vary widely, and VA \nmust be better prepared to compete in every market. Locality pay \nsurveys are a crucial tool in this effort. However, a recent GAO report \non nurse anesthetists revealed a locality pay system that is \ninconsistent and often dysfunctional. The bill I am introducing would \nmake implementation of locality pay surveys more effective by requiring \nadditional training on proper implementation, and improving \ntransparency to allow for better oversight.\n  This legislation would also encourage retention of experienced \nprofessionals by removing salary offsets for retired employees who \nchoose to return to work at VA. In the coming years, a significant \nportion of the VA workforce will reach the age of retirement. \nEliminating the salary offset by the amount of an employee's retirement \nannuity would encourage these experienced professionals to return to \nVA.\n  Education benefits are often among the chief advantages of employment \nat VA, and I believe these benefits can be used for an even greater \neffect. VA has extensive programs to encourage further education within \ntheir workforce, and to provide financial assistance for employees with \neducational debt. This legislation would increase yearly benefit limits \non the Education Debt Reduction Program--EDRP--and would broaden the \ngoals of that program to include retention as well as recruitment. In \nso doing, the EDRP would be made available to both long-time VA \nemployees and new hires. It would also reauthorize the Health \nProfessionals Scholarship Program, and would broaden eligibility to a \nwider range of health professions.\n  Further, to make VA more attractive to clinical researchers, this \nlegislation would provide VA with authorities similar to the Loan \nRepayment Program of the National Health Service Corps. VA would be \nauthorized to use funds from medical services appropriations to help \nresearchers in need of financial assistance to payoff their education \nloans. This program would compliment EDRP, which is not available to \nresearchers.\n  In recent years, VA has been challenged to retain top administrators, \nespecially those who have spent their careers at VA. Their expert \nknowledge is indispensable to the effective management of the VA health \ncare system. However, given the high rates of compensation available \noutside of VA, retention of these professionals is often difficult. \nThis legislation would provide VA with the authority to pay national \nadministrators additional compensation so as to better compete with the \nprivate sector. It would also give VA the authority to increase, under \nlimited circumstances, compensation for pharmacists, doctors, and \ndentists, in order for VA to be more competitive in local labor \nmarkets.\n  VA faces many challenges in recruiting and retaining nurses. I have \nworked with VA administrators and nurses to develop solutions to these \nchallenges. This legislation would give VA more tools to attract and \nkeep these employees.\n  Alternative work schedules are now commonly available in other health \ncare systems. At VA, part-time and alternative work schedules are \nunder-utilized, and as a result, VA loses prospective hires and damages \nemployee morale. This legislation would clarify alternative work \nschedule and weekend duty rules. By making these schedules easier to \nimplement, it is my hope that VA will expand their use.\n  This bill would also make it easier for VA to hire and retain part-\ntime nurses by limiting probationary periods and expanding eligibility \nfor overtime pay. For nurses who transition from full-time to part-\ntime, this legislation would eliminate the probationary period they are \nnow required to serve. This provision would be extremely helpful in \nencouraging experienced nurses to extend their careers at VA beyond the \ncustomary age of retirement.\n  In many locations, VA cannot compete with other health care systems \nfor many nursing positions, particularly certified registered nurse \nanesthetists--CRNAs--and licensed practical and vocational nurses. A \nrecent GAO report on CRNAs in VA noted that VA spends thousands of \ndollars on contract nurses to cover staffing gaps. The use of contract \nnurses, while appropriate in some situations, is not a permanent \nsolution to the long-term staffing shortfall. The bill I am introducing \nwould raise or eliminate pay caps currently placed on these difficult-\nto-fill positions. These provisions are derived directly from testimony \nthe Committee heard from VA nurses and administrators at the April 9, \n2008, hearing.\n   This legislation would also clarify rules about emergency duty for \nVA nurses. The use of emergency mandatory overtime has been an issue in \nmany VA facilities, and in other health care systems. I believe this \nlegislation provides a reasonable solution. By standardizing the \ndefinition of ``emergency,'' it would facilitate more consistent and \nequitable use of emergency mandatory overtime.\n  I believe that this legislation will give VA the tools it needs to \nrecruit and retain the best health care professionals in the Nation. I \nalso anticipate that it will improve employee morale, as well as \nimproving transparency and oversight. As we have heard many times, VA \nfaces a looming retirement crisis. The solutions proposed in this \nlegislation seek to address these challenges.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the proposed Veterans' Medical \nPersonnel Recruitment and Retention Act of 2008.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 548\n\n       Whereas, since the inception of the AmeriCorps national \n     service program in 1994, AmeriCorps has proven to be highly \n     effective at promoting the ethic of service and volunteering \n     and engaging people in the United States in meeting a wide \n     range of local needs;\n       Whereas, since 1994, more than $5,000,000,000 in AmeriCorps \n     funds have been invested in nonprofit, community, \n     educational, and faith-based groups, and those funds have led \n     to the contribution of hundreds of millions of dollars of \n     additional funds and in-kind donations from other sources;\n       Whereas, since 1994, approximately 542,000 people have \n     taken the AmeriCorps pledge to ``get things done for \n     America'' by becoming AmeriCorps members;\n       Whereas, each year, AmeriCorps provides opportunities for \n     75,000 people across the United States to give back in an \n     intensive way to their districts, their States, and the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas AmeriCorps members have served a total of more than \n     705,000,000 hours nationwide, helping to improve the lives of \n     the Nation's most vulnerable citizens, protect the \n     environment, contribute to public safety, respond to \n     disasters, and strengthen the educational system of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in 2007, AmeriCorps members recruited and \n     supervised more than 1,700,000 community volunteers, \n     demonstrating the value of AmeriCorps as a powerful force for \n     encouraging people to become involved in volunteering;\n       Whereas, in 2007, AmeriCorps members served 4,100 nonprofit \n     organizations, schools, and faith-based and community \n     organizations;\n       Whereas AmeriCorps members nationwide, in return for their \n     service, have earned nearly $1,430,000,000 to use to further \n     their own educational advancement at the Nation's colleges \n     and universities;\n       Whereas, after AmeriCorps members complete their terms of \n     service, those members remain engaged in their communities as \n     volunteers, teachers, and nonprofit professionals in \n     exceptionally high levels; and\n       Whereas ``AmeriCorps Week'' is observed the week beginning \n     May 11, 2008, and is an opportune time for the people of the \n     United States to salute current and former AmeriCorps members \n     for their powerful impact on the lives of people in the \n     United States, to thank AmeriCorps's community partners for \n     making the program possible, and to encourage more people in \n     the United States to become involved in service and \n     volunteering: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) encourages the people of the United States to join in a \n     national effort to salute AmeriCorps members and alumni and \n     raise awareness about the importance of national and \n     community service;\n       (2) acknowledges the significant accomplishments of the \n     members, alumni, and community partners of AmeriCorps;\n       (3) recognizes the important contributions of AmeriCorps \n     members and alumni to the lives of the people of the United \n     States; and\n       (4) encourages people of all ages to consider opportunities \n     to serve in AmeriCorps.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Cochran and \nothers to celebrate the achievements of the members and alumni of \nAmeriCorps and to recognize the week of May 11, 2008, as ``AmeriCorps \nWeek.'' These young men and women have dedicated their time and efforts \ntoward improving the lives of all Americans by protecting the \nenvironment, strengthening education, responding to disasters, and \nsupporting public health and safety.\n   Since 1994, AmeriCorps has encouraged citizens to volunteer, serve, \nand address the unmet needs of our Nation. About 542,000 people have \nbecome AmeriCorps members and have pledged ``to get things done for \nAmerica.'' These citizens have provided more than 705,000,000 hours of \nservice, hard work, and dedication to improve our communities. In \naddition, since its inception, more than $5 billion of AmeriCorps funds \nhave been invested back into our communities and have helped leverage \nhundreds of millions of dollars of additional funds and in-kind \ndonations from external sources.\n  Last year, 75,000 AmeriCorps members were able to give back to this \nNation, and those members recruited more than 1,700,000 community \nvolunteers to join them in their mission. Their volunteers served in \nover 4,000 nonprofit organizations, schools, and faith-based and \ncommunity organizations across the country.\n  In return for service, AmeriCorps members have earned more than $1.4 \nbillion to go toward furthering their education, and after completing \ntheir service, many alumni remain engaged in their communities as \nvolunteers, teachers, and nonprofit professionals.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, since AmeriCorps was created, more \nthan 7,000 AmeriCorps members have served about 9.5 million hours and \nearned over $20 million toward their education. From my own experience \nas a Peace Corps member, I know it takes a tremendous amount of \nperseverance, commitment, and passion to serve, but I also know the \nemotional reward achieved in dedicating your time to help others. \nEmerson wrote, ``It is one of the most beautiful compensations of life \nthat no man can sincerely try to help another without helping \nhimself.'' It is my hope that all Americans take the opportunity to \ndevelop a deeper sense of community, a renewed sense of national \npurpose, and a shared experience of sacrifice to serve our country.\n   During this ``AmeriCorps Week,'' we must take the time to recognize, \nsalute, and thank those Americans who have answered the call to serve \nby joining AmeriCorps; we must acknowledge the tremendous \naccomplishments and important contributions of the AmeriCorps members, \nalumni, and community partners; and, we must raise awareness about the \nimportance of national and community service. Our collective \nimaginations, ideas, energy, and resolve are needed to solve our \nNation's problems and rekindle our American community. I encourage \ncitizens of all ages to consider serving in AmeriCorps and contributing \ntheir skills and talents to bettering this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3721-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3721-S3722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4635.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 7th \nAnnual ``National Substitute Teacher Recognition Week,'' which is \ncelebrated in conjunction with Teacher Appreciation Week. This is a \nnational effort to recognize the approximately 270,000 men and women \nthat fill in for absent permanent teachers every day in the United \nStates.\n  According to research performed by the Substitute Teaching \nInstitute--STI--at Utah State University, as much as 1 full year of a \nchild's elementary and secondary education is taught by substitute \nteachers. More often than not, these are talented individuals who are \nwilling to take on the challenge of providing quality education when \npermanent teachers are out of the classroom. I believe it is only \nappropriate that we do something to recognize the efforts of these \nmembers of our communities who fill a void in the education of our \nchildren and play a vital role in maintaining continuity of instruction \nand a positive learning environment for students throughout our \ncountry.\n  I would also like to recognize and commend the work and dedication of \nthe Substitute Teaching Institute. Established in 1995, STI provides \nsubstitute teachers with training materials to improve the quality of \ntheir contribution to classroom activities. Over the last 12 years, STI \nhas evolved and grown to become one of our Nation's leaders in the \neffort to improve substitute teaching, providing training materials and \nservices along with recruitment and retention assistance to school \ndistricts and substitute teachers around the world. Having expanded its \nwork over the years, the STI continually works to revolutionize the \nrole of substitute teachers into opportunities for educational \nexcellence.\n  I am joined by Senators Clinton and Cochran in submitting a \nresolution designating May 5-9, 2008 as National Substitute Teacher \nRecognition Week, and I urge all my colleagues to lend their support.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 544\n\n       Whereas, on average, as much as 1 full year of a child's \n     elementary and secondary education is taught by substitute \n     teachers;\n       Whereas, on any given day in the United States, more than \n     270,000 classes are taught by substitute teachers;\n       Whereas formal training of substitute teachers has been \n     shown to improve the quality of education, lower school \n     district liability, reduce the number of student and faculty \n     complaints, and increase retention rates of substitute \n     teachers;\n       Whereas a strong, effective system of education for all \n     children and youth is essential to our Nation's continued \n     strength and prosperity;\n       Whereas much of a child's growth and progress can be \n     attributed to the efforts of dedicated teachers and \n     substitute teachers who are entrusted with the child's \n     educational development;\n       Whereas substitute teachers play a vital role in \n     maintaining continuity of instruction and a positive learning \n     environment in the absence of a permanent classroom teacher; \n     and\n       Whereas substitute teachers should be recognized for their \n     dedication and commitment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 5 through 9, 2008, as the 7th annual \n     National Substitute Teacher Recognition Week;\n       (2) recognizes the important and vital role substitute \n     teachers play in a child's education; and\n       (3) encourages educational institutions to observe the week \n     with appropriate events and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3729-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING THE RECIPIENTS OF THE EL DORADO PROMISE SCHOLARSHIP\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Res. 545\n\n       Whereas the 2000 United States Census determined that El \n     Dorado, Arkansas, had a significantly lower percentage of \n     residents with degrees from institutions of higher education \n     and a significantly higher percentage of families who fell \n     below the poverty line than the national average;\n       Whereas it is increasingly important for students to obtain \n     a college education in order to keep up with the demands of \n     the modern workforce and global economy;\n       Whereas the El Dorado Promise scholarship is a tuition \n     scholarship, created and funded by Murphy Oil Corporation, \n     which enables all eligible high school graduates of the El \n     Dorado Public School District in El Dorado, Arkansas, to \n     attend any accredited 2- or 4-year, public or private, \n     college or university;\n       Whereas school enrollment in the El Dorado Public School \n     District has significantly increased since the El Dorado \n     Promise scholarship program was established, despite a 15-\n     year trend of decreasing enrollment;\n       Whereas the El Dorado Promise scholarship program increased \n     the number of El Dorado High School students who chose to \n     attend college after graduation by 20 percent; and\n       Whereas, on April 30, 2008, El Dorado High School students \n     who receive El Dorado Promise and other academic scholarships \n     sign academic letters of intent for the colleges they will be \n     attending upon graduation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the recipients of the El Dorado Promise \n     scholarship for choosing to further their education;\n       (2) recognizes April 30, 2008, as the second Academic \n     Signing Day for graduating El Dorado High School students \n     receiving El Dorado Promise and other academic scholarships;\n       (3) acknowledges that the El Dorado Promise scholarship \n     program is important for the revitalization of southern \n     Arkansas; and\n       (4) recognizes Murphy Oil Corporation for its efforts to \n     ensure that children from southern Arkansas, who might \n     otherwise struggle in financing a college education, are able \n     to attend college.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/01/senate-section/article/S3729-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3729-S3730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL PHYSICAL FITNESS AND SPORTS MONTH AND NATIONAL PHYSICAL \n                       EDUCATION AND SPORTS WEEK\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 546, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 546) designating May 2008 as \n     ``National Physical Fitness and Sports Month,'' and the week \n     of May 1 through May 7, 2008, as ``National Physical \n     Education and Sports Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution today \nwith my colleague, Senator Wyden OR, designating the month of May as \n``National Physical Fitness and Sports Month'' and the first week of \nMay as ``National Physical Education and Sports Week.''\n  Developing healthy habits is important for all of us, as children, \nyoung\n\n[[Page S3730]]\n\nadults, and as we grow older. Current and past Presidents have \nrecognized the month of May, the beginning of spring, as ``Physical \nFitness and Sports Month'' for over 20 years. Around South Dakota and \nacross the country, local YMCAs, afterschool programs, and other \norganizations take time during the month of May to recognize the need \nto get fit, stay active, and look at new ways to promote physical \nactivity. This year, I am pleased we are able to recognize the \nimportance of physical fitness through the Senate.\n  As we talk more about health care reform and the uninsured, it is \nimportant to remember that each of us has a responsibility concerning \nour own care and to educate our children on the importance of staying \nhealthy. Too often I hear from constituencies, such as school groups \nand health care providers, that childhood obesity and diabetes are on \nthe rise--and it is not just affecting our health, but also our \npocketbooks.\n  According to my State and the Centers for Disease Control, more than \n50,000 South Dakotans have diabetes and projections show that number \nwill continue to increase. Diabetes of course can cause severe \ncomplications and takes a tremendous toll on our society. The disease \nis associated with significant personal and social costs due to \nimpaired health and quality of life.\n  Heart disease is another significant and often related illness to \ndiabetes that effects millions of Americans and costs Medicare and \nMedicaid, and therefore taxpayers, millions each year. In South Dakota, \napproximately 1,743 deaths--24.8 percent of all deaths--in 2006 were \ncaused by cardiovascular diseases, including stroke.\n  Now much of the burden of heart disease is due to smoking--and that \nis another problem we will continue to tackle through education at the \nstate and local levels. But it is also helpful to know that both heart \ndisease and type 2 diabetes are largely preventable. Also, obesity and \ninactivity are two of the major risk factors associated with these \ndiseases---which means a healthy diet and regular physical activity at \nall ages can go a long way toward improving our quality of life and \nreducing our health care bills.\n  For adults, it is recommended that minimum physical activity consist \nof moderate activity for 30 minutes, 5 days a week, or more vigorous \nactivity for 20 minutes, 3 days a week. My daughters and I happen to \nhave a passion for running, which is particularly popular this time of \nyear in South Dakota.\n  The month of May is also a time to recognize the importance of sports \nto our State and to our schools. Getting involved in your local school \nteam--high school or college--or in other local teams is a great way to \nstay motivated and focused through school and to develop healthy habits \nthat will last for many years. It is also a tremendously important part \nof community life in South Dakota.\n  I am proud that this resolution has been endorsed by YMCA of the USA, \nAAHPERD--American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation & \nDance--the American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, \nand the National Coalition for Promoting Physical Activity.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are many items we were taking care \nof, but I think the Senate, including the Presiding Officer, in the \nlast several days has spent a lot of time talking about the high prices \nof gasoline and how the consumers are being impacted by it.\n  I come to the floor tonight to continue that discussion and to say to \nthe American people and the people of Washington State whom I represent \nthat we are going to be aggressive and vigilant about looking into the \noil market and why gas prices have risen over 100 percent in a year \nwhen there has been no disruption of supply, when there has been no \nshortage, when most oil companies testified that oil should be at $60 a \nbarrel, why we are at these high gas prices.\n  Many of my colleagues have been out on the floor speaking. I keep \npointing to the fact that the price of oil has been at over $118 a \nbarrel. I don't know what they closed at today. Many consumers have \nbeen paying anywhere from $3.56 a gallon to $4.22 a gallon for diesel. \nOil futures--I keep emphasizing this--oil futures are part of what \ndrives the day-to-day price of oil. When oil futures are so high, that \nhelps set the price in the day-to-day, what is called the spot market. \nWe know oil futures now will be over $100 a barrel for several years. \nWe know this is a very big indicator of the challenge we face in \nkeeping gasoline prices low.\n  Many of my colleagues have been out here talking about ANWR, how we \nshould drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and we will solve our \nproblems. I do not support drilling in the wildlife refuge because I \nthink it is a very special place because it is a wildlife refuge. More \nimportantly, in this case, it is not going to solve our energy crisis. \nDrilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge will, at the height of its \nproduction 10 or 20 years from now, if it actually occurs, will reduce \ngas prices by about a penny a gallon. We are talking about a few \ndollars of savings over a year's period of time. We are not talking \nabout a solution.\n  The United States has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. We are \nnot going to drill our way out of this problem. So we need to act.\n  Many of my colleagues have said it is about the fact that there is \nnot enough gas supply; we don't have enough inventory. And we hear from \noil analysts who give testimony or write articles in the paper that \n``gasoline inventories are higher than the historical average at this \ntime of year . . . so there is really no need to worry about the supply \nbeing too tight.'' This is an oil analyst who said this in March. Here \nis somebody analyzing the market who says it is not about the supply \nbeing too tight.\n  We had some people say it is all about refineries, if we just went \nahead with refineries producing more and there are all these \nenvironmental regulations and they cannot produce more oil. According \nto CEOs of oil companies, that is not the issue because the CEO of \nShell testified that--this is before a Senate committee--``We are not \naware of any environmental regulations that have prevented us from \nexpanding refinery capacity or siting a new refinery.'' That is not \nwhat the problem is either.\n  We know it is not any existing regulations because here is another \nCEO of an oil company who said: At this time, we are not aware any \nprojects have been directly prevented as a result of any specific \nFederal or State regulation.\n  I have gone over some of these charts, and I am going over them again \ntonight because I think it is important for us to get to the bottom of \nwhat is going on. We owe it to our consumers, to our constituents to \nmake sure that strong Federal statutes are in place that prohibit \nmarket manipulation and that they are enforced and that if markets are \nout of control--and by that I mean there is no justification for the \nprice--we have somebody in the Federal Government, a Federal agency \nthat is going to police that market and hold people accountable for the \nmanipulation of supply and price.\n  During the summer season, we actually think consumption in the United \nStates is projected to decline. So this notion somehow that the summer \ndriving season is upon us and all of a sudden the price should go up \nbecause more people are going to be driving taking vacations and it is \ngoing to have an impact and that is why the price should go up is just \nnot correct. This is a statement by the Energy Information Agency that \nit declined over last year by three-tenths of a percent and is expected \nto decline by four-tenths of a percent for the summer. It is not really \nabout the fact that all of a sudden just because it is summer we should \npay higher gas prices.\n  I have shown this chart about supply and demand because it shows in \nthe orange color what demand have been and what supply has been, the \nyellow line. What is interesting is that supply and demand has been \nfairly consistent over time; that is, we see some anomalies there, but \npretty much supply and demand are being met. So someone cannot say we \nhad in 2007 or 2008 a big gap and that is why today prices are 100 \ntimes what they were, over 100 percent from where they were a year ago. \nYou cannot say that because supply and demand are basically constant.\n  That leaves us to say, What is the problem? What is going on and what \nis causing this problem? When I think about this issue about what \nAmerica needs to do to make sure oil markets are policed, to make sure \noil markets are functioning, to make sure oil, a commodity that is so \nimportant to us in the United States as it relates to our economy, is \nreally properly policed by proper Federal agencies, I look at where \nthis is.\n  I have said a couple times on the floor now it seems to me that \nhamburger in America has more regulation as it relates to the futures \nmarket than oil does. I am sure some will say: What is the Senator from \nWashington talking about? What I am talking about is basically this \nchart which is that cattle futures, which are traded on several \nplatforms, basically do not have any exemptions. They have to comply \nwith all the rules and regulations of the futures market. That means \nthey have to register, people have to know who is buying and selling on \nthat market. They have daily reporting requirements. That means there \nhas to be transparency. And there are speculative limits. Those \nspeculative limits in the market for something such as cattle futures \nbasically say if price gets out of control, then they stop the market. \nThey stop the market; they don't let it just careen out of control.\n  Yet we look at oil--besides the NYMEX, oil has been traded on these \nmini-platforms, and you ask: Does it have to meet any of these same \nrequirements as beef? No. Look over here and they are exempt. There is \nno check mark here. They are exempt. They are an exempt commodity. Why? \nBecause in 2000, they were given an exemption called the Enron loophole \nthat basically said those trades don't have to\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\ncomply with the same daily reporting requirements of the futures \nmarket. They don't have registration, so we don't know who is impacting \nthat market. We don't know who is doing it. They certainly don't have \ndaily reporting requirements, so there is no transparency, and they \ndon't have any kind of limitation on the speculation. Basically, we \nhave a totally different regime of how futures are treated.\n\n  As I said, the important point is that the oil futures price impacts \nthe day-to-day price of oil as well. So it is very important that we \nhave a futures market that functions, that is not manipulated, that has \na certain amount of transparency to it, that there are reporting \nrequirements so that if something is amiss in the marketplace, it can \nbe investigated.\n  Let me be clear. I don't think any oil company or hedge fund or any \nother organization wants a disruptive market that does not function \nproperly on market fundamentals. That is not good for anybody. So \neverybody should think that somehow hamburger cannot be more important \nto America than oil as it relates to our economy, and yet we have given \nall of these exemptions to oil and said we don't need to know this. We \ndon't need to know this information. It is apparent at these prices \nthat market fundamentals are not working. Supply and demand is not \nworking.\n  We as a body basically said we want a prohibition on manipulation of \noil. We made it illegal for any person to directly or indirectly use \n``any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance'' in connection \nwith the wholesale purchase of crude oil or petroleum distillates. And \nwe said any violators of that law could be fined up to $1 million a \nday. We did that in December. I think that $1 million per day is a \npretty stiff fine to deter people from manipulating the market.\n  We also said anybody who knowingly provides false or misleading \ninformation about the wholesale of crude oil or gasoline prices to a \nFederal department or agency can also be fined up to $1 million per \nday.\n  We believe when we look at the Enron case and we look at some of the \ninformation that has been provided in these other markets where there \nhas been manipulation, that providing false information was exactly the \nway we caught and understood exactly how people were manipulating the \nmarket.\n  That is the legislation that Senator Reid and the Democrats pushed \nand got bipartisan support for in the Senate and we passed in December \nof last year.\n  What we have been waiting for is the FTC to act. We have been waiting \nfor the administration to enforce that law. We have been waiting for \nthem to enforce that law by writing the rules and regulations that will \npolice the oil market and catch the manipulators of oil prices in this \ncountry.\n  The good news is the FTC is acting. The FTC, within the last half an \nhour, 40 minutes, has issued their rule. I have it here. This is the \nnew rule.\n  It has to go through a public comment period. It has to have the \ninput, I am sure it will be from hundreds of people who will want to \nsay this is how I think this rule should work. I certainly encourage \nconsumers and consumer organizations and my colleagues in the Senate to \nall respond to this rule because it will be critical that we hear from \npeople.\n  I think the Chairman of the FTC, Chairman Kovacic, has done a good \njob saying in a press release just issued:\n\n       We understand consumer prices are being hurt by high gas \n     prices and that the Commission remains vigilant in using this \n     authority to prevent unlawful behavior that affects gas \n     prices.\n\n  I congratulate the FTC in issuing this rule. But I want people to \nunderstand that this rule in its final implementation is what is going \nto say to those individuals who are manipulating markets--we don't know \nyet about oil markets. We certainly know we have found manipulation of \nelectricity markets, we have found manipulation of natural gas markets, \nwe have found manipulation of propane, and we are going to use this law \nand this new rule to police the oil markets and stop any kind of \nactivity that is spiking the price of gasoline and ruining our economy.\n  I can't say how important it is that we move forward on this rule. I \ncan't tell you how critical it is because without the proper tools, \nwithout the proper policing and a market careening out of control--we \nhad an oil analyst who basically said--I don't know if we have that \nchart--but he basically said Government has to act because there is too \nmuch speculative power running around in the market without the \noversight, and Government needs to act. If it does not act, prices are \ngoing to keep going up.\n  I wish to give an example because the Amaranth case was a natural gas \ncase where a hedge fund basically manipulated the market and sold a \nbunch of product into the market, physically a whole month of supply, \nto crash the price and then basically end up capitalizing on the fact \nthey had so much control of the market.\n  Back to a chart that we have on beef and cattle futures, it is the \nissue that when you look at those markets, one of the reasons you \npolice markets and you look at speculative limits and you have exchange \nregistration is because you want to make sure that not one big player \nhas so much market share it ends up using that in a manipulative way, \nwhich is what Amaranth did.\n  After Amaranth basically collapsed and the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission went after them for the manipulation of these prices, the \nprice of natural gas fell 38 percent. After they got out of the market, \nthe natural gas price fell 38 percent.\n  I am not saying this is going to happen, but imagine if that same \nthing happened in the oil markets. What would happen if we found out \nthere was a big player such as Amaranth that was helping drive up the \nprice and you actually could see a reduction of 38 percent from where \nwe are today at nearly $118--$110 a barrel. Oil would be about $75 a \nbarrel. Instead of paying $3.60 a gallon, we would be paying more like \n$2.40 or $2.50 a gallon. That is what would happen.\n  It is critical we police these markets and we use this new rule and \nthat consumers respond and that we do our job in the Congress in making \nsure Federal regulators are on top of what is an out-of-control oil \nmarket that is not based on supply and demand, that is based on some \nother market activity that cannot be explained. Where there is smoke I \nthink there is fire. We certainly see a lot of smoke in the oil markets \nthat I hope will lead the FTC to investigate vigorously, with this new \nrule, the potential manipulation and stop these practices to help save \nour economy and save consumers who are getting gouged at the pump.\n  We are going to continue next week by reminding our colleagues of \nwhat we need to do. We need to protect consumers by closing the Enron \nloophole. As I said, beef futures have all these requirements but oil \ndoesn't. We need to require the oversight of all oil futures markets. \nThis was No. 3 on our list, get the FTC to act with new rules. The FTC \ndid it tonight, issued their rule. I have not even read it in full. I \nam going to do that as soon as I leave the floor. I am going to see how \ngood the rule is in basically enforcing the power we gave them in the \nDecember 2007 Energy bill.\n  We need to get the DOJ in the act because I think the FTC, while they \nhave the new authority, should be with the CFTC, they should work with \nthe SEC. They did a great job on the Enron task force in compiling \nacross multiple agencies the case against the manipulation of the \nelectricity markets. They should do the same for the oil markets.\n  Then, as I said before, I think making sure the President has \nemergency authority on price gouging, such as 28 States do, is also an \nimportant tool, and I am sure we will be talking more about that in the \nfuture.\n  Bursting the energy price bubble is what we need to do. We need to \nburst the energy price bubble that we cannot explain. We do not know \nwhy it is there. It is not supply and demand. It is something else \ngoing on, and we need to get to the bottom of it. After Amaranth, \npricing dropped to the lowest level in 2\\1/2\\ years after their getting \nout of the market, after their manipulation, after a hedge fund came in \nand tried to manipulate the natural gas market. When we saw the lowest \nrate for natural gas in 2\\1/2\\ years after we got that manipulator out \nof the market, it tells us we have to be vigorous in this battle. We \nhave to be aggressive in protecting our consumers, and that is what the \nSenate is going to continue to do.\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer is on board in that effort. I know many \nof my colleagues are too. I know Senator Reid is as well.\n  I encourage my colleagues to weigh in on this issue of the FTC rule \nand policing of the oil markets. I hope we have hearings in the \nCommerce Committee to do that and that we show the American public the \nSenate is serious about protecting consumers from the high price spikes \nin oil that cannot be described as simply market supply and demand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
