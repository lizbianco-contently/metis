Abad\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning I pay tribute to a fallen \nsoldier from my home State. SPC Sergio Abad was tragically killed in \nWanat, Afghanistan, from wounds suffered by small-arms fire and rocket-\npropelled grenades fired by the enemy on July 13, 2008. Army records \nlisted Morganfield, KY, as Specialist Abad's home, and he was 21 years \nold.\n  For his valor on the battlefield, Specialist Abad received several \nmedals, awards, and declarations, including the National Defense \nService Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Army\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\nCommendation Medal with Combat Distinguishing Device ``V,'' the Purple \nHeart, and the Bronze Star.\n  Specialist Abad's adoptive mother, Marilyn Popko, relates a tale of \nhis heroism in his final moments that explains just how such a young \nman earned that many medals and more. At a memorial service for Sergio \nat Arlington National Cemetery, a friend and fellow soldier of Sergio's \nwho was at the battle told her Sergio kept fighting even after taking \nhits to his arms and thigh. With his brother soldier there to reload \nhis gun for him, Sergio kept firing until he finally succumbed to his \nwounds and could fight no more.\n  ``It was his dream to be in the military, and he was living his dream \nwhen he was killed,'' Marilyn says.\n  Sergio was born and grew up in Florida. At the age of 7, he was \nremoved from an abusive home and placed with relatives. By middle \nschool, young Sergio had become part of not just one Florida family but \ntwo: the Popkos and the Pittses, both of whom already had children \naround his age.\n  ``He would stay with us a while, then go to stay with Lori Pitts's \nfamily,'' Marilyn recalls.\n  Thanks to the support of the Popkos and Pittses, a child with an \nunhappy start in life received plenty of support and love. He called \nboth Marilyn Popko and Lori Pitts ``Mommy.'' Paul Pitts and Stephen \nPopko were both ``Dad.''\n  Growing up, Sergio participated in Junior ROTC and studied karate at \na local martial arts studio. Sergio ``was really athletic and could \nknock out hundreds of push-ups with no problem,'' says Marybeth Klock-\nPerez, who ran the studio where Sergio practiced. For someone who had \n``been dealt really unfair cards in life, he was absolutely never \nbitter. He never used excuses or acted like the world owed him.''\n  COL Eddie Santana ran Sergio's Junior ROTC Program. He was ``an \noutstanding young leader--very disciplined and committed,'' the colonel \nremembered. ``He always knew what he wanted to do: join the Army.''\n  Sergio traded the Sunshine State for the Bluegrass State in 2005 when \nhe came to the Earle C. Clements Center in Morganfield, KY, to earn his \nGED. After he received it, he entered basic training at Fort Benning, \nGA, and then was stationed in Italy for a year with Company C, 2nd \nBattalion, 503rd Infantry.\n  ``It was one of the best times he ever had,'' Marilyn Popko says. \n``He went to Germany, Switzerland, France. And he loved jumping out of \nairplanes.''\n  Amidst all this adventure, Sergio also fell in love. He met \nChristina, and the two planned to marry in the summer of 2008. The \nwedding was to feature the music of Sergio's favorite singer, Frank \nSinatra. Sadly, Sergio was killed before he could walk down the aisle \nand before he could welcome his and Christina's daughter, due this \nDecember, into the world. Christina ``legally changed her name to Abad \nso their daughter would have Sergio's name,'' Marilyn says. Sergio \n``died without knowing they were having a girl--he always wanted a \ndaughter.''\n  Sergio leaves behind many loved ones, and our thoughts are with them \ntoday. This includes members of both the Popko and Pitts families, \nincluding Marilyn, Stephen, and Catherine Popko, and Lori, Paul, \nZachery, and Leo Pitts and Krystine Pitts Flagg, as well as Sergio's \nfiancee, Christina Abad, and their daughter, who will grow up knowing \ntheir father was a hero.\n  Everyone who knew and loved him should also know our Nation is \nhonored to have men like SPC Sergio S. Abad defend our country. Today, \nthis Senate honors him for his immense sacrifice and for his life of \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 237, H.R. 923.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 923) to provide for the investigation of \n     certain unsolved civil rights crimes, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will \nunanimously pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, H.R. \n923, a bipartisan bill to provide critical tools and resources for the \nDepartment of Justice and FBI to expeditiously investigate and \nprosecute decades-old unsolved civil rights cold case crimes.\n  This bill overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives last \nyear and unanimously passed the Senate on two previous occasions, in \nthe 108th and 109th Congresses. Its consideration in the Senate has \nbeen needlessly delayed due to a Republican objection. Finally, this \nbipartisan legislation will be sent to the President.\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\n  This legislation includes the Missing Child Cold Case Review Act, a \ncritical measure which I sponsored last Congress. It allows inspectors \ngeneral of Federal law enforcement agencies to authorize staff to \nprovide much needed assistance to the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children--NCMEC--inactive case files. In order to bolster \ntheir efforts to solve these heart-wrenching cases, NCMEC needs the \nassistance and the cooperation of inspectors general. I am pleased that \nthis legislation will help the men and women at NCMEC carry out this \nimportant mission.\n  The primary purpose of the Till bill is to track down those whose \nviolent acts during a period of national turmoil remain unpunished. In \n1955, the brutal murder of a 14-year-old African-American teenager \nnamed Emmett Till stirred the conscience of our country. No one has \nbeen punished for this tragic and brutal murder. Fifty-two years later, \nEmmett Till's family and the families of hundreds of other Americans \nwho lost their lives in the fight for equal rights, still await \njustice.\n  Racially motivated violence during this turbulent time left a scar on \nthe fabric of our democracy. Far too often, its goal was to divide \ncommunities and intimidate certain citizens from achieving full \nparticipation in our democracy and exercising their constitutional \nrights to vote, to travel, and to stay in a federally protected \nenclave, and, most often, the right to live where you please.\n  The Federal Government has traditionally been the guardian of last \nresort for our Nation's most vulnerable inhabitants. Yet sadly for much \nof our Nation's history, African-Americans and other citizens involved \nin civil rights activities were not protected in the full enjoyment of \ntheir rights. Indeed, as FBI Director Mueller acknowledged last year, \n``[m]any murders during the civil rights era were not fully \ninvestigated, were covered up or were misidentified as accidental death \nor disappearance.'' With the passage of the Till bill today, we once \nagain acknowledge past governmental missteps and seek to right these \nwrongs.\n  The Till bill provides the necessary tools for the Federal \nGovernment, along with State and local officials, to investigate and \nprosecute civil rights decades-old unsolved crimes. First, the bill \ncreates two new offices to investigate and prosecute these decades-old \ncold case crimes. Rather than creating a new unit or section within the \nJustice Department, the legislation allows precious Federal resources \nto be used by the FBI field offices and Federal prosecutors in the \nstates where these prosecutions will occur.\n  Second, it will empower the Community Relations Service of the \nDepartment of Justice to work with local communities in identifying \nunsolved cases. In a similar vein, the bill also allows the Justice \nDepartment to issue grants to State and local law enforcement agencies \nfor investigation and prosecution of violations of State and local laws \nsimilar to Federal criminal civil rights statutes. Many Federal \ncriminal civil rights prosecutions may be time-barred or face ex post \nfacto concerns. Allowing Federal grants to State and local entities \nwill allow for justice to prevail even where Federal law may be \ninadequate.\n  Third, the bill incorporates my recommended change to provide \noversight over this initiative. Congress will be able to track how many \ncold cases were selected for further inquiry and how many were not. \nThis change strengthens oversight and protects ongoing investigations \nfrom being compromised. In a February 2007 press conference, the \nDirector of the FBI announced that the FBI and Justice Department would \nwork with civil rights organizations to bring closure to decades-old \nunsolved civil rights crimes. Yet, just a few weeks ago, press reports \nindicated that the Justice Department and FBI have yet to prosecute a \nsingle case under the agency's cold case initiative already in place. \nThis is further evidence that vigorous oversight is needed, and I hope \nthis bill will help.\n  Although I am happy this bill has finally passed the full Senate, \nthis noncontroversial and bipartisan bill should not have taken several \nCongresses to pass. The Till bill was one of many bills that the \nmajority leader included in S.3297, the Advancing America's Priorities \nAct. The majority leader selected three dozen legislative items from \nthe jurisdiction of seven Senate committees, including eight Judiciary \nCommittee bills, for this effort. These are all measures with \nbipartisan support and, we believe, the support of a strong bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate. Each of these bills has the support of all \nDemocratic Senators and had overwhelming support, but stalled on the \nSenate floor by Republican objection. Ensuring the civil rights of all \nAmericans is a core American value, and I am disappointed that a single \nRepublican objection prevented this bipartisan legislation from passing \nlong ago by unanimous consent.\n  Our Nation should always be thankful to those who risked their lives \nfighting for civil rights. During the recent reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act, I was reminded that the lives of Medgar Evers, \nVernon Dahmer, Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and \ncountless others, demonstrate that ordinary persons can change the \nworld. Three months ago, we commemorated the 44th anniversary of the \ndeaths of Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman. The sacrifice and courage of \nthese Americans--many of whom gave their lives toiling for freedom--\nmade our democratic ideals real, and continue to inspire future \ngenerations to fight for civil rights.\n  This important bill is long overdue. As each day passes evidence \nfades and witnesses age. We must have a sense of urgency. Justice \ncannot afford to wait. Earlier this month, we witnessed an unfortunate \nexample of the impact waiting too long to prosecute these cases can \nhave on the administration of justice. Recently, the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals overturned the conviction of former Klansman James \nSeale, who was charged with the 1963 abduction and killings of two \nAfrican-American teenagers in Mississippi. At that time Mr. Seale \ncommitted the horrendous crimes a jury of his peers convicted him of, \nCongress had no statute of limitations on Federal kidnapping. I was \ndisappointed that, in overturning his conviction, a court of appeals \nwould misinterpret congressional intent and retroactively apply a \nprocedural bar that we did not intend to apply to crimes that occurred \nalmost a decade before.\n  I thank Senator Dodd and my good friend Representative John Lewis for \ntheir leadership and hard work on this legislation. Representative \nLewis is a civil rights hero who courageously marched and fought for \nequal justice in America. I know this bill is important to him, and I \nam deeply appreciative of his tireless efforts on this important \nlegislation. I also thank Senator Cochran for his support. Last year we \ntraveled overseas together, and I know this bill is important to him \nand his State. I thank the majority leader for his leadership in \nadvancing this legislation. I also appreciate the help of Senator Byrd \nin helping us move this bill through the Senate. Lastly, I thank the \nmany civil rights and law enforcement organizations who have worked so \nhard to enact this legislation: the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Emmett Till \nJustice Campaign, the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights under Law, the \nACLU, the Fraternal Order of Police, and so many others.\n  In July, I had the honor to meet Simeon Wright, Emmett Till's cousin, \nwho was with Mr. Till on the horrible night he was kidnapped. This bill \nwill begin the process of seeking restorative justice for families, \nlike Mr. Wright, who were victimized by these horrific crimes and so \njustice went undone for so many years. We could not pass this \nlegislation today without their efforts. Mr. Wright, and so many \nothers, should be congratulated for their courage and their commitment \nto fighting for justice for so many years.\n  With its passage, we take an important step towards finally bringing \nto justice individuals who committed heinous crimes against civil \nrights activists and African-American citizens. Equally important, we \nsend an important message to all Americans about the depth of our \ncommitment. We have made great progress in the last few decades towards \nachieving equal justice under law. The Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Act \nbrings us one step closer towards that important goal.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 923) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. REID. So staff once again was right, and I was wrong.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank my colleague from Florida for this short period \nof time to thank the majority leader for working in good faith on \nseveral of these bills.\n  There is a gentleman in this country by the name of Alvin Sykes. If \nyou haven't met him, you should. He is what America is all about. He \npromised the mother of Emmett Till before she died that he would make \nsure there would be an investigation into the death of her son, her \nyoung son, as well as others who were never properly investigated to \nthe extent they should have been.\n  We have wrangled a lot over this bill, and one of the reasons we have \nwrangled is because of the financial problem we find ourselves in today \nin this country. Begrudgingly, I have decided we could not, out of the \nwaste of the Justice Department, get the Senate to concur that we \nshould not spend additional money on it; that there is plenty of money. \nAs a matter of fact, at the end of last year, there was $1.7 billion in \nunexpended funds and unobligated funds at the Justice Department. They \nalso have a tremendous track record of waste in terms of conferences \nand of poor management. Moreover, they are the only agency of the \nFederal Government that, unlike every other agency, the unobligated \nbalances do not automatically go back to the Treasury. They get to \nspend the money.\n  So we have again failed to do the fiscally responsible thing. But I \ndecided last night this is one of those rare exceptions when I can't \nconvince the body that we ought to be more frugal. We could have \naccomplished the same thing with the funds over there, but the greater \ncall was to allow this bill to pass.\n  But I wanted to tell you something about America with this bill, and \nit has to do with Alvin Sykes. If you met him, you would immediately \nfall in love with him. He is poor as a church mouse. He has led this \ngroup with integrity. He has been an honest broker. He has not played \nthe first political game with anybody in Washington. As a matter of \nfact, he has had games played on him and he has been manipulated. But \nthe fact is he has held true to his belief and his commitment to the \nmother of Emmett Till. And because of that, we are going to see this \nbill come into fruition.\n  I think that speaks so well about our country; that one person has \ntruly made a difference, and that one person is Alvin Sykes. I can't \nsay enough about this individual. I can't say enough about his stamina, \nhis integrity, his forthrightness, his determination. All of the \nqualities that have built this country this gentleman exhibited as he \nworked to keep a promise to the dying mother of Emmett Till. So I come \nto the floor now to sing his praises, to recognize him publicly for his \ntremendous efforts, and all those on his board have made in making this \ncome to fruition.\n  I also wanted to spend a moment saying there is no reason why this \nbody can't do something more aggressively in terms of protecting \nchildren in the midst of child pornography. We have the PROTECT Act, \nwhich cost $372 million, and which could easily be paid for, but we \nwon't pay for it. The fact is, as the bill is written today, nothing \nwill happen until a year from now with that bill, even if we pass it, \nbecause we are not going to appropriate funds for it.\n  It is going to be like the Adam Walsh Act. We promised everybody we \nwould do it, but have barely funded it at all. However, we could make a \nbig difference with that by combining the PROTECT Act with the SAFE \nAct. The Justice Department has reiterated there are no fourth \namendment concerns. The House passed the bill 390 to 2, and yet we have \nresistance--for political reasons, not for policy reasons--in bringing \nforth that bill.\n  I also thank the Democratic staff, who have worked so hard to clean \nthat bill up to eliminate the objections. It is my hope that before we \nleave here this week, we will do something. The reason the SAFE Act is \nimportant is because it will do something the moment it is signed into \nlaw. Internet service providers will have to start reporting to the \nGovernment, to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nchild porn sites and the people who are utilizing them and putting them \nup. The PROTECT Act won't do any of that, but the SAFE Act will. So my \nhope is that through the rest of the remaining days of this session we \ncan come together and put politics aside and truly make a difference.\n  I talked to a Congressman from North Carolina two nights ago and he \nsaid there are 250 fathers who are filming sexual acts with little \nchildren and putting it on the Internet. The way you stop that is have \nthe Internet service providers start reporting that to the FBI. And the \nfact we won't do that--for political reasons, not policy reasons--is a \npox on us. That is in North Carolina alone. And not to pick on North \nCarolina, because it is the same in many other States. But that is a \nfact, and we know it is happening in other places. This is something \nwhere we can make a difference, and my hope is we can work that out.\n  I thank again the Senator from Florida for this time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9352-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9352-S9353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AVOIDING A DEPRESSION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to speak to the Senate \ntoday about this enormous decision we must make about what to do about \nour current financial catastrophe.\n  We are in a recession. By any measure, we are in a recession. The \nquestion is we must ask today is: What can we do to prevent this \nrecession slipping into a full-blown depression? That is the matter \nthat is in front of the Senate. One way or another we are going to have \nto come to grips with this by the weekend, or have an understanding \nthat we are going to come back next week and try to finish this.\n  What should be the underlying policy we pursue? Well, we ought to \nfind ways to help stabilize the mortgage market that has caused this \ncrisis. Let me quickly recapitulate what caused this financial mess. It \nwas the fact that banks, and financial institutions acting as banks but \nnot regulated as banks, started encouraging people to take loans on \ntheir homes which they could not afford.\n  All the checks and balances that regulations would have required \nthese financial institutions ignored. They did not conduct their due \ndiligence, and ask the practical questions: Did the people have a \nsufficient income stream to be able to afford their mortgage? Did they \nput some skin in the game, by having to put some money down on the \nhouse they were purchasing? Could they afford the interest rates and \nthe other terms of that mortgage? Lenders and brokers weren't paying \nany attention to that. A whole bunch of these loans were granted by \nfinancial institutions, and sometimes they very aggressively pushed \nthese loans on people who could not afford them.\n  Now, the banks don't keep these mortgages. They bundle them together \nand sell them to institutions as individual mortgages, or perhaps as \nbundles, or mortgage backed securities. And then different players in \nthe financial institutions would buy these securities--made up of \nshaky, subprime mortgages and they would in turn sell them. A couple \nyears later, when it became apparent that the homeowner couldn't afford \nto make the payments each month on their mortgage, and the income \nstream on those mortgages started dwindling, those financial \ninstitutions that had bought these bundles of mortgages found \nthemselves with a shortage of cash. They had to start borrowing to make \nup for their cash shortage, and the whole system started to unravel.\n  So as we try to straighten out this mess, are we to do what the \nSecretary of the Treasury has said? Are we to provide almost three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars--specifically he is saying $700 \nbillion--in order to infuse capital into these financial institutions? \nThese banks, investment banks, and insurance companies that all fed off \nthis frenzy that saw this balloon get bigger and bigger until it \nstarted to burst?\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\nAnd if we do that, aren't we rewarding the very people whose financial \ngreed got us into trouble in the first place?\n  I think the answer to that question is yes. So I want to tell the \nSenate that this Senator is not going to vote for a bailout of the \nfinancial institutions by taking nearly 5 percent of the national \nbudget--much of which we will have to borrow from the governments and \nbanks in China and--and give it to these financial institutions. I am \nnot going to vote for that.\n  At the same time, we are caught on the horns of a dilemma, because \nthe economic recession is slipping into economic catastrophe. So we \nhave to act. Well, instead of providing all the funds at once, I am \ncertainly more inclined to provide an initial portion of funds--say \n$150 billion or $200 billion and seeing how successful the government \nintervention proves during a 3- or 4-month period, and then coming \nback. Of course, those on Wall Street will say: No, we have to have the \nwhole amount of $700 billion in order to give confidence to the \nmarkets. But don't we have a responsibility to the taxpayer to make \nsure these funds are being wisely spent? Can't we provide a substantial \ndownpayment on this problem, and in a few months require everybody to \ncome back and to see whether it is working as we intended?\n  I think there is some wisdom to that. And I think there is some \nwisdom to what everybody has been talking about here, that we want to \nmake sure this money doesn't go towards executive compensation and \ngolden parachutes. That is the least we can do.\n  I was amused to see an article by a conservative columnist--Kristol--\nwhich said, well, maybe what we ought to do is put a provision in that \nno compensation--for the executives of these financial institutions \nthat participate in this bailout--no compensation can be greater than \nthe compensation to the President of the United States. That would \ncertainly get some people's attention. There ought to be some \nreasonable limits on executive compensation.\n\n  The essential question for this Senator, and I think for a lot of my \ncolleagues, is how are we going to get this money into the mortgage \nmarket so it will revive lending and restore the housing market? Is \nthis not the purpose of what we are trying to do? Not only save the \nnational economy but get in and resuscitate the housing market. How do \nwe ensure that it does not go solely into the hands of the bankers and \nthe investment bankers and the insurance companies?\n  Therefore, I suggest to the Senate that we consider a couple of \ncourses. In the process of this package, we should create a loan \nfacility that would work with people who are facing foreclosure. This \nloan facility could well be run out of Freddie or Fannie. For people \nwho have a problem with a mortgage, this facility would have the legal \nauthority, indeed the mandate, to go in and work to modify that \nmortgage, the terms and interest rate, so that in fact those people can \nstill stay in their homes.\n  I see the chairman of the Banking Committee has come in. This Senator \nis laying out a suggestion--in addition to that of the esteemed \nchairman of the Banking Committee, who I think has come out with an \nexcellent product--that in order to get the money, not into the \nbankers' hands but to get it to revive the mortgage market--in other \nwords revive the housing market--to create a loan facility, within \nFannie or Freddie, with the legal authority to get in there and help \npeople change the terms of their loans so they can stay in their homes. \nThen, second, as the chairman has suggested in his committee package, \nchange the bankruptcy laws so that if someone has gone into bankruptcy, \nthe bankruptcy judge, under law, would have the discretion to change \nthe terms of the mortgage in order to keep the person in his or her \nhome. So, prevent foreclosures through a loan facility with legal \nauthority to modify mortgages, and if the homeowners must declare \nbankruptcy, give the bankruptcy judge the authority to modify the \nmortgage. In that way, a lot of the money we are going to put towards \nthis bailout would go to preventing foreclosures.\n  This Senator speaks as one area of my State, Fort Myers, FL, has had \none of the highest foreclosure rates in the country for the past year.\n  My suggestions are just a start. I think as we look to this huge \nbailout we also ought to set up a regulatory system for all financial \ninstitutions, not just commercial banks. In other words, we should \nregulate all securities that are traded publicly or privately so we do \nnot face this problem in the future.\n  Why? Because what happened? They got us into the problem we are in. \nThe financial managers were encouraged to leverage all their \ninvestments so much in order to increase their own personal \ncompensation. We ought to avoid that at all costs. Unless we get \nsomething that is close to what this Senator is trying to share with \nthe Senate and the esteemed chairman of the Banking Committee, who is \ngoing to have more influence on this than any other person in this \nSenate--he is here--unless we can get these checks and balances in the \nsystem, this Senator is not going to vote for it.\n  It is my responsibility to try to be a careful steward of the money \nthat has been entrusted to me. We are talking about such mega amounts \nof money that will almost defy description and tie the hands of the \nnext President and the next Congress. We will have borrowed so much \nextra money that the new Congress and the next President will not be \nable to accomplish some goals because there will not be any money left \nfor the Federal Government.\n  I would love to hear from the chairman of the Banking Committee, who \nI see is ready to speak.\n  Because he is here, this Senator will yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. First, I thank my colleague from Florida. Let me say I am \nrising to speak on a matter other than the matter the Senator is \naddressing, but I wish to commend him for his thoughts and ideas on the \nsituation. We have had extensive hearings, of course, yesterday, 5 \nhours with the Secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Bank and chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the head of this new agency with our GSEs. The House is \ngoing to have a hearing today. What is quite clear is the plan, as \nsubmitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, I think, generally--I say \nthis politely--but across the spectrum, has been sort of rejected, a \nthree-page bill asking for $700 billion.\n  I pointed out to someone yesterday a few years ago you could get a \n$100,000 no-doc subprime loan and the paperwork was four pages long. \nThis is sort of a no-doc request here--not to try to be humorous about \na situation such as this. But nonetheless we have a lot of work to do \nto try to put together a plan, but I hope we can do something because \nthe situation is grave and it is serious and we have to respond.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will but very quickly. I have about 4 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Is the Senator considering one of the things I \ntalked about earlier, that we would not do the whole $700 million in \none swat, but we take a part and say that is good for the next 3 or 4 \nmonths and come back and evaluate it?\n  Mr. DODD. I don't want to negotiate with you on the floor of the \nSenate. There are a lot of ideas kicking around. I know that is one \nthat has received some consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9353-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9353-S9355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE EMMETT TILL UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Harry \nReid. I thank Senator Coburn of Oklahoma as well. He has had a hold on \nthis bill, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which I \ncoauthored going back some 3 years ago. In fact, Jim Talent, our former \ncolleague from Missouri, was the original author of this legislation. I \nwas his original partner in this effort going back to 2005. He left the \nSenate and was replaced by Claire McCaskill, a great friend and \nwonderful Senator from Missouri.\n  I introduced this bill separately along with Senator Leahy and some \n12 other Members of the Senate, including Thad Cochran of Mississippi \nand Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. This has been a bipartisan effort \nthat has been tied up for the last couple years, regretfully, but \nnonetheless that is\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\nwhat it was. Today, the news that this bill has now passed the Senate \nis good news. I am deeply grateful to the majority leader, again, for \nsticking with an issue and not walking away from something as important \nas this is.\n  Some might argue that this is a long time in coming, others who say \nit is too little too late. In many ways, I suppose they could be right.\n  The subject matter, the name on this bill, Emmett Till, dates back 53 \nyears.\n  Fifty-three years ago, a young boy of 14 was killed for no other \nreason than the color of his skin. His life was extinguished in the \nmost brutal fashion imaginable.\n  When Emmett Till's body was discovered in the Tallahatchie River, it \nhad been weighted down by a 75-pound cotton gin fan, tied around the \nboy's neck with barbed wire. His clothes had been stripped from him and \nburned. Emmett's body could only be identified by a ring the young boy \nhad been wearing.\n  At the trial of the two White men who would later confess to the \ncrime, few African-Americans dared to even testify at the trial, such \nwas the atmosphere at the time. The all-White jury acquitted the two \nmen, deliberating for a mere 67 minutes, which one juror reportedly \nsaid only took so long because they paused to drink a soda. The \nrationale for acquittal? That the prosecution had failed to prove that \nthe body recovered from the river was even Emmett Till, so mutilated \nwas his face and body.\n  A year later, the two defendants bragged about the killing to a \nmagazine for a sum of $4,000.\n  Believe me when I say: there was no justice in this case--nor in \ncountless other civil rights cases that remain unsolved to this day.\n  The failures of our legal system to bring to justice those who \ncommitted brutal crimes based solely on racial prejudice is not merely \nsad or tragic--in a country such as ours and at this moment in our \nhistory, it is inexcusable.\n  The sad truth is that for far too long, hate crimes were rarely \ninvestigated in this country. For far too long, murderers could walk \nfree as long as they chose the so-called ``right'' victims. And so, \nwhatever the merits of this legislation, The Emmett Till Act cannot \nerase that memory. It cannot erase even a single year that lapsed \nbetween crime and justice.\n  What it can do is keep even more years from piling on.\n  If we want to remove the great stain on our justice system that is \nthe hundreds, maybe even thousands, of civil rights-era crimes that \nremain unsolved, we need to reopen the books on as many as we can.\n  That is what this legislation would do--bring justice to those who \nperpetrated these heinous crimes because of racial hatred by creating a \nmechanism that allows us to pursue them.\n  Can it bring back and make whole those who have suffered and were \nmurdered by a racist criminal hand? Of course not. But in passing this, \nthis Congress can reaffirm our Nation's commitment to the truth and to \nmaking equal justice not a dream but a reality.\n  As such, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act would give \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nincreased resources to reopen Civil Rights-era criminal cases which \nhave gone cold--that is, unsolved civil rights murder cases that \noccurred prior to 1970.\n  It would do so by designating a deputy chief in the criminal section \nof the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ and a supervisory special agent \nin the civil rights unit of the FBI. These officials will be tasked \nwith spearheading and coordinating efforts by Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement officers and prosecutors to bring long-time fugitives \nto justice.\n  For these purposes, it authorizes $10 million annually for fiscal \nyears 2008 through 2017. This legislation also authorizes $2 million \nannually for DOJ to make grants to State and local law enforcement and \n$1.5 million annually for the Community Relations Service within DOJ to \npartner with local communities. I know that sounds like a lot of money, \nbut when you talk about $700 billion to take care of some failed \ninstitutions verses a few million to pursue these cases, I hope my \ncolleagues would recognize the value.\n  The time has come to confront the injustices of the past openly and \nhonestly. For some of these crimes, it is too late. Last year, \nTallahatchie County in Mississippi officially apologized for the trial \nin the Emmett Till case in which these two confessed killers lived the \nrest of their lives in freedom. To be sure, they are now dead and \nbeyond the reach of justice.\n  But there was some measure of justice for the families of Andrew \nGoodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner--young civil rights workers \nwho participated in the historic Freedom Rides in 1963.\n  Edgar Ray Killen was allowed to roam free for more than three \ndecades. But his belated conviction in 2005 is proof that we can \nprovide closure and hold those responsible for terrible crimes, even \nyears after they have occurred.\n  With this legislation, we will launch one of the most exhausting \nmanhunts in the history of our country to pursue those responsible for \nthese acts. We can tell those who committed crimes who still roam this \ncountry free that they should never, ever, ever again enjoy a sleep-\nfilled night; that is, as long as they live, the U.S. Government, our \nGovernment, will do everything in its power to apprehend them and bring \nthem to the bar of justice.\n  That is the message we can convey today, with this legislation, to \nthe families, the friends, and others who have lost loved ones, who put \ntheir lives on the line to press for justice and for helping our Nation \nachieve that ``more perfect Union'' that each and every generation has \ntried to achieve. Those ideals are at the heart of this effort. We may \nnever be that perfect Union, but, as Abraham Lincoln understood \nintrinsically, each generation bears the responsibility for bringing us \ncloser to that ideal.\n  With this legislation, the Senate and this Congress on this date \nearly in the 21st century is saying simply: We will not forget, and we \nwill not yield.\n  The hour is, obviously, very late. Memories are dimming. Those who \ncan bring some important information to the legal authorities are \npassing away. This bill may be the last and best chance we will have as \na nation to write a hopeful postscript in the struggle for racial \nequality in our Nation and to provide closure for these families at \nlast.\n  We all bring a unique commitment to this case. Representative John \nLewis, my great and dear friend in the other body who has worked so \nhard to see this bill become law, was a hero of the civil rights \nmovement--is still a hero, I might point out--who nearly gave his life \nensuring that the promise of America can be realized for all of our \ncitizens and in all of our communities. Others may simply recognize \nwhen justice has not been served.\n  I have spoken many times about my father on this floor, in this \nChamber, about how in the 1930s he was among the first, as a member of \nthe Justice Department, long before the Civil Rights Division, to \nprosecute the Ku Klux Klan and other civil rights cases for the \nDepartment of Justice. I have spoken about his work as a prosecutor \npursuing Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg war trials, where he stood \nface to face with the men who committed crimes that were so horrifying, \nso enormous, that few believed they could have possibly happened--\nuntil, that is, my father set out meticulously proving them, step by \nstep, piece by piece. I believe the same is true of civil rights crimes \nin this country.\n  His body of work, including his service to this body, never fails to \nremind us that when we reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law, when \nwe act not out of vengeance but in pursuit of justice, we most live up \nto the promise as Americans. However tardy that pursuit may be, \naffirming that enduring commitment is what this effort is about today.\n  Again, I thank immensely the majority leader and others who have been \na part of this effort. We thank Jim Talent, the Senator from Missouri, \nwho originally authored this bill, and I am proud to have joined with \nhim some 3 years ago and proud to have picked up that mantle in this \nCongress, along with, as I say, 13 of our other colleagues here, to be \na part of this effort that has produced this passage a few minutes ago.\n  I wish to thank the steadfast support of allies and friends such as \nJohn\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\nLewis in the Congress, the House of Representatives, who made this \npossible, and many organizations that helped us shepherd this \nlegislation through the Senate: the NAACP, the Southern Law Poverty \nCenter, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and so many others.\n  In addition, I thank the Emmett Till Justice Campaign and its \npresident, Alvin Sykes. We heard Senator Coburn talk about this a few \nmoments ago, and I wish to associate myself with his remarks. He is a \nremarkable individual. Mr. Sykes's determination has helped the Senate \nget to this historic moment.\n  I wish to mention Simeon Wright, as I had the pleasure of meeting \nSimeon Wright and his wife a few weeks ago. Simeon Wright is Emmett \nTill's cousin, and he was sharing that bed with him that night 53 years \nago when his cousin was ripped out of that bed, never to be seen again, \nexcept for his mutilated body. Simeon Wright is getting on in years \nnow. But it was an honor to meet him and his wife, and his \ndetermination and commitment on behalf of his family helped us arrive \nat this moment. So to Simeon Wright and his family, the moment has \ncome, and this bill will now become law.\n  It is vital that we bring to justice those individuals who committed \nthese heinous crimes. It is essential to their families that we \nreaffirm this Nation's commitment to the rule of law.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for supporting the Emmett Till Unsolved \nCivil Rights Crime Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning I would like to speak about \nmedical safety, about patient care, about the cost of that care, and \nabout how Medicare is dealing with this.\n  In 1999, the Institute of Medicine issued a groundbreaking report on \nmedical errors. The report was called ``To Err Is Human: Building a \nSafer Health System.'' The Institute of Medicine findings provoked \nheated and extensive professional and public dialog. The report left \nfew doubting that preventable medical injuries occur and continue to be \na serious problem in America.\n  It identified a number of solutions, solutions to stop hospitals and \nphysicians from performing unsafe practices. It also asked lawmakers to \npartner with health care providers to create and to adhere to strict, \nambitious, quantitative and well-tracked national goals.\n  The National Quality Forum Set out to do just that. The forum's \nmission is to bring people together to create health care quality \ninitiatives that are safe, effective, and patient-centered.\n  In 2001, the former National Quality Forum CEO first coined the term \n``never event.'' Well, he was referring to particularly shocking \nmedical errors that really should never happen, medical errors such as \nsurgery performed on the wrong body part, surgery performed on the \nwrong patient, or the wrong surgical procedure performed on a patient.\n  By 2002, the National Quality Forum had identified 27 so-called never \nevents. Now, the ``group'' is listed in six different categories: \nsurgical, product or device, patient protection, care management, \nenvironmental, and criminal.\n  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality says that most never \nevents are very rare. They estimate that a typical hospital might have \na wrong-site surgery case once every 5 or 10 years.\n  As public reporting on health care quality gained momentum, lawmakers \nfocused on eliminating never events. They did it as a way to increase \naccountability as well as to contain costs. More and more surgeons \nbegan physically signing the surgical site with a marking pen in the \npre-op holding area. Now, they did this while the patient was still \nawake just to make sure everyone agreed what operation was being done \non what body part.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to select at least two conditions that could be \nreasonably prevented. This is where Washington went too far. The \nWashington bureaucrats identified eight conditions as never events. \nHere is the list: object left in during surgery; air embolism; blood \nincompatibility; pressure ulcers; falls and trauma; catheter-associated \nurinary tract infections; vascular catheter-associated infections; and \nsurgical-site infection. Why is this important, this list of eight? \nWell, it is important because some of this list of eight conditions \nreally should never happen. Some of these eight conditions, though, can \nand do occur with regularity, even under the best of circumstances.\n  Well, what is the impact of the rules on patients and the medical \nprofession? Medicare says it will pay to treat the underlying diagnosis \nbut will not pay the hospital to treat complications from any of these \neight conditions if the medical problem develops during the patient's \nhospital stay. For example, the patient is treated for a stroke, has no \nother complications during the hospital stay, and the hospital is paid \na little over $5,000 by Medicare. If the same patient was to have a \nsevere pressure ulcer when they arrived at the hospital in addition to \nthe stroke, Medicare pays about $3,000 more for the treatment of both \nthe stroke and the ulcers. But Medicare says: If the pressure ulcers \ndeveloped after the patient arrived at the hospital, then Medicare will \nonly reimburse to treat the stroke, not to treat the pressure ulcer.\n  The problem with pressure ulcers is they will not show up until the \npatient has usually been in the hospital for awhile. The damage to the \ntissue occurs at the time the patient with the stroke or with a broken \nhip lies motionless at home waiting until someone finds them, as often \nhappens with somebody who lives alone. The damage occurs before the \npatient is even taken to the hospital, but the hospital is going to \nlose up to $3,000 to treat the pressure ulcer regardless of the medical \ncondition that caused the problem in the first place. The bureaucrats \nare saying it should never happen, yet it happens all the time.\n  Although the never events program is in its infancy, I am troubled by \nthe direction these Washington bureaucrats are headed. I believe the \nnegative long-term impact on patient care is going to be significant. \nThis year, Washington bureaucrats expanded the never events. They \nexpanded the list to include even more conditions: surgical-site \ninfections following elective procedures, blood sugar control, and \ndeep-vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.\n  When you take a closer look at the entire process, it does show a \ndisturbing trend. I agree that a foreign object left behind inside a \npatient after surgery is an event that should never occur. The fact is \nthat most of the never events on the Government's list, selected and \ntargeted in the rulemaking process, are impossible to eliminate.\n  These bureaucrats clearly did not fulfill their requirement in the \nDeficit Reduction Act, a requirement to choose never events that are \nreasonably preventable by applying evidence-based guidelines. To be \nreasonably preventable, the Washington bureaucrats must have peer-\nreviewed, published literature showing clinicians can reduce the \nincidence of the chosen never event to zero or near zero. Current data \nshows that even when all appropriate care is administered, we do not \nknow how to reduce the rates to zero or near zero of many of the \nconditions now on the list. Some patients, particularly high-risk \nfolks, will develop conditions on the list regardless of how good the \ncare is that they receive at the hospital.\n  Here is an example. The bureaucrats have listed deep-vein thrombosis/\npulmonary embolism as a never event. Well, the best scientific studies \non large numbers of total hip and total knee procedures--and this is \nfrom the time I started in medical school and we were trying to lower \nthe risk of those blood clots--showed that under no circumstances, no \nmatter what different treatments the best scientists have come up with, \nthere is no current treatment available today worldwide that would \ndecrease the blood clot risk to zero.\n  Now, I want to tell you about a patient who had a broken hip, a \nbroken hip on the left side, and at the same time of the injury, she \nbruised her right hip but did not break it. We know that patients with \neither a broken hip or who have received an artificial hip,\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\nthat right after surgery, for the first couple of weeks, they have an \nincreased risk of getting a blood clot. We treat them with blood \nthinners. Still, blood clots happen.\n  So this is a patient who was given a blood thinner. We were trying to \nfind out what the right delicate balance was. We worked with an \ninternist and others. We thought we had the right delicate balance for \nthe right dose of medication. On her right side where she had the \nbruise, she bled into that wound, and that bruise got more blood \naccumulated, a hematoma. On the left side, the side with the broken \nhip, she got a blood clot. She was on the blood thinners and bled into \nthe one side, had a blood clot on the other side, and yet they call it \na never event. How can Washington bureaucrats say that this is a never \nevent?\n  Let's look at another so called never event that made the list. Many \nof the ventilator-assisted pneumonia cases I saw practicing medicine in \nCasper, WY, occurred in trauma patients. The Wyoming Medical Center is \na centrally located trauma facility. I saw patients brought in from \naccidents that occurred around all the State.\n  Many of the patients are treated and stabilized at a local hospital \n100 to 250 miles away. They are transferred to the Wyoming Medical \nCenter. Trauma physicians have no way to determine whether the \npneumonia is secondary to aspiration that occurred right there at the \nsite of the accident or whether it occurred as a result of something \nthat happened at the first hospital. In the physician's initial \nassessment, a pneumonia has not yet developed. It takes time before it \nshows signs. Even the Washington bureaucrats that wrote the proposed \nrule agree. The rule is clear and scientific evidence is clear that 60 \nto 80 percent of ventilator-assisted pneumonia cases cannot be \nprevented. How can they call that a never event?\n  I have been a doctor for 30 years. I can share lots of similar \nexamples with Members. Each example begs the following question: So \nwhat if the never event occurs in one hospital and then the patient \nneeds to be transferred to another medical facility for advanced \nspecialty care? Medicare says they are not going to pay for that \ntreatment. Does that mean the second physician in the second hospital \nwill not get paid? If the receiving hospital will get paid but the \nfirst one will not, isn't that surely going to lead to more transfers \nfrom one hospital to another, moving the patient from a hospital where \nthe hospital will not get paid to the hospital where payment will \noccur?\n  Look at it on the other side. If the receiving hospital will not get \npaid for a complication that occurred at the first hospital, then why \nshould they accept the patient in transfer for the care they need? Is \nthere any way for hospitals to appeal the decision of the Washington \nbureaucrats? What impact will this whole process have on medical \nliability? Will this list of so-called never events lead to increased \nlitigation? After all, if something is never supposed to happen because \nthe Government list says it doesn't but then it happens, does that mean \nsomeone is at fault?\n  Where guidelines and proven medical strategies exist, doctors and \nhospitals strive every day to make sure serious adverse events do not \never occur. Never events should never occur.\n  It is important to remember that the 1999 Institute of Medicine \nreport which called attention to medical errors in the first place said \nbad systems and not bad people lead to most errors. As an orthopedic \nsurgeon, I have spent my entire professional career trying to make \npeople better. I have been on call in the middle of the night when \nfolks have been involved in traumatic accidents. There are people with \nincredible talents practicing medicine, trying to do their best, but \ngovernment policies continue to needlessly hamstring the ability to \nhelp their patients. The health care of this Nation is going to be hurt \nby the direction that Washington bureaucrats are headed.\n  ``Never events'' should never happen. When Washington bureaucrats \nstretch the meaning of the word ``never'' to keep from paying \nhospitals, they mislead the public and cheat our Nation's hospitals and \nhealth care providers. Perhaps Washington should start to focus its \nregulatory efforts on eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nMedicare system. This year alone we have seen one news report after \nanother uncovering Medicare wasting American tax dollars. Medicare is \npaying billions for wheelchairs, prosthetics, canes, prescription \ndrugs, and other medical supplies, as the report shows, all prescribed \nby doctors who are dead, some who died 10 years ago. The Washington \ncheck writers honored hundreds of thousands of these fraudulent claims. \nI wonder who is holding these bureaucrats accountable.\n  In 2001, they pledged to fix the problem identified by the Health and \nHuman Services Office of the Inspector General. That was 7 years ago. \nRecent reports estimate Medicare loses approximately $70 to $90 billion \neach year to waste, fraud, and abuse. This strips our health care \nsystem of vital resources, resources we should be devoting to care for \nthe elderly, the frail, the vulnerable. Federal officials have an \nopportunity to show leadership. They could have chosen to work with \nhospitals and physicians to develop evidence-based guidelines. Instead \nthey have decided to issue a rule aimed at withholding money from \nhospitals, not improving patient care.\n  It is time to rethink this flawed policy. Policies must work to \nimprove patient care, not to punish hospitals. Hospital doors must \nremain open.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was pleased to see a report that the \ncontinuing resolution that will keep the Government running while \nCongress adjourns during the election period and beyond, that the \ncontinuing resolution proposed by the Democratic leadership in the \nHouse will actually eliminate a moratorium or a ban on drilling and \nexploration in the Outer Continental Shelf, which is, of course, the \nsubmerged Federal lands off our coastlines which are reported to have, \nby all of the experts, huge volumes of oil and gas. This actually \nrepresents a tremendous development in the Congress.\n  For a long time now we have been saying we need to develop more of \nAmerica's natural resources, American energy at home, so we would be \nless dependent on imported oil and gas from the Middle East. Until this \npoint, those entreaties, those pleadings, those requests had fallen on \ndeaf ears, it seemed. But I congratulate the Democratic leadership in \nthe House. This could go down as a bipartisan success of which we \nshould be proud.\n  I remind our colleagues this is only part of the equation. We have \nsaid we need to find more American energy so we would be less dependent \non imported oil from the Middle East. Where might we find that? It has \nbeen documented that deep sea exploration in the Outer Continental \nShelf, the submerged lands off our coastlines, could produce as much as \n14.3 billion barrels of oil. That is a lot. The western oil shale--\nwhich I am unclear whether the continuing resolution will deal with, \nbut which has currently received a ban on development and exploration \nof western oil shale--is projected to have the equivalent of 800 \nbillion barrels of oil. That is even more than the Outer Continental \nShelf. Then there is, of course, the Arctic Coastal Plain which is \nestimated to have 10.4 billion barrels of oil, for a total estimate of \n824.7 billion barrels of oil right in the good old U.S. of A. This \nwould eliminate all oil imports, once it was on line and was being \nproduced, for more than 198 years. These are fantastic numbers and time \nperiods. I know it is hard to conceive, but even if these numbers are \nnot exactly right, what it demonstrates is that we have a lot of great \noil and gas reserves in America. And all of the money that T. Boone \nPickens, through his advertising campaign to raise the visibility of \nthis issue, all the money which he has documented, which we are sending \noverseas to buy oil and gas, we could actually reduce that dramatically \nby producing more at home.\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\n  We have said, of course, it is only part of the equation. While we \nneed to find more, we also need to use less.\n  Yesterday we also did the third leg of the stool. We voted to extend \nthe various tax credits and subsidies that would encourage development \nof alternative sources of energy. In Texas, we are known as an energy \nState. I bet most people would be surprised to know that in addition to \noil and gas, we are the No. 1 electricity producer in the Nation from \nwind energy. Obviously, those alternative sources of energy are very \nimportant.\n  I caution my colleagues to the fact that no matter how much we act to \neliminate the moratorium on the ban on offshore exploration, we still \nhaven't done enough to open western oil shale. We still haven't done \nanything to open exploration and production in the Arctic Coastal \nPlain. I know while this 824 billion figure seems like a lot, it is \nestimated, once on line, it would produce about 3 billion barrels of \noil a day, reducing our dependency. Just as the President's elimination \nof the executive ban on offshore exploration is a hopeful sign and \nelimination of the Federal moratorium on exploration and production in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf is likewise a hopeful sign, it is a \nnecessary but not a sufficient answer to the problem. That is because \nsignificant oil and gas reserves that exist in America, where producers \nand leaseholders already have a right to explore and produce that oil \nand gas and where they have invested more than $2 billion into these \nprojects, because of lawsuits, opponents have blocked drilling in a way \nthat, unfortunately, is going to take years and years and years to \nresolve.\n  There are many examples of litigation thwarting approved drilling \nprojects on existing leases. The area I am talking about specifically \nis, the Federal Government has leased land and approved drilling in the \nBeaufort Sea off the coast of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nToo often, long-term planning and heavy investments of human and \nfinancial resources necessary to develop and produce these reserves are \nfrustrated, and future investment discouraged, when projects that have \nbeen extensively reviewed and approved by the responsible Federal \nagencies are shut down and effectively thwarted by frivolous \nlitigation.\n  It is undisputed that oil and gas can be extracted from below the \nsurface in a cleaner and more environmentally sensitive way than ever \nbefore. This is something that is vividly demonstrated by the fact that \nif you land or take off from an airplane at DFW Airport in the \nmetroplex of Texas, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, you can actually land \nat the DFW Airport and you will see a number of drilling rigs on the \nDFW Airport property. What they are drilling through there is something \ncalled the Barnett Shale, a prolific producer of natural gas right \nthere in a highly populated area. It is being done in an \nenvironmentally responsible way, a way that is safe to the human \noccupants of that area and a way that, because of modern drilling \ntechnology, you can use a single well bore and basically go in all \ndirections by thousands of feet and produce a lot more natural gas than \nyou could have using old drilling technology. So just like when it \ncomes to coming up with better sources of alternative energy, \ntechnology has produced a more efficient, more environmentally \nresponsible way of drilling for oil and gas right here in the United \nStates.\n\n  But to get back to my point, even if we lift this ban--all of these \nbans--unless we do something about the limitless litigation that \nprevents drilling from ever starting, we might as well have done \nnothing because this effectively shuts down drilling and production of \nAmerican energy as much as any moratorium could. Unless we reform this \nlitigation system, any repeal of a drilling ban does nothing to help \nconsumers at the pump.\n  So I urge my colleagues to work with me and all of us who are \ninterested in trying to find a solution to this tremendous dependency \non foreign oil. Lifting the moratorium is an important step. I \ncongratulate the Democratic leadership coming together with Republicans \nwho have been calling for this for many months now. But no one should \nbe fooled--and this would be the most cynical of all--if Congress \npretended to actually be solving a problem when we know that this \nfrivolous litigation effectively bans development of America's natural \nresources. This would be the most cynical move of all if we did nothing \nabout that second part, about the frivolous litigation, because already \nI think people across America look at Congress as appearing to do \nthings, perhaps superficially appearing to be responsive to their \nconcerns, but in the end roadblocks continue to exist which impede, if \nnot block, any realistic reform or progress on the particular subject.\n  So this is something I hope we will not give up on. I think today if, \nin fact, we do pass a continuing resolution that eliminates the \nmoratorium on Outer Continental Shelf exploration development, it will \nbe a great day. It is a necessary--again, a necessary--but insufficient \nway of addressing the ultimate dependency on imported oil.\n  We know high energy prices affect our economy. As a matter of fact, \neven though prices have dipped some, the fact is, today, according to \nUSA Today, the average price of gasoline is $3.72 a gallon in America. \nIt had gone as high as $4.11 a gallon and has come down a little bit, \nbut it is hard to remember just a year ago a gallon of gasoline sold \nfor an average of $2.80 a gallon. In other words, it is up about 92 \ncents a gallon over a year ago, even though it has come down a little \nbit.\n  The underlying problem that is putting so much pressure on gasoline \nand oil prices is, of course, the law of supply and demand and the fact \nthat growing economies such as India and China are using more and more \nenergy, which means we are competing globally for the same oil, which, \nof course, unless we produce more, the law of supply and demand tells \nus the price will continue to go up.\n  So we should not be fooled into thinking we have solved the problem \nby eliminating only the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf--and \nthere is more that remains to be done with the western oil shale and \nthe Arctic Coastal Plain--we should not fool ourselves into thinking we \nhave solved the problem, even if we were to lift those moratoria, \nunless we address this frivolous litigation that has had a way of \nbogging down this development in areas already leased and where \nleaseholders and producers have already invested billions of dollars. \nWe need to do something about that.\n  So I hope we will return--if not this week--and my hope would be we \ncould do this at the same time. There are a number of proposals. \nCongressman Shadegg over in the House of Representatives has done good \nwork in this area. Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska has some very good \nand interesting proposals. I have heard Senator Kit Bond of Missouri \ntalking about some ideas he has. I have a proposal we have been working \non that we think will address the delays in this frivolous litigation, \nwhile preserving to those who were genuinely harmed the right to \nrecover compensation if, in fact, there is damage as a result of some \nmisconduct on the part of the individuals who are producing or \nexploring for energy in America.\n  So far so good. I think we ought to acknowledge the progress that is \nbeing made after all of these months. But we are not there yet. I hope \nwe will see continued cooperation as we actually help to bring down the \nprice at the pump and reduce America's dependency on imported oil in a \nway that endangers our national security and threatens our economy at a \ntime when our economy is quite fragile indeed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nprinciples that will guide my consideration and my vote on the proposal \nmade by the administration, by the Secretary of Treasury, Henry \nPaulson, and Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  I have to tell you I am extremely upset we find ourselves in this \nterrible situation. I can tell you the phone calls I have been getting \nfrom my constituents are that they are overwhelmingly angry at how we \ncould possibly find ourselves in this situation.\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\n  First of all, I think there has been a perception that--listening to \nTreasury Secretary Hank Paulson--is actually not true: that this is \nsomehow a bailout for Wall Street. In other words, the people who have \nprofited mightily from the enormous sums of money that have been made \nrecently on Wall Street, in the end, they are going to get off scot-\nfree and the taxpayer is going to end up holding the tab. That is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  First and foremost, I think we need to ask ourselves how we can \nprotect the American taxpayers. The vast majority of Americans played \nno part in the collapse of some of the largest financial institutions \nin America, and they should not be forced to pay the price for the \nirresponsible and risky conduct of those who were at fault.\n  Secondly, we need to make sure this American economy remains stable \nand that small businesses, which are the lifeblood and the job creators \nin our economy, have the ability to grow and to create new jobs.\n  I think in the end economic growth is the key. What can we do to keep \nthis great economy growing and producing jobs? I believe responsible \ntax relief helps small businesses grow and helps create jobs. Now, how \nwould I know that? Well, all I would have to do is look back to the tax \nrelief we passed in 2003, which cut the dividends and capital gains \nrate, which gave rise to a net increase of about 7 million jobs in \nAmerica. That is what life was like before we hit the subprime mortgage \ncrisis and high energy prices.\n  But we ought to look to what works, and we should not use this as an \nexcuse to grow the size of Government and increase the size of the tax \nburden on hard-working American families and small businesses because \nthat will make things worse, not better.\n  Third, we need to ask ourselves if this proposal does enough to \nsafeguard transparency and accountability. Frankly, I think a lot of \nwork needs to be done here. I think the very fact that Moody's and \nother entities which actually grade the investment value of many of \nthese mortgage-backed security projects completely missed the target \nand failed to predict the precipitous drop in value of these subprime \nmortgages and the securities that are backed by these mortgages is \nevidence this is simply an opaque and nontransparent system and that \nnot even the people who should know were able to evaluate what the true \nvalue of these mortgage-backed securities were. So I think we need to \nhave certainly more transparency in this process, and we need to make \nsure those who are responsible are held accountable.\n  I am very pleased to hear in today's news that the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation has decided to investigate, among others, the actions of \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae to determine whether fraud or corruption on \nthe part of key players was the cause or contributed to the cause of \nour current financial turmoil. After the collapse of Freddie and \nFannie, I sent a letter to the Attorney General of the United States, \nMichael Mukasey, and asked for a full investigation because in 2006 the \nvery titans of industry who reaped millions of dollars in financial \ngain ended up with a slap on the wrist and no criminal penalty for \ncooking the books in order to generate larger bonuses and financial \nreturns for themselves. That is completely unacceptable.\n\n  We need to make sure those who are responsible for precipitating this \nfinancial crisis are held accountable. If that means they are guilty of \ncrimes, they should go to prison and pay the price as an example to \nothers who would take advantage of the American taxpayer and would be \nmotivated by the kind of greed that lets them forget their \nresponsibilities not only to their shareholders but to the American \npeople themselves.\n  So I am pleased the Attorney General is taking an aggressive posture \nand the Federal Bureau of Investigation is going to be conducting a \nthorough investigation. I say let the chips fall where they may. I do \nnot care who it is. I hope they will pursue that to the fullest extent \nof the law.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come and address these \nvery important topics, and I hope that as the days go by Congress can \nwork together in a bipartisan manner to try to find a way to address \nthese problems. But certainly the initial proposal by the Secretary of \nTreasury is unacceptable on a number of bases, but he has my \ncommitment, as do my colleagues, that I will do my best to work with \nhim to try to protect the American taxpayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the \nSenate today. I second the words of my colleague from Texas of the \nconcerns of this economy and question how we got here. It is pretty \nclear to me, with 8 years of Bush economics, with deregulation of Wall \nStreet, more tax cuts for the rich, and a trade policy that Wall Street \nhas pushed through the House and Senate, these job-killing trade \nagreements that have caused literally millions of manufacturing jobs to \nflee our country, combined with a tax policy that gives incentives for \ncompanies to go overseas, rather than passing Senator Obama's, Senator \nDurbin's, and my Patriot Corporation Act, which gives incentives for \nthose companies that are staying right here in the United States, \nwhether it is in Omaha or Cleveland, whether it is in Houston or \nColumbus, those companies that play by the rules, rewarding them with \ntax policy and others that those companies deserve.\n  Let me, for a moment, Mr. President, take the Senate around on a tour \nof my State. There are so many good things happening in Ohio. I was \nwith Governor Strickland for a couple days on Friday and Saturday going \nthrough eastern and southern Ohio. We were talking with people we met \nand talking to each other about all that is happening in our State, all \nthe good that is happening, particularly in the area of biomedical \nresearch and development and job creation and especially in alternative \nenergy.\n  Ohio is on the precipice--as many of us have pushed for in my State \nfor many years--Ohio is on the precipice of being the Silicon Valley of \nalternative energy. It started in Toledo, which has the largest solar \nenergy manufacturer in the country. The research going on at the \nUniversity of Toledo on wind turbines is the furthest reaching, \nfurthest advanced research in the country.\n  Go around the State to Akron and you can see what the University of \nAkron is doing with polymers and the kind of spinoff of jobs replacing \nlost jobs in the auto industry.\n  Go to Dayton where we have the National Composite Center that is \nmaking major contributions with lighter, stronger, more durable \nmaterials that can help with more efficient, better mileage \nautomobiles, not to mention what they are doing on alternative energy \nwith wind turbine blades.\n  Go to Cleveland and look at what the Case Western Reserve University, \nin conjunction with the Cleveland Foundation, is doing with plans to be \nthe first place in the world where there will be a wind turbine farm in \nfresh water off the coast of Cleveland in green Lake Erie, supplying \nmuch of the electricity needs of northern Ohio.\n  Go to Columbus and look at the Center for Automotive Research and the \nwork they are doing for Ohio State. Look at the great university \nfacilities at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the University of \nCincinnati and what they are doing on biomedical research and \nalternative energy too.\n  You can see in my State of Ohio, as many jobs as we have lost, this \nState is coming back.\n  Now, we can't do what we need to do--and the Governor was emphatic \nabout that, as I am in the Chamber of the Senate--we can't do what we \nneed to do unless we get a little more help from the Federal \nGovernment, not so much giving us things but just not standing in our \nway.\n  Instead, we have seen, for the last several years in our State and in \nour country, a betrayal of the middle class. The drug companies wrote \nthe Medicare law, the insurance industry has written health care \nlegislation in this Congress, the oil companies have dictated energy \npolicy, and Wall Street has pushed through these job-killing trade \nagreements. On issue after issue after issue, the Republican majority \nin the House and in the Senate, for most of the last 8 years, and the \nBush administration have betrayed the middle\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\nclass and the values that we as a nation and that we as a State find so \nimportant.\n  All you have to do is look at what happened yesterday in the Banking \nCommittee when Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke testified. I \nhave a lot of respect for Chairman Bernanke. I think he has moved as \nquickly as a Fed Chairman can in dealing with the housing crisis in \nmost cases, certainly compared to his predecessor, who helped to set \nthe table for a lot of these problems. I have a lot of respect for him. \nHe and Secretary Paulson testified before our committee. They had some \ninteresting ideas, as the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, mentioned a \nmoment ago. I don't buy their solution: Give me $700 billion and a \nblank check and I will try and figure out how to do it; buying these \ntroubled assets, without any rules to it. It is dead on arrival in my \nbelief.\n  But what my colleagues don't bring out, when we have this terrible \nproblem on Wall Street, is how we got there. It is this betrayal of the \nmiddle class that has been brought to us by the Bush administration--\nthe deregulation of Wall Street. Wall Street people are always going to \nbe aggressive. They are all going to look for money-making \nopportunities. They are all going to play on the edge sometimes and \ntake risks. But until the Bush years, there have been rules in place \nthat keep Wall Street from going over the line, that keep Wall Street \nin check, that still capture the energy and dynamism of capitalism but \ndon't allow them to go overboard and do what they did. That is what has \nbrought us to this today, coupled with the tax cuts and the incredible \nprofits of Wall Street firms, the incredible bonuses, eight-figure \nbonuses. When I say eight figure, that means $10 million and up; \nbonuses that too many of these Wall Street executives had while they \nwere inflicting damage in Maple Heights, in Garfield Heights, in \nNorwood, and in places all over my State that are suffering from the \nhome foreclosure crisis.\n  So we got to this place where Wall Street overreached, where their \ngreed overcame all other sentiments, and we got to this place because \nof the Bush deregulation of Wall Street, because of the tax cuts, \nbecause of this trade policy that has betrayed the middle class. As far \nas I am concerned, three strikes and you are out. This deregulation, \nthe tax cuts, and trade policy clearly have put us in a place where my \nState has lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs since George Bush took the \noath of office. I see the pain around my State, even though we are \nfighting back. Even in that initial trip around the State that I took \nmy colleagues on, people in my State are hurting. In the last year and \na half, since I was sworn into the Senate in January of 2007, I have \nheld almost 120 roundtables in my State--from Ashtabula to Middletown, \nfrom Gallipolis to Toledo--and in these roundtables I will invite 15 or \n20 people from the community or 15 or 20 veterans or 15 or 20 farmers, \na cross-section of the community, and talk to them about their hopes \nand their dreams. Increasingly, I see fear. Increasingly, I see anxiety \nabout the future because they know their Government simply hasn't been \non their side.\n  So I think about this deregulation, the Bush-Cheney-McCain \nderegulation. We know that our colleague, Senator McCain--who has not \nbeen here very much in the last year and a half because of the \nPresidential campaign--has consistently pushed for deregulation. He \nhas, in the last few months, become a raging populist. He almost sounds \nlike some of the great populists who sat in this Senate over the last \n100 years. He almost sounds like Paul Wellstone. He almost sounds like \nSenator LaGuardia from New York, people who fought for the common man. \nBut this is sort of a new John McCain than before when he was for the \ntax cuts, when he was for deregulation. More importantly, Senator \nMcCain has been one of the prominent cheerleaders for deregulation \nwhich got us into this position on Wall Street. Now he is saying the \nPresident should fire Chairman Cox. He is saying we should go after \nthese Wall Street executives, things he never dreamed of saying until \nhe decided it was good for his Presidential campaign.\n  In the past, Senator McCain has said he doesn't know much about \neconomics, and what he does know he learned from one of our colleagues, \nPhil Gramm. Phil Gramm was the architect--John McCain's mentor in the \nSenate, particularly on economic issues--Phil Gramm was the prime \narchitect of this deregulation scheme that has so pushed us behind the \neight ball and that is so troubling, frankly, to the direction we are \nnow going. I think if we hadn't had this deregulation of Wall Street, \nwe wouldn't be in the position we are. I don't know that Senator Gramm \ngets it, still. Phil Gramm has said we are not in a recession; that \nAmericans are in a mental recession. When people complained about that \nstatement saying: Look around; all you have to do is look around, Phil \nGramm said the American people ought to quit whining. It is easy for \nhim to say. He is a major bank executive. He is a lobbyist--he is a \nmajor bank executive and he has made so much money. He is the Senator \nwho supported Enron and all its problems. We know that following his \neconomic advice is not the way the country should go.\n  I come to the floor today for one more purpose, and that is to sound \nthe alarm on what this privatization, deregulation scheme is all about. \nImagine if we had followed what Senator McCain had said in 2005. In \n2005, President Bush was sworn in for his second term on January 20. \nTwo weeks before that, the House and Senate began their sessions. We \nwere sworn in. I was sworn in as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives in those days. Soon after our swearing in and soon \nafter the President's swearing in, the President unveiled his major \ndomestic policy initiative, which was to privatize Social Security, to \nset up these private accounts. Democrats opposed them in a unified way \nin the Congress. In the House and Senate, almost every single \nDemocrat--maybe every single Democrat--opposed them. People in the \ncountry said no. Democrats said no. All over the country, citizens, \nIndependents said no, Republicans said no, this was a bad idea.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank my colleague from Florida.\n  Imagine what would have happened if we had gone along and if the \ncountry hadn't said no to this Bush-Cheney-McCain privatization scheme: \nAmericans now would find that these private accounts weren't quite what \nthey were billed to be. They were, in fact, as risky as many of us \nsaid. Because of the promises of: Let's put our private accounts--let's \nput our hard-earned Social Security dollars in New York; let's have \nWall Street manage our private Social Security accounts--we all know \nwhat would have happened with the vicissitudes and the volatility of \nthe stock market.\n  My last point is Senator McCain has recently called himself \nfundamentally a deregulator and he is sort of the deregulator in chief \nin the Senate. But he has come up with something else. He wrote in this \nmonth's issue of Health Magazine that it would still be a good idea to \nderegulate the health insurance market: ``As we have done over the last \ndecade in banking.''\n  I don't get it. I don't know how any Member of this body, if he ever \ngoes home or she ever goes home and talks to voters, how they could \nthink that deregulation of banking, deregulation of health care, let's \ngive more power to Wall Street and deregulate banking; let's give more \npower to the health insurance industry and deregulate health insurance, \nit would make any sense at all. I think that, perhaps, more than \nanything, shows the fork in the road we are at in this country.\n  In this Senate and in the House and in the elections, we have a \nchoice. Do we want to continue down this path of deregulation and \nbetrayal of the middle class by a government that has turned this \nGovernment over to interest groups--the drug companies writing the \nMedicare law, the insurance companies writing the health care \nlegislation, the oil companies writing energy policy, Wall Street \npushing through these job-killing trade agreements--do we want to \ncontinue to go in that direction or do we want to go in a different \ndirection that will put the middle class first. I think the choice is\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\nclear, and I think we will see that in the upcoming weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I have some remarks I wish to make about \nthe pending matter of the financial crisis we are facing, but before I \ndo I guess I have to make some comments about some of the things my \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio had to say. It was a great speech for \na Presidential race, but I don't think it touched on some of the very \nimportant issues our country is facing right here and now, the big \ndecisions we have to make and that we have to do in a bipartisan way.\n  We cannot rewrite history because it sounds good. We cannot rewrite \nhistory because it helps the Presidential campaign that one might want \nto see succeed in the next 40 days.\n  The fact is we had a regulation bill before the Senate: S. 190. I was \na cosponsor of it. Senator John McCain was a cosponsor of that bill. \nThat bill could have regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It got \nnowhere. The silence on the other side of the aisle was deafening. This \nwas in 2005. It wasn't that long ago. There was an opportunity then for \nall to come around the idea that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at the \nheart of the problem we have faced in this financial crisis, and they \nshould have a strong, world-class regulator. I wish to talk more about \nthat in a moment. When we talk about a betrayal of the middle class, \nwouldn't it have been a good idea if we had rallied around John McCain, \nElizabeth Dole, John Sununu, Mel Martinez, and others who were \nsupporting the idea that we needed a strong regulator for Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac; that they were undercapitalized, and until they had a \nworld-class regulator, it would be business as usual, and they would \ncontinue to pass their largesse around the Congress among their \nfavorites. The fact is we did not get that bill passed in 2005, when it \nmight have made a difference.\n  It is also easy to talk about this administration and attempt to \nrewrite history. It is probably more politically expedient not to \ndefend this administration, but I was a part of it. From 2001 to 2003 I \nserved as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I came before the \nCongress and I testified before the House and the Senate Banking and \nFinancial Services Committees, respectively. I had on my side the \nSecretary of the Treasury, John Snow, who was the Secretary at the \ntime. What did we tell the Congress? We told Congress that we thought \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac needed a strong regulator, that they were \nthinly capitalized, and that they posed a systemic risk to our economy. \nI don't know if Senator Brown, at the time a Member of the House, had \nan opportunity to hear or read our testimony, but if he had, he would \nhave known that this administration was for a stronger regulatory \nscheme for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  I would also say to the Senator from Ohio, when he talks about \nderegulatory schemes and tax cuts, the fact is the tax cuts we have had \nin place brought us out of a recession which we were in in 2001. We \nhave short memories, I know. I know we have a 30-second sitcom memory, \nbut we should remember that in 2001, when President Bush came into \noffice, this country was in a recession. We came out of that recession \nas a result of a lesser tax burden on the American people that created \njobs and that got this country moving again.\n  One last thing I will say before I go to my remarks that I planned to \nmake. When we talk about trade agreements that lose jobs, stalling a \ntrade agreement with the country of Colombia, in addition to not \nserving our security interests, is costing jobs in Miami, in Port \nEverglades, in the Port of Tampa. These are good-paying jobs. These are \nthe kinds of jobs that people today in Florida, with unemployment over \n6 percent, would stand in line to be able to have. These are good-\npaying jobs at the ports--ports that would trade with Colombia. The No. \n4 trading port in America with Colombia is in Tampa. Jobs would be \ncreated in Tampa, FL, if we were to trade with Colombia and if we were \nto have a free-trade agreement with Colombia. Over $1 billion in \nincreased trade, in increased jobs, in increased dollars flowing into \nFlorida's economy would be created if we would pass that free-trade \nagreement, which is stalled because we are doing the bidding of the big \nlabor unions that don't want to see it happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9360-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9360-S9361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FINANCIAL RESCUE PLAN\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, let's now talk about the moment at hand. \nThe seriousness of the moment could not be more overstated or \nunderstated. This Congress is about to consider the most important \nlegislation affecting our financial markets, I would say for a \ngeneration and possibly in the history of our country.\n  The American people must understand exactly what is at stake as we \nbegin to consider this legislation. This is something we have to do, \nputting aside partisan rhetoric, putting aside the fact that in 40 days \nwe have a Presidential election.\n  We have to put aside the partisanship and shed ourselves of that \nrhetoric. That rhetoric just invites more and more acrimony. The fact \nis, we have to come together not as politicians but maybe in a rare \nmoment of statesmanship to look at this legislation and this serious \nand sober moment that our country faces.\n  What happened is that the credit markets have quit functioning. \nCredit cards, car loans, home equity loans, home mortgages, business \nloans--all of these loans are impacted. Business loans, which keep \nlarge and small businesses operating, have ceased to exist. They cannot \nget the credit that is necessary to operate their businesses. The \nfinancial markets are not functioning, putting in jeopardy our entire \neconomy. The entirety of our economy is at stake in what we are dealing \nwith now.\n  Without timely Government intervention, the financial system as we \nknow it no longer will exist. This will impact each and every American \nfamily, and it will impact them not just for the next month but for \nyears to come.\n  This isn't a Wall Street versus Main Street argument. This isn't \nabout dividing us and trying to gain political advantage by the \ndivision it creates. This is about every American's ability to pursue \nhis or her American dream. Without liquidity in the marketplace, \nfinancial transactions just come to a halt. That will create a complete \ncollapse of our financial system as we know it.\n  So the need to act has become clear. Treasury Secretary Paulson has \nasked for the authority to purchase illiquid assets from financial \ninstitutions in an attempt to get the markets functioning again.\n  With that authority comes great responsibility, and Congress has an \nobligation to the U.S. taxpayers to ensure that any program is crafted \nand carried out with appropriate oversight.\n  Congress should consider limiting executive compensation in any \npackage we discuss. Congress will have to engage in active oversight of \nTreasury as they implement whatever plan we ultimately approve. So \nthere should be no blank check, and there will be no blank check.\n  Let me also mention I am very pleased to learn of ongoing \ninvestigations into the activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, and \nLehman Brothers. This is the worst financial crisis our country has \nencountered in recent history, and we owe it to the taxpayers to get to \nthe bottom of any wrongdoing that may have occurred. That is welcome \nnews. The American people ought to be reassured by the fact that there \nis not going to be any whitewashing of wrongdoing when it comes to this \nvery serious crisis.\n  We need to prosecute any inappropriate behavior on the part of these \ncompanies to the fullest extent of the law. If we are going to have to \nfix this problem, those who created it need to be held accountable.\n  After the dust clears, Congress cannot lose sight of one of the main \nreasons we are so heavily encumbered by this crisis--why our financial \nsystem is so deeply troubled at this moment in time. Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac were huge contributors to the problem because of their thin \ncapitalization, ever-expanding portfolios, and risky practices. I add \nto that, that was made possible by weak regulation, by the kind of \nregulatory scheme designed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so they\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\ncould keep doing business as usual, so they could continue to make the \npolitical contributions and continue to run the Congress as they \nwished. I recall on more than one occasion we were trying to push that \nlegislation that Senator Dole originally sponsored, which I was proud \nto cosponsor with John McCain, so that we would have an effective \nregulator over Fannie and Freddie. It was really about Fannie Mae was \nnot going to go for that, so that meant it was dead on arrival and we \ncould not get it done. As they were able to have their say in terms of \nthe type of regulator they wanted, then they were able to create the \nkind of crisis we have come to today.\n  They fueled and funneled the risky securities that Wall Street bought \nand sold and made lots of money, while ignoring the systemic risk that \nmove posed to the financial system.\n  In 2003, when I was HUD Secretary, I came before the Congress with \nTreasury Secretary Snow and warned of the loose regulation of the GSEs \nand the risk posed by their undercapitalization.\n  We asked Congress to create a world-class regulator to properly \nprovide oversight to these financial entities that had become so large \nthat they had an implied guarantee of the Federal Government, and they \nwere deemed too big to be allowed to fail.\n  In 2005, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Congress \nhow urgent it was for it to act, and he said in the clearest possible \nterms, if Fannie and Freddie ``continue to grow, continue to have the \nlow capital that they have, continue to engage in the dynamic hedging \nof their portfolios, which they need to do for interest rate risk \naversion, they potentially create ever-growing potential systemic risk \ndown the road.''\n  Well, we are now at the end of that road. As we go forward, not only \nwill Congress have to determine the future role of these entities, we \nneed to take a very close look at the practices that brought us to this \nplace.\n  Throughout all of this work, we cannot lose sight of the root cause \nof this financial debacle--the housing crisis. What are we going to do \nto avert an ever-deepening housing crisis? When we ask Secretary \nPaulson what is the reason we are where we are, obviously, the lack of \nregulatory scheme appropriate for Fannie and Freddie is part of it, but \nthey say that mortgage-backed securities continue to have no value. The \nmarkets for mortgage-backed securities, which has essentially locked \ndown the entire lending system of our country--and I daresay the \nworld--came about as a result of the deepening crisis in home prices, \nthe fact that home values continue to decline, so mortgage-backed \nsecurities continue to have little or no value.\n  So what are we doing in this scheme that we are discussing to avert \nan ever-deepening housing crisis? How are we going to try to put a \nfloor on those declining home values that are creating the type of \ncrises in mortgage-backed securities that brought us to this brink of \ncomplete financial collapse of our financial system?\n  Floridians are among the hardest hit in the Nation. Our State is \nsuffering mightily because of the deepening housing crisis. I have, for \na long time, been saying, as we talked about a stimulus package some \nmonths ago--and we got them out the door and a lot of families have \nbeen helped by that, and I voted for that package--I said then: What \nare we doing not to treat what is apparent in our economy, which is \nthat people are hurting, but the root cause of the pain, which was the \nhousing economy? The fact is, folks who work in home construction are \nout of work, homebuilders are not being able to keep their employees \ngoing and give them the health insurance they provided for them, and we \nhave that entire cycle in the homebuilding industry that is, today, not \nworking as it should, which is providing us with the kind of economic \npain so many Floridians are feeling.\n  In addition, we have people now in foreclosure or are facing it. That \nwill continue, as will the decline of neighborhoods. As the \nneighborhoods decline, the communities decline. How are we going to \nhelp that situation? I believe it is inevitable that, whether we do it \nnow or later, we have to seriously address the issue of the declining \nhome values. One way of doing it would be to provide a healthy $15,000 \ntax credit to those who would invest in a new home and help them with \nthe downpayment by that particular means. That is a solution that I \nhave been advocating that may be of significant help in bringing down \nthe huge inventory of unused homes that we have, particularly in places \nsuch as Florida.\n  Housing prices continue to fall, inventories continue to rise, and a \ngrowing number of homeowners are facing their own personal foreclosure \ncrisis.\n  To find the bottom of the housing crisis, to stabilize prices, we \nneed Congress to act. We can approve home-buying incentives. Congress \ncan approve a tax credit for downpayments. That would at least \nencourage people to enter the marketplace, would reduce housing \ninventories, and get the money flowing back into the market.\n  As Congress debates this package, let's remember whom we work for--\nthe American taxpayer. Our priority should be making decisions that \nserve their best interests. No blank check, strict oversight, \naccountability, and taxpayer recourse.\n  It is in every American's best interest that we act. I look forward \nto creating the right legislation that averts a financial crisis that \nwill affect every single American--a financial crisis perhaps bigger \nthan the Great Depression. That is what is at stake today.\n  So this is a moment when we have to get away from the usual partisan \nrancor. We have to get away from thinking about how we might gain a \npolitical advantage over the other side. The fact is, we need to put \naside the fact that we have an election coming up, put aside all of our \ndifferences, and we have to come together--Republicans and Democrats, \nliberal and conservative--for the good of our country. This is a moment \nthat doesn't call for politics as usual. I believe it is a moment that \ncalls for something a little bigger than that, a little greater than \nthat.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to come up with the best ideas that we can. But at the end of the \nday, I believe the failure to act would be so cataclysmic, so \ndevastating to our country that we have but only one course, which is \nto find the best way to get this done, with the right oversight and the \nright checks and balances, but act we must.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I didn't get the entire message of the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida. The part of the speech I heard \ntalked about us getting together and working as American Senators, not \nRepublicans or Democrats, in this time of crisis. I totally \ncongratulate the Senator. I agree with him and I believe it is \nimperative that we do something before we leave.\n  Today, I hear talk that we have a continuing resolution we have to \npass, and then we are finished. I am not hearing that from anybody \nofficially, but it is chattering around. That is the big thing to do.\n  I must say, that is a frightening thought. If we are thinking of \nleaving here without doing something to give the Treasury Department of \nthe United States some authority to stabilize the credit system of the \nUnited States--if we don't do that and spend time doing that, we don't \ndeserve to be called Senators.\n  It is hard to explain, but when you look at it, credit and the \nAmerican credit system--call it the banking system if you would like, \nbut I am calling it the credit system--is what makes America's \nprosperity available to millions and millions of people. It is the \ncredit system that we set up that has given us the greatest standard of \nliving that any people have ever had.\n  Something is going wrong with that financial system. It is not a \nquestion of Wall Street; it happens to be that Wall Street is the \ncenter for some of these\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\nfinancial systems that I am talking about. But they are going amiss; \nthey are going awry. Something basic is happening, so that the \nliquidity of the system, which means the money available for the \nAmerican financial system that I have just spoken of--something has \nclogged it up. We are told by the experts--and I don't think they have \nanything to gain. I think the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is \na distinguished American who never would have thought he was taking on \nthis job when he agreed to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  Incidentally, for those who don't know, he has a Ph.D. in economics, \nbut guess what his dissertation was on. It was on the Great Depression. \nI think we are lucky that we have somebody there who understands the \nworst of times. He is here, joined by the Secretary of the Treasury, \nwho is not a long-term Wall Streeter. It is only about 6 years that he \nhas been involved in the Wall Street activities as a businessman. He is \nhere begging us, pleading with us, and apologizing that he is not a \ngood speaker. I am kind of saying: Who cares. Just listen to what he \nsays. If you can understand it, pick it up and decide there is \nsomething for you to do.\n  If I sound like I am concerned, I would like everybody to know I have \na very large stake in the future. My grandchildren haven't stopped \narriving on the scene. I have 13 of them. I have 8 children of my own, \nand America has been great to all of us. There are millions more \nAmericans like myself.\n  What is going to happen if we leave here without solving this problem \nor at least giving the executive branch, through the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the authority to try to do something to make this system \nliquid so that money will flow again? If we don't do that and we go \nhome and think we are going to have a Christmas, we are apt to have a \nChristmas that will shock us all.\n  We are being told we can have a recession. Those are the words of a \nmild-mannered Federal Reserve Chairman. That is what he says, we could \nhave a recession. I am quite sure when he is in the back room talking \nwith those experts who advise him and with Secretary Paulson, he says \nworse than that. He probably says the thing can fall apart because it \nis all tied together and now it is all going to come untied, this great \ncountry, with billions of dollars in securities in the hands of all \nkinds of countries and people, having the dollar fall and the other \nsignals out there that maybe they are right, that we are getting close \nto things falling apart.\n  I have a prepared speech. I asked somebody who is an expert to give \nme the whole history of the banking system of the United States since \n1933. I was hoping I would have time to read it and let everybody know \nwhat it was and how it happened and how we as legislators in America \ndidn't quite respond to the banking system as fast as we should. \nLegislation didn't keep pace with the changes.\n  So many people are to blame for us getting to where we are. There are \nplenty of people who abused the system. But if we get hung up trying to \nfind out who did something wrong, then we are going to sit here, with \nour fingers pointed, in chairs trying to conduct hearings, asking the \nFBI to do things while the America we know goes down the tube.\n  I believe it is time for clear thinking, for Senators to say: We have \nto take this one on the chin. If it is going to hurt politically, it \nmight as well hurt politically while you are doing the greatest thing \nyou could do for your country, and that is save it--save it from \neconomic turmoil. If that is not the case and you don't believe it, \nthen obviously you can leave as Senators or Representatives. Once the \nCR is passed, you can go home and start your Christmas festivities and \nstart running for reelection. I hope if you do that, when you come \nback, maybe those of us who will stay and work will not let the system \nfall apart for you. But if you want to take that chance, do it.\n  I think my colleagues should be here, not home campaigning. And I \nthink the American people are going to hold you responsible if you \ndon't get this thing solved.\n  I hear some say we will do a little something. No, no, not do a \nlittle something. We have the best people advising us that we have to \ndo this, and there is even a chance if we do this right that we won't \nlose as much money as we will as if we do nothing; that, in fact, we \nmay lose many more billions of dollars if we don't do something to stop \nthe hemorrhage and at the same time loosen up the money.\n  I haven't said ``Wall Street'' very often in this speech, and I \nhaven't used the word ``bailout'' because I don't think we are bailing \nout Wall Street and I don't think it is Wall Street that is the \nbeneficiary of what we are trying to do. Stop and think. Who is \ninvolved in this thing called money lending in the United States, \ncredit in the United States? There are millions of people and thousands \nof institutions that lend money. To whom? To people buying a car, \nbuying a house, buying the Christmas presents for their children, \nimproving the house, buying the lawn mower, buying their third car, and \non and on. Those are the people who are using this credit system.\n  One time off the cuff I didn't know what to speak about before a \ncrowd. I decided to have them guess with me: What is the greatest \nsystem that is working in the United States that is beneficial to you \non an everyday basis? Of course, nobody could guess what I was going to \nsay. I said: the credit system of the United States. And then I \nproceeded to tell them why the credit system was one of the best things \nthat America had going for us--not for Wall Street, for us. And the \ncredit system is at stake. If it doesn't work, nothing works. If your \ncredit system doesn't work, you don't buy houses, you don't buy cars, \nyou don't buy toys. Maybe you buy groceries. But if it is broken, who \nknows what will happen to a country such as ours when we have been so \nused to so much for so long.\n  Having said that, I have a little bit more time and I wish to talk a \nlittle bit about the history. Maybe I will rethink this for a minute \nand put it this way. I believe it is imperative that we pass \nlegislation, and I believe that if the consensus is, after saying we \nwant to give the executive branch what they think they need to solve \nthis problem, if the consensus is that we need to add something to that \nlegislation--add oversight, add something on executive pay, whatever \nthe other things are--let's get on with it. Let's do that. Let's sit \ndown with the leaders from the White House, from the executive branch, \nand say: What do we need in addition to their proposal? And let's talk \nseriously. I don't see why it would take so long. I don't see why we \ncan't do it.\n  Incidentally, I was chairman of the Budget Committee when the \nResolution Trust Corporation was formed in order to curb the savings \nand loan crisis in the early nineties. That effort was also very \ncontroversial. Yet that effort stabilized the markets and eventually \nmade money for the American taxpayers. Of course, it was much more \nlimited in scope. We were talking about the savings and loan \ninstitutions. Some were regulated, some were not regulated, and we were \nin some kind of a real mess. Some had deposit insurance that was \nadequately covered, some didn't. We had to take over their assets and \nthen dole them out. Some people made a good deal and bought them cheap \nand made money. People focused on that and said what a dumb thing we \ndid because some people made money on the buyouts from this Resolution \nTrust Corporation. In the end, when we added it all up, it made more \nmoney than it lost, and it saved the system. In the process, a lot of \npurification occurred, a lot of cleaning out occurred.\n  The same is going to happen here. I am no expert on the difference \nbetween then and now, the Resolution Trust Corporation problem that was \nbeing solved and the problems we are going to solve now, but clearly \nthere are many similarities. We were frightened. When we heard the \nfirst reports about how much we might lose, there were many who \nsupported it who didn't want to go home, they wanted to hide their \nheads under the desks because it was so many billions of dollars. This \none is going to be worse, and if we don't decide to fix it, there are \nnot going to be any desks to hide under, in my opinion.\n  The other problem we have is we haven't told the American people that \nthis affects them. They have been told, because of the way it was \npresented, ``Wall Street,'' ``bailout,'' those famous words--it has \nbeen presented as if it\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\ndoesn't have anything to do with the people on Main Street and in our \nshopping centers across America and those who are selling and buying \nhouses anywhere in America or buying cars from their local dealerships. \nIt applies to all of them.\n  If liquidity, the liquid money flowing, stops for any period of time, \nall of those are affected. And guess who is at the end of each of \nthose. The American people. They are all going to be affected. In fact, \nI am quite sure many thousands of Americans are worried today as to \nwhat they should do with their money, with their savings. We need to \nbuild some confidence back into the system and in them. We need to \nstabilize the system and build confidence in the American people by us \nbeing confident, by speaking out that we intend to do this, and by \ndoing it we are going to save this credit system in the United States \nwhich applies daily to each American in a different way, but is their \ncredit system, the credit system of the people of this country.\n  The history of the banking system in the United States is clearly an \ninteresting one, and I believe rather than give it today, I will \nreserve it--I know I will have another opportunity to speak--and change \nthe tenor of my remarks today from the history of the banking system to \nmy version of the problem, from the top of my head as I think and look \nat a few words, what I think the problem is and what I think our \nresponsibility is.\n  I once again say that before we leave here, we have a responsibility \nto face up to what could be the greatest economic crisis America has \never seen. If it isn't that big, we don't understand it. We are being \ntold by those who know that it is that big, that it could be the \nbiggest economic crisis we have ever had. I tend to believe these two \ngentlemen. I have heard them. I don't know them. I listen to them. I \nhave no idea why they would be telling us this if it were not that they \ntruly believed it was the fact as they gathered the facts from this \nenormous credit system of the United States.\n\n  I repeat, we are fortunate that the two experts are truly expert on \nmatters similar to the ones we are facing. I didn't know about the good \ndoctor who is Chairman of the Federal Reserve until I was preparing for \nthis speech and for these hearings, that not only is he an economist \nbut his expertise is in the Great Depression. No wonder he talks so \nconfidently about what might happen if we do this or that.\n  Who are we going to believe if we don't believe people such as them? \nWho are we going to believe if we don't believe the Secretary? The \nSecretary worked so hard yesterday. I was around him late in the \nafternoon. I thought maybe he ought to go home and rest, he had worked \nso hard. He truly is trying to tell us with two red flags--if he could \nhold five of them--he is trying to tell us there is a big problem and \nwe better start solving it. Don't be worrying too long how big the fire \nis or how big the fire hose has to be. We know how big the problem is. \nIt is either as big as they say, or we have to guess and say we, as \nSenators, with no expertise in this area, no more than that, we are \ngoing to guess. I don't choose to do that. I don't think that is why we \nare here. This is a complicated system. The credit system of the United \nStates is complicated. They have narrowed it down to five or six major \nevents and now the big one that will wrap it up. We better help them or \nwe better be prepared to face the consequences ourselves as individual \nAmerican Senators.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senate for listening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand that at 12 o'clock I am to be \nrecognized for half an hour, but I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed at this time for half an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9363-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9363-S9366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MAIN STREET\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the reason I wanted to take a half hour is \nto discuss at some length and in some depth the situation we are in \nright now, as I see it, relative to the financial markets as they \naffect Main Street because there is a lot of confusion out there and \nthis issue is about Main Street. It is that simple.\n  Why is it about Main Street? It is about Main Street because if our \nfinancial markets become totally destabilized, that leads directly to \nthe ability of people to keep their jobs, to keep their savings, and to \ncreate more economic activity on Main Street.\n  How does this work? It is very simple. If you are working for a small \ncompany or even a medium-sized company and certainly if you are working \nfor a large company, it is very likely those companies borrow money to \ndo things. They may borrow money to buy the materials you work on in \norder to create their product. They may borrow money in order to pay \ntheir suppliers. They may borrow money to pay their payroll every week \nto make your paycheck. That is just the natural order of commerce in \nour Nation. That is the way banks work. That is the way Main Street \nworks.\n  You have a little restaurant, a mom-and-pop restaurant, and they \ndidn't make quite enough this week to pay their payroll, so they go to \ntheir local bank or the community bank and they say: Will you give me a \nloan to get me through this week so I can make payroll?\n  A person who makes a significant or a reasonable amount of money \ntakes their money and puts it in their bank, into a savings account or \nmaybe into a money market instrument because they get more interest on \na money market instrument, and that becomes a big asset in their life.\n  Let's say a person wants to go out and buy a car. Most likely, they \nare going to borrow money to do that, either from their local bank or \nthrough their car dealership or they are going to borrow money from a \nmajor financial entity such as GE or GMAC. The same is true if you are \nbuying a house, obviously, or if you are buying a lot of things. If you \nare adding on to your house, you are probably going to try to get a \nhome equity loan. If you are going to expand or improve your kitchen, \nput on a playroom for your kids or, if the kids are old enough, send \nthem to college, you are probably going to borrow money to pay for \ntheir college education.\n  The ability to borrow, the ability to use credit in our system is at \nthe essence of the economic lifeblood of our system. Every person in \nthis country is affected by it.\n  Unfortunately, what we are confronting and what we almost saw last \nweek is a total seizing up of our financial industry, and not just the \nbig banks in New York we hear so much about--not just Lehman Brothers \nand Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns--but the mom-and-pop bank in your \nlocal town, the medium-sized bank in your local county or your State. \nAll of these were under huge pressure. And why is that? It is because \nunderlying the banking system is the business of trading and exchanging \ncredit, of buying and selling debt between banks.\n  One of the main elements of buying and selling debt is a debt \ninstrument called a mortgage-backed security. Now, what is that? A \nmortgage-backed security is a debt instrument, as if you went to your \nlocal bank and borrowed money, only it is a big set of debt \ninstruments, and the security for those debt instruments is mortgages. \nWhat has happened, because of the real estate meltdown and because of \nthe subprime event and the collapse of the real estate industry, \nprimarily in our bigger States, such as Arizona, California, and \nFlorida, is it has become extremely hard to value the security below \nthat debt instrument--those mortgage-backed securities--because the \nvalue of that asset has reduced so much, the house price has reduced so \nmuch.\n  The reason for that is because a lot of the loans which were made to \nbuy those securities--to the person who is actually paying the loan, \nthe person who lives in the house, theoretically, or the person who \nspeculated and bought the house as part of their investment--were made \nat a time when money was so cheap to borrow that\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\nthey were made at interest rates which were extraordinarily low and are \ntoday being reset, as those notes become due under the terms of them, \nat a much higher interest rate and at an interest rate that the person \nwho lives in that home can't afford to pay. That is called the subprime \nissue. And there are also a lot of variations of that, by the way. So \nthe person who is responsible to pay that note, first, has an asset \nwhich probably isn't worth what the note was issued for because of the \ndrop in the value of the home prices and, second, finds themselves with \na debt they can't afford to pay because the interest rates have jumped \nso much. That translates into thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of \nthousands of situations which merged together in these mortgage-backed \nsecurities which were then sold and then insured and then reinsured and \nreinsured through something called credit default swaps in order to \navoid failure, in order to give coverage, and all of that system has \nessentially frozen up--frozen up--so that those mortgage-backed \nsecurities are no longer tradeable because nobody knows the value of \nthem, and the insurance that was issued on them is at risk, also, \nbecause of the fact that the asset has depreciated and the revenue to \npay the cost of that debt has depreciated.\n  How does this affect the person on Main Street, the person in Epping, \nNH, or Raymond, NH, or Lancaster, NH? The way it affects them and the \nway it affects all Americans is that when that freezes up and the \nbanking system can no longer get value for the debt which it has on its \nbooks and it has to start writing down that value, then the banking \nsystem starts to contract dramatically because the assets which the \nbank was depending on in order to be able to lend against are \ndepreciating radically. As a result, the financial ability to get \ncredit dries up and contracts, and people react to that, and they did \nlast week.\n  This is not a theoretical event, by the way. This type of \ndestabilization is upon us, unfortunately, and what we are trying to do \nis avoid it becoming an epidemic. But last week, in response to the \nfact that people couldn't get money and didn't have confidence in \nlending money or borrowing money, we had $335 billion taken out of \nmoney market accounts and basically moved over to Treasurys.\n  What did that do? It was essentially a run on money market accounts. \nWell, if you have a run on money market accounts, you have a very \nserious problem. Last Wednesday night, we had that problem, because \nwhat happens when there is a run on money market accounts? Well, the \nentities that have those money market accounts have to pay them off, \nwhich means they have to hoard their cash in order to support and \ndefend their money market accounts which are in their banks. So they \ncan't lend any more money; they have to actually start calling in \naccounts. So when somebody comes into their office and says--and this \nis a simplified way of explaining this--OK, I need some commercial \npaper, some financing to get through my next payroll, which is going to \nbe this week, because I didn't make enough money on my business this \nweek--it is maybe a seasonal event or a seasonal slowdown--and they \nsay: I need to get some commercial paper to make my payroll, well, they \ncan't get it because the bank can't lend it to them because the bank is \nholding its money or the finance house is holding its money for the \npurpose of supporting its own capital position or for the purpose of \ndefending itself against the fact that so many of its money markets are \nbeing called in. The practical effect of this is that you create the \npotential for massive destabilization of the economy at a level we have \nnever seen, potentially.\n  Now, some might say that is hyperbole. I don't think it is. Mr. \nGreenspan doesn't think it is. The former Chairman of the Fed said this \nis a 100-year event. Warren Buffett doesn't think it is--a Democrat--\nand I am quoting him because he said this morning that he had never \nseen an event like this in his life with the potential for this type of \ndestabilization.\n  I think anybody who is honest about it recognizes that the last few \nweeks have been extraordinary and the threat to our economy and to the \neveryday life of Americans has been immense--the threat.\n  What has happened to try to address this? Fortunately, we have had a \nvery activist, very bold, and very creative Federal Reserve Chairman \nand Secretary of the Treasury. Leading up to where we are today, we had \nthree major fiscal crises that were addressed aggressively. The first, \nof course, was Bear Stearns, the first financial house to go down. That \nwas aggressively addressed by an infusion of support, not for Bear \nStearns--the stockholders of Bear Stearns lost all their money, as did \ntheir debtholders--but for the underlying financial institutions and \nthe debt structure built around Bear Stearns.\n  The second was Fannie and Freddie. Here, the Federal Government, \nagain, and the Congress, acting in a very responsible bipartisan way, \npassed legislation which allowed us to stabilize those two entities. \nWhy did we need to stabilize those two entities? Because they own $5 \ntrillion of the mortgages in this country. Mr. President, 70 to 80 \npercent of the mortgages in this country are run through those two \ncompanies. Had they been allowed to collapse, had they been allowed to \ntotally implode or to become massively dysfunctional, the entire credit \nmarket would have frozen, the mortgage market would have frozen, and a \nlot of people would have lost their homes. So, again, the Congress, \nacting in an extraordinarily responsible way with the Secretary of the \nTreasury, created the authority to move forward to settle that.\n  Then, the third event was last week, last Tuesday night--AIG, an \ninsurance company. Why, you say, do we need to step in to defend an \ninsurance company? We didn't need to step in to defend the insurance \ncompany. What we needed to do was to defend the insurance which they \nhad issued. Why? Because almost every bank of any small or medium size \nin this country uses insurance issued by AIG to insure much of its \ncapital assets so those capital assets can be used against lending. \nWhether a bank can lend depends on how much they have in capital \nassets. Had AIG gone down, the insurance--the rating agencies would \nhave rated that insurance as nonperforming, for all intents and \npurposes. I am simplifying it, but that is basically what would have \nhappened.\n  That would have meant the banks would have had to contract their \ncapital immediately and that would have meant dramatically less \nlending; good loans being called, people who paid their loans would \nfind their loans no longer existing as the banks had to collect more \ncapital to get their capital requirements up. Many banks might even \nhave failed as a result of that event. It was a systemic problem \nbecause the insurance was so pervasive throughout the system and it so \nsupported the banking and financial houses, to say nothing of the money \nmarket area where it also played a major role.\n  Again, Chairman Bernanke in this situation stepped in to stabilize \nthat insurance. He didn't bail out AIG. Don't say to Mr. Greenberg, who \nwas the primary stockholder in AIG and who lost $5.8 billion in 1 week, \nI think it was, that he was bailed out. No, the stock basically went \ndown to $1, I think, $1 or $1.50. The senior debt was replaced by debt \nowned by the Federal Reserve, which is paying 11 percent and I think \neverybody agrees that in the end that will end up being a financial--\nthe Federal Reserve will make money on it.\n  Now we are at the fourth event of this very tenuous and difficult \nfinancial dislocation that we confront and that is the request by \nChairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson to give Secretary Paulson the \nauthority to basically use up to $700 billion of Federal debt to go in \nand buy debt which is not performing off the books of various lending \nagencies and financial houses so the market can begin to perform. This \ngoes back to those mortgage-backed securities I talked about; to get \nthat freeze which has occurred, that logjam to break up so the markets \ncan function in an orderly way and people can borrow money and people \non Main Street can finance their payrolls, can finance their homes, can \nfinance their house, can finance sending their child to college, and \nthe economy grows rather than contracts. Instead of losing jobs, we \nwill add jobs; instead of losing net worth, we add net worth. That is \nwhat this is about.\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\n  There has been a lot of misrepresentation, exaggeration, and \npolitical statements made around here--especially in the ``talking \nhead'' area of the media. They say, basically, there is a $700 billion \nbailout, we are going to take $700 billion of taxpayers' money and \nthrow it at financial institutions across this country and get the fat \ncats off the hook, so to speak. We need to go back and talk about what \nhappens to the taxpayers in all four of these events.\n  I will represent upfront I do not know exactly what is going to \nhappen. Nobody else does. But I also represent upfront that the cost to \nthe taxpayer will be dramatically less than any of these numbers which \nare being thrown out there in a most irresponsible and inappropriate \nway. When somebody says $700 billion to $1 trillion this is going to \ncost taxpayers, they are being dishonest when they make that statement. \nIt is never going to cost that type of money, never even be close to \nthat type of money. In fact, the taxpayers are going to come out of \nthis making money because we will replace other investors, and when \nthose investors pay off, they will make a little money.\n  Let's go through all four of these items as to how much it is going \nto cost the taxpayers. Bear Stearns, $29 billion. That is what the \nFederal Reserve put into Bear Stearns. That is the Federal Reserve, \nremember. This is not off the Federal budget. It is not from the \nFederal taxpayer. The Federal Reserve is an operating corporation. It \nhas about $895 billion of assets. Every year it makes $25 billion to \n$30 billion, which it pays to the Federal Government as income. \nChairman Bernanke has decided to take $29 billion and invest it in \nvarious bonds that were issued by Bear Stearns, to give those bonds \nstability. It is very likely the Federal Reserve will get all that \nmoney back, or a large percentage of it back. It is totally unlikely \nthe Federal taxpayers will end up with any type of bill from this \nexercise. That is probably a zero cost to Federal taxpayers. The only \nthing that could possibly happen that would affect Federal taxpayers is \nthe Federal Reserve might make less money this year and, thus, pay less \ninto the Government as part of its contribution, when it makes a \nprofit, to our revenues. But even if that occurs, in the outyears, it \nis likely that amount of money will be higher because they will be \ngetting that money or a large percentage of it back. So that doesn't \ncost us anyway.\n  So when someone in the press--not the press, I don't want to pick on \nthe press--when someone says it is a $29 billion taxpayer bailout with \ntaxpayer dollars, it is not. That is plain wrong.\n  The second event I wish to talk about because it is similar--it is \nnot in sequence, but it is significant--is the AIG, $85 billion. In \nthis instance, once again it is the Federal Reserve investment. It is \nnot taxpayers' dollars being invested. The Federal Reserve has taken \n$85 billion and essentially bought AIG. In buying AIG, they got the \nparts as well as the holding company. The holding company is where the \nproblems were. The parts, the subsidiary insurance companies--of which \nI think there were about 150 or 160--were actually quite economically \nstrong and viable. In buying that company, not only did they wipe out \nthe stockholders, not only did they kick out the management, not only \ndid they eliminate the golden parachutes, but they took back securities \nwhich guaranteed an 11.5-percent payment to the Fed before anybody \nelse. So as AIG starts to make money again--which it certainly will \nbecause it and its subsidiaries are a very viable company--the Fed is \ngoing to make 11.5 percent at a minimum. I don't think there is anybody \nwho has looked at this exercise who has not concluded that this is \ngoing to be a financial benefit to the Fed. The Fed is actually going \nto make money off that in the sense that over the long run--when I say \n``long run,'' I am talking about less than 5 years--over 5 years they \nwill have a return on that purchase of AIG which will exceed the $85 \nbillion they put up.\n  So when somebody says that was a bailout with taxpayers' dollars, \nonce again they are totally inaccurate and they are misrepresenting and \ntrying to scare people by saying that.\n\n  Now we come to the two big items. Big items? The other ones are \npretty big; $85 billion would take care of the State of New Hampshire \nfor I don't know how long--probably 20 or 25 years or so.\n  Now we come to the two very large exercises; first, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. In those instances, the Congress, in a bipartisan, \nextraordinarily constructive way, joined with Secretary Paulson and \nsaid to Secretary Paulson: We are going to give you $100 billion of \nauthority for each company, $200 billion total, that you can use to \nstabilize those two institutions. Why so much money? Because we had to \nmake it clear to the people who were dealing with Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac that the Government would be there to stabilize them.\n  By stabilizing them, it would cost us a lot less. If we allowed them \nto unravel, if we allowed them to basically go into a destabilized \nsituation, then the contraction to the economy would have been so \noverwhelming because mortgages would essentially have been called all \nover this country and mortgages would not be able to be obtained by \nvirtually anybody. We would have seen a massive contraction on top of \nthe already serious situation we have in the real estate industry and \nthat would have had a huge impact, not only on Main Street and on John \nand Mary Jones, who want to buy their house or stay in their house, but \non the Federal Government in the way of revenues because taxes would \nhave fallen off precipitously. By stabilizing those two companies, we \nwere able to keep the ordinary business of lending for mortgages in \nthis country going forward and moving in a constructive way. We had to \nput enough money on the table or represent that we were willing to put \nenough money on the table so nobody could question that we were not \ngoing to be able to stabilize those two institutions and that is why \nthe numbers were picked.\n  How much has actually been spent of taxpayer dollars? Five billion \ndollars, that is what the Treasury has had to put in so far. As a \nresult of this putting in that $5 billion, we are seeing mortgage rates \nactually come down because we are actually getting a Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac that are able to function again. So that is all good news. \nI don't know how much more will have to go in, but it certainly will \nnot have to be $200 billion or anything near that number.\n  Furthermore, once again, with that $5 billion, we are buying assets \nthat have value. How much value is still up in the air. But we will get \nsome sort of return on that $5 billion. Thus, under the scoring rules \nthat we work under in our budget, because this is a credit action, this \nis not going to score as a $5 billion hit on the Federal deficit, even \nthough $5 billion has been spent because CBO is going to say some \npercentage of that $5 billion is going to come back to us as these \nassets mature and as people make payments on those assets and, thus, \nmaybe it will only be $1 billion; maybe we will get $4 billion back. So \nthe effect on the Federal deficit will be $1 billion. I don't know how \nCBO is going to score it, but they are going to score $5 billion as \ndramatically less than $5 billion as a hit on the deficit.\n  At the same time, we have been able to stabilize, to some degree, the \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac situation because we took aggressive and \nbold action, which brings us to where we are now.\n  This whole issue of whether we need to move forward with a major \neffort of stabilization and recovery for the financial industry, \ngenerally, by having the Federal Government come in and basically buy \nup a lot of securities which today cannot be traded on the market \nbecause nobody can value them. That is what I was talking about \nearlier. You cannot value these securities because nobody understands \nwhat the underlying equity that supports these securities is, the value \nof that home; and nobody knows whether the people paying on that debt \noriginally are going to be able to make their payments as these \nmortgages reset.\n  The Federal Government is going to come in. What Treasury Secretary \nPaulson has asked is for the Federal Government to have the authority \nto come in and start buying up these securities in classes, in groups, \nacross the board. The question becomes, will he have to spend $700 \nbillion to stabilize the financial markets? And how much will that cost \nthe American taxpayer?\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\n  First off, the easy answer to it is it is not going to cost anywhere \nnear $700 billion, even if he uses the whole $700 billion, which he \nprobably will not do. But even if he were to use the entire $700 \nbillion authority, he would be out buying assets.\n  He would be out buying notes that have security behind them and, \ntherefore, we will be paid, to some degree, as to their value and \ndepending upon what he buys these notes at. Let's say he is not going \nto buy them at face value. Let's say someone borrowed $100,000 secured \nby a house, and nobody knows what the house's value is now, and the \nperson who borrowed the money cannot repay that because the cost of the \nnote, the reset interest rate is too high. That note is not going to \nsell for $100,000, it is going to sell for something less, maybe \n$70,000 maybe $60,000.\n  It is not clear what the Treasury is going to buy that for right now. \nI want to get into that in a second, but whatever they buy it for, they \nwill be getting an asset. And the question will be, is the price they \npaid for that asset above or below what they can, in the end, get for \nthat asset?\n  Now, the big advantage the Federal Government has is we do not have \nto do what is known as mark to market. We do not have to write down \nthese assets the way a bank does or a financial house does as they \nbecome destable, as the assets become destable. We are the Federal \nGovernment. We can hold that asset until it is paid off at face value, \nfor example.\n  So not only do we get the 70 cents back, but we get 100 cents back on \nthe dollar, so we can actually put ourselves in a position where if we \npay a reasonable price for an asset we may make money on the asset. We \ndo not know that that will happen, because the purpose here is not to \nmake money, the purpose is to stabilize the financial markets and give \nthem the ability to start freeing up, trading and freeing up activities \nso that the credit markets start to move back and forth once again.\n  But if we are successful, and we will be if this plan is approved, \nthen the credit markets will start to move once again, and that will \nraise the economy. And as the economy improves, then these mortgages \nthat we will have bought, these mortgage-backed securities, and their \nother things such as loans, will start to improve in their performance, \nand the chances of us getting a good portion or all of the money back \nthat we put into this effort will be pretty high.\n  What is the effect of that? That means that instead of costing $700 \nbillion, we may get $600 billion back, we may get $500 billion back, we \nmay get $800 billion back. Whatever we get back, that is going to be a \nnet figure. So when CBO scores this activity, they are not going to say \nthe deficit is going to increase by $700 billion as a result of us \npassing this proposal, they are going to say it is going to increase by \nthe net difference between the $700 billion and what they estimate we \nwill get back from the assets that we purchase.\n  I suspect that estimate is going to be--I do not know what it is \ngoing to be, but it is certainly not going to be anywhere near $700 \nbillion, $100 billion. It is going to be a shot in the dark because \nnobody knows. But we do know we are going to get some value for this \ninvestment. In fact, if things were to work out, we might get as much \nvalue back as we put in, maybe even more. That is not the expectation, \nthat is not the purpose.\n  But clearly when somebody gets on the public airwaves and says: We \nare putting $700 billion of taxpayers' money into this and we are not \ngetting anything back, we are throwing it at these big companies, they \nare big demagogues, they are big, dishonest, they are heightening the \nproblem rather than addressing the problem. They are certainly not \nfactually accurate as to what is going to happen here. The deficit will \nnot be aggravated by anything near that number.\n  Now, will the Federal debt go up? Yes. But then it comes back down as \nwe get the money back. So that also is not a legitimate argument. If \nyou have got a legitimate complaint, it is this as a conservative: When \nwe make this investment and we start to get this money back, which we \nwill, over the next 5 years, so that money is flowing into the Treasury \nat a pretty big rate, $500 billion, $600 billion, $700 billion, we \nbetter make darn sure that money goes to reduce the debt of the Nation \nand does not get spent around here on various products, which is what \nwe tend to do with money when we see it arriving at our doorstep. That \nis what I am concerned about.\n  I am hopeful that whatever the final agreement is, it will have \nlanguage in it that says as we start to get this debt repaid, the \nFederal Government starts to receive monies as a result of the \ninvestment we have made, those monies will go directly to reduce the \ndebt of the Federal Government, and the debt we are passing on to our \nchildren.\n  But what is the practical effect of doing this, of putting this type \nof commitment up, this type of commitment to stabilization? The \npractical effect is that we stabilize, hopefully, the financial \nmarkets. What is the effect of not doing this? What is the effect of \nnot doing this? We are playing with fire. We are rolling the dice. We \nare confronting potentially one of the most significant economic events \nin the history of this country, and it is not a good event if we do not \ntake action.\n  There are a lot of very thoughtful people around here who know that. \nLast week we almost saw that event occur when there was $335 billion of \nmoney market funds pulled out of the market and we basically saw the \nbanks unable to continue to operate in an orderly way because of that \nuntil the Fed and the Treasury came in to basically stabilize the \nsituation.\n  We do not want to take that gamble as a nation. The cost of not \ntaking that gamble is not that high. It is not $1 trillion, it is not \n$700 billion, as I have run through the scenario. It is virtually no \ndollars in the Bear Stearns-AIG event; it is a marginal number of \ndollars potentially in the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae event; and in the \nbig event, the $700 billion, we do not know what it will be, but we \nknow it is dramatically less than $700 billion because we know we are \ngoing to recover a large amount of those assets, and the net cost of \nthat activity will be well below $700 billion, assuming there is even a \nnet cost over a 5-year or 10-year period as we work out these loans.\n  But the cost to us if we do not do this? Potentially staggering to \neverybody in America. This is not about Wall Street; this is about Main \nStreet. This is about people keeping their jobs; small mom-and-pop \nbusinesses being able to borrow money to operate; people being able to \nsend their kids to college; an economy being able to be a growth \neconomy rather than a contracting economy.\n  That will affect everyone, everyone in America. So I think it is time \nto put an end to the theater and to the politicization and to the \nhyperbole.\n  I congratulate a lot of folks on the other side of the aisle. I \ncongratulate the Senator in the chair, from Pennsylvania. He has been \nresponsible. I have heard Senator Schumer, who is a leader in this \narea, make some extraordinarily constructive ideas. Senator Dodd is \ntrying to be constructive.\n  I think there is a willingness in this body to act at least in a \nbipartisan, constructive way. That is what we need is some mature \naction around here. That is our responsibility as a government. We have \na crisis upon us. There are ways to avoid it. We have a responsibility \nto pursue a course of action which gives us the best chance of avoiding \nthat for the American people.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, Senator Pete Domenici, who is retiring \nfrom the Senate this year after serving since 1972, once said to me \nthat we don't say goodbye in the Senate very well. As a matter of fact, \nwe don't say hello very well either. We have a little orientation \nprogram, but we abruptly arrive and leave. We leave in the midst of a \nlot of turmoil and discussion with very little time to say goodbye. Yet \nin\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\nbetween that arrival and leaving, we have very intense personal \nrelationships. We virtually live with each other. We see each other \noften for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We see each other more than we \nsee our families. So when there is a time for saying goodbye, we look \nfor ways to say it a little better.\n  There are five Members of our body, all of them Republicans, who have \nannounced their retirement for this year. While I won't be speaking at \nlength about them here today, I want to recognize their service. I will \ndo it in the traditional way in the Senate, which is to start with \nseniority. By ``seniority,'' I mean from the time I have known them.\n  I first met John Warner 40 years ago, in 1968. I was a young lawyer, \nand he was head of United Citizens for Nixon. I went to work for him in \nWashington, DC, at the Willard Hotel. He had been an advance man for \nPresident Nixon in 1960. He had been a businessman who was a striking \nfigure, as he still is. I remember one of my assignments was to recruit \na Mississippi chairman, and I found an outstanding young man named Thad \nCochran who became chairman of Citizens for Nixon in Mississippi. Then \nwe went to Indianapolis for the national meeting of our organization, \nand the mayor of Indianapolis was Richard Lugar. John Warner was 17 \nyears old and enlisted in the Navy in World War II. He served as a \nmarine officer in Korea. He was appointed by President Nixon as Under \nSecretary of the Navy in 1969 and became Secretary. He has served in \nthis Senate since 1978 with distinction. He has added civility, a sense \nof institution, and perhaps his greatest continuing contribution has \nbeen his expertise and independence and leadership on matters of \nmilitary affairs which he has discharged in a bipartisan way with \nSenator Levin for many years.\n  Senator Domenici from New Mexico has been here since 1972. That is a \nlong time. He arrived as a young man. He had been a chairman of the \nAlbuquerque City Commission, a math teacher, a baseball player. It was \nunusual for a Republican to be elected to the Senate from New Mexico. \nHe has served with distinction all that time. He was the first \nRepublican chairman of the Budget Committee. He has been a leader in a \nrenaissance of nuclear energy in this country which is so important \nbecause of its low cost and because it is clean. A great many people, \nincluding myself, are concerned about global warming. Well, 70 percent \nof our carbon-free electricity in the United States comes from nuclear \nenergy. Senator Domenici, more than almost anyone, has been behind the \nrevival of interest in nuclear energy. He has truly been one of the \nmost consequential Senators of the last half century.\n  Chuck Hagel of Nebraska is like the rest of us Senators. We are all \naccidents. None of us could have guessed we would be here. It is hard \nto plan your way into the Senate because we come from all different \ndirections.\n  Senator Hagel, who is Nebraska's senior Senator, is retiring after \nonly two terms in the Senate, but he has had a full life so far, \nstarting a business or helping to start one that became a public \ncompany. While we have a great many patriots in the Senate, men who are \nhonored for their service in the military--such as Congressional Medal \nof Honor winner, Senator Inouye; Senator Stevens, who flew the first \nplane to land in Beijing after World War II ended; Senator McCain, \nwhose story is well known, while he never discusses it--Senator Hagel's \nheroism and service serving side by side with his brother in Vietnam is \none of the most fascinating, heroic stories of any Member of the \nSenate.\n  With that sort of independent background, you can imagine he brought \nto this body a sense of independence, a great knowledge of the world. \nAlong with Senator Lugar on this side of the aisle, he understands the \nworld better than almost anyone, and he works hard at it. He has been \nindependent in his views, willing to criticize those he thought were \nwrong, including those in his own party. He has written recently an \nexcellent book about the future of our party. We will miss Senator \nHagel.\n  Senator Larry Craig has been in the Congress for a number of years. \nHe served three terms in the Senate. I believe Senator Craig's great \ncontribution is in the area of energy. He and Senator Domenici have \nbeen a team in advocating for nuclear power. They have been leaders in \nthe Senate in understanding energy and its details, particularly over \nthe last few years as issues of energy and the environment have become \nthe most fascinating and important issues we have to deal with in many \nrespects. Senator Craig has made a great contribution.\n  I especially appreciate his courtesies. When I was just elected to \nthe Senate, I had worked here before as a staff member many years ago, \nbut I didn't understand what it was like to be a Member. Senator Craig \ntook a long hour with me on the telephone just explaining to me about \ncommittee assignments. I have always been grateful for that.\n  Finally, there is Senator Wayne Allard. We have two veterinarians in \nthe Senate. When Wayne Allard goes back to Colorado, we will have one. \nSenator Allard told the people of Colorado if he was elected that he \nwould serve two terms. He has, and he is keeping his pledge. He has \nbeen a strong and vigorous advocate of military preparedness. He is a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee. He has been a member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  One of Senator Allard's great contributions in the last couple of \nyears was to take a job that many others probably wouldn't have wanted \nand plow into it. When the Capitol Visitor Center, which is almost \nopen, was being worked on and running over budget and had some \nproblems, Senator Allard, through his chairmanship of the Legislative \nBranch Appropriations Subcommittee, was able to jump into that and \nprovide a great service.\n  I say to all five of those Senators, we will miss them. We are \ngrateful for their service. I know people must look at the Senate in \nmany different ways.\n  Let me conclude by telling a story about how some teachers look at \nit. We have a tradition in the Senate of making a maiden address. It is \nkind of a funny name, but we still call it that. We pick the subject of \nmost interest to us. My subject was to put the teaching of U.S. history \nand civics back in its proper place in the school curriculum so our \nchildren would grow up learning what it means to be an American. There \nis not too much the Federal Government can do about that, but what we \nwere able to do is to begin summer academies for outstanding teachers \nand students of American history. One group of those teachers was here \nin July, one from each State. I brought them on the Senate floor early \none morning. I took them to Daniel Webster's desk, which is occupied by \nthe senior Senator from New Hampshire right here by me. I took them \nback to that part of the Senate where Jefferson Davis's desk is, \noccupied by the senior Senator from Mississippi, and told them the \nstory of how the marks in the desk are because a Union soldier came in \nduring the Civil War and started chopping on it with his sword. His \ncommanding officer came in and said: Stop that. We are here to protect \nthe Union, not to destroy it.\n  This Chamber is full of history, full of our country. Anyone who \nstands on this floor and sees the engravings of ``In God We Trust'' or \n``E Pluribus Unum'' and gets a sense of what has happened here has \nrespect for it. The teachers had that respect. When we got to the end \nof our visit, one teacher said to me, I think it was the teacher from \nOregon: Senator, what would you like for us to take home to our \nstudents about our visit to the Senate floor?\n  I said: I hope you will take back that each of us takes our position \na lot more seriously than we take ourselves. We understand we are \naccidents, that we are very fortunate and privileged to be here, that \neach of us reveres our country, and we respect this institution. I can \nonly speak for myself, but I think it is true of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle that we get up every day thinking first of how we can make \na little contribution before we go to bed at night that will help the \ncountry be a little better off than it was in the morning. That means \nserving in the Senate is a very great privilege. I hope you will take \nthat back to your students. I don't know what they see on television or \nread in the newspaper about the Senate, but that is how we feel about \nthe privilege we have to serve here.\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\n  To these five Senators--Warner, Domenici, Craig, Hagel, and Allard--\nwe say goodbye. They are members of our family. We appreciate their \nservice. We know they have believed it has been a very great privilege \nto serve in the Senate. For us it has been a great privilege to serve \nwith them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9368-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9368-S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I have said on many different occasions, \none of the heroes in my family as I was growing up was Franklin \nRoosevelt. That is an understatement. One of the things I admired most \nabout President Roosevelt was how he lifted our country out of the \nGreat Depression and did so by speaking directly to the American people \non the radio, telling the American people the truth. All he told us was \nnot good news, explaining plainly what needed to be done.\n  Another President that we all admire, Democrats and Republicans, was \nHarry Truman. We all know that President Truman had on his desk a \nwooden sign that said, ``The buck stops here.'' It did, and it does.\n  Today we face what economists call the greatest economic danger since \nthe Great Depression. We have come to this point after 8 years of \nPresident Bush waging a war on fiscal responsibility. His Republican \nphilosophy of removing all accountability from big business and \nexpecting no responsibility from them in return has created this crisis \nthat now threatens to devastate America's working families. President \nBush put cronies and ideologues in charge of all critical regulatory \nagencies, including the Justice Department, who ensured that special \ninterests would always come before the common good.\n  In one example of particular irresponsibility, the Bush \nadministration refused to exercise its regulatory authority over the \nmortgage industry. The President's neglect allowed massive fraud and \nwidespread predatory lending to pave the way for the largest mortgage \ncrisis in our entire history, a crisis he continued to ignore long \nafter the consequences of the plundering and pillaging of the mortgage \nmarket became clear.\n  Here in the Senate, we never got the support of President Bush when \nwe were trying to do something with housing reform. In fact, just the \nopposite; he was threatening a veto. We had to break seven Republican \nfilibusters on that legislation.\n  History will show that while all this was going on in the White \nHouse, for the last 20 months we Democrats were trying to restore \nfiscal sanity. Here are some examples over the years.\n  We have only been in control of the Senate for the last 20 months. \nPrior to that, in 2000, Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, introduced the Predatory Lending Consumer \nProtection Act to restrict abusive predatory lending. The same year, \nSenator Schumer introduced the Predatory Lending Consumer Protection \nAct. In 2002, Senator Sarbanes reintroduced his bill. In 2004, Senator \nSarbanes and the current chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator \nDodd, called on the Federal Reserve to take action on alternative \nmortgages. Senator Dodd called them a nightmare for low-income \nAmericans. In 2005, the House of Representatives passed bipartisan \nlegislation to reform the regulation of government-sponsored \nenterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It passed the House 331 to 90.\n  The Democratic minority in the Senate tried to pass it. We were \nblocked by the White House and Senate Republicans. When Representative \nOxley, one-time chairman of the Banking Committee and a devout \nRepublican, brought this legislation to the White House, the President, \nin the words of Mike Oxley, gave him ``the cold shoulder and the one-\nfinger salute'' and rejected the bipartisan plan.\n  In February of 2008, Senate Democrats introduced the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act, which was blocked by Senate Republicans after a veto \nthreat from the White House.\n  In June 2008, the White House threatened to veto the Federal Housing \nFinance Regulatory Reform Act, which would have improved oversight of \nFannie and Freddie. The reason for the veto threat? They did not want \nto help communities struggling with foreclosures. If the President had \nsigned this bill in June, we would have saved billions we must now \nspend to bail out Fannie and Freddie.\n  In every one of these instances, Democrats saw the storm clouds \ngathering and attempted to pass legislation that could have steered our \ncourse away from the crisis we now face. But every time, the White \nHouse and congressional Republicans chose to continue along their own \nirresponsible path, which brings us to where we are now.\n  After ignoring Democrats in Congress and good fiscal sense for 8 \nyears, President Bush has sent Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke \nto Congress to pitch his $700 billion bailout. As I have said before, \nSecretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke are good men. I believe they \nboth have the best interests of our country at heart. I certainly hope \nso. But the testimony of yesterday's Banking Committee hearing made it \nclear that Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke have not yet \nsuccessfully made the case for the Bush plan. Democrats and Republicans \nraised serious questions about the plan, and I do not believe anyone--\nDemocrat or Republican--felt those questions were sufficiently \nanswered.\n  At 2 o'clock today, in the House of Representatives, their Banking \nCommittee is going to listen to the Chairman and the Secretary.\n  As our country prepares to face the consequences of George Bush's \nfiscal dereliction of duty, Congress is prepared to act as quickly as \nwe responsibly can. But the Congress, and especially the American \npeople, have a right to know this: Where is President Bush? President \nBush has sent Congress an unprecedented $700 billion bailout proposal--\n$700 billion straight from the pockets of every single man, woman, and \nchild in America. Yet President Bush has been absent from what may well \nbe the most important debate on economic policy in a generation.\n  Isn't it interesting. You look at our experience, the Presiding \nOfficer's and my experience. When there was an issue of such paramount \nimportance, we were always called to the White House. Not this time. \nThe President has not been available. It has not been his issue.\n  Well, it is his issue. We have a right to know--Congress and the \nAmerican people--where is President Bush? He sent Congress this \nunprecedented $700 billion bailout proposal. This money, as I have \nsaid, is straight from the pockets of each one of us, and even our \nchildren and our children's children. Yet President Bush has been \nabsent from what may well be the most important debate on economic \npolicy in the history of our country.\n  I was listening to the radio this morning and Allan Sloan, who is an \neconomic writer, said this issue is as big as he has ever seen or heard \nabout. Well, I do not know if he is right, but I think the President \nshould be available. He has given two brief statements to the press and \na press release admonishing the Congress to accept his bailout plan \nimmediately. Other than that, President Bush has been silent.\n  We must not forget, President Bush is still President of the United \nStates. It is time for him to focus on the issues and tell the American \npeople where he is. It is time for him to explain why 8 years of \nderegulation policies have bought us to this dangerous ground. It is \ntime for him to explain why this administration sat on its hands for \nmonths and only now has come to realize the need for immediate and \nunprecedented Government action.\n  Where was he when it was called for during his first 7\\1/2\\ years? It \nis time for him to explain how he could tell our country for months \nthat our economy was fine, the fundamentals were fine, yet overnight \ndeclare that if American taxpayers do not accept his bailout proposal, \nour country will face economic disaster.\n  And, most importantly, it is time for him to explain how his plan, \ndrafted literally under the cover of darkness, will help America \nweather this storm. This is not the Paulson plan. This is not the \nBernanke plan. This is not the Congress's plan. This is the Bush plan. \nIt is time for him to take ownership and demonstrate leadership. He is \nour\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nPresident, and it is time for him to realize that the buck stops with \nhim, as President Truman said.\n  If President Bush is serious about passing legislation quickly, he \nshould address our country and make his case. Then he should seek to \nwork with Members of both parties to reach a reasonable solution that \nAmerican workers, families, small and large businesses all desperately \nneed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have often described on the floor the \nlyrics of Bob Will's and the Texas Playboys' song from the 1930s:\n\n       The little bee sucks the blossom and the big bee gets the \n     honey; the little guy picks the cotton and the big guy gets \n     the money.\n\n  Never is that more true than what we see today with the prospect of \nunbelievable financial bailouts and the mechanics of what is happening \non Wall Street and the wreckage of the financial system. I wish to show \nmy colleagues this about the bailouts by the administration. Everybody \nis talking about a $700 billion proposed bailout by the Federal Reserve \nand Treasury Secretary Paulson. In fact, the Federal Reserve previously \ncommitted $29 billion so J.P. Morgan could buy Bear Stearns, the \ninvestment bank that was failing. In addition, the Fed opened its \ndiscount window for direct loans to non-regulated banks for the first \ntime since the Great Depression. We understand that this program and \ntwo other Fed loan programs total some $300 billion. There is another \n$300 billion for the Federal Housing Administration, and about $200 \nbillion for Fannie and Freddie; JPMorgan Chase for Lehman financing, \n$87 billion; AIG insurance, $85 billion; $50 billion for money market \nfunds that was offered as a guarantee; and now the prospect of $700 \nbillion is pending. That isn't just $700 billion; that totals $1.7 \ntrillion. Even if the Congress decides not to provide the $700 billion \nbailout that is being requested, there already exists $1 trillion that \nhave been offered to try to stabilize the financial system.\n  Now, the question is, How did we get into this mess? What caused this \nwreckage? What do we think we should do about it? I wish to talk for a \nbit about what caused this. I take no pride in being right 9 years ago \nas one of eight Senators who voted against the Financial Modernization \nAct. That act was a bunch of folks who sold to the Congress the \nproposition that what we put in place for protection in the 1930s, \nduring the Great Depression, to separate banking from more speculative \nenterprises, such as real estate and securities--the decision was that \nthat is old-fashioned, don't keep doing that; let's allow these \ncompanies to merge, to create massive financial holding companies--a \nkind of financial cafeteria under one roof. Let's bring them together, \nand you can build firewalls inside the organization. So the Financial \nModernization Act was passed.\n  I said on the floor of the Senate then that within 10 years I believe \nwe will see massive bailouts that will be paid for by the American \ntaxpayer. I regret that I was right. It should not have happened, \nhowever. I wish to talk about what has happened as a result of taking \ndown the basic protections. Let me go back to the start of two things--\none I mentioned--the Financial Modernization Act, which took apart the \nprotections. Second, a group of people came to this town boasting that \nthey weren't interested in regulating. People were put into positions \nwhere they were supposed to regulate and decided not to regulate. Those \ntwo pieces together, taking apart the protections in law and putting in \nplace people who wanted to be willfully blind in deciding not to \nregulate, steered us right toward the cliff. Here is what began to \nhappen across the country. Most Americans saw this because you could \nnot miss it. You wake in the morning and perhaps you brush your teeth \nor you shave in front of a mirror and you might have a small television \nset that you are watching, seeing what is going on, and the \nadvertisements come on--and they are always louder than the programs. \nThe advertisements say: Hey, if you have been bankrupt or if you have \nbad credit, you can get a loan from us. Do you think you are paying too \nmuch for your home loan? Are your house payments too high? Get a loan \nfrom us.\n  This was the biggest mortgage bank in the country, Countrywide. They \nadvertised this:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us.\n\n  America's biggest mortgage bank was saying: Have you got bad credit? \nCall us. Want a loan? Call us.\n  Millennia Mortgage said this in their advertisements:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payments. That's right, we will \n     give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may \n     reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 percent \n     and allow you no payments for the first 12 months. Call us \n     today.\n\n  So Millennia Mortgage was saying: Get a mortgage from us. We will pay \nthe first 12 months. They didn't say, of course, that that money you \nare not paying is going to go on the back end of the loan, with \ninterest, and will substantially increase the cost of your loan.\n  Zoom Credit, in their advertisement, said this:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit is like money \n     in the bank.\n\n  Again, they say that even if your credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit \nis like money in the bank.\n\n       Zoom credit specializes in credit repair and debt \n     consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who \n     cares?\n\n  That is what they advertise. I don't know who the president of Zoom \nCredit was or who the president of Millennia was. I know who the \npresident of Countrywide was. I know he is out of that company. That \ncompany is now collapsed and sold. He ended up with somewhere north of \n$140 million in unbelievable outer-space compensation. I don't know who \nthese company presidents were, but I assume the brokers and CEOs of \nthese companies were wallowing in money. They were all wallowing in \nmoney like hogs in a corn crib, grunting and snorting, making out like \nbandits--billions of dollars. In fact, in the 9 years that have led up \nto this period, the bonuses on Wall Street were $200 billion. I am not \ntalking about salaries. I am talking about bonuses. In 9 years, it was \n$200 billion. It was $33 billion last year alone. So everybody is \nmaking money. They are advertising to people: got bad credit, bankrupt, \nslow pay, no pay? Doesn't matter. Come to us and get a mortgage.\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n  So they were writing mortgages in the dim light of these rooms, with \nbrokers who are breathless to get their bonuses and mortgage banks \ninterested in putting the mortgages out there. They are advertising we \ncan give you teaser rates. Want to pay a 1 percent rate? We can do \nthat. Two percent? We can do that. Then they would create a mortgage at \na teaser rate, with a reset in 3 years maybe to 9 or 10 percent, which \nis locked in with a prepayment penalty so you cannot prepay it. It is a \nreset that the borrower cannot possibly pay. But they say: Don't worry \nabout that; the housing prices are going up, up, up, and all you have \nto do is get this mortgage from us, and when it resets, it is true that \nyou will not be able to pay it, but you can flip the property in 2 \nyears. That is not a problem. You will make money.\n  So they put these bad mortgages out there--bad mortgages all around--\nand they would combine them with a few good mortgages and put them into \na security and splice and dice them and cut them up, like they used to \npackage sawdust in sausage years ago. Then they would sell them \nupstream, from the mortgage bank to the hedge funds and investment \nbank. They are all fat and happy because they all know the return \nembedded in these securities is a very substantial return. The mortgage \nholder is locked into it because they have prepayment penalties. None \nof them were smart enough, even as they were collecting massive \nincomes, to understand that the people who were going to have to make \nthe payments could not possibly make the mortgage payments once they \nwere reset.\n  So at some point, mortgages began to reset. It is estimated that 2 \nmillion American families will sometime over the next year come home \nand sit around the supper table and discuss the fact that this is their \nlast night in their home because they are losing the home because they \ncannot pay their mortgage. I am not talking about 2,000 or 20,000 or \n200,000 families; I am talking about 2 million American families.\n  It has caused a precipitous drop in property values around the \ncountry. It broke the bubble of the escalating price of housing and \nthen began to collapse it. It has had a profound impact on most \nAmerican families. The most significant form of equity for most \nAmerican families was their home equity. Similar to the tent pole being \npulled out of a big tent, it collapsed. We have people sitting back and \nthumbing their suspenders, wondering how this could have happened. It \ndoesn't take a genius to figure it out. Where were the people who were \nsupposed to regulate in this town when they saw this practice of \nadvertising mortgage conditions that you knew the borrowers could not \nmeet? Where were the regulators? They were sitting by with grins on \ntheir faces because they were engaged in other things; they weren't \nregulating. So now we have this unbelievable financial wreckage.\n  We see major investment firms that have been around since the Civil \nWar going bankrupt. We see runs on some of the funds in the investment \nbanks. On Monday, we saw the most significant drop in the value of the \ndollar in a single day, and the most significant increase in the price \nof a barrel of oil in a single day, even as the stock market dropped \n500-plus points on the same day.\n  So the question is: What do you do about this financial wreckage? How \ndo you put this back together? Even as the Treasury Secretary and the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board are now over before a committee \nof the House today, describing their plan to put this back together. As \nI indicated earlier, their plan is to provide $700 billion to take the \ntoxic mortgage-backed securities off the hands of those who invested in \nthem, which, by the way, then adds up to about $1.7 trillion having \nbeen committed of American taxpayers' money--even as they are doing \nthat, nobody is talking about how you fix the underlying problem. You \ncan pour something in the top, but if you have not put a stopper in the \ndrain, you are going to pour it right out the bottom.\n  Let me describe what I discovered today. I went to the Internet \ntoday. While the Treasury Secretary and Fed Chairman are over \ntestifying about how you deal with the financial wreckage, and how much \nyou ask the American taxpayer to pay for this malfeasance, I found \nthis. I was just curious how many places on the Internet I could still \nfind the same business practices of advertising to come and get a loan \nif you have been bankrupt or if you have bad credit. Well, I found 325 \ncases on the Internet where they would provide you a home loan and \npromise they would not check your credit. Again, they would not check \nyour credit. Isn't that interesting? Talk about bad business practices. \nThere are 325 companies advertising get a loan from us and we will not \ncheck your credit. Most people don't believe it when I say these \nmortgage companies, who put out these toxic mortgages, were advertising \n``no doc'' loans. It doesn't have anything to do with doctors. That \nmeans you can get a mortgage from them for your home without having to \ndocument your income. You are going to ask them to provide the funding \nfor you to buy a home, and they say you don't have to document your \nincome to us in order to get that loan. That is so far afield and \nignorant, in my judgment, of what you would expect in terms of sound \nbusiness practices that it is even hard to describe.\n  Here is what is on the Internet this morning. Easy loan for you. It \nsays that you can get your loan, without collateral, in a couple days. \nEven with bad credit, no credit or bankruptcy, your unsecured loan is \ncompletely guaranteed. Think of that. We have people asking over in a \nHouse committee today to have the American taxpayers provide $700 \nbillion for a bailout. And on the same day, on the Internet, here is a \ncompany that is advertising that they will give you a loan with no \ncollateral. It will take a couple days. Even if you have bad credit, no \ncredit, or bankruptcy, we will guaranteed your unsecured loan. Is \nsomebody going to fix this, I wonder.\n\n  Here is what I found on the Internet this morning. \nSpeedyBadCreditLoans.com. Think of that. Isn't that unbelievable, \nSpeedyBadCreditLoans.com. I guess there is a dot.com for almost \neverything, including speedy bad credit. If you have bad credit, type \nin your characteristics. I have bad credit. Can I get a mortgage? Can I \nget a loan? Bad credit loans. Bad credit, no problem; no credit, no \nproblem; bankruptcy, no problem. Get a guaranteed bad credit personal \nloan today.\n  I am wondering if those we are paying to be regulators in the Federal \nagencies today who are supposed to deal with predatory lending, \ndeceptive practices, I wonder if they are still asleep at their desks \nor are they going to the Internet to find out these kinds of business \npractices exist on the Internet? Probably not.\n  I found this today as well. I could do this all day because it is all \nover the Internet. ``Bad credit personal loans, a Christian faith-based \nservice. Fast results in just 60 seconds.'' There is a modicum of \nresponsibility here. It says you have to reside in the United States. \nThat is really helpful, I guess. Bad credit personal loans. If you have \nbad credit and some Christian faith, if you live in the United States, \nwe have some money for you.\n  This is an example of a cesspool of greed, and we can't possibly \nbegin addressing these issues, the underlying problems on Wall Street, \nthe financial wreckage that has been caused, without addressing this \nsituation. You are going to decide to bail out whatever, you are going \nto put up $1.7 trillion and try to stabilize things when you have this \nsort of thing going on in the country? This is almost unbelievable.\n  On Monday, there was an analysis of what happened in the marketplace. \nWhy was there a precipitous, larger than ever, 1-day drop in the value \nof the dollar? Why was there the largest 1-day runup in the price of \noil, accompanied by a 300-plus point drop in the market? Most of the \nanalysis was people were concerned about the value of the dollar, \nthrowing massive amounts of credit, the substantial amount of money \nthat is being provided to bail out firms to provide undergirding loans \nfor firms. All of this is added to the Federal debt, by the way, which \nitself is about $700 billion in trade debt in this year, about $700 \nbillion in fiscal policy debt in this year. That's almost 10 percent of \nthis country's GDP in 1 year. Analysts take a look at that and say: On \ntop of that unbelievable debt and fiscal policy, you have run off the \nrails in fiscal policy, you are off the\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\nrails in trade policy with unbelievable debt, we will now ante up a \nsubstantial amount of money for Federal bailouts, and analysts say: I \nworry about what that will do to the value of the dollar.\n  The electronic herd that bets on currency, the currency traders, when \nthey go against a currency, they can destroy an economy and devalue the \ndollar, meaning people pull their investments and put it in gold and \nput it in commodities. That is what dramatically can destroy an \neconomy.\n  It may well be true that might be worse. The destruction of the \neconomy might be worse by dramatically eroding the value of the dollar \nand having the currency traders run against this dollar than not doing \nthe $700 billion that Secretary Paulson and Mr. Bernanke suggest.\n  I think it is the case that this Congress has a responsibility to do \nsomething. Doing nothing is not something that makes sense. We cannot \ndecide: You know what, whatever is happening is happening; we are \noblivious to it; we will decide to take the same tack regulators have \ntaken in the last 7 years and sit around and observe and from time to \ntime grin or just decide that we will be completely ambivalent about \nwhat is happening. We cannot do that. We have to take some action.\n  So the question is, What? First and most important for me is we have \nto restore the stability and the safety of the banking system. I think \nthat means we should recreate the protections that existed after the \nGreat Depression. It may not be that we recreate explicitly what Glass-\nSteagall provided, but the protections that it provided must exist \ngoing forward. Otherwise, we will not have done anything by bailing out \nanybody. We will still have the same circumstances existing in our \neconomy, with people advertising on the Internet that we would like to \nput bad paper out, thereby giving mortgages to people with bad credit, \nbankruptcy, or other slow-pay problems in their credit history.\n  It makes no sense to me to ignore what happens when you merge or \ncombine the functions of banking with the functions of investment in \nreal estate and securities. Banking requires not just the reality of \nsafety and soundness but the very perception of safety and soundness. \nIf people perceive a bank is not safe and sound, they will run on the \nbank and the bank will fail, inevitably, regardless of how much capital \nit has. It will not have enough capital to withstand a run on the bank. \nThat is why just the perception of the safety and soundness of banking \nenterprises is imperative. We went far afield in deciding that we will \nallow the fusing of inherently risky enterprises, investments and \nsecurities and real estate, to banking.\n  I know that some point to as a success allowing, for example, Bank of \nAmerica to come in and purchase one of the failing investment banks. I \ndon't view that as a success. At the moment, it was able to forestall a \nfailure. But now we have attached a large banking enterprise, whose \nperception of safety and soundness is critically important, to an \ninvestment bank that was failing. I don't see that as success. I think \nit is moving in exactly the wrong direction.\n  I want us to find a menu of ways to provide confidence to the \nAmerican people that we are moving in the right direction. That \nrequires a lot of things. No. 1, straighten out this wildly escalating \ntrade deficit. We cannot have a $60 billion-a-month trade deficit. That \nis what destroys your currency value. We have to get real on fiscal \npolicy. We cannot continue to spend what we don't have on things we \ndon't need. We have to find a way to create a fiscal policy that has \nsome stability and balance to it. We have to address these business \npractices with effective regulation. We have to recreate the \nprotections that existed for the banking system.\n  We have to address the wildly excessive and speculative incomes and \nsalaries on Wall Street which I think incentivized reckless behavior. \nAs I indicated, in the last 3 years on Wall Street, just the bonuses--I \nam not talking about salaries--just the bonuses were $100 billion. Many \nof them went to the very people who steered us into this corral. In the \nold western movies, they used to call this a box canyon: there is only \none way in and one way out. The same people who got us there made a \nmassive amount of money putting us where we now are.\n  As I said, we need a system of regulation that gives us some \naccountability that laws are going to be followed, that we are going to \nregulate the deceptive practices, predator lending, and so on.\n  Then I think, as well, we need to have some period of forbearance on \nmortgages where people who can continue to make payments even under the \noriginal interest rate can make those payments for a period of time and \ncontinue to stay in those homes. That is the only way we will begin to \nput some strength under the value of homes. Otherwise, we will continue \nto see a collapsing of home values. As I said, 2 million families will \nlose their homes this year unless we find a way to take some action.\n  Finally, we should create a taxpayer protection task force. No matter \nwhat else we do, we need to investigate and claw back ill-gotten gains \nin which people have gotten away with billions of dollars by shady \nbusiness practices.\n  Whatever this Congress decides to do or must do, the American \ntaxpayer ought to have a share in the increased values of the \ninvestments that are made in their name.\n  There is one point that unites everybody in this Chamber, perhaps in \nthis Congress, perhaps in the entire country. I don't think anybody \nknows what the right answer is. We certainly can take a look at this \nsituation and understand now what caused much of this, but I don't know \nthat anybody has a magic bullet that says you do this and we \nimmediately provide stability, we move this country toward higher \nground, we have stopped some of the volatility. I don't know that \nanybody knows that. But I think the American taxpayers are plenty \nworried about what I think is a stampede in the wrong direction.\n  On Friday, we were told by the same people who have reassured us in \nrecent months that things are OK, things are stable, don't worry. We \nwere then told by the very same people that in the next several days, \nthe American taxpayers need to ante up a $700 billion bailout plan, \nfollowing a substantial amount of money that has already been provided \nby the American taxpayers to bail out and to provide support for \ninvestment banks that were failing. And we are told: Here is a 3- page \npiece of legislation, one provision of which is that one person will \ndecide where the $700 billion goes, and that person's decision will not \nbe reviewable by the courts or by the Congress. In my judgment, that is \na nonstarter. Congress is not going to do that, should not do that.\n  The question is, What do we do in the coming couple of days to \nprovide some assurance and stability? I think it makes some sense to go \nback to the fundamentals, and the fundamentals are, you start fixing \nthat which caused this problem. You connect the protections that used \nto exist. If you start fixing, at the foundation, some of the issues \nthat caused this problem, you will begin to engineer some confidence in \nthis country.\n  Finally, I used to teach some economics briefly in college. I talked \na lot about the supply-and-demand curves, and all of the things we know \nare in the books that describe the way the economy works. But no one \nreally knows much about how the economy works. We all think we do. \nEconomics is a little bit of psychology pumped up with helium. It is a \nlot of discussion about what we think might or might not happen.\n  The most important thing to understand about this economy is the \nAmerican economy expands when people are confident about the future. If \npeople think the future is going to be better for them and their \nfamily--they have a job, feel good, feel secure--they do things that \nmanifest that security. They buy a home, buy a car, take a trip. They \ndo things that manifest people's confidence in the future, and that \ncreates economic expansion. If, on the other hand, people are not \nconfident about the future and concerned about the future, concerned \nabout their job, concerned about job security, then they do exactly the \nopposite. They decide not to buy that car. They decide not to take that \ntrip. They defer the purchase they were going to make. And then we have \neconomic contraction.\n  This is not about an engine room of a ship of state with a lot of \nlevers and\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\ngears and dials and gauges that you can get just right to make this \neconomy work. This is a lot about consumer confidence, how do you \nprovide confidence in the future. That is how we begin to expand this \neconomy.\n  How can people have confidence in the future when they see these \nunbelievable wild gyrations that are occurring on Wall Street? How can \nthey have confidence in the future when they know what the root of it \nis? People have been advertising to them that if you are bankrupt, if \nyou have slow credit or no credit, come here, we will give you a loan. \nHow can that engender confidence? And how can people have confidence in \nan economy where we have a President who says: You know what, we are \ngoing to go fight a war and not pay for it; I insist we not pay a \npenny; I insist that while we fight this war, we are going to charge \nevery single cent, and if you in Congress want to pay for it, I will \nveto the bill that raises the funds. Is that going to give people \nconfidence? I don't think so.\n\n  People have a right to be concerned about an economy that is deep in \ndebt and getting deeper every day and a trade policy that ships our \njobs overseas and ends up with a $700 billion trade deficit every year \nthat will have to be repaid with a lower standard of living in our \ncountry. People have a right to be concerned about that.\n  If you go back to the fundamentals and start putting some of this \nback together--a fiscal policy that makes sense, a trade policy that \nstands up for this country's economic interests, and firing the \nregulators who won't regulate, and put in place new regulations and new \nregulators who will do the job they are paid to do, and then restore \nthe laws that provided protection so we don't fuse risk with banking--\nif you start doing those kinds of things and telling the American \npeople we are going to bring back some of those ill-gotten gains, and \nwe are going to stop these outer space incomes of hundreds of millions \nof dollars a year. In fact, the highest income earner last year was \n$3.6 billion. That is a $300-million-a-month paycheck. Does that seem a \nlittle out of line to you? It does to me.\n  I have covered a lot of ground, and my sense is that we have work to \ndo to give the American people the comfort and the assurance that we \nare dealing with the fundamentals that will put this country back on \nbetter footing. We won't do that by deciding to write a check and \noffering up a bunch of money. It won't happen. I mean, that is not what \nis going to provide confidence to the American people. What will \nprovide confidence is effective leadership, leadership that says here \nare the six or eight things that are wrong, we know they are wrong, we \nhave known for some while, and now we are going to make them right. If \nwe can we can work on those issues together, I think the American \npeople finally will decide there is some leadership that will give us \nthe opportunity for a better future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1343, and \nthat the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1343) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to provide additional authorizations of appropriations for \n     the health centers program under section 330 of such Act, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate will proceed to consider the \nbill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be before this body and \ncongratulate my colleagues on the work they have done to facilitate \npassage of the Health Care Safety Net Act. I sincerely appreciate the \nwork of Senators Kennedy and Hatch on this important issue; their \nleadership has led us to this point. I look forward to sending the bill \nto the President and seeing it signed into law.\n  Community health centers are a critical piece of the health care \nsafety net and a vital piece of our health care system. The Community \nHealth Center program has a long history of helping people get the care \nthey need when illness or an emergency presents itself. Congress \nenacted the health centers program in the 1960s. Since that time, \nhealth centers have been regularly providing high quality health care \nto people living in rural and underserved areas, regardless of their \nability to pay. The number of health centers continues to rise, and \nmore people are getting the kind of high quality health care they have \ncome to rely on every day.\n  A newly added provision in this bill requests the Comptroller General \nconduct a study on the implications of expanding the Federal Tort \nClaims Act to cover volunteer health care providers serving at \ncommunity health centers. I am very supportive of encouraging health \ncare providers to volunteer time serving underserved populations \nespecially at community health centers, and I am interested to see the \nresults of the study. I also have a separate piece of legislation, not \nincluded in this bill, that takes a slightly different approach at \nsolving this problem. The Volunteer Health Care Program Act of 2008 \nprovides grants to States that contract with providers who provide \ncharity care as an agent of the State and the State assumes the \nliability risk. I hope Members will consider this approach next \nCongress as we look to address the problems volunteers face.\n  This bill also reauthorizes the National Health Service Corps, the \nCorps, program for 5 years. The Corps assists health professional \nshortage areas in all parts of the United States to meet their primary \ncare, oral, and mental health services needs. The bill clarifies that \nall federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics shall \nbe automatically designated as having a health professional shortage. \nIn my home State of Wyoming, we have a shortage of every type of \nprovider, so I am glad this committee is reauthorizing this important \nprogram.\n  The bill also reauthorizes for 5 years the Rural Health Care Services \nOutreach program, which increases access to primary health care \nservices for rural Americans. Most of Wyoming is not classified as \nrural; most of Wyoming is classified as frontier because we have such a \ngeographically large state with so few residents. I am pleased these \nprograms were reauthorized.\n  Additionally, I appreciate all the help of my friend Senator Collins, \nwho championed the provisions reauthorizing the primary dental health \nworkforce programs. This program awards grants to States that develop \nand implement innovative programs to address dental health workforce \nshortages. Many States are doing great things with these funds, and I \nplan to encourage my home State of Wyoming to apply for one of these \ngrants. Improving dental health is a critical part of keeping folks \nhealthy and preventing disease and I commend the work of my friend from \nMaine.\n  A new section of the bill promotes greater coordination of primary \ncare providers during emergency situations. I am pleased to say Wyoming \nis leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the country with regard to \nthis provision. During Hurricane Katrina, other States sent volunteer \nproviders to Louisiana, but their medical liability protections did not \nfollow them. Wyoming enrolled providers in the Volunteer Medical \nReserve Corp Program, which allowed the Wyoming volunteers to have \nmedical liability protections that followed them to Louisiana. I \napplaud the health care providers in Wyoming who did the right thing by \nvolunteering and the State efforts that ensured that their liability \nprotections followed them to Louisiana. I hope other States will follow \nin Wyoming's footsteps and enroll volunteers in the Volunteer Medical \nReserve Cops.\n  I also appreciate the leadership of Senators Smith, Barrasso, \nRoberts, Grassley and the other members who championed revising the \ntimeframe for recognition of certain designations in certifying rural \nhealth clinics under the Medicare Program. Because the\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nMedicare Program falls under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, \nwe worked closely with the Finance Committee members and enlisted their \nsupport and expertise in designing this provision. I am pleased we \ncould include this provision that will help rural health clinics \ncontinue to provide quality care to their patients.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention this Community Health \nCenter bill is actually a part of step 9 of my 10-step plan to \ntransform health care in America. Passing this bill puts us one step \ncloser to fixing our health care system. I look forward to passing more \nof the 10 steps next Congress.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the lead Republican sponsor of the \nHealth Care Safety Net Act with the chairman of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions, HELP, Committee, Senator Kennedy, I am \nso pleased that the Senate approved this legislation earlier today. \nMembers of the Senate HELP Committee, on both sides of the aisle, \nworked hard to ensure its passage, and I want to thank, in particular, \nSenator Ted Kennedy, Senator Mike Enzi, Senator Judd Gregg, Senator \nLamar Alexander, Senator Richard Burr, and Senator Coburn for their \ncommitment in getting this legislation through the Senate.\n   I also want to thank my House colleagues, especially, House Energy \nand Commerce Committee chairman John Dingell and its ranking Republican \nmember Joe Barton for the leadership on this bill. Additionally, the \nHealth Subcommittee chairman Frank Pallone and its ranking member \nNathan Deal, along with Congresswoman Diana DeGette and Congressmen \nGene Green and Bart Stupak, were extremely helpful during our \nnegotiations on this bill. And while, at times, it was not easy, I \nappreciate their willingness to work with the Senate on compromise \nlegislation that will improve the lives of millions of uninsured and \nunderinsured Americans.\n  This bill is expected to be considered by the House of \nRepresentatives tomorrow, and once it has been approved by the House, \nit will be sent to the President to be signed into law.\n  The health centers program was created over 40 years ago and has been \nproviding health care to those without health coverage and those who \nare underinsured. These centers provide care to children, their \nparents, and their grandparents and are an important part of our \ncountry's health care safety net.\n  Community centers have made a tremendous difference for Utahns with \ninsufficient health coverage. In fact, Utah community health centers \nprovide care to close to 85,000 patients. They have not only filled in \nhealth coverage gaps, but they have also done an excellent job \nproviding care to those with little or no coverage.\n  Utah health centers have made a tremendous difference in the lives of \nmany Utahns--66 percent of patients come from Utah's urban areas and 27 \npercent are from the rural parts of the State. Ninety-six percent of \nUtah's health center patients, incomes are below 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. Utah health centers have literally changed their \nlives--in rural areas, health centers are often the only health care \nprovider.\n  Our bill will reauthorize the health center program for 5 more years \nand includes funding levels of $2,065,000,000 in fiscal year 2008; \n$2,213,000,000 in fiscal year 2009; $2,602,000,000 in fiscal year 2010; \n$2,940,000,000 in fiscal year 2011; and $3,337,000,000 in fiscal year \n2012.\n  H.R. 1343 also contains other important provisions relating to \ncommunity health centers including a health care quality study \nconducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, on \nefforts to expand and accelerate quality improvement activities in \ncommunity health centers.\n  In addition, our bill requires the Government Accountibility Office, \nGAO, to conduct three studies. The first study would review integrated \nhealth systems as a model to expand access to primary and preventive \nservices for medically underserved populations and improve care \ncoordination and health care outcomes. The second GAO study would \nevaluate the economic costs and benefits of school-based health centers \nand their impact on the health of students. The final study would make \nrecommendations on policy options that would encourage health care \npractitioners to work as volunteers in health centers.\n  The Health Care Safety Net Act allows the Secretary of HHS to \nrecognize the unique needs of high poverty areas in awarding grants, \nsomething that was important to members representing these parts of the \ncountry.\n  The legislation reauthorizes the National Health Service Corps, NHSC, \nat $55 million over 5 years and also makes permanent the automatic \nhealth professions shortage area designation that community health \ncenters currently have, allowing them to cut down on the cumbersome \npaperwork that can delay NHSC placements. The bill requires the NHSC to \nassist the Corps members in professional development opportunites.\n  H.R. 1343 also reauthorizes the State Loan Repayment Program through \n2012 and makes the District of Columbia and the territories eligible \nfor this program, which is part of the overall strategy to improve \naccess to health care in underserved communities.\n  Our bill reauthorizes the Primary Dental Workforce and Rural \nHealthcare Programs, which increases access to dental care in \nunderserved areas by providing matching funds for States to use in \ntraining, recruiting, and placing dentists. In addition, the bill \nreauthorizes the rural health care programs at $45 million per year \nthrough 2012. I would like to thank Senator Susan Collins for working \nwith us on this important provision.\n  The legislation improves access to primary care during public health \nemergencies by improving coordination between health centers, State and \nlocal emergency planners, and existing Federal programs for medical \nvolunteers.\n  Finally, the bill prevents rural health clinics, RHC, from losing \nMedicare certification by including a technical fix that aligns Health \nResources and Services Administration, HRSA, and the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, standards so that all RHC shortage \narea designations are reviewed every 4 years. This provision was \nextremely important to members of the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus, \nand I would like to thank Senators Pat Roberts, Tom Harkin, Gordon \nSmith, Ron Wyden, Kent Conrad,  and John Barrasso for bringing this \nimportant matter to our attention. I also want to thank Finance \nCommittee chairman Max Baucus and its ranking member Chuck Grassley for \ntheir willingness to include this provision in this bill.\n  Community health centers have made a huge impact in people's lives. I \nam pleased and proud that our legislation has been approved by the \nSenate, and I urge my House colleagues to approve this important bill \nas quickly as possible. This legislation will not only allow health \ncenters to continue providing people with essential health care \nservices but also will ensure that the health centers will have the \nfunding necessary to provide these important services.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a substitute \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; and any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5642) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 1343), as amended, was read the third time, and \npassed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9373-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9373-S9378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 334, THE HEALTHY AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\nintroducing or cosponsoring the Healthy Americans Act, S. 334, \nlegislation which is directed to cover the some 47 million Americans \nwho are not covered by health insurance. It is a bipartisan bill which \nhas 16 cosponsors, half Republicans and half Democrats. It has been \nsponsored principally by Senator Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator \nBennett, Republican of Utah. I believe it provides the basis for moving \nahead on this very important subject.\n  We have long struggled to cover all Americans with health insurance. \nIn a detailed statement, which I am about to submit, I have recounted \nthe efforts which this Senator has made over the course of my tenure in \nthe Senate; beyond the bill's own coverage, the work which has been \ndone on the Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services \nSubcommittee; and legislation in which Senator Harkin and I, on a \nbipartisan basis, have taken the lead in increasing funding for the NIH \nfrom $12 to $30 billion.\n  This proposal, S. 334, has a number of issues which I think need \nfurther analysis and further study and modification, as noted in the \ntext of the statement. But I believe it is an excellent starting point \nand, having some 16 cosponsors, the most I have seen on a bipartisan \npiece of legislation to address this very important subject, I think it \nhas an excellent opportunity in the next Congress to provide the basis \nfor moving ahead for the appropriate coverage of all Americans.\n  We are facing a grave situation in America where millions of \nAmericans do not have health insurance coverage. As the cost of health \ncare is increasingly prohibitive and access to insurance is reduced, \nthe number of uninsured will continue to climb.\n  It is estimated that nearly 47 million Americans are without health \ninsurance. This includes the nearly 38 million individuals who have \nfull or part time employment and still are without health care \ncoverage. Of significant concern is the number of young adults lacking \ninsurance: with an estimated 28 percent of those young people without \ninsurance.\n  Individuals without insurance suffer from both acute and far reaching \nconsequences. It ultimately compromises a person's health because he or \nshe is less likely to receive preventive care, more likely to be \nhospitalized for avoidable health problems, and more likely to be \ndiagnosed in the late stages of diseases. Additionally, lack of \ninsurance coverage leaves individuals and their families financially \nvulnerable to higher out-of-pocket costs for their medical bills.\n  It is my belief that we can and should fix the problems felt by \nuninsured Americans with a system that does not resort to a single \npayer system and one that involves the private insurance industry. We \nmust enact reforms that enhance our current market-based health care \nsystem.\n  The legislation I want to discuss today is S. 334, The Healthy \nAmericans Act, which would provide access to health insurance for all \nAmericans. Senator Wyden introduced this legislation on January 18, \n2007, and since then, it has gained support from an impressive group of \nbipartisan Senators, including Bennett, Alexander, Nelson from Florida, \nGregg, Coleman, Grassley, Landrieu, Stabenow, Crapo, Lieberman, Carper, \nInouye, Corker, Smith and Cantwell. Today I am pleased to add my name \nto the list of cosponsors of S.334.\n  The Healthy Americans Act uses the private health insurance market to \nensure that all Americans have access to a quality plan they can \nafford. This legislation has a number of components that will address \nthe problems that plague our current health insurance system.\n  To begin, S. 334 provides so-called ``portability,'' which allows \nindividuals to retain their health insurance regardless of the job they \nhold. In today's changing society, many Americans no longer stay with \nthe same employer for long periods of time. Moving from job to job may \nmean the loss of health insurance, a new insurance carrier, or a gap in \nhealth care. The Healthy Americans Act seeks to provide consistent \ninsurance coverage in a fluid job market.\n  Additionally, the Healthy Americans Act offers assistance for those \nwho need it most by providing premium assistance for individuals and \nfamilies with incomes below 400 percent of the poverty level--or \n$41,600 and $84,800 respectively. This provision aids those individuals \nthat are employed but their income is insufficient to afford insurance. \nThe assistance is based on a sliding scale with those with lower \nincomes receiving the greatest help. Individuals below 100 percent of \nthe poverty level--$10,400 for an individual or $21,200 for a family--\nreceive full assistance with their insurance premiums.\n  While I am cosponsoring this legislation, I have some concerns that \nneed to be addressed as the debate on this important issue moves \nforward. For instance, the potential new tax obligations associated \nwith the Healthy Americans Act on both individuals and on businesses \nwarrant further consideration. Concerns have been raised that this bill \nis not tax-neutral, meaning that new tax obligations created by this \nlegislation are not completely matched by new or increased tax \nbenefits. This resulting imbalance, or lack of tax neutrality, is \nargued by some to be a tax increase. Specifically, individuals would be \nrequired to pay their insurance premiums through the Federal tax \nwithholding system, as opposed to the current model where premiums are \npaid to insurers through their employer. Payments would pass through \nthe IRS on the way to newly created regional purchasing organizations \ncalled health help agencies--HHAs--and ultimately to the private \ninsurer. The payment system, or collection, is technically a tax \nbecause it is being collected by the IRS. However, it is important to \nnote that the Government will not keep those dollars and will not have \ndiscretion over how they are spent. Nevertheless, this payment system \ndeserves further analysis on the issue of tax-neutrality.\n  S. 334 would require all businesses to pay an assessment of between 2 \npercent and 25 percent of average per worker premiums. The rate paid \ndepends on the number of people it employs. I have concerns that this \nprovision is structured as a tax. However, it is important to note that \nbusinesses would see some benefits as a result of the bill. They would \nbe freed from the administrative burden of providing health care for \nemployees because the individual would carry the responsibility of \nobtaining a private plan.\n  Because employers would be required to pay increased wages--in lieu \nof providing a health plan, they would also be subject to additional \npayroll tax obligations--i.e. Social Security and Medicare. An \nemployee's increased payroll tax obligation is offset by a tax \ndeduction provided in the bill. There is no corresponding deduction for \nthe employer to offset their additional payroll tax obligations, and \none should also be considered, because the bill's purpose is not to \nincrease payments to Social Security and Medicare. The sponsor's \nintention of maintaining a budget-neutral bill is also worth \nconsideration.\n  The mandate of paying increased wages only lasts for 2 years under \nthe bill, after which time market forces would determine total \ncompensation. Consideration should be given to retaining the employer \npayroll increase indefinitely to defray the cost of health insurance. \nMarket forces may not sufficiently compensate employees when an \nemployer decides to cut wages beyond the 2-year time frame. This would \nharm an employee's ability to purchase health insurance.\n  I am also concerned with the elimination of specific tax benefits for \ncorporations that do business abroad, though it is my understanding \nthat the sponsors are not wedded to elimination of these specific \nitems. The argument has been made by proponents that the Wyden bill \nmakes U.S. firms more competitive internationally because it removes \nthe burden on employers to administer health care plans for their \nemployees. Often foreign firms do not have that burden. To that end, \nthe sponsor has chosen to eliminate certain tax preferences to \nmultinational corporations as a way to raise revenue. I believe that \ngreater consideration should be given to whether the benefit to \nemployers of not having to administer a health care plan outweighs the \nelimination of these provisions.\n  First, the elimination of the section 199 manufacturing deduction \nraises concerns for our exporters. The section 199 deduction allows \nmanufacturing\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\nfirms of all kinds to take a tax deduction for their U.S.-based \nbusiness activities. The deduction was 3 percent in tax years 2005 and \n2006, 6 percent in tax year 2007, and is scheduled to be 9 percent by \n2010. This tax benefit was enacted as part of the so-called FSC/ETI \nlegislation in 2004 to replace an export tax incentive that was ruled \nto be in violation of our international trade commitments. At the same \ntime, it sought to boost the ability of manufacturers to compete in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  Second, the bill would eliminate deferral of income from foreign \ncorporations that are owned by a U.S. parent company. Under current \nlaw, U.S. taxes do not apply to the foreign income of U.S.-owned \ncorporations chartered abroad. As a result, a U.S. firm can \nindefinitely defer U.S. tax on its foreign income as long as the \nforeign subsidiary's income is reinvested overseas. U.S. taxes apply \nwhen the income is repatriated back to the U.S. Ending this deferral \nstrategy could have the negative impact of encouraging the U.S. parent \nfirm to relocate abroad or to limit the size of their operations in the \nU.S.\n  S. 334 also requires all Americans to obtain health insurance. \nEligible insurance plans include not only those purchased through this \nprogram, but health care coverage through Medicare, the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Service, or \na retiree health plan. I am concerned that this mandate will put a \nburden on individuals and families that may not be able to afford the \nprogram despite assistance.\n\n  This concern is shared by fellow cosponsor Senator Chuck Grassley who \nstated that:\n\n     . . . the act would require all individuals to buy health \n     insurance. I support accessibility to private insurance and \n     differ with my colleagues on this point.\n\n  This is an issue that must be more closely examined.\n  This bill also holds the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Plan \nprovided under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program as the \nstandard for the program. While I believe that everyone should have \naccess to this level of coverage, it does not allow for variety in the \ntypes of insurance plans that would be available under the program. The \ncurrent market allows for different types of plans, which should be \navailable under the Healthy Americans plan. When Senator Norm Coleman \nsigned on as a cosponsor of S. 334, he similarly noted:\n\n       While I certainly believe people should have access to this \n     level of coverage, I don't think it should be the only \n     option. My vision of health reform does not include this one-\n     size-fits-all approach. Instead, I support giving people \n     access to a variety of health insurance options and the \n     ability to make informed choices.\n\n  The vetting of this bill is already underway. Senators Wyden, \nBennett, Grassley, and Stabenow have taken steps to provide flexibility \nin the program by allowing businesses and employees to choose the best \nhealth insurance program for employees. An amendment has been filed to \nallow businesses to continue to offer health insurance to employees \nunder the current system, yet employees would still have the option to \nenter the Health Help Agency and obtain a health americans private \ninsurance plan.\n  While these concerns are important and should be addressed, this \nbipartisan effort makes an important step forward in the ongoing quest \nto provide health insurance to all Americans. I believe the Healthy \nAmericans Act contains excellent ideas and should be the basis for \nfuture discussions on health insurance reform. This sentiment is shared \nby Senator Judd Gregg, who when he joined this bill, stated:\n\n       that by joining forces with colleagues on both sides of the \n     aisle on a private market approach, we can begin a bipartisan \n     dialogue, work through our differences, and find workable \n     solutions that will result in a better health care system for \n     all.\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to provide a health \ninsurance system that can provide quality healthcare to all Americans.\n  I have advocated health care reform in one form or another throughout \nmy 28 years in the Senate. My strong interest in health care dates back \nto my first term, when I sponsored S. 811, the Health Care for \nDisplaced Workers Act of 1983, and S. 2051, the Health Care Cost \nContainment Act of 1983, which would have granted a limited antitrust \nexemption to health insurers, permitting them to engage in certain \njoint activities such as acquiring or processing information and \ncollecting and distributing insurance claims for health care services \naimed at curtailing then-escalating health care costs. In 1985, I \nintroduced the Community-based Disease Prevention and Health Promotion \nProjects Act of 1985, S. 1873, directed at reducing the human tragedy \nof low birth weight babies and infant mortality. Since 1983, I have \nintroduced and cosponsored numerous other bills concerning health care \nin our country.\n  During the 102nd Congress, I pressed the Senate to take action on the \nhealth care market issue. On July 29, 1992, I offered an amendment to \nlegislation then pending on the Senate floor, which included a change \nfrom 25 percent to 100 percent deductibility for health insurance \npurchased by self-employed individuals, and small business insurance \nmarket reforms to make health coverage more affordable for small \nbusinesses. Included in this amendment were provisions from a bill \nintroduced by the late Senator John Chafee, legislation which I \ncosponsored and which was previously proposed by Senators Bentsen and \nDurenberger. When then-majority leader Mitchell argued that the health \ncare amendment I was proposing did not belong on that bill, I offered \nto withdraw the amendment if he would set a date certain to take up \nhealth care, similar to an arrangement made on product liability \nlegislation, which had been placed on the calendar for September 8, \n1992. The majority leader rejected that suggestion, and the Senate did \nnot consider comprehensive health care legislation during the balance \nof the 102nd Congress. My July 29, 1992, amendment was defeated on a \nprocedural motion by a vote of 35 to 60, along party lines.\n  The substance of that amendment, however, was adopted later by the \nSenate on September 23, 1992, when it was included in a Bentsen/\nDurenberger amendment which I cosponsored to broaden tax legislation, \nH.R. 11. This amendment, which included essentially the same self-\nemployed tax deductibility and small group reforms I had proposed on \nJuly 29 of that year, passed the Senate by voice vote. Unfortunately, \nthese provisions were later dropped from H.R. 11 in the House-Senate \nconference.\n  On August 12, 1992, I introduced legislation entitled the Health Care \nAffordability and Quality Improvement Act of 1992, S. 3176, that would \nhave enhanced informed individual choice regarding health care services \nby providing certain information to health care recipients, would have \nlowered the cost of health care through use of the most appropriate \nprovider, and would have improved the quality of health care.\n  On January 21, 1993, the first day of the 103rd Congress, I \nintroduced the Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1993, S. 18. This \nlegislation consisted of reforms that our health care system could have \nadopted immediately. These initiatives would have both improved access \nand affordability of insurance coverage and would have implemented \nsystemic changes to lower the escalating cost of care in this country.\n  On March 23, 1993, I introduced the Comprehensive Access and \nAffordability Health Care Act of 1993, S. 631, which was a composite of \nhealth care legislation introduced by Senators Cohen, Kassebaum, Bond, \nand McCain, and included pieces of my bill, S. 18. I introduced this \nlegislation in an attempt to move ahead on the consideration of health \ncare legislation and provide a starting point for debate. As I noted \nearlier, I was precluded by Majority Leader Mitchell from obtaining \nSenate consideration of my legislation as a floor amendment on several \noccasions. Finally, on April 28, 1993, I offered the text of S. 631 as \nan amendment to the pending Department of the Environment Act, S. 171, \nin an attempt to urge the Senate to act on health care reform. My \namendment was defeated 65 to 33 on a procedural motion, but the Senate \nhad finally been forced to contemplate action on health care reform.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, January 4, 1995, I introduced \na slightly modified version of S. 18, the Health Care Assurance Act of \n1995, which contained provisions similar to\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\nthose ultimately enacted in the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, \nincluding insurance market reforms, an extension of the tax \ndeductibility of health insurance for the self employed, and tax \ndeductibility of long term care insurance.\n  I continued these efforts in the 105th Congress, with the \nintroduction of Health Care Assurance Act of 1997, S. 24, which \nincluded market reforms similar to my previous proposals with the \naddition of a new title I, an innovative program to provide vouchers to \nStates to cover children who lack health insurance coverage. I also \nintroduced title I of this legislation as a standalone bill, the \nHealthy Children's Pilot Program of 1997, S. 435, on March 13, 1997. \nThis proposal targeted the approximately 4.2 million children of the \nworking poor who lacked health insurance at that time. These are \nchildren whose parents earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid, but \ndo not earn enough to afford private health care coverage for their \nfamilies.\n  This legislation would have established a $10 billion/5-year \ndiscretionary pilot program to cover these uninsured children by \nproviding grants to States. Modeled after Pennsylvania's \nextraordinarily successful Caring and BlueCHIP programs, this \nlegislation was the first Republican-sponsored children's health \ninsurance bill during the 105th Congress.\n  I was encouraged that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed into \nlaw on August 5, 1997, included a combination of the best provisions \nfrom many of the children's health insurance proposals throughout that \nCongress. The new legislation allocated $24 billion over 5 years to \nestablish State Child Health Insurance Program, funded in part by a \nslight increase in the cigarette tax.\n  During the 106th, 107th, 108th Congresses, I again introduced the \nHealth Care Assurance Act. These bills contained similar insurance \nmarket reforms, as well as new provisions to augment the new State \nChild Health Insurance Program, to assist individuals with disabilities \nin maintaining quality health care coverage, and to establish a \nnational fund for health research to supplement the funding of the \nNational Institutes of Health. All these new initiatives, as well as \nthe market reforms that I supported previously, work toward the goals \nof covering more individuals and stemming the tide of rising health \ncosts.\n  My commitment to the issue of health care reform across all \npopulations has been consistently evident during my tenure in the \nSenate, as I have come to the floor and offered health care reform \nbills and amendments on countless occasions. I will continue to stress \nthe importance of the Federal Government's investment in and attention \nto the system's future.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I can personally report on the miracles \nof modern medicine. In 1993, an MRI detected a benign tumor, \nmeningioma, at the outer edge of my brain. It was removed by \nconventional surgery, with 5 days of hospitalization and 5 more weeks \nof recuperation. When a small regrowth was detected by a follow-up MRI \nin June 1996, it was treated with high powered radiation using a \nremarkable device called the ``Gamma Knife.'' I entered the hospital on \nthe morning of October 11, 1996, and left the same afternoon, ready to \nresume my regular schedule.\n  In July 1998, I was pleased to return to the Senate after a \nrelatively brief period of convalescence following heart bypass \nsurgery. This experience again led me to marvel at our health care \nsystem and made me more determined than ever to support Federal funding \nfor biomedical research and to support legislation which will \nincrementally make health care available to all Americans.\n  In February 2005, I received tests at Thomas Jefferson University \nHospital for persistent fevers and enlarged lymph nodes under my left \narm and above my left clavicle. The testing involved a biopsy of a \nlymph node and biopsy of bone marrow. The biopsy of the lymph node was \npositive for Hodgkin's disease; however the bone marrow biopsy showed \nno cancer. A follow up PET scan and MRI at the University of \nPennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center established that I had stage IVB \nHodgkin's disease. After successful chemotherapy treatment I received a \n``clean bill of health.''\n  Three years later, I received the test results from a routine PET \nscan, which showed a mild recurrence of Hodgkin's disease. I was once \nagain undertook a chemotherapy regimen, which I have recently \nsuccessfully completed.\n  My concern about health care has long predated my own personal \nbenefits from diagnostic and curative procedures. As I have previously \ndiscussed, my concern about health care began many years ago and has \nbeen intensified by my service on the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education--LHHS.\n  My own experience as a patient has given me deeper insights into the \nAmerican health care system beyond my perspective from the U.S. Senate. \nI have learned: No. 1 patients sometimes have to press their own cases \nbeyond doctors' standard advice; No. 2 greater flexibility must be \nprovided on testing and treatment; No. 3 our system has the resources \nto treat the 47 million Americans currently uninsured; and No. 4 all \nAmericans deserve the access to health care from which I and others \nwith coverage have benefited.\n  I believe we have learned a great deal about our health care system \nand what the American people are willing to accept in terms of health \ncare coverage provided by the Federal Government. The message we heard \nloudest was that Americans do not want the Government to have a single \npayer Government operated system.\n  While I would have been willing to cooperate with the Clinton \nadministration in addressing this Nation's health care problems, I \nfound many areas where I differed with President Clinton's approach to \nsolutions. I believe that the proposals would have been deleterious to \nmy fellow Pennsylvanians, to the American people, and to our health \ncare system as a whole. Most importantly, as the President proposed in \n1993, I did not support creating an expansive new Government \nbureaucracy.\n  On this latter issue, I first became concerned about the potential \ngrowth in bureaucracy in September 1993 after reading the President's \n239-page preliminary health care reform proposal. I was surprised by \nthe number of new boards, agencies, and commissions, so I asked my \nlegislative assistant, Sharon Helfant, to make me a list of all of \nthem. Instead, she decided to make a chart. The initial chart depicted \n77 new entities and 54 existing entities with new or additional \nresponsibilities.\n  When the President's 1,342-page Health Security Act was transmitted \nto Congress on October 27, 1993, my staff reviewed it and found an \nincrease to 105 new agencies, boards, and commissions and 47 existing \ndepartments, programs and agencies with new or expanded jobs. This \nchart received national attention after being used by Senator Bob Dole \nin his response to the President's State of the Union address on \nJanuary 24, 1994.\n  The response to the chart was tremendous, with more than 12,000 \npeople from across the country contacting my office for a copy; I still \nreceive requests for the chart. Groups and associations, such as United \nWe Stand America, the American Small Business Association, the National \nFederation of Republican Women, and the Christian Coalition, reprinted \nthe chart in their publications--amounting to hundreds of thousands \nmore in distribution. Bob Woodward of the Washington Post later stated \nthat he thought the chart was the single biggest factor contributing to \nthe demise of the Clinton health care plan. And during the November \n1996 election, my chart was used by Senator Dole in his presidential \ncampaign to illustrate the need for incremental health care reform.\n  The reforms we must enact need to encompass all areas of health. This \nmust start with preventive health care and wellness programs. This \nstarts at birth with prenatal care. We know that in most instances, \nprenatal care is effective in preventing low-birth-weight babies. \nNumerous studies have demonstrated that low birth weight does not have \na genetic link but is instead most often associated with inadequate \nprenatal care or the lack of prenatal care. It is a human tragedy for a \nchild to be born weighing 16 ounces with attendant problems which last \na lifetime. I first saw one pound babies in 1984 and I was astounded to \nlearn that Pittsburgh, PA, had the highest infant mortality rate of \nAfrican-American babies\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\nof any city in the United States. I wondered how that could be true of \nPittsburgh, which has such enormous medical resources. It was an \namazing thing for me to see a 1-pound baby, about as big as my hand. \nHowever, I am pleased to report that as a result of successful \nprevention initiatives like the Federal Healthy Start program, \nPittsburgh's infant mortality has decreased 24 percent.\n  To improve pregnancy outcomes for women at risk of delivering babies \nof low birth weight and to reduce infant mortality and the incidence of \nlow-birth-weight births, as well as improving the health and well-being \nof mothers and their families, I initiated action that led to the \ncreation of the Healthy Start program in 1991. Working with the first \nBush administration and Senator Harkin, as chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee, we allocated $25 million in 1991 for the \ndevelopment of 15 demonstration projects. This number grew to 75 in \n1998, to 96 projects in 2008. For fiscal year 2008, we secured $99.7 \nmillion for this vital program.\n  To help children and their families to truly get a healthy start \nrequires that we continue to expand access to Head Start. This \nimportant program provides comprehensive services to low income \nchildren and families, including health, nutritional, and social \nservices that children need to achieve the school readiness goal of \nHead Start. I have strongly supported expanding this program to cover \nmore children and families. Since fiscal year 2000, funding for Head \nStart has increased from $5.3 billion to the 2008 level of $6.9 \nbillion. Additional funding has extended the reach of this important \nprogram to over 1 million children.\n  The LHHS Appropriations bill also has made great strides in \nincreasing funding for a variety of public health programs, such as \nbreast and cervical cancer prevention, childhood immunizations, family \nplanning, and community health centers. These programs are designed to \nimprove public health and prevent disease through primary and secondary \nprevention initiatives. It is essential that we invest more resources \nin these programs now if we are to make any substantial progress in \nreducing the costs of acute care in this country.\n  As ranking member and chairman of the LHHS Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have greatly encouraged the development of prevention \nprograms which are essential to keeping people healthy and lowering the \ncost of health care in this country. In my view, no aspect of health \ncare policy is more important. Accordingly, my prevention efforts have \nbeen widespread.\n  I joined my colleagues in efforts to ensure that funding for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, increased from $2.3 \nbillion in 1997 to $6.375 billion in fiscal year 2008. We have also \nworked to increase funding for CDC's breast and cervical cancer early \ndetection program to $200.8 million in fiscal year 2008.\n  I have also supported programs at CDC which help children. CDC's \nchildhood immunization program seeks to eliminate preventable diseases \nthrough immunization and to ensure that at least 90 percent of 2-year-\nolds are vaccinated. The CDC also continues to educate parents and \ncaregivers on the importance of immunization for children under 2 years \nold. Along with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, I have \nhelped ensure that funding for this important program together with the \ncomplementary Vaccines for Children Program has grown from $914 million \nin 1999 to $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2008.\n  While vaccines are critical for prevention we must be prepared for an \ninfluenza pandemic. To ensure that America is properly prepared for \nsuch a pandemic the LHHS Appropriations bills have provided $6 billion \nsince 2005. This funding provides development and purchase of vaccines, \nantivirals, necessary medical supplies, diagnostics, and other \nsurveillance tools.\n  We have also strengthened funding for Community Health Centers, which \nprovide immunizations, health advice, and health professions training. \nThese centers, administered by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, provide a critical primary care safety net to rural and \nmedically underserved communities, as well as uninsured individuals, \nmigrant workers, the homeless, residents of public housing, and \nMedicaid recipients. Funding for Community Health Centers has increased \nfrom $1 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $3.2 billion in fiscal year \n2008.\n  Increases in research, education and treatment in women's health have \nbeen of particular importance to me. In 1998, I cosponsored the Women's \nHealth Research and Prevention Amendments, which were signed into law \nlater that year. This bill revised and extended certain programs with \nrespect to women's health research and prevention activities at the \nNational Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  In 1996, I also cosponsored an amendment to the fiscal year 1997 VA-\nHUD Appropriations bill, which required that health plans provide \ncoverage for a minimum hospital stay for a mother and child following \nthe birth of the child. This bill became law in 1996.\n  In 2005, I introduced the Gynecologic Cancer Education and Awareness \nAct to increase education of gynecological cancer so that women would \nbe able to recognize cancer warning signs and seek treatment. This \nlegislation became law in 2007.\n  I have also been a strong supporter of funding for AIDS research, \neducation, and prevention programs.\n  During the 101st and 104th Congresses, I cosponsored the Ryan White \nCARE Reauthorization Act, which provided Federal funds to metropolitan \nareas and States to assist in health care costs and support services \nfor individuals and families affected by acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome, AIDS, or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, \nHIV. Those bills became law in 1990 and 1996 respectively.\n  Funding for Ryan White AIDS programs has increased from $757.4 \nmillion in 1996 to $2.14 billion for fiscal year 2008. That includes \n$794 million for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, ADAP, to help low-\nincome individuals afford life saving drugs. AIDS research at the NIH \ntotaled $742.4 million in 1989 and has increased to an estimated $2.91 \nbillion in fiscal year 2008.\n  Veterans provide an incredible service in defending our country, and \nproviding them with quality health care is critical. During the 102d \nCongress, I cosponsored an amendment to the Veterans' Medical Programs \nAmendments of 1992, which included improvements to health and mental \nhealth care and other services to veterans by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. This bill became law in 1992.\n  During the 106th Congress, I sponsored the Veterans Benefits and \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 2000, which increased amounts of \neducational assistance for veterans under the Montgomery GI Bill and \nenhanced health programs. This bill became law in 2000.\n  I also sponsored the Department of Veterans Affairs Long-Term Care \nand Personnel Authorities Enhancement Act, which improved and enhanced \nthe provision of health for veterans. This bill became law in 2003.\n  In the 108th Congress, I introduced the Veterans Health Care, Capital \nAsset and Business Improvement Act of 2003, which upon becoming law in \nDecember 2003 enhanced the provision of health care for veterans by \nimproving authorities relating to the administration of personnel at \nthe VA.\n  In June 2004, I introduced the Department of Veterans Affairs Health \nCare Personnel Enhancement Act, which simplified pay provisions for \nphysicians and dentists and authorized alternate work schedules and pay \nscales for nurses to improve recruitment and retention of top talent. \nThe bill was signed into law in December 2004.\n  To increase the portability of insurance, in 1996, I cosponsored the \nHealth Coverage Availability and Affordability Act, which improved the \nportability and continuity of health insurance coverage in the group \nand individual markets, combated waste, fraud, and abuse in health \ninsurance and health care delivery, promoted the use of medical savings \naccounts, improved access to long-term care services and coverage, and \nsimplified the administration of health insurance. This bill became law \nin 1996.\n  Statistics show that 27 percent of Medicare expenditures occur during \na person's last year of life and beyond the last year of life, a \ntremendous percentage of medical costs occur in the last month, in the \nlast few weeks, in the last week, or in the last few days.\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\n  The issue of end of life treatment is such a sensitive subject and no \none should decide for anybody else what that person should have by way \nof end-of-life medical care. What care ought to be available is a very \npersonal decision. However, living wills give an individual an \nopportunity to make that judgment, to make a decision as to how much \ncare he or she wanted near the end of his or her life and that is, to \nrepeat, a matter highly personalized for the individual.\n  Individuals should have access to information about advanced \ndirectives. As part of a public education program, I included an \namendment to the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of \n2003 which directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ninclude in its annual ``Medicare and You'' handbook, a section that \nspecifies information on advance directives and details on living wills \nand durable powers of attorney regarding a person's health care \ndecisions.\n  As ranking member and chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to \nprovide much-needed resources for hospitals, physicians, nurses, and \nother health care professionals.\n  An adequate number of health professionals, including doctors, \nnurses, dentists, psychologists, laboratory technicians, and \nchiropractors is critical to the provision of health care in the United \nStates. I have worked to provide much needed funding for health \nprofessional training and recruitment programs. In fiscal year 2008, \nthese vital programs received $334 million. Nurse education and \nrecruitment alone has been increased from $58 million in fiscal year \n1996 to $149 million in fiscal year 2008.\n  Differences in reimbursement rates between rural and urban areas have \nled to significant problems in health professional retention. During \nthe debate on the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, which passed as part \nof the fiscal year 2001 consolidated appropriations bill, I attempted \nto reclassify some northeastern hospitals in Pennsylvania to a \nMetropolitan Statistical Area with higher reimbursement rates. Due to \nthe large volume of requests from other states, we were not able to \naccomplish these reclassifications for Pennsylvania. However, as part \nof the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus appropriations bill, I secured $7 \nmillion for 20 northeastern Pennsylvania hospitals affected by area \nwage index shortfalls.\n  As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement \nAct of 2003, which passed the Senate on November 25, 2003, a $900 \nmillion program was established to provide a one-time appeal process \nfor hospital wage index reclassification. Thirteen Pennsylvania \nhospitals were approved for funding through this program in \nPennsylvania. This program has been extended on several occasions and \nhas provided a total of $164.1 million for Pennsylvania hospitals.\n  The National Institutes of Health--NIH--are the crown jewels of the \nFederal Government and have been responsible for enormous strides in \ncombating the major ailments of our society including heart disease, \ncancer, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The NIH provides \nfunding for biomedical research at our Nation's universities, \nhospitals, and research institutions. I led the effort to double \nfunding for the NIH from 1998 through 2003. Since I became chairman in \n1996, funding for the NIH has increased from $12 billion in fiscal year \n1996 to $30.2 billion in the fiscal year 2009 Senate LHHS \nAppropriations bill.\n  Regrettably, Federal funding for NIH has steadily declined from the \n$3.8 billion increase provided in 2003, when the 5-year doubling of NIH \nwas completed, to only $328 million in fiscal year 2008. The shortfall \nin the President's fiscal year 2009 budget due to inflationary costs \nalone is $5.2 billion. To provide that $5.2 billion in funding, I \nrecently introduced with Senator Harkin, the NIH Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act. This supplemental funding would improve the current \nresearch decline, which is disrupting progress, not just for today, but \nfor years to come.\n  In 1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer. Had that war been \nprosecuted with the same diligence as other wars, my former chief of \nstaff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful young lady of 48, would not have died \nof breast cancer. One of my very best friends, a very distinguished \nFederal judge, Chief Judge Edward R. Becker, would not have died of \nprostate cancer. All of us know people who have been stricken by \ncancer, who have been incapacitated with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, \nwho have been victims of heart disease, or many other maladies.\n  The future of medical research must include embryonic stem cell \nresearch. I first learned about embryonic stem cell research in \nNovember 1998 and held the first congressional hearing in December of \nthat year. Since that time I have held 19 more hearings on this \nimportant subject. Embryonic stem cells have the greatest promise in \nresearch because they have the ability to become any type of cell in \nthe human body.\n  During the 109th Congress, the House companion bill to S. 471, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act, was passed by Congress but vetoed \nby President Bush. The vote to override the veto in the House failed. \nThe legislation would expand the number of stem cell lines that are \neligible for federally funded research, thereby accelerating scientific \nprogress toward cures and treatments for a wide range of diseases and \ndebilitating health conditions.\n  In the 110th Congress, S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, \nof which I am a lead cosponsor and is identical to the 109th Congress \nlegislation, was passed by Congress, but a vote to override the veto in \nthe House again failed.\n  During the course of our stem cell hearings, we have learned that \nover 400,000 embryos are stored in fertility clinics around the \ncountry. If these frozen embryos were going to be used for in vitro \nfertilization, I would support that over research. In fact, I have \nprovided $3.9 million in fiscal year 2008 to create an embryo adoption \nawareness campaign. Most of these embryos will be discarded and I \nbelieve that instead of just throwing these embryos away, they hold the \nkey to curing and treating diseases that cause suffering for millions \nof people.\n  The many research, training and education programs that are supported \nby the Federal Government all contribute to this Nation's efforts to \nprovide the best prevention and treatment for all Americans. But \nwithout access to health care, these efforts will be lost. But with the \nplan outlined in the Health Americans Act, we can provide health care \ncoverage for the 47 million uninsured Americans. This bipartisan bill \nis where the health insurance reform debate needs to begin--with a \nmarket based approach to reforming health insurance. The time has come \nfor concerted action in this arena. I urge my colleagues to take action \non this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9378-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9378-S9380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FILLING THE TREE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as we near the end of the 110th Congress, \nit is my hope that when we return for the 111th Congress, that there \nwill be more comity and more bipartisanship and more accomplishment \nthan we have seen in this Congress and in prior Congresses. I have \nspoken at some length on the Senate floor about this subject. I am \nabout to introduce a prepared written text, but the essence of my \nconcern arises because of the practice of limiting the amendments which \nSenators may offer on the floor and the problems of confirming judges, \nespecially in the last 2 years of a President's administration.\n  The great value of the Senate on the American political scene, which \nhas earned this august body the title ``the world's greatest \nlegislative body,'' has been the right of any Senator at any time to \noffer virtually any amendment on any bill. That, plus unlimited debate, \nhas made this Chamber a unique place among modern democracies, where \ngreat ideas can be stated, can be articulated, and can be debated, and \nwhere, with sufficient debate, sufficient analysis, and sufficient \nmerit, they can attract great public attention. But that has been \nthwarted in recent years--the last 15 years specifically--by both \nRepublican and Democratic majority leaders so that, as usual, when \nthere is a problem with this institution, there is bipartisan blame.\n  Senator Mitchell, Senator Lott, Senator Frist, and Senator Reid have \nall used this practice. The first three Senators used it on some nine \noccasions\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\neach, as detailed in the written floor statement which I am about to \nintroduce for the record. Senator Reid has used it some 15 times. The \npractice has been that the majority leader, who is entitled as a matter \nof Senate practice to first recognition, takes the floor and offers \namendments so that there is a process where no other Senator can offer \nan amendment. That is called filling the tree. That has resulted, then, \nin the followup on a cloture motion to cut off debate. Then it becomes \na bipartisan wrangle, with one half of the aisle--Democrats--voting for \ncloture to cut off debate and Republicans, in a partisan context, \nvoting against cloture. I have voted against cloture because as a \nmatter of principle I do not think we ought to end the debate before we \nhave had a debate or before Senators have had an opportunity to offer \namendments. That has resulted, as I see it, in gridlock on the Senate \nfloor, so the Senate has really become dysfunctional.\n  I contrast the kinds of work weeks we have had, with very few votes, \nto the management of the comprehensive immigration bill during the \n109th Congress where we had some 227 amendments filed and some 27 \nvotes, which is the way I think the Senate ought to operate.\n  Then, beyond the issue of filling the tree and stopping Senators from \nproceeding with the offering of amendments, we have had the problems of \nthe filibuster. Again, there is bipartisan blame, blame on both sides \nof the equation.\n  Mr. President, in the last 15 years, the ``World's Greatest \nDeliberative Body'' has degenerated into a ``do-nothing Senate'' due to \nabusive procedural actions taken by both Republican and Democratic \nmajority leaders. The Senate has been gridlocked and has become \ndysfunctional.\n  The uniqueness of the U.S. Senate has been that any Senator could \noffer any amendment on virtually any bill at any time. That \nopportunity, plus unlimited debate, made the Senate the place where \ngreat ideas could be presented to the American people and be debated \nextensively to provide the basis for legislative changes on public \npolicy to govern the Nation.\n  That changed in 1993 when majority leaders started using their powers \nof first-recognition to offer a series of amendments called ``filling \nthe tree.'' This procedure precludes any other Senator from offering \namendments to the legislation under consideration. Senator George \nMitchell used this procedure nine times in the 103d Congress from 1993 \nto 1994, Senator Trent Lott used it nine times in the 106th Congress \nfrom 2000 to 2002, and Senator Bill Frist used it nine times in the \n109th Congress from 2005 to 2006. Thus far in the 110th Congress during \n2007-2008, Senator Harry Reid has used the tactic 16 times.\n  The legislation on global warming illustrates the unproductive nature \nof this practice. On June 2, 2008, Senator Reid called up the Warner-\nLieberman bill. On June 3, 2008, I filed and discussed on the Senate \nfloor a series of proposed amendments based on competing the Bingaman-\nSpecter climate change bill. On June 4, 2008, Senator Reid used his \npower as majority leader of getting first-recognition to offer eight \namendments which filled the so-called tree thus precluding me or any \nother Senator from offering any amendments. Senator Reid then filed a \nmotion for ``cloture'' to cut off debate on June 4 to set the stage to \nvote on the bill without any amendments. It then became a partisan \nissue with Republicans opposing cloture and Democrats favoring it. I \nopposed cloture to cut off debate since there had been no debate and no \nopportunity to amend the bill. On June 6,, cloture was not invoked.\n  Reciprocal finger pointing then began, with Democrats blaming \nRepublicans for stymieing the legislation by filibustering and \nRepublicans responding that the Democrats were responsible for killing \nthe bill. This practice has been used 16 times during the 110th \nCongress, stopping the Senate from acting on bills such as FAA \nReauthorization--H.R. 2881--Lieberman-Warner Climate Security--S. \n3036--and the Energy Speculation Bill--S. 3268.\n  Sometimes, after the tree has been filled, there will be extensive \nnegotiations among Senators to agree on a limited number of specified \namendments that both sides are willing to vote on. In part, this is \ndone to limit the time it will take to finish the bill. More often, it \nis done to eliminate the tough votes where Senators will have to take \npositions on controversial issues which could be used against them in \nfuture campaigns, including 30-second television spots.\n  As a result of these practices, Senate floor time has been filled \nwith quorum calls where negotiations are in process to limit the number \nof votes which will be taken or to find ways to resolve the most \ncontentious issues without votes. On many weeks, the Senate has had \nlittle floor debate and votes. For example, the following occurred: one \nvote, April 28-May 2; 3 weeks with two votes, January 22-25, January \n28-February 1, and September 15-19; 1 week with three votes September \n8-12; 1 week with four votes, June 9-13; 5 weeks with five votes, April \n21-25; May 19-23; June 3-6; June 16-20; July 21-26; 2 weeks with six \nvotes, April 14-18; March 3-7.\n  This inactivity is contrasted with Senate action on the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill which was debated from May 15 to May 25, 2006, \nwith 227 amendments filed and 27 rollcall votes.\n  A far better procedural practice is to allow Senators to offer \namendments under time agreements. These are agreed to by unanimous \nconsent and allow Senators to have their amendments considered in an \nexpeditious manner. Thus, the Senate can work its will. The public then \nunderstands the issues involved and Senators are compelled to take \npositions by voting. That procedure is obviously totally undercut by \nthe majority leader's filling the tree to abort traditional Senate \npractices.\n  To stop the practice of filling the tree and revert to traditional \nSenate debate and votes, I proposed S. Res. 83 on February 15, 2007, \nwhich would have stopped the majority leader from filling the tree. \nNotwithstanding repeated efforts to get this proposed rule change acted \nupon, nothing has been done.\n  Senate action has also been stymied by the use of the filibuster or \nother procedures to thwart the confirmation of Federal judges. These \npractices have been utilized by both Democrats and Republicans in the \nlast 20 years. In the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nadministration, 1987-1988, the Democrats failed to confirm 10 district \ncourt nominees and 7 circuit court nominees. In addition, the time \nrequired to confirm circuit court nominees increased from 195 days \nduring President Carter's administration to 257 days during President \nReagan's administration.\n  Similarly in the last 2 years in the administration of President \nGeorge H.W. Bush, 1991-1992, the Democrats failed to confirm 10 circuit \ncourt nominees and 43 district court nominees. Further, the time \nrequired to confirm a circuit court nominee increased from 257 to 319 \ndays during President Bush's administration.\n  The Republicans retaliated when Senator Lott was the majority leader \nby refusing to give hearings to President Clinton's nominees or by \nrefusing to have the Senate vote on nominees after they reported out \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee. At the end of the 106th Congress, \n1999-2000, the Senate returned 17 circuit court nominees and 24 \ndistrict court nominees to the President, and the time required to \nconfirm a circuit court nominee had increased from 319 to 439 days.\n  In the final 2 years of President Clinton's administration, a \nRepublican Senate confirmed 15 circuit court judges and 57 district \ncourt judges. To date, the Democratic Senate has confirmed 10 of \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees and 48 district court nominees. \nAn additional 10 district court nominees may yet be confirmed. \nPresident Bush has nominated an additional 9 circuit court judges who \nhave not been confirmed and he has nominated an additional 20 district \ncourt nominees who it appears will not be confirmed, assuming that 10 \nof pending district court nominations will be confirmed. In the 110th \nCongress, the time required to confirm a circuit court nominee \nincreased from the 439 to 906 days.\n\n  The Senate was engaged in an especially bitter controversy from 2003-\n2005 when the Democrats engaged in 23 filibusters to stop the \nconfirmation of 10 circuit court nominees: Miguel A. Estrada, Richard \nGriffin, Carolyn B.\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nKuhl, David McKeague, Priscilla Richman Owen, Charles W. Pickering, \nHenry W. Saad, William H. Pryor, William G. Myers, and Janice Rogers \nBrown. At least four other nominees were blocked by the mere threat of \nfilibuster: Terrence Boyle, William Haynes, Brett M. Kavanaugh, and \nSusan B. Neilson.\n  Republicans then threatened retaliation with the so-called nuclear or \nconstitutional option. That plan would have called upon Vice President \nCheney to rule that 51 votes could invoke cloture. That ruling would \nthen be appealed, and under Senate procedure, a majority of 51 votes \nwould sustain the ruling of the chair. In that manner, it was \ncontemplated that at least 51 votes could be obtained from the 55 \nRepublican Senators.\n  On May 23, 2005, the eve of a vote set for the following day to \ninvoke the nuclear or constitutional option, the so-called ``Gang of \n14''--7 Democrats and 7 Republicans--agreed to enter into a compromise \nto confirm Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, and Priscilla Owen, and \nto reject William Myers and Henry Saad, so there was never a \ndetermination as to whether Republicans had sufficient votes to invoke \nthe nuclear/constitutional option.\n  With the 7 Democrats and the 7 Republicans in the ``Gang of 14'' \nbreaking party lines, there would have been insufficient votes to \nmaintain the filibusters or to invoke the nuclear/constitutional \noption. With 7 Democrats from the ``Gang of 14'' voting for cloture, \nthere would have been 62 potential votes--55 Republicans and 7 \nDemocrats--to invoke cloture. With 7 Republicans voting against the \nnuclear/constitutional option, there would have been a maximum of only \n48 votes, 55 minus 7.\n  In order to break the filibuster impasse on the confirmation of \nFederal judges, I proposed S. Res. 327 on April 1, 2004 and S. Res. 469 \non March 4, 2008. These resolutions provided for a 90-day timetable for \nfair consideration of all judicial nominees with the following \nbenchmarks: within 30 days of the President submitting a judicial \nnomination, the Judiciary Committee would hold a hearing; within 30 \ndays of the hearing, the committee would vote on the nomination; and \nwithin another 30 days, the Senate would hold an up-or-down vote on the \nnomination. I was willing to modify this timetable; but it would move \nthe issue forward to some compromise timetable.\n  This rule change would not affect the existing rules that require 60 \nSenators to cut off debate on legislative matters. It would apply only \nto judicial confirmations.\n  The basis for the rule change was that public policy was better \nserved by determining confirmation on professional qualification \nwithout engaging in the ``cultural wars'' to elevate ideology over \nprofessional judicial qualifications.\n  As a practical political matter, filibusters have not been used to \nblock Supreme Court nominations, where there is substantial public \nvisibility even though many Senators would like to have done so. The \nconventional wisdom was that in a high visibility situation like \nSupreme Court confirmations, many Senators would not support a \nfilibuster unless a good reason could be publicly articulated to do so. \nWith less visible circuit court nominees, that reluctance was absent.\n  For example, no filibuster was mounted against Justice Clarence \nThomas even though there was substantial ideological opposition to his \nconfirmation. Democrats did not have 60 votes to invoke cloture. \nJustice Thomas was ultimately confirmed 52-48. Similarly there was no \neffort to filibuster the nominations of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg or \nJustice Stephen Breyer even though there was substantial Republican \nideological opposition. Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3 and \nJustice Breyer was confirmed 87 to 9.\n  During the confirmation hearing of Justice Samuel Alito, the \nDemocrats sought to gain traction about a filibuster trying to \nassociate Justice Alito with the Concerned Alumni of Princeton, an \norganization which reputedly discriminated against women and \nminorities. The Democrats' effort failed to secure a subpoena for the \nConcerned Alumni of Princeton records and informal inquiries found no \nconnection between that organization and Justice Alito. Thus, the \neffort to muster a filibuster sputtered and was not pursued.\n  During my travels through Pennsylvania during the August recess, I \nheard many complaints from my constituents at town meeting about \npartisanship in the U.S. Congress. The consistent comments were that \npeople were sick and tired of partisan bickering. It is reflected in \nthe public opinion polls which give the Congress very low ratings.\n  My proposed rule changes would have a profound effect on allowing the \nSenate to take care of the people's business by eliminating the \ngridlock and providing for up and down votes in the judicial nominating \nprocess based on professional competence and not ideology.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9380-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9380-S9381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1375\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today because there are far too \nmany women in America suffering in silence from postpartum depression \nand it is time to let them know that they are not alone. It is time to \nlift the veil of shame and secrecy--this condition is not their fault \nand they can get help.\n  The Melanie Blocker Stokes MOTHERS Act would establish the first \ncomprehensive legislation to assist new mothers suffering from \npostpartum depression and educate women about this disabling condition \nthat affects 800,000 women each year.\n  It would help provide support services to women suffering from \npostpartum depression and psychosis and would also help educate mothers \nand their families about these conditions.\n  In addition, it would support research into the causes, diagnoses and \ntreatments for postpartum depression and psychosis.\n  It attacks postpartum depression on all fronts with education, \nsupport, and research so that new moms can feel supported and safe \nrather than scared and alone.\n  We know--doctors and psychologists know--that there are all too many \nmothers in need who are suffering in silence. All too many mothers are \nunaware of the condition and go without the treatment and support they \nso desperately need.\n  I introduced this bill because I was inspired by the story of Mrs. \nMary Jo Codey--the former first lady of New Jersey--who publically \nshared her struggle with postpartum depression. It was her courage and \nstrength that helped change New Jersey law--and now, hopefully, will \nhelp change our Nation's laws.\n  But postpartum depression affects women all over this country, not \njust in my home State, and that is why I was proud to introduce this \nlegislation with Senator Durbin and work with the support of Senator \nKennedy. I saw the companion legislation of Representative Rush sail \nthrough the House--passing 382-3--and we were all set to pass this bill \nwhen one singular Senator signaled his objection, essentially blocked \nthe bill, and the whole process ground to a halt.\n  One Senator's objections and American women are left without relief \nand support from a disabling and often undiagnosed condition affecting \nas many as one in five new mothers experiencing symptoms.\n  One Senator's objections, and American women are left without this \nstrong program to make sure they no longer have to suffer in silence \nand feel alone when faced with this difficult condition.\n  One Senator's objections, and American women are left with few places \nto turn when they show signs of depression, lose interest in friends \nand family, feel overwhelming sadness or even have thoughts of harming \nthe baby or themselves.\n  Many new mothers sacrifice anything and everything to provide \nfeelings of security and safety to their newborn child. It is our duty \nto provide the same level of security, safety and support to new \nmothers in need.\n  We were on our way to taking those steps when a single Senator \nstepped in and blocked it from happening.\n  For the millions of American women who have suffered or soon will \nsuffer from postpartum depression we need to pass this bill today.\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged of S. \n1375 and that the Senate immediately proceed to S. 1375; that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken and that an amendment at the desk \nconsisting of the text of subtitle (d) of title I of S. 3297 be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that the amendment be considered and agreed \nto, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I assume my distinguished colleague from \nIdaho is objecting on behalf of Senator Coburn, and I understand if \nthat is the case.\n  I have a problem in that we have a process that has festered where \none person suddenly believes that they are the guardian of what is good \nand what is not. I always get concerned when suddenly one person in an \ninstitution believes they can use the powers that are reserved largely \nfor the purposes of ensuring that something they feel so passionate \nabout or so strongly about and to protect the powers of the minority \ncan be preserved, but then it get abused and hundreds of pieces of \nlegislation get stopped by one Senator.\n  Now, I intend to continue to push this because I want mothers \nthroughout this country to understand who is blocking their way from \nhaving the type of access and help that is necessary to be able to \nensure that, in fact, they do not have to go through these depressions \nalone.\n  We have many stories across the landscape of the country of mothers \nwho did not know they were having post partum depression, and the \nconsequences were that they thought about hurting their children and \nhurting themselves. We can do far better.\n  When the House of Representatives passed this very same bill, and we \nchanged it to accommodate our colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle in the HELP Committee, but passed it 382 to 3--382 to 3--the \nreality is, something is wrong when one Senator believes he or she can \nstop the progress on behalf of millions of women in this country.\n  I am going to come to the floor of the Senate time and time again. I \nwant American women to know who is the impediment to the opportunity \nfor them to get the help they need. I want mothers to know who is the \nimpediment to get the help they need. I want families to know who is \nthe impediment to get the help they need. I want husbands to know who \nis the impediment to have their spouses get the help they need, and \nthat is one Senator--one Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9381-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor often over \nthe last good number of years to speak about a variety of issues. In \nthe last 4 or 5 years, I spoke of my concern over a lack of a national \nenergy policy and the productivity of the great private sector in our \ncountry to produce energy for the American consumer and the inability \nof public policy or political figures to allow that to happen for all \nkinds of reasons, and obviously we have now experienced one of the \ngreatest energy shocks in our country's economy. Yet we still stand \nstill today, immobile in our ability to deal with it for a variety of \nreasons.\n  Today, I do not come to the floor to speak about energy. I am here \ntoday to speak about two health care issues that are important to our \nNation: accessibility to health care services and health care for \nveterans.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I had the opportunity \nto learn more about the phenomenal job the Department of Veterans \nAffairs does to provide health care to our Nation's veterans. VA runs \nfacilities across the country that employ some of the finest doctors, \nnurses, and other health care professionals.\n  These are dedicated men and women who provide world class health care \nto our Nation's heroes. The VA is also a training ground for many of \nour Nation's health care professionals. According to the American \nAssociation of Medical Colleges, more than half--yes, that is right, \nmore than half--of our Nation's physicians receive some part of their \nmedical training in VA hospitals.\n  Over 28,000 residents and nearly 17,000 medical students rotate \nthrough the VA health care system each year. Clearly, VA has become an \ninvaluable piece of the health care system for all Americans.\n  At the same time, the VA is a separate health care system within our \nNation and creates a certain disconnect. The focus of the VA has been \non establishing a system that is dependent upon bricks and mortar and a \nfixed location.\n  In the vast majority of situations, veterans enrolled in the VA \nhealth care system must receive health care at VA facilities unless \nthey want to pay for care through private insurance or out of their own \npockets. This means that veterans who do not live near a VA facility \nhave a more difficult time accessing VA care because of where they \nchoose to live.\n  To address this, VA aims to build facilities in strategic locations \nto serve the greatest number of veterans. I am pleased that in the past \nfew years VA increased the number of outpatient clinics in my State of \nIdaho. Unfortunately, these new clinics cannot completely resolve all \nof the issues or serve veterans in a total way.\n  I am sure all of my colleagues, and particularly those who represent \nrural States such as my home State of Idaho, have heard from veterans \nwho wish they could utilize their VA health care benefits at a facility \ncloser to their home. It is a significant barrier to care when a \nveteran has to drive for several hours to reach a VA facility.\n\n  An elderly veteran, possibly in his or her seventies or eighties, \ndriving literally hundreds of miles to get to that VA facility, is in \nitself not only impractical, in many instances it is impossible for \nthat veteran. We also need to consider health care access for the \ngeneral population. It is no surprise that our Nation is facing a \ncrisis when it comes to having an adequate supply of health care \nprofessionals.\n  According to a July 2007 report of the American Hospital Association, \nU.S. hospitals need approximately 116,000--that is right, 116,000--\nregistered nurses to fill vacant positions. This is a national RN \nvacancy rate of about 8.1 percent.\n  Another study estimates that the shortage of RNs could reach 500,000 \nby 2025. I did the math on my age and determined that is about when I \nam going to start needing possibly more health care provided by health \ncare professionals. At this moment, we are suggesting this will be the \nperiod of time when there will be potentially the greatest shortage.\n  An aging workforce, a shortage of slots in nursing schools, and an \naging population that is living longer and therefore requiring more \nhealth care services are all contributing to this nursing shortage. \nThis shortage in health care providers is not limited to nurses. In the \n2006 report by the Health Resources and Services Administration, they \nproject a shortfall of around 55,000 physicians by 2020. In addition, \nvarious studies have indicated current\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\nor impending deficiencies in various specialties, including cardiology, \nrheumatology, and neurosurgery, as well as primary care.\n  I think most Americans understand the significance of this situation. \nWe can build all of the medical facilities we want, but they serve no \npurpose if there are not enough medical professionals to work in these \nhospitals and clinics.\n  That is where the VA and other medical facilities, be they public, \nprivate or nonprofit, run into each other. They are all competing for a \npool of health care professionals that is not growing, and that is not \ngrowing as quickly as it is needed. I am concerned that ultimately this \nwill diminish the quality of health care that is delivered to our \nNation's veterans and, of course, to all Americans.\n  So how do we address the health care needs of all Americans when \nfaced with these challenges? I think we need to examine how we can \nintegrate VA facilities with other health care facilities to better \nserve not only veterans but entire communities. Is there a way that we \ncan utilize existing VA facilities to serve all of those living in \nrural communities that struggle to recruit health care professionals \nwithout compromising care for veterans? Is there a way we can change \nthe VA health care system to enable veterans to receive care at their \nlocal non-VA health care providers?\n  I know these kinds of changes will not happen quickly and they will \nnot happen easily. Earlier this session I introduced two pieces of \nlegislation that proposed dramatic changes in the VA health care \nsystem. I will say that these proposals were not enthusiastically \nwelcomed by many of those entrenched in the veteran advocacy community. \nS. 815, the Veterans Health Care Empowerment Act, would allow veterans \nwith a service-connected disability to receive hospital or other \nmedical care at any Medicare or TRICARE-eligible facility.\n  When I introduced this legislation last March, I stated my belief \nthat most veterans would choose to continue to receive health care at a \nVA facility. I still believe that is true. But I also know this \nlegislation would enhance access of care for veterans who do not live \nnear a VA facility by serving them in the communities in which they \nlive.\n  I also introduced legislation, S. 441, the State Veterans Home \nModernization Act, which would allow, instead of building veterans \nhomes, noninstitutional care and daycare and respite care for our \nveterans. I know my time is now limited, so let me close with this \nthought.\n  Earlier this year, a group of young Idaho Iraqi and Afghan vets came \nto my office concerned about health care. One of them pulled from his \npocket a credit card and said: Senator, why cannot this become a VA \nhealth care card that allows me access to health care in my community \npaid for by the Veterans' Administration because I have, upon my \nservice and upon my disability, been granted access to the VA health \ncare system? I live in rural Idaho. But why must I travel miles when \nthere are hospitals and clinics all around me? I cannot have access to \nthem.\n  What is wrong with that picture? What is wrong with that picture is \nthat this wonderful, marvelous VA health care system is a static, in-\nplace system that does not have the flexibility that modern health care \nspeaks to and that it must have in the future.\n  I am retiring from the Senate, so these pieces of legislation will \nnot be introduced again. But I am challenging my colleagues, as you \nstand and so proudly speak of your concern for veterans and your \nconcern for their care, that you step away from the bricks and mortar \nand from the rigidity of the activist advocacy groups who think that \nhealth care for veterans can only be delivered in one form. Modernize \nit. Change it. Give it flexibility if we want to give ultimate health \ncare to our veterans, and if we want to integrate nonveterans into that \nquality health care system in a way that strengthens it, improves it, \nand sustains it in an economical fashion.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9382-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Senator McCain has just announced he is \nwilling to suspend his campaign, set politics aside, and sit down with \nall sides to come to a solution to the looming threat to our economy. \nThat is really an outstanding idea. The threat to Americans and their \nhomes, savings, and retirements is really not a partisan problem, and \nit will not be fixed with a partisan approach. Americans want to know \nthat their home values and college funds and retirement accounts are \nsafe; in other words, that the problems on Wall Street are not going to \nspread to Main Street. So I appreciate my colleague's proposal, and I \nhope it will be given serious consideration.\n  My constituents are not calling and asking me to help their brokers. \nThey are asking for help to protect their mortgages, their ability to \ngrow their small businesses, their ability to send their kids to \ncollege. And they are worried about the security of their life savings. \nI am concerned that if we do nothing, their savings, their ability to \nbuy a home or finance college, and their financial security are all at \nvery serious risk.\n  These are not ordinary circumstances, and if this economic \nstabilization plan was nothing but a bailout for Wall Street bankers, I \nwould not have anything to do with it.\n  The only reason to support this action is to save ordinary Americans \nfrom an economic disaster that they had absolutely no hand whatsoever \nin creating. And to say that I am more than a little mad at this \nsituation--created largely by bad decisions of those in the subprime \nhousing market--is an understatement.\n  But if we are to take action, then it needs to put Main Street ahead \nof Wall Street. This isn't about bailing out investment bankers; this \nis about keeping the U.S. economy from entering a downward spiral. To \nthat end, any action we take must include the following: No. 1, limits \non executive compensation; No. 2, debt reduction; No. 3, congressional \noversight and transparency. And yes, of course, taxpayer protection.\n  With regard to executive compensation, if weak companies are seeking \nGovernment assistance, the taxpayers should expect no less than a firm \nlimit on what kind of executive compensation might be possible for \nthose involved in these distressed companies.\n  Debt reduction. Any proceeds that are earned from the Government \nbuying these assets and then selling them in the marketplace must be \nused to reduce the national debt. These revenues must not be used to \npay for unrelated and unnecessary pet projects.\n  Congressional oversight and transparency. Americans need to be able \nto see how their money is being used and that it is being managed \nwisely. We in Congress will watch where every dollar goes to ensure \nthere is no waste and no funny business.\n  Taxpayer protection. Americans have a right to expect that there is \nno fraud or abuse. It is the taxpayer and the American economy we are \nprotecting, and we must take steps to ensure they are protected first.\n  The American people who were not involved in creating this situation \nneed to be protected from the mistakes of those who were. Main Street \nneeds to be insulated from Wall Street. That is what this plan is meant \nto accomplish. But we must insist on the protections I have just \nenumerated.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout a perspective that I think is lacking, and I hope we have an \nopportunity to gain. I was intrigued and interested as I listened to \nthe senior Senator from New Hampshire explain to the American people \nwhat actually is going on in terms of our financial system. I don't \nbelieve there is anybody in the Congress, or anybody in the country, \nwho is happy about where we are today: contemplating putting the \nFederal Government as the owner of a bunch of toxic assets that were \naccumulated on the basis of greed, poor policy, bad management, and bad \nregulation. I don't believe anybody is happy we are here. I don't \nbelieve the regulators are; I don't think Members of Congress are; I \ndon't think people in this country are.\n  But from that, we can learn something. My worry is that we will not. \nI heard this morning the majority leader--and I have a great deal of \nrespect for him--laying this all at the foot of President Bush. \nPresidents can do very little other than what we let them do. When we \ntalk about the lack of oversight and regulation, the problem is, we \nwere not watching the regulators, and our constitutional duty is that \nwe should have been.\n  There is a lot of blame to go around--and it is not partisan--\nRepublicans and Democrats, the executive branch, even the judicial \nbranch in some of their rulings that created some stupid consequences \nto things that were never intended by Congress.\n  But what we ought to learn, and what I think is most important is, if \nyou are an American right now and you are worried, you have a great \nreason to be worried. It is not about some impending financial crash. \nWhat you should be worried about is the Congress is not listening.\n  Let me explain what I mean.\n  We are going to finish at the end of this year with over $10 trillion \nin debt. That is over $33,000 for every man, woman, and child. We are \nabout to pass some type of system to salvage credit liquidity in this \ncountry that is going to cost another $2,000 to $3,000 per man, woman, \nand child in this country.\n  We are going to have a continuing resolution that comes to this body \nthis evening or maybe tomorrow morning that continues to do the wrong \nthings that got us into the mess in the first place.\n  The financial mess we are in is because confidence in the country and \nour response has been eroded. As I got on a plane to come back to \nWashington, I talked with a businessman from eastern Oklahoma who has a \nworldwide business. He talked about on August 20, he saw this \ntremendous worldwide drop in demand for his product. It didn't have \nanything to do with his product. It had everything to do with people \nnow worried about if they should hang on to cash because the economics \ndon't look good.\n  Whatever they do here, the No. 1 goal has to be reestablishing a \nconfidence in this country that, yes, we can have an economy that \nworks, we can rebuild faith in the financial institutions, and we can \ndo that, best of all, by not repeating the mistakes we have made in the \npast.\n  To outline, the Defense appropriations bill has over $10 billion in \nit for airplanes the Air Force doesn't want. Think about that. There is \n$10 billion worth of airplanes in the Defense appropriations bill that \nis going to pass that they are going to have to buy that they neither \nwant nor need. Why is that happening? Because we are putting local, \nparochial politics ahead of the best interests of the country.\n  We are going to buy some ships the Navy doesn't want. Same reason, \ndifferent area of the country. But we are going to buy them because we \nare going to put a parochial benefit to a Member of Congress ahead of \nthe best interests of the country.\n  There isn't a family out there who doesn't have to weekly or monthly \nmake hard choices about how they spend their money. We, unfortunately, \ncontinue to make decisions on how we spend your children's money and \nyour grandchildren's money on a parochial or political interest that \nbenefits Members of Congress. That is what has to change.\n  If there is a lesson in what has happened to us in terms of the loss \nof confidence in the financial system in this country, all I have to \nsay is Congress earned it. We created it. We expend 100 times more \neffort trying to create new programs and new ways of spending than we \ndo managing the very Government you send us here to put under control.\n  I take the Constitution literally. It has a section in it called the \nenumerated powers. It is article II, section 8. It spells out exactly \nwhat the role of Congress is. If you look at how we got into this mess, \nevery example of that goes back to the fact that Congress is violating \nwhat the Constitution says is our legitimate role, is doing something \nthat is outside the legitimate role, and we rationalized it for the \npolitical benefits for either career politicians or party, one side of \nthe aisle or the other. That is why Congress has a 9-percent approval \nrating, because we are more interested in us than we are the best \ninterests of the country. And it shows.\n  We have the financial debacle in front of us today to prove it. \nImagine what would have happened had Congress been aggressive in its \noversight. Imagine what would have happened after the failed attempt 4 \nyears ago to try to put the controls of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that \nwe had a monthly hearing outlining the worsening--worsening--condition \nso we could have avoided this situation. Instead of us doing that, we \ndid what was easy. We took the easy road, the wide road. We didn't do \nwhat our oath calls us to do.\n  I think we are going to see some very different behavior when it \ncomes to us approaching the financial package that we are going to put \ntogether that will enable an economic recovery in this country. I \nbelieve you are going to see people vote for bills they basically don't \nlike because it is in the best interest of the country. My hope is that \nwhen we do that, it would not be a one-time happening; that we will, in \nfact, move back to the position to take a decision on how we vote on \nsomething and not do a finger to the wind on how it looks back home or \nhow it looks for our political career but, in fact, look at the U.S. \nConstitution and say: Does it square with that, and does it match our \noath to do what is in the best interest of the country? When we get \nthrough with this exercise, as far as this economic recovery, I think \nthe country can once again maybe start to have confidence in Congress; \nthat we will, in fact, address the issue; that we will vote against our \npolitical best interests, but we will vote in the best interests of the \nAmerican people.\n\n  Senator Gregg has outlined very eloquently what is happening, what \nhas happened, what the response has been thus far, and what needs to be \ndone in the future. If you have not heard him speak to this, I would \nsuggest my colleagues listen to him. You can get it, what he spoke \nabout this morning, before lunch, an understanding of what is necessary \nto reestablish confidence. It is not a time for politicians to win, it \nis a time for the American people to win. The only way they win is when \nwe put them first and us second.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the time the Senator from Oklahoma has used, I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes under morning business; and at the conclusion \nof my time, Senator Alexander be recognized; and if a Democratic Member \nwishes to speak, that they be inserted in the proper order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nOklahoma. He has made an extraordinarily statesmanlike presentation. \nThis isn't about the politics of the day, it isn't\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\nabout theater or hyperbole. This is about how we maintain the integrity \nof the American financial system so we have the necessary tools to make \nMain Street solvent and prosperous so Americans don't lose their jobs, \ndon't lose their savings, and we have economic activity that continues. \nHe has stood and--in the face of what is some fairly intense criticism \ncoming from pundits who don't have a vested interest in the issue, \nother than their desire to get ratings--made the very rational point \nthat we need to do this, we need to take action, we need to step \noutside the bounds of politics, outside the bounds of theater, and we \nneed to do it now; that delaying this only will lead to significant \nproblems.\n  So, first, I wish to say I have unlimited praise for the position the \nSenator has taken, and he has not only done this in this Chamber but he \nhas done it in meetings with membership, and it has had a huge impact \non my colleagues because he is so highly regarded on the issue of \nfiscal policy especially. But I guess my question is: We have Senator \nMcCain basically suspending his campaign to come back and try to work \non this, and Senator Obama has been very constructive. It is time to \nmove forward in a bipartisan way. Doesn't the Senator from Oklahoma \nbelieve this has to be done in a bipartisan way and done in a very \ntimely way; otherwise, we will lose the opportunity to settle this \nsituation out, and we may see a disastrous event occurring which \naffects every American's pocketbook and their lifestyle, basically?\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, I thank the Senator for his comments, and \nto answer him: What we saw on the market today, we saw a period of time \nwhen there was zero interest on a 2-month T-bill. What that is saying \nis people have lost interest on anything other than a government \nsecurity, and they are willing to give the Government their money for \nthat security with no interest. That is fear talking. What we have to \ndo is drive out fear. We have to drive back confidence.\n  So I believe, Senator Gregg, that we will see a bipartisan vote in \nthe Senate and the sooner the better. Because every day we are not \nfixing this, it is costing jobs, it is costing the ability to promote \nnew jobs in our economy, and it is costing savings for those people who \nare no longer working but living off retirement. So I feel this body is \ngoing to stand and do the right thing.\n  I have been impressed with Senator Schumer, Senator Jack Reed, whom I \njust saw. The questions he asked and the answers that were put forth by \nboth Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke yesterday, I thought, were \nright on the money. I don't think we are far apart. But even if we are \nnot far apart, we have to be able to do what is right and we have to do \nit timely. We should not leave here. There should be no leaving and \ncoming back until this is solved.\n  Our future depends on what we do and how fast we do it. That doesn't \nmean we should not do it right. It doesn't mean we shouldn't be \nthoughtful about what we do. But the degree and the magnitude of this \nproblem is something I have never seen in my 60 years, and I doubt the \nSenator from New Hampshire has ever seen it. Very few people in the \nhistory of the world have ever seen the kind of risk this country is \nfacing at this moment.\n  So it is important it have nothing to do with Republicans or \nDemocrats; that it have nothing to do with the Presidential election; \nthat it have nothing to do with anything except the best interest and \nthe future of this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, I wish to continue the dialogue the \nSenator from Oklahoma has begun because I believe it is critical.\n  There are times when our Nation faces a crisis of incomprehensible \nthreat--incomprehensible in terms of the size and the effect of it--and \nat those times we have united as a nation. This is a time when we have \nto do that. Most of those threats have been physical events, the most \nrecent being Katrina and, obviously, 9/11, and the attack on Pearl \nHarbor. These were physical events that caused us as a nation to pull \ntogether and act in an extraordinary way and as a government to do the \nsame. What we are facing is an event that will create a massive \ndisruption of our economy and will have a huge impact on individuals. \nThat is the point. People will be unable to get credit.\n  If you run a small mom-and-pop grocery store or a small business, and \nthis month or this week you don't make enough money to meet payroll, \nyou are not going to be able to borrow money to meet payroll, so people \nwill not be paid. If you have a child in college and you want to borrow \nto keep them going in college, you are not going to be able to borrow \nthat money. If you have a house you want to refinance or add on to, you \nprobably would not be able to borrow to do that. The credit markets are \nlocked down and will lock up if we don't take some action to try to \nrelieve this pressure.\n  The important point is this action is not that expensive in the \ncontext of the overall threat. The number $700 billion has been thrown \naround. That is a totally specious number. Yes, that is what will be \nborrowed, but it is not what it will cost us, because that money will \nbe used to purchase assets, and those assets have value and the \nGovernment and the taxpayers will recover that value. The net effect of \nthat borrowing and the assets purchased, when they are resold, could be \nzero, we could actually make money, or it may be $100 billion, which is \na lot of money, but it is certainly not $700 billion.\n  So in the context of what the initial cost will be, it will hardly be \nanything on the deficit in the next year. It may be significant on the \ndebt but not on the deficit. The practical effect of that in the long \nrun will be that it would not be anything on the debt because the money \nwill be repaid through the selling of the assets that are purchased. \nCompare that cost to what happens if we do nothing--if we have a total \ndestabilization of our financial houses, if banks start to fail, if \nMain Street contracts, if people are put out of work, if revenues drop \ndramatically. You are talking about lost revenues to the Federal \nGovernment of an inordinate amount. You are talking about programs \nwhich will have to be added to take care of people in dire straits of \ninordinate amounts. I can't imagine what the cost would be if we went \nthrough a dire recession or worse. But it would be huge--huge--and \ndramatically more, by factors of multiples, multiple events compared to \nwhat the cost is of trying to do something now.\n  The point is we have to do it quickly. This is understood, by the \nway, by a lot of people around here. It is understood, fortunately, by \nSenator McCain, who has said he is going to suspend his campaign to \ncome back and try to get this thing done. I believe it is understood by \nSenator Obama. I have been totally impressed with his very mature and \nappropriate response to this issue. I am hoping Senators McCain and \nObama can lead us, in a bipartisan way, to resolve this. I have also \nbeen impressed with the leadership on the other side of the aisle, \nespecially the role taken on by Senator Schumer, who obviously \nunderstands this intuitively and substantively, being from New York, \nBut also other Members on the other side of the aisle. I think Senator \nDodd, chairman of the Banking Committee has played a major role. \nObviously, he was extremely critical, he and Senator Shelby, in the \ninitial effort with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Their work was \nextraordinary.\n  So there is the core and the energy in the Senate to do something \naggressively, in a bipartisan way, and to do it right. I think the \npoint is we need to do it aggressively and do it right and do it now. \nWe can't wait.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Alexander, on the floor, and I know he \nhas a number of thoughts on this, and so I yield to the Senator from \nTennessee because he is a leader on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I came to the floor to join with the \nSenator from New Hampshire in congratulating the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor his statesman-like comments. And not just his comments on the floor \nbecause those of us who know Senator Coburn know that what he says in \npublic he says in private and vice versa, and we respect his views on \nfiscal matters. What he said was that we in the Senate have a \nresponsibility to make sure we do nothing to cause a crisis in \nconfidence, or more of one.\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for pointing out to us that \nwhen you say $700 billion or a trillion dollars, you are not taking \ninto account the real dollars--and I will not repeat his speech about \nthe cost. In fact, I will ask, if I may, a question of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, and I will yield the floor for a moment.\n  We hear these numbers, a trillion dollars and $700 billion.\n  May I ask the Senator from New Hampshire through the Chair, what \nwould he guess the real cost of this economic recovery plan to be, this \nSecretary Paulson plan that we hear about, based on what he knows now? \nWhat does he suspect the real cost would be?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, nobody actually knows, is the answer to that. But \nthere are some pretty good parameters you can put it within. We know \nthe Bear Stearns situation, which was $29 billion by the Fed, is \nprobably going to be a wash. We expect the AIG which again was the \nFederal Reserve action, not coming off our Treasury books, which was \n$85 billion--is probably going to be a winner. In other words, they \nwill get more money back than they are spending. Freddie Mac and Fannie \nMae, where we put up $200 billion, we essentially said we were willing \nto put up $200 billion and give the Treasury Secretary that type of \nauthority. We have only spent $5 billion so far of that $200 billion. \nThat $5 billion will net out, so the total cost of that $5 billion is \ngoing to be less than $5 billion, probably at the most maybe $1 \nbillion, maybe $1.5 billion after you net out the assets.\n  So if you look at those parameters and look at the $700 billion \nnumber, what we are going to be buying is assets. Think of it this way: \nWe are going to go out and buy a lot of cars that have been a little \ndamaged; some have been really damaged. The pricing we pay for those \ncars isn't going to be what the person paid for them when they bought \nthem off the lot. It is going to be what those cars are valued as \ndamaged. There may be a premium, but I don't think it will be much. \nThen we will take those cars and either repair them and resell them or \nwe are going to resell them, when the economy improves, as damaged \ncars. People will want them because they are going to repair them.\n  In either event, we are going to get back a fair amount of the money \nwe invested because we have a physical asset. It is called a mortgage-\nbacked security, most likely, and we own it and we can resell it or we \ncan wait until it matures at face value and get the money back, having \nbought it at less than face value.\n  I honestly believe, and my guess is--and everything is going to be a \nguess, but my guess is the cost of this event will be less--less--than \nthe initial stimulus package which we passed around here, which was \n$140 billion. That is a guess.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, whatever the cost is, I do not want to \nsee the cost of what will happen if we don't take action in the next \nfew days. After you have lived a while, and after you have seen a few \nthings, you begin to make some decisions based not just on the heart or \nthe mind but on the gut. This is a gut decision to me, with a little \nbit of experience thrown in.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee in the mid-1980s, I had the \nmisfortune of presiding over a situation where we had 40 or 50 banks \nthat failed. I stayed up all night with Paul Volcker and watched the \nFederal Reserve pull its credit for one of the banks in Knoxville. And \nthat set off a chain of events which, if it had been a national chain \nof events, we would have seen 1,000 or 2,000 bank failures. That is \nwhat we had to deal with.\n  That was a controlled, small event compared to what could happen if \nwe do not take steps to avert a credit crisis in the United States. \nLast week, before Thursday night's events, I was at the Volkswagen \nheadquarter's opening in Virginia. I spoke with the credit manager \nthere for the part of the company that loans money to people who buy \ncars, and said to me that he and people similar to him, even companies \nthat large, the largest European automobile maker, were finding it \ndifficult to get dollars.\n  What if General Motors Acceptance Corporation or Ford or Volkswagen \nor Nissan Credit cannot go into the market to get some money? Then they \ncannot loan me money to buy a Nissan or a Ford or a Saturn. If I can't \nbuy a car, then the new Volkswagen plant or the Nissan plant or the \nGeneral Motors plant that we are so excited about, doesn't have any \njobs.\n  I applaud Senator Coburn, I applaud Senator Gregg, and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, and the Republican leader here. Inaction is not an \noption here. I can only speak for one Senator, but from what I have \nheard on the Republican side of the aisle, we understand the \nseriousness of this problem. From what I have heard on the Democratic \nside of the aisle, most Democrats understand the seriousness of this \nproblem. We want to put our imprint on the proposal, but we want a \nresult. In my view, we must have a result to avert a set of events that \nnone of us would want to see.\n  For those watching the legislative process here in Washington, I want \nto make it clear to them that in my view, and I believe the sentiment \nof a great many Senators, is that we want and expect a result. We \nunderstand the seriousness of the problem.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was listening carefully to Senator Gregg and the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, and Senator Coburn and I see \nanother of my colleagues here, Senator Domenici. Let me give a real-\nworld example from my State, information just received. Here is what \nthis particular company experienced today.\n  ``We were informed''--I will leave out the name of the bank. ``We \nwere informed that an''--I will leave out the name of the county--\n``industrial revenue bond issued last year could not be resold this \nweek in the market because of the freeze of the credit markets.'' \nToday. ``These tax free bonds totaling $10 million were issued last \nyear on a variable interest rate basis, secured by a full irrevocable \nletter of credit from one of the nation's largest and most well \ncapitalized banks.''\n  No credit problem at all, but no lending--freeze credit. This crisis \nwe are all talking about here is not about a bunch of people on Wall \nStreet. It is about a bunch of people on Main Street, and whether we \nare going to act on a bipartisan basis to restore confidence, restore \nconfidence in our country and to prevent what could be a major \ncatastrophic event.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator from Tennessee would allow \nme to express a question to our leader: The point the leader makes is \nabsolutely valid, but it is not unique to Kentucky. We are hearing all \nover the country that municipal--communities are unable to roll over \ntheir municipal bonds or are getting close to that threat. We have \nheard about major corporations that have been unable to move cash into \nfranchises last week because the banks did not have the wherewithal to \nmove cash because of the threat and the pressure that was being put on \ntheir money market accounts, which they had to protect and defend.\n  As you say, this is not a Wall Street event. This is going to be a \nMain Street event. People are going to be put out of work, they are \ngoing to lose their jobs, there is going to be a huge disruption. The \npotential for economic disarray is unprecedented.\n  I think it is very appropriate that the Senator from Kentucky, as the \nleader, has pointed out a very real-world event here because this is \nreal-world stuff. This is not theory.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Democratic whip here and I am \nglad to have an opportunity to make this point while he is here, since \nthose of us on this side are Republicans.\n  I applaud the reaction of Senator Obama to this economic crisis. It \nis a Presidential reaction. It is restrained. It leaves room for \ndiscussion and it recognizes the problem.\n  I applaud Senator McCain's decision to involve himself, if he can, in \na solution to the problem. That is the kind of leadership we should \nexpect of both men, both of whom are Members of this body.\n  I can't emphasize enough how much I believe this situation cries out \nfor measured but urgent reaction, in a bipartisan way, by the Senate. \nBecause, as all the Senators have said, if it were Wall Street, we \ncould leave them to pick themselves up. But we are talking about \nwhether you can get a student loan, whether you can get a car loan,\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\nwhether you can get an auto loan, whether your money market account is \nsafe, and whether you have any money on the block. That is the \npotential impact of what we are talking about and we need, within a few \ndays, to take the kind of decisive action that builds confidence in our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to indicate if the minority \nleader chose to speak I will yield now and wait my turn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition to Senator Domenici, we have the ranking \nmember of the Joint Economic Committee, I see, standing in the back. If \nit is all right with the senior Senator from New Mexico, I suggest that \nSenator Brownback go right ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleagues and the Senator from Kentucky \nfor giving me a couple of minutes. The reason I wanted to take that is \nwe had Chairman Bernanke in front of the Joint Economic Committee this \nmorning for a couple of hours. Chairman Bernanke is also not only a \nstudent but a scholar of the Great Depression. He has studied this a \ngreat deal. I got to ask a question of him, as several other people did \nas well: When he looks at this situation, what similarities or \ndissimilarities does he see?\n  He was very forthcoming with his comments this morning. He said of \ncourse our financial markets are far more complex now than they were \nduring the period in the 1920s and the 1930s. But the same sort of \nsystemic thing that grabbed hold and made that one of the key problems \nthat made the Great Depression the length of time it was, was the \ncredit markets froze up. Then they didn't respond and they didn't open \nup.\n  While the market is far more complex today and people in the 1920s \nand 1930s wouldn't recognize this financial market for what it is on \nits complexities and derivatives and other things, they would recognize \nthe feature of market credit freezing. He was all but saying that right \nnow we are in a negative growth month or two; it could well be the \nquarter we are in. If you do not unfreeze these credit markets at this \npoint in time, you are going to go into a lengthier, deeper recession \nthat is going to take place because the credit is what allows small \nbusiness to get loans to grow and what allows people to get student \nloans to go to college. It is what lubricates and lets the system grow.\n  We are already in a weakened economy. You go ahead and constrict that \ncredit and then don't put the mechanism in place to release and let \nthat credit flow again, you are going to further jam down this economy \nand you are going to have a longer term, much more difficult situation.\n  This is a guy who is not just a student, he is a scholar on the Great \nDepression in this country and the depressions that have happened in \nother countries. I think we should listen to him.\n  In a real respect, we have--people may not agree with the situation \non the war in Iraq, but we have General Petraeus, who was the general \nwho led the turnaround, and General Odierno, who was there with them, \nand it was the A team that was there, and we put them on the field and \nthey put forward a plan and the plan worked.\n  I think we have the A team on the field now in Secretary Paulson and \nChairman Bernanke. I do not like the idea of what is being talked \nabout, but what they are saying is, if you do not do this and you leave \nthese credit markets locked up or stymied a great deal, you are going \nto push this recession, in an economy that is soft, into a longer, \ndeeper recession. This is not the way any of us wants to go.\n  I do not know what the plan actually is that we need to pass. There \nare some changes I think we need to do in what is being proposed, \nchanges that are very important for us to do. But the option of doing \nnothing is not an option. That has a huge number of problems for Main \nStreet America in the time we are talking about here. I think we do \nnot. The option is we have to act and we have to act right and we need \nto do so quickly so we do not have this further impacting people in a \nnegative fashion.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to share that with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first I want to say how proud I am to \nsee Senators on the floor, and others I have spoken to in meetings, \nspeak up on this issue. I particularly commend the former chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Judd Gregg. Senator Gregg, I was chairman \nof the committee when the Resolution Trust Corporation--another one of \nthese where a group of banks, called savings and loans, were going \nbroke and the Federal Government had to step in. I recall having gone \nthrough what you are going through. What is the real value? How much is \nthe real cost?\n  I do laud your statesmanship and your ability to tell it to us the \nway it is. I thank you for it. I recommend you make your expertise \navailable to the Senate because this is not a Republican issue, this is \nan American issue. The facts as you know them are as important to \nDemocrats as they are to us.\n  I commend you for that, and our leader, who made a forceful statement \ntoday that delays are not the order of the day, that something must be \ndone.\n  I talk of this issue--I have spoken two times or three times for at \nleast 10 minutes on the issue and never once in those speeches did I \nmention ``Wall Street'' or ``bailout,'' because I think it is neither. \nIt has nothing to do with either of those. Wall Street is a location. \nAs far as a bailout, this has nothing to do with Wall Street. The \ncredit market of the United States, that which makes money available \nday by day to the people of our country for any and everything--their \ncar, the new car they bought, the house they added on to that they want \nto pay for--anything you want to think of that requires the exchange of \nmoney or the payment of something by a check, all of this requires \nliquidity. It requires that money move. When money is stopped, the \nwhole thing stops.\n  The best that we have in America, the two men representing the \nexecutive branch, I think are as good as we could have. They are \ntelling us they have a way to attack that problem and perhaps come out \nof it without having to spend all the money we put up, that we will let \nthe Treasury Department use to try to buy these assets that are \nstopping up things and take them to the trust corporation and see what \nhappens over time.\n  In the meantime, the money for Americans must be loosened. That is \nthe whole issue. I am glad we are talking about it forthrightly and \nhonestly and that each Senator who has spoken has spoken of the fact \nthat we ought to get this done as soon as possible. Time is hurting \nAmericans, and the longer we wait the more difficult it gets for us to \nget it done.\n  I also laud the two candidates for President. It is no use running \nfor President of the United States if, when you get there, America has \ngone bankrupt or is in the middle of a recession so big that it \napproaches a depression.\n  From my vantage point, things are not going to get better until we do \nsomething rather extraordinary. Two experts have told us what that is. \nThey have a plan. I don't have a plan. I hope other people don't have \nplans. I hope we build on the plan submitted to us.\n  With that, I will yield the floor. Once again, I thank Senators who \nhave had the courage and the will to understand that this is a big \nAmerican problem requiring big actors who are not worried about their \nreelection but worried about America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, late last night, about 11:30 p.m., I \nreceived an e-mail on my BlackBerry from my fellow Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Obama. He said he needed to talk to me. I called him \nthis morning, reached him at about 8 a.m. this morning, and we had a \nconversation. He said: I am going to call Senator McCain and I am going \nto suggest to him that we both come out with a joint statement saying \nthat Congress should respond as quickly as possible to deal with the \neconomic challenges facing the United States and that we should find a \nsolution which includes four basic principles: makes certain there is \ntransparency there so we know there are conflicts of interest, that \nthey will be dealt with;\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\n  Make certain you protect the taxpayers, give a helping hand to the \nhomeowners facing foreclosure, and do something about the issue of \nexecutive compensation.\n  He said: I have said these publicly. Senator McCain has said these \npublicly. I think it would be a healthy thing for the American \npolitical scene and the economy for us to depoliticize this situation, \nto take the partisan politics out of it, and to issue this joint \nstatement. He asked me for my reaction, and I said I thought it was a \ngood idea.\n  At 9 o'clock this morning, Senator Obama made that call to Senator \nMcCain, and Senator McCain returned the call at 12:30, a few hours \nlater. I think they have issued that statement, and it is a positive \none. It puts in perspective the seriousness of the challenge we face \nand establishes core principles we should follow to try to resolve it.\n  Other things have happened since. There has been a suggestion by \nSenator McCain that he is going to suspend his Presidential campaign \nand come back to Washington. He can make that decision if he chooses \nto, but I think the honest answer is, he will be bringing the \nPresidential campaign with him to Washington. I am not sure that is \ngoing to help create a positive bipartisan or nonpartisan atmosphere to \nsolve the problem.\n  I think we understand what faces us here, the challenges we face. I \nthink we also understand that it is best for us to meet in serious--\nmaybe even behind doors--closed-door meetings, and come up with a plan \nthat is bipartisan, that the administration agrees with and a majority \nin Congress will agree with on a bipartisan basis. I think we should go \nforward.\n  During the course of the last statement by several of my Republican \ncolleagues, two of them came over to say to me: This really isn't \npolitical; we really think we need to work to find a solution. I \ncouldn't agree more. We need to work to find a solution, and a good \none.\n  Let's remember where we are. It hasn't been 72 hours since we have \nseen the administration's proposal giving the Secretary of the Treasury \n$700 billion--more money than ever allocated in the history of our \nRepublic--with virtually no strings attached. There are many of us who \nthink we need to be more careful--we need to be decisive, but we need \nto be thoughtful as well. I heard Senator Dodd, as chairman of the \nBanking Committee, say: Speed is important, but getting it right is \nmore important. And I think he is correct. We need to stick with this, \nroll our sleeves up, and try to find an answer.\n  I will tell you, we do it in a very highly charged political \natmosphere. I have spoken to my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, \nwhose e-mail and phone responses to the bailout proposal Secretary \nPaulson has brought forward are overwhelmingly negative. It is a \ncharged political atmosphere. Bringing a Presidential campaign into \nthis atmosphere is not going to make it easier or more likely that it \nwill come to a good ending.\n  I think we need to do this in a thoughtful, quiet, and sensible way. \nI think the joint statement by Senator Obama and Senator McCain set the \nright tone, depoliticizing it at the Presidential level, and now we \nneed to roll up our sleeves and go to work. Bringing all of the lights \nand cameras to Capitol Hill, bringing the Presidential campaign here is \ncertainly not going to be the answer.\n  I also remember that we have one of the most important events before \nus this Friday night: the first Presidential campaign debate. I think \nthese debates will be widely followed by Americans across the board, \nwho will measure the major candidates and make their decisions. The \nAmerican people are entitled to that, and we need to move forward to \nmake certain those debates take place so that at the Presidential and \nVice Presidential level voters can take their measure of the \ncandidates.\n  But now we need to roll up our sleeves here as Members of Congress \nand the Senate and work to find this bipartisan answer. I hope we can \ndo that, and I hope we follow the four principles which Senator McCain \nand Senator Obama announced today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9387-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I would like to follow on with the assistant majority \nleader's comments and say that I agree that we need to gather to solve \nthis problem. And I sense, from the administration and in 5 hours of \nbanking hearings yesterday and phone conversations I have had \nthroughout the evening last night and today, I sense a willingness to \nalter the plan in such a manner that accountability, that those kinds \nof things, oversight and other matters we want to address are \naddressed.\n  What I would say to the assistant majority leader and to others who \nwant to see something happen is, let's work through the weekend. Let's \nnot have some artificial deadline of leaving here Friday until we get \nit right.\n  I think there has to be a structure that comes together very soon \nthat allows both the House and the Senate to be negotiating together. I \nthink the worst that could come out would be for one body to send to \nanother body a message and then that be the vote. The assistant \nmajority leader and others who are in the leadership here, I hope what \nyou will do is bring us together as two bodies to try to solve this \nextraordinary problem together.\n  I have a lot of people in Tennessee who are very frustrated with what \nhas happened on Wall Street. I understand that frustration. I realize \nthere have been lots of excesses there that need to be punished and \npenalized, but the fact is that Wall Street is inextricably tied to \nMain Street.\n  I am also getting calls throughout the State of Tennessee from \nbusinesses, from people involved in small businesses, people who are \ninvolved in household issues, who are having very difficult issues with \ngetting credit.\n  So what I would say is, look, I think all of us agree that something \nneeds to occur. I think all of us agree that something drastic needs to \noccur in order to jolt this system. There is a lot of debate over what \nis the right and wrong thing to do, but I believe we as a body should \nbe responsible. I believe we should come together as two bodies, with \nthe leadership of both bodies working together to try to get this \nlegislation right.\n  The hearings that are taking place today in the House have been most \nilluminating. The 5-hour session we had yesterday in Banking was most \nilluminating. Most of us have been able to spend time with Chairman \nBernanke and Secretary Paulson to talk through this issue.\n  One of the responsibilities and privileges we have here in the Senate \nis that we have access to information most people throughout the \ncountry do not have access to. People ask us to make judgments, to use \nthe wisdom we garner from talking to these people to try to do the \nright thing for our country, and I hope that sometime between now and \nSunday we will come together, solve this problem, do so in a way that \nis prudent for our country, that protects our taxpayers but at the same \ntime causes the financial system in our country to operate as it \nshould.\n  I want to mention one other thing. If we do this correctly, which is \nwhat I have been trying to encourage--I know the President has done the \nsame thing in hearings yesterday--if we do this correctly, the money, \nwhatever money that is expended, is actually something that is an \ninvestment. These securities Secretary Paulson is talking about \ninvesting in have a market value. If they can set up a mechanism to buy \nthese at proper value, the taxpayers will, in fact, have a return.\n  I believe that whatever we do is not going to be 100 percent correct. \nWe will make mistakes. We will look back on whatever it is we pass in \nthe next week or so and we will realize we had some issues that were \nnot dealt with properly. But I do think it is incumbent upon us to work \nuntil this is done.\n  I think the markets are watching us. I think actually that while we \nmight have taken another week or two to solve this problem, an \nartificial line has been drawn in the sand for this\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nweekend because the markets now expect us to do something. And I want \nto say to the assistant leader, to our minority leader, and to others \nwho have been on the floor that I certainly stand ready and available \nto work with others, to work with people on both sides of the aisle and \nin both bodies to make sure we solve this problem, we solve it \nprudently, and we do so in a timeframe that allows our financial \nmarkets to get back to somewhat normal operations as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9388-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about some \nof our departing colleagues who will not be joining us for the next \nsession of Congress. They are great colleagues, people whom I have \nenjoyed working with in my 3\\1/2\\ years here in the Senate. They \ninclude Senator Allard from Colorado, Senator Pete Domenici from New \nMexico, Senator John Warner from Virginia, Senator Chuck Hagel from \nNebraska, and Senator Larry Craig from Idaho.\n  A quick word first about my colleague and the senior Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Wayne Allard. He has served the State of Colorado with \ndistinction. In the days before he came to the Senate, now almost 12 \nyears ago, he also served the people of the State of Colorado in the \ngeneral assembly. I had the opportunity then to watch him work on \nmatters ranging from education to protecting-the-water issues in the \nState of Colorado. I know well that he has been a strong voice for the \nState of Colorado and know that his services here, including the \nservices of his acting as a veterinarian for colleagues like Senator \nKennedy and his dogs, are something that will be missed. I have enjoyed \nvery much the time I have spent working with him on matters of mutual \nand common interest to the State of Colorado. I wish him well.\n  Pete Domenici from New Mexico, the senior Senator from New Mexico, is \none of the Senators here who comes from the same place my family came \nfrom many generations ago.\n  His constant reminding me of the beauty of the Land of Enchantment \nand his work on behalf of securing an energy future for America is \nsecond to none. We will be missing him also in terms of his major \ncontributions to the Energy Committee. He also has done a lot with \nrespect to a whole host of other issues, too many to mention, but in \nparticular I want to mention his work on the mental health parity \ninitiative which would not have happened without his leadership. We \nwere successful in getting mental health parity in legislation we \npassed in the Senate yesterday, and it was in large part because of his \npassion and willingness to work hard on a bipartisan basis to bring \npeople together to help create that achievement.\n  I want to say a word about my very good friend, Senator John Warner \nof Virginia. I often call him Moses because, as we have debated on the \nfloor of the Senate over the last several years on one of the major \nissues of our time, the issue of war and peace and how we create a \nframework for a more peaceful world for our generation and those to \ncome, it has often been Senator Warner we have gone to to get direction \nand counsel on how we might move forward. I had the opportunity of \ntraveling with him to Iraq and Afghanistan and other places along with \nhis very good friend, Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. The friendship between the two of them, between Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner, is one that exemplifies the types of \nrelationships that are important for this Chamber and for the good of \nAmerica. I will miss my good friend, Senator John Warner, the man I \ncall Moses, because of his willingness to try to bring people together \nto try to resolve major and difficult issues that face us in America.\n  Senator Chuck Hagel from Nebraska has likewise been one of those \nvoices of independence, putting public purpose above partisanship and \nbeing a great example for all of us in doing so. He has some deep \nconnections in Colorado, including his sister Claire who lives in \nColorado, and his family whom I have met over time. Even though he \nteases me occasionally on the battleground between Nebraska and \nColorado with respect to the Nebraska Cornhuskers and the University of \nColorado Buffaloes, he has done a remarkable service in the Senate as a \ngreat Senator and someone whom I will sorely miss.\n  Finally, Senator Larry Craig from Idaho has been a champion for \nagriculture and rural issues and for western values. When, yesterday, \nwe were able to pass the payment in lieu of taxes, secure rural schools \nact, on which Senator Wyden and others had worked so hard, it was \nSenator Craig who helped make sure at the beginning that payment in \nlieu of taxes, which is so important to the Presiding Officer's State \nand my State of Colorado, were, in fact, on the radar screen of \nWashington, DC. Sometimes those issues that are unique to the western \npart of the United States are not heard in the Halls in this Capitol. \nSenator Craig was an unrelenting advocate for making sure those western \nissues were, in fact, not forgotten by those of us who are here who \nhave an ability to cast a vote.\n  I will miss my five colleagues. All of them are Republicans who are \ndeparting. Many of them brought a true spirit of bipartisanship and \nworking together, which is worthy of the emulation of many Members of \nthe Senate who will serve in this Chamber in the next Congress and in \nmany Congresses to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9388-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9388-S9389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1315\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay \nbefore the Senate a message from the House on S. 1315, the Veterans \nBenefits Enhancement Act; that the Senate disagree with the House \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Reserving the right to object, I ask my distinguished \nfriend, the chairman, a question. It is my understanding that included \nin the fiscal year 2009 VA appropriations conference agreement is \nlanguage denying the use of appropriated dollars putting into effect a \nrepeal of the Hartness v. Nicholson decision. That is an agreement that \nhas already been made.\n  As the chairman knows, this is the offset that is used in S. 1315 in \norder to fund all the entitlement spending in the bill for Filipino \nveterans. My question to him is, what is the point in us going to \nconference on a bill if the only available offsets have been pulled off \nthe table from the standpoint of us using them in S. 1315?\n  Mr. AKAKA. As my friend and colleague knows, the appropriations \nmeasure is not yet law. And even if it were, there are various options \navailable to the Veterans' Affairs Committee. So I urge my colleague to \njoin me in seeking a conference on S. 1315. Together we can decide how \nour committee and the authorizing committee in the House can deal with \nthe concern about the Hartness case.\n  Mr. BURR. Continuing my reservation of objection, it seems to me that \nany conference wouldn't move because it would not meet pay-go. The pay-\ngo compliance doesn't exist. It doesn't make sense to proceed to a \nconference. The chairman and I had a lengthy debate as it related to \nthis benefit. It disturbs me that we are on the floor of the Senate \nonce again talking about the benefit at a time when we are talking \nabout a financial crisis. It is also my understanding that the House \ncontinuing resolution will have $200 million that goes to the benefits \nof Filipino veterans with money that has been pulled from somewhere yet \nunknown.\n  So with all the respect that I have for the chairman, I object at \nthis time\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\nto moving to conference for the simple reason that this issue will be \nresolved a different way, but, more importantly, pertinent to S. 1315 \nthe mechanism is already in place that takes away the funds that are \nused to fund this expansion in S. 1315.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am disappointed and somewhat surprised \nthat objection has been made on this motion. I must tell my colleagues \nthat I have deep respect for my friend and colleague and my ranking \nmember. I respectfully say that this objection is one that disappoints \nme, but it has been made to this motion. The intent of the motion is to \ncreate a mechanism by which there might be further action on this very \nimportant veterans legislation before the Congress goes into recess.\n  Last week, when I sought a UC with reference to this legislation, I \ndid so by seeking to utilize an unrelated House bill as a vehicle to \ncreate a conference. In objecting to that approach, the Senator from \nIdaho said my approach was a tactic he hoped we would not use to \naddress this important issue. He objected. While I did not agree that \nthis tactic was inappropriate, given the lack of action in the House on \nS. 1315 at the time, I recognized the merits of the Senator's position.\n  Now, however, the motion is to use the same bill, S. 1315, as passed \nby both Houses. That is, in fact, the normal process, the regular order \nfor resolving differences between the Houses. I addressed the Senator's \nconcerns and am disappointed to see his Republican colleague objecting. \nI wish to remind my colleagues this bill passed the Senate by a vote of \n96 to 1. Surely there must be some willingness to stand by the Senate \nposition, to validate the Senate's action.\n  As I noted last week, this bill would improve benefits and services \nfor veterans, both young and old. There are many provisions that \naddress a broad range of veterans benefits. This bill deserves to be \nresolved and brought to a final vote. I realize there is some \nopposition to the provision which allows this legislation to meet pay-\ngo requirements through the legislative reversal of a case known as \nHartness.\n  According to the one veterans organization that has expressed its \nopposition, the concern is not over the merits of the court decision. \nThey simply oppose this effort to correct a mistake. The court's \ndecision resulted in veterans receiving an extra pension benefit based \nsolely on their age. This is not what Congress intended. I have not \nseen any analysis of the legislative history that supports that result.\n  The purpose of the provision in S. 1315 is simply to restore the law \nto what it was supposed to be. Those who have characterized it as an \nattempt to withdraw benefits from deserving veterans and grant them to \nundeserving veterans are simply not fairly describing the legislation. \nThe Hartness decision is wrong and should be overturned. How the \nsavings of that action are treated is a fair subject for debate, and I \nbelieve we should have that discussion in the context of a conference \nbetween the two Veterans' Affairs Committees. I again ask, as I did \nlast week, that the Senator, or Senators, who object to this request to \nset up a conference with the House advise me of the concerns and see if \nit might be possible to find a way forward. I am very committed to this \nlegislation and would like to see if we can reach final action before \nwe recess. If we are not able to do so, I intend to renew my efforts in \nthe next Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Let me add for purposes of my colleagues \nthat all the benefits incorporated in S. 1315 that do not have \nmandatory spending implications have been negotiated between the House \nand the Senate and are part of another benefits package that I hope \nwill move through the Congress. If there were a conference on S. 1315, \nthe conference would be about only mandatory spending provisions, \nincluding mandatory spending for Filipino veterans. The chairman and I \nhave debated this in public, and we are on two different ends. We have \ndone that with civility and I have tried to do it and he has tried to \ndo it with passion and with facts.\n  At the end of the day, I will lose. There will be a special pension \nthat is created out of the continuing resolution. It will be funded \nwith money that is pulled out of the sky, which we do regularly in \nWashington.\n  The House has spoken about the Hartness decision and the fact that \nthey did not want to use that money. I think my chairman will get the \nbenefit he is looking for in the continuing resolution. But for the \npurposes of those things that affect our veterans that do not require \nan offset, we did not wait to see the outcome of this bill. We have sat \ndown and negotiated with the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nRepublican and Democrat. We have put those additional benefits for our \nveterans into a benefits package that I feel certain will pass by \nunanimous consent.\n  So there is still a disagreement the chairman and I have relative to \nthis new special pension. But at the end of the day, there will be one, \nassuming there is a continuing resolution, that is passed. It will not \nbe funded out of the Hartness, which is the preference of the House. As \na matter of fact, it will not be funded at all. We will pull it out of \nwhere we typically pull money, and that is the pockets of future \ngenerations of American people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9389-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize one of our Nation's heroes from World War II. I am proud to \nsay that he is a resident of my home State of Kentucky. His name is \nRalph Rose. Mr. Rose is being honored in a Veterans Day ceremony in \nHardinsburg, KY, this November for his heroic action in defense of our \nNation and for his continued service to veterans in the local \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Rose was born in Mystic, KY, in 1922. He entered the U.S. \nmilitary at age 20. During his time in the Armed Forces, Mr. Rose \nserved in General Patton's Army and fought the Germans in France. But \non a fateful night, Mr. Rose and several of his fellow soldiers were \ncaptured by Axis forces. He was held as a prisoner of war for more than \n8 months until the Allies occupied Munich.\n  Mr. Rose suffered unimaginable hardships at the hands of the enemy, \nbut by all accounts, he does not dwell on them. In fact, he has said \nthat if given the choice to serve in the Army again--even knowing what \nhe would have to endure as a prisoner of war--he would have done the \nsame thing.\n  As a true testament to his dedication to the Armed Forces, Mr. Rose \ncontinues to serve his country by helping and inspiring other veterans \nin the Commonwealth.\n  There is a special flag that honors our American heroes like Mr. \nRose. It is called the Prisoner of War/Missing in Action flag, and it \nhas a simple statement at the bottom: ``You are not forgotten.'' Just \nas surely as that flag sits outside my office each day, I can guarantee \nyou that those whose lives have been touched by Mr. Rose will never \nforget the sacrifices he made to keep our Nation free and prosperous.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9389-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9389-S9391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE 3RD BATTALION, 320TH FIELD ARTILLERY REGIMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would like to take a brief moment \nto recognize the men and women of the 3rd Battalion, 320th Field \nArtillery Regiment and its subordinate units. The battalion has been \nassigned to Fort Campbell since 1986. Since then, it has been deployed \nin support of various military operations around the world--including \nits current mission in support of the global war on terror.\n  In November, the members of the 3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery \nwill return home to Fort Campbell, to their\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\neager families and to a grateful Nation after 15 long months in Iraq. \nDuring their deployment, these brave Americans fought our enemies in \none of the most dangerous sectors of southern Baghdad. They also spent \nmonths training their Iraqi Army counterparts so that one day Iraq may \nbe able to enjoy the same security we have here at home.\n  Freedom is something many of us take for granted. Not so for the \nmembers of the 3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery, who have defended \nfreedom by enduring great hardship. The same is true of their families, \nwho have also sacrificed for freedom with sleepless nights and fear for \nthe safety of their loved ones. As Americans, we are forever indebted \nto those in the military community who have given so much to protect \nour liberty and our way of life. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthanking the men and women of the 3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery \nfor their heroic service and in welcoming them back home.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have the names of these brave \nAmericans printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sgt Shane Michael Adams; 1Lt Nicholas Lawrence Albright; \n     Sfc Bradley William Amstutz; Sfc Michael David Andrews; Spc \n     Harold Gene Barnes III; Spc Robert Carlton Beardsley; Ssg \n     Philip John Belmont; Sgt David Frank Benoit, Jr.; Sfc Shaun \n     Edward Benoit; Maj Carl Lawrence Bergmann; Pfc Joshua Keith \n     Brakefield; Sgt Robert James Bronson; Sgt James Deon Brown; \n     Ssg Marco Maurice Brown; Cpl Jeremy Thomas Burch; Spc Steven \n     Henry Burtis; Cpt Jose F.

Madam President, as you know, the Defense \nauthorization bill passed the Senate last week. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I filed an amendment to the legislation, which had been \nincluded in the committee managers' package. Unfortunately, due to \nprocedural matters stemming from the Senate majority's decision to \nlimit amendments, my amendment, No. 5415--and many others like it--was \nnot permitted to move forward. Although my amendment was not able to be \nconsidered by the Senate during debate over the Defense bill, I \nnonetheless want to bring the issue underlying the amendment to the \nattention of my colleagues.\n  My amendment was quite simple. It was a sense of the Senate that \nstated that funding for Department of Defense programs involving \ntraumatic brain injury, TBI, and psychological health should be \nincluded in the President's fiscal year 2010 base budget.\n  Typically, the majority of funding for such programs has been \nincluded in supplemental appropriations measures. The reasoning \napparently has been that these programs are a cost of war, and \ntherefore they should be addressed through war supplementals.\n  But TBI and psychological health issues are problems that have been \nwith us for some time and unfortunately are going to be with us for the \nforeseeable future.\n  Military personnel often experience health difficulties owing to TBI \nand psychological injuries long after their combat tour has been \ncompleted. Moreover, it has been reported that as many as one in five \nmilitary personnel returning from Afghanistan and Iraq will suffer from \nTBI. That is a significant percentage of our military, There are \ncurrently nearly 3,000 brave Kentuckians deployed in the war on terror. \nAccording to these projections, close to 600 of these brave men and \nwomen will suffer from TBI. That figure does not even include those who \nhave already returned from theater.\n  Considering the long-term health ramifications of TBI and the large \nnumber of military personnel who will face these challenges, it seems \nto me that this reality ought to be reflected in DOD's long-term \nbaseline budgeting rather than through ad hoc supplementals.\n  My amendment would have put the Senate on record as stating that TBI \nand psychological health issues reflect a long-term budget priority for \nour Nation and should be considered as part of the regular order. I \nbelieve we owe the brave men and women of our military no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9391-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9391-S9392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 NEPAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have closely followed developments in \nNepal for several years, and have been encouraged by the progress that \ntiny Himalayan country is making to end a divisive, bloody conflict and \nbecome a more peaceful, just and democratic society.\n  An enormous amount of work remains to be done, including the writing \nof a new constitution, demobilization and reintegration of Maoist \ncombatants, restructuring and reform of the Nepali Army, policies and \nprograms to address the legacy of discrimination against women and \nminority groups, programs of assistance for the millions of \nimpoverished rural Nepali people who are illiterate and lack basic \nservices, and justice for victims of atrocities committed by both sides \nof the conflict.\n  As chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee I have \nincluded additional assistance for Nepal, above the amounts requested \nby the White House, for these efforts, and I commend the U.S. \nAmbassador, Nancy Powell, for the way that she has represented our \ncountry there. The United States has a strong interest in a democratic, \npeaceful Nepal, and although the situation remains fragile and the \nfuture unpredictable, Ambassador Powell and her staff have worked hard \nin an even-handed, diplomatic way to help keep the peace process on \ntrack.\n  I have also urged the leaders of Nepal's political parties, including \nthe Maoists, to put partisan and personal interests aside for the \ngreater good of their country at this critical time in Nepal's history. \nFor too long, politics in Nepal have been equated with cronyism, \ncorruption and neglect. The Nepali people who courageously took to the \nstreets and risked their lives--some of whom lost their lives--to oust \nan abusive monarch, deserve a government that represents them and works \nto address their needs.\n  There are three specific issues I want to mention briefly today. The \nfirst is the treatment of Tibetan refugees in Nepal. There are \ndisturbing reports that the Nepali Government is taking steps to \nforcibly return to China, in violation of international law, Tibetan \nexiles in Nepal, presumably in an effort to curry favor with the \nChinese Government. These people have risked their lives to escape \nChinese repression, and in the past the Nepali Government has, with \nrare exceptions, provided them refuge. The Nepali Government has a \nlegal and moral responsibility to continue to respect the rights of \nTibetan refugees, and this is an issue that the United States and \nothers will be watching closely.\n  The second issue is justice, which is fundamental to any democratic \nsociety, and that means an independent judiciary and the rule of law. \nIn Nepal, government officials who abuse their authority have too often \nescaped justice. Impunity has been the rule, including for members of \nthe Nepali Army and Maoist forces.\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\n  Recently, the Advocacy Forum and Human Rights Watch jointly published \na report entitled ``Waiting for Justice: Unpunished Crimes from Nepal's \nArmed Conflict.'' The report describes the impunity that continues to \nshield those who have been credibly alleged to have violated human \nrights. The report includes a number of recommendations for the Nepali \nGovernment to ensure that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are \nbrought to justice. I urge the Nepali authorities to study the report \nand implement its recommendations. For the rule of law to prevail in \nNepal, it must be demonstrated that human rights crimes are \ninvestigated and prosecuted and that no one is above the law.\n  Finally, I want to mention the issue of the implementation of the \nLeahy amendment in Nepal. This law, which I sponsored a decade ago, \nrequires, among other things, thorough vetting of candidates for U.S. \nmilitary or police training to ensure that they have not been involved \nin violations of human rights. This is important because we do not want \nto afford the benefits and legitimacy of U.S. training to individuals \nwho have engaged in such crimes, and we want to encourage their \ngovernments to bring them to justice. I am concerned with reports that \nthe Leahy amendment is not being adequately implemented in Nepal, and \nthat some Nepali military officers who have been credibly implicated in \nhuman rights violations have been approved for U.S. training. This is a \nmatter that must be effectively addressed by the U.S. Embassy.\n  During the war, the Maoists and the Nepali Army were responsible for \nwidespread atrocities, including arbitrary detention, torture and \nextrajudicial killings. This eventually led to a suspension of U.S. \nmilitary assistance to Nepal. After the collapse of the monarchy and \nthe end of the fighting, that suspension was lifted, but any U.S. \ntraining of Nepali military officers should be conducted with the \nutmost caution and only after thorough vetting.\n  In the past year, the focus has shifted to military reform. The U.S. \ncan assist in this effort, particularly through our expanded \ninternational military education and training program, but we need \nassurance that the Nepali Army command recognizes the need for reform \nand to be accountable under the law.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the key recommendations \nin the Advocacy Forum-Human Rights Watch report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Waiting for Justice: Unpunished Crimes From Nepal's Armed Conflict\n\n\n                          Key Recommendations\n\n       The new government of Nepal needs to ensure that \n     perpetrators of grave human rights violations are brought to \n     justice. Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum call on the \n     Nepali government to:\n       Vigorously investigate and prosecute all persons \n     responsible for abuses, including members of the security \n     forces, in the 49 FIR cases highlighted in this report, as \n     well as other cases of human rights violations.\n       Suspend all security forces personnel named in the 49 FIRs, \n     or in other complaints, against whom there is prima facie \n     evidence of criminal activity until the investigations and \n     any prosecutions are complete.\n       Reform the criminal justice system, including by reviewing \n     the role of the Nepal Police and Attorney General's Office to \n     improve their effectiveness in investigations of serious \n     crimes.\n       Criminalize ``disappearances'' and torture--whether \n     committed by the security forces, Maoists or other actors--\n     and ensure these offenses when committed by the army will be \n     subject to investigation and prosecution by civilian \n     authorities and courts.\n       Amend the Police Act, Army Act, and Public Security Act to \n     remove all provisions that grant security forces and \n     government official's immunity from prosecution for criminal \n     acts.\n       Establish an independent, external oversight body for the \n     Nepal Police.\n       Strengthen the NHRC by giving it the necessary powers to \n     carry out credible investigations, including the power to \n     require the attendance of witnesses and the production of \n     evidence. The government should ensure that all the NHRC \n     recommendations are speedily implemented by the relevant \n     state authorities. The NHRC should be given clear powers to \n     refer cases for prosecution and to seek legal redress against \n     unlawful acts by state authorities.\n       Establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission that does \n     not grant amnesty for serious human rights abuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9392-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9392-S9396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LATIN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to report on \na trip I made to Latin America during the August recess. Specifically, \nfrom August 17 to 23, I traveled to Mexico and Venezuela to investigate \nconditions relating to national security, immigration and counterdrug \nefforts. I also explored the current state of our diplomatic relations \nwith these two important neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. I last \nvisited both countries in 2005, and I was eager to assess firsthand the \nimpact of recent changes in their domestic political landscapes.\n  On Sunday, August 17, I flew to Mexico City, Mexico. There, I was \ngreeted by Robyn Prinz, a Foreign Service officer from the economic \nsection of our Embassy, who served as my guide in Mexico. That evening, \nI enjoyed a taste of Mexico's rich cultural heritage by attending the \nfamous Ballet Folkloico, a performance of Mexican folk dances, at the \nPalacio de Bellas Artes.\n  On Monday morning, August 18, I began the day by meeting with a large \nteam from our Embassy. Ambassador Antonio Garza was traveling, so the \nEmbassy team was led by Deputy Chief of Mission Leslie Bassett. In \naddition to Ms. Bassett, my meeting included representatives of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, Customs and Border Protection, \nCBP, the Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, the Defense Attache Office, the \nU.S. Agency for International Development, and the Department of \nJustice. I explained to the group my interest in learning about current \nefforts to combat drug trafficking and the attendant violence in Mexico \nand the extent to which U.S. aid can be of assistance in tackling these \nproblems. In particular, I inquired about the likely impact of the \nMerida Initiative, a multiyear proposal to provide funding to Latin \nAmerican countries to support counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and \nborder security efforts, as well as programs designed to build \naccountable public institutions and ensure the rule of law. Earlier \nthis year Congress approved the initial sum of $400 million for Mexico \nand $65 million for Central America, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. \nFinally, I asked our representatives in Mexico about Mexican efforts to \nstem the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States.\n  According to Ms. Bassett, in the 18 months since he was elected, \nMexican President Felipe Calderon of the center-right Partido Accion \nNacional, PAN, has moved quickly to bolster law enforcement and \ncounterdrug efforts. He has also launched economic reforms intended to \nmake Mexico more attractive to Mexicans. Ms. Bassett further noted the \nimportance of our bilateral trade with Mexico. She pointed out that \nMexico is now the third largest trading partner of the United States. \nAnd, as transportation costs continue to rise, trade between Mexico and \nthe Unites States will likely become even more important.\n  David Gaddis, the regional director for DEA in Mexico, explained that \nPresident Calderon's efforts to combat drug traffickers have been \ncostly for Mexico--not only in terms of enhanced resources but also in \nterms of lives lost. The press has taken note of this unfortunate \nreality. In June 2008, the New York Times wrote, ``[s]ince Mr. Calderon \ncame to office in December 2006, he has sent thousands of federal \npolice officers and troops to reclaim cities and states where [drug] \ntraffickers controlled local officials through bribes and threats. The \noffensive has unleashed a war among different cartels that has killed \nmore than 4,000 people, among them about 450 soldiers, police officers \nand public officials.'' Nevertheless, according to Agent Gaddis, Mexico \nhas achieved significant successes against the traffickers, arresting \nkey leaders and extraditing many of them to the United States to stand \ntrial. The DEA has also seen large improvements in the level of \ninformation sharing and cooperation from Mexican officials. This \ninteraction directly benefits the United States because the major \ncartels in Mexico can be tied directly to drug traffickers in the \nUnited States. To drive home this point, Agent Gaddis provided a map \nshowing cases in every state with links to Mexican drug trafficking \norganizations.\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\n  As the assembled agency representatives noted, of course, the drug \nproblem is not a one-way street. High demand for illegal drugs within \nthe United States fuels much of the drug trade. And, just as drugs are \nsmuggled into the United States, weapons and money are increasingly \nbeing smuggled into Mexico from our country. By some estimates, more \nthan 90 percent of the weapons being used by Mexican drug traffickers \noriginate in the United States. Erik Moncayo, the CBP attache in \nMexico, pointed out that the United States has been far more focused on \ncontraband, hazardous materials, and persons entering the country than \nthose leaving it for Mexico. As a result, bulk cash shipments totaling \nmore than $12 billion are reportedly smuggled into Mexico annually. \nAmong other things, these illegal proceeds are used to pay off corrupt \npolice and public officials.\n  Although the Mexican Government has begun to implement new legal \nreforms, including a shift away from a confession-driven judicial \nsystem to one that places a greater emphasis on other evidence, \ncorruption is still a major problem in Mexico--especially among the \nranks of the local police. This breeds mistrust of the very officials \nwho should be relied upon by the public to keep them safe. This \nmistrust was illustrated in a tragic case that occurred shortly before \nmy arrival in Mexico and which was mentioned in nearly every meeting I \nhad there.\n\n  In June 2008, the 14-year-old son of a wealthy family--the founders \nof a chain of sporting goods stores--was kidnapped and held for ransom. \nRather than call the police, however, the family reportedly hired a \nprivate negotiator to deal directly with the kidnappers. Then, after \nthey had paid millions of dollars in ransom money, their son's body was \nfound in the trunk of a stolen car abandoned in Mexico City. This \ntragic case, and the deep mistrust of the police it reveals, \nunderscores the serious challenge faced by President Calderon and his \nadministration as they seek to reform Mexico's criminal justice system.\n  On the illegal immigration front, Ms. Bassett noted that there had \nbeen a decrease in illegal immigration from Mexico, but she \nacknowledged that the causes could range from a weakened U.S. economy \nto enhanced border security to increased opportunities in Mexico, or \nsome combination of these factors. Mr. Moncayo, the CBP representative, \nhighlighted a successful joint operation with Mexican officials--dubbed \nthe Oasis program--under which more than 800 cases involving alien \nsmugglers have been prosecuted by Mexico during the last 3 years, using \nevidence collected in part by U.S. authorities, with a nearly 98 \npercent conviction rate.\n  In response to my question about Mexico's willingness to accept \ncriminal aliens being deported by the United States, Ms. Bassett said \nthat Mexico actively cooperates with such repatriation efforts. I was \npleased to hear this news because I have been particularly concerned \nabout the refusal by some countries to accept their nationals back \nafter they have served criminal sentences in the United States and been \nordered deported.\n  Later on August 18, I met with Mexico's Secretary of Public Security, \nGenero Garcia Luna. Secretary Luna is charged with the daunting task of \nreforming Mexico's federal police force and forging new, cooperative \narrangements with the country's state and local police. A July 13, 2008 \nprofile in the New York Times Magazine notes that ``Garcia Luna \ncultivates the image of a cop in a world of politicians, a doer in a \nworld of talkers.'' The article also quotes a security analyst as \nsaying that Secretary Luna has ``the hardest job in the country.''\n  I found the Secretary to be sincere and enthusiastic about his \nmission. He described ongoing efforts to improve police pay, regulate \nthe requirements for new recruits, and require comprehensive ``trust'' \ncenters--akin to community policing centers--for citizens to interact \nwith police and prosecutors in the states and localities. He also \nfocused on the need to stem the tide of illegal weapons entering Mexico \nfrom the United States.\n  Secretary Luna represented that more than 95 percent of the firearms \nused by Mexican criminals come from the United States. He said that, in \nthe first 2 years of the Calderon administration, approximately 20,000 \nhigh-caliber weapons have been seized by Mexican law enforcement. While \nacknowledging the value of assistance from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, in tracing the origins of such \nweapons, Secretary Luna urged a crackdown on retailers along the \nsouthwest border selling weapons for export to Mexico.\n  With respect to the recent, high-profile kidnapping and murder of a \n14-year-old boy, Secretary Luna noted that kidnapping is not a federal \noffense in Mexico; a fact that limits his ability to investigate such \ncases. I cited the 1932 kidnapping and murder of the young son of \naviator Charles Lindbergh as the catalyst for making kidnapping a \nFederal offense in the United States and suggested that Mexico may have \nreached a similar moment in its legal evolution. The Secretary agreed \nand said that members of the administration planned to meet with \nlegislators later in the week to consider such a change.\n  Although somewhat outside his jurisdiction, I asked the Secretary for \nhis views on the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nNAFTA, on security matters and the standard of living in Mexico. I also \nasked about his department's cooperation with other countries to combat \ndrug trafficking, particularly Colombia, Venezuela, and Cuba. Secretary \nLuna said that he thought NAFTA had been very important for job \ncreation in Mexico, with incidental benefits for security. With respect \nto international cooperation on drugs, he said that cooperation with \nColombia was very good. He said that the cooperation with Venezuela and \nCuba was more difficult but noted that they had worked collaboratively \nthrough third-party organizations. For example, he cited cooperation \nwith Venezuela through Interpol.\n  I further inquired about Mexico's cooperation with the United States \non terrorism matters. Secretary Luna was very positive about the level \nof cooperation. He said, for example, there was an active effort to \npreempt potential terrorists from the Middle East from seeking entry \ninto the United States via Mexico.\n  Following my meeting with Secretary Luna, I met with Mexico's \nAttorney General, Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza. I had met the Attorney \nGeneral during my last visit to Mexico, when he was serving as the \nDirector of the Center for National Security Investigations, Mexico's \nequivalent of the CIA. Once again, I found him to be \narticulate, intelligent and dedicated to public service--though he also \nhas a strong background in the private sector and brings a business \nperson's pragmatism to the work of government.\n\n  The Attorney General described his department's current relationship \nwith U.S. law enforcement and our Justice Department as the ``best \never'' in his considerable experience. He said that, through joint \noperations, we have succeeded in challenging and disrupting the key \ndrug cartels, which are now more fragmented than ever. He conceded, \nhowever, that we have not yet succeeded in significantly reducing the \ntotal output of drugs. He then focused on some of the concerns that had \nbeen discussed in my earlier meetings, particularly the smuggling of \nguns and bulk cash shipments into Mexico.\n  In addition to improved checkpoints for south-bound traffic, the \nAttorney General recommended some other avenues for exploration. For \nexample, he noted that approximately half of the cash shipments \nsmuggled into Mexico consisted of large-denominations, like $100 bills. \nThis suggests that the smugglers may have some contact with U.S. \nfinancial institutions, which may provide another avenue for \ninvestigation and interdiction. Further, the Attorney General said that \nmost of the weapons shipped into Mexico were purchased by ``straw'' \nbuyers, who were paid a fee for essentially renting their \nidentification to the true purchasers--a practice that might be \nsubjected to limitations without infringing on the second amendment.\n  On the issue of immigration, the Attorney General offered a thought-\nprovoking demographic analysis of the subject. First, he acknowledged \nthat the United States has the most vibrant economy in the world, \nsupported by a host of desirable factors including the\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nrule of law the ability to innovate and profit from innovation; labor \nflexibility and mobility; and the ability to shift assets from one \nsector of the economy to another through the financial markets. \nNevertheless, he argued that the United States simply does not produce \nenough humans to keep up with its economic growth. And, although \nconcerns about illegal immigration may currently be focused on Mexico, \nthe Attorney General further argued that--within just 15 years--Mexico \nwon't be able to supply much labor to the United States because \nMexico's labor force peaked in 2006 and is now growing at a rate of \nless than 1.4 percent. Indeed, Attorney General Medina-Mora suggested \nthat the whole world may face a labor shortage within a generation, due \nto falling population rates across much of the globe. In contrast to \nyears past, the Attorney General also said that today's migrants are \nnot uneducated peasants but workers with an average of 9 years of \neducation and sought-after skills.\n  I asked the Attorney General for his views on the value of dialog \nwith other nations, even dialog with adversaries. He agreed that dialog \nis critical. With respect to my trip to Venezuela, Attorney General \nMedina-Mora said that isolating Venezuela would be the worst way to \ndeal with the country. He said that Cuba ought to serve as an important \nlesson; namely, that isolation can actually help a disfavored regime to \nsustain itself. Of course, it would be naive to think that dialog is a \nsilver bullet. In fact, at the time of our meeting, the Attorney \nGeneral still appeared hopeful that dialog would ensure fair \ncompensation for a Mexican-owned cement company that Venezuela was \nseeking to nationalize. As we later learned, however, efforts to engage \nthe Venezuelan Government on this subject failed to prevent Venezuela's \nexpropriation of the Mexican company by threat of force or at least \nunder the supervision of national guard troops. Nevertheless, I believe \nthat, over time, dialog often produces better results than heated \nrhetoric and posturing.\n  On Tuesday, August 19, following a brief tour of the beautifully \nrestored Chapultepec Castle overlooking Mexico City, I departed for \nCaracas, Venezuela. Upon arrival in Caracas, I was welcomed by our \nAmbassador there, Patrick Duddy, and the Control Officer for my visit, \nEvan Owen. Due to a traffic accident, our trip from the airport to the \nAmbassador's residence turned into a tour of relatively impoverished \nenclaves perched on the steep slopes of a twisting mountain road. By \nthe time we reached our destination, it was nearly midnight.\n  On Wednesday, August 20, I began my day with a briefing from \nAmbassador Duddy and key members of his Embassy team. They provided an \noverview of significant developments in Venezuela since my last visit \nin 2005. Perhaps most significantly, President Hugo Chavez lost a \nConstitutional Referendum in December 2007 that would have further \nconsolidated his power, despite publicly characterizing the vote as a \nchoice between himself and President George Bush. Now, as the New York \nTimes reported on August 6, 2008, President Chavez is ``using his \ndecree powers to enact a set of [26] socialist-inspired measures that \nseem based on a package of constitutional changes that voters rejected \nlast year.''\n  Among other things, these decrees create new regional officers, \nappointed by the government, who could help President Chavez to retain \ninfluence in states and localities even if his party loses upcoming \nstate and local elections. Similarly, the decrees elevate the status of \na new militia force that reports directly to the President, making it \nco-equal with the traditional branches of the military services, which \nfacilitated a short-lived coup against President Chavez in 2002. \nAccording to the August 6, 2008, Wall Street Journal, ``Mr. Chavez said \nthat if anyone didn't approve of the laws, they could file for a \nchallenge with the supreme court. But critics . . . said that would be \nfutile because six of the seven justices are sympathetic to the \npresident.''\n\n  In another troubling development, Venezuela's Controller General has \nreportedly disqualified nearly 300 individuals from holding appointed \npublic office, or running for elected office, based on central \ngovernment sanctions--but not convictions--for alleged administrative \nirregularities. A number of those who have been disqualified would have \nbeen strong potential opposition candidates for municipal and state \nelections scheduled for November 23, 2008. These elections pose the \nnext major test for both the Chavez administration and the political \nopposition.\n  At the same time, there has been some recent reason for optimism. On \nJuly 5, 2008, Venezuela's Independence Day, President Chavez publicly \napproached Ambassador Duddy and expressed a desire to renew antidrug \ncooperation with the United States. Among other things, President \nChavez recalled how he had met several times with John Maisto, the U.S. \nAmbassador to Venezuela from 1997 to 2000. According to press accounts \nof the overture, President Chavez also mentioned the upcoming U.S. \nPresidential elections and commented, ``whoever wins, we should be able \nto sit down and converse. I did this with Clinton, we sat down to \ntalk.''\n  I was particularly heartened by the prospect of renewed cooperation \non drugs because I had pushed for such collaboration between our \ncountries during my visit in 2005. I even took the somewhat \nextraordinary step of asking then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \nto consider ``a moratorium on adverse comments on Venezuela'' because I \nbelieved his harsh rhetoric about President Chavez at the time was \ncounterproductive. With respect to the most recent overtures from \nPresident Chavez, however, it remains somewhat unclear whether he is \nprepared to match his positive words with meaningful actions.\n  Following my meeting with the Ambassador and his team, I accompanied \nhim to the U.S. Embassy for further briefings on drug trafficking and \nnational security issues. With regard to the drug issues, I met with \nmembers of the U.S. Embassy's law enforcement team. By way of \nbackground, in September 2007, President Bush issued a determination \nthat Venezuela, for the third year in a row, had failed demonstrably \nover the previous 12 months to adhere to its obligations under \ninternational counternarcotics agreements. In a September 17, 2007, \nreport, State Department officials maintained that, although Venezuela \nindicated that it had developed some new programs to fight drug \ntrafficking and were making seizures, its efforts continued to be \nlimited.\n  Given this backdrop, I asked the representatives of the law \nenforcement team in Caracas about recent reports suggesting that \nVenezuela had further increased its drug seizures and begun a campaign \nto bomb clandestine airstrips in the Venezuelan jungle being used by \nColombian drug traffickers. Those present reported that the flow of \ndrugs through Venezuela had increased dramatically, making the new \nseizures a smaller percentage of the whole. They also questioned the \nvalue of bombing dirt airstrips that could be quickly reconstituted. \nMoreover, the Government's claims with regard to such airstrips \narguably served to confirm the importance of Venezuela as a \ntransshipment point for drugs from Colombia being sent to the United \nStates and the need for further cooperation.\n  The group identified several modest steps that President Chavez could \ntake to demonstrate his commitment to re-building cooperation on \ncounter-drug efforts: No. 1, reiterate to his people what he said to \nAmbassador Duddy; No. 2, designate clear points-of-contact in \nVenezuela's counterdrug agencies for their U.S. counterparts; No. 3, \napprove seven pending applications for visas from the DEA; No. 4, give \nDHS access to the airport in Caracas to screen for contraband headed to \nthe United States; No. 5, allow the United States to re-export an x-ray \nmachine intended for scanning cargo at a port but currently sitting \nunused; and No. 6, permit effective cooperation between U.S. officials \nand the Intelligence Unit of the superintendent of Banks. To this list, \nI would add that the Chavez government should meet with the America's \nso-called drug czar, Director of National Drug Control Policy John \nWalters. As noted later in my remarks, Director Walters was denied a \nvisa during my visit to Caracas, although the purpose of his requested \nvisit was to follow up on the proposal President Chavez made to \nAmbassador Duddy to begin increasing counternarcotics cooperation \nbetween the United States and the Government of Venezuela.\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\n  The following day, August 21, I started the morning by meeting with \ntwo members of the Venezuelan National Assembly: Saul Ortega, the first \nVice-President of the National Assembly, and Francisco Torrealba, the \nleader of the U.S.-Venezuela Friendship Group in the National Assembly. \nWe discussed the fact that, prior to the 2005 parliamentary elections, \nthere used to be fairly regular dialog between the U.S. Congress and \nthe Venezuelan National Assembly through the informal ``Boston Group.'' \nThe parliamentarians commented favorably on their past contacts with \nformer Representative Cass Ballenger of North Carolina and \nRepresentative William Delahunt of Massachusetts. Vice President Ortega \nalso recalled fondly a meeting with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts \nand mentioned a visit to Venezuela by Senator Kerry and his fellow \nMassachusetts Senator, Edward Kennedy, that had been discussed but \nnot completed. Both members of the assembly said that such exchanges \nwith the U.S. Congress would be welcome.\n\n  During our meeting, which was also attended by Ambassador Duddy, I \nstressed the importance of the separation of powers under the U.S. \nConstitution. I noted that, as a Senator, I am free to criticize or \ndissent from the decisions of Presidents of my own party. I also cited \nthe example of recent Supreme Court rulings on the rights of detainees \nbeing held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to underscore the value of our \nindependent judiciary, confirmed with the advice and consent of the \nSenate. I am hopeful that through future exchanges, legislator-to-\nlegislator, we may demonstrate the merits of our system of checks and \nbalances and find a way to address areas of common interest to both \ncountries, even if our respective executive branches remain at \nloggerheads.\n  Following the meeting with the parliamentarians, Ambassador Duddy and \nI traveled to the economically challenged Bucaral neighborhood in the \naffluent Chacao borough of Caracas. A grassroots nongovernmental \norganization called ``Friends of the Health of Bucaral'' is working to \nimprove conditions for the neighborhood's residents. Among other \nthings, this organization operates a computer room for young students. \nIn addition, the group's center offers conflict resolution programs, \ndrug prevention workshops, and cultural classes in dance, theater, \nstorytelling and music. The U.S. Embassy, through the Narcotics Affairs \nSection, has helped to support the youth center's illicit drug demand \nreduction efforts. I had the pleasure of meeting the organization's \nfounder, Maria Teresa Gonzalez, and several of the children who benefit \nfrom the group's programs. I also had the chance to visit a small \npolice post to see firsthand the work they are doing--much like \ncommunity police stations in American cities--to build trust in the \ncommunity and prevent crime.\n  After visiting the Bucaral neighborhood, I met with representatives \nof Venezuela's Jewish community at a meeting hosted by the \nConfederation of Israelite Associations of Venezuela, CAIV. CAIV is the \nleading Jewish organization in Venezuela. The Jewish community in \nVenezuela stands at some 13,000, down from over 20,000 10 years ago.\n  I was especially interested to speak with representatives of the \nJewish community because, the week before my visit to Venezuela, \nPresident Chavez met with Jewish leaders including Ronald Lauder, \npresident of the World Jewish Congress. As reported by the Miami Herald \non August 14, 2008, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicols Maduro expressed \nhope following the meeting that ``this coming-together will be \nmaintained.'' According to the Herald, Argentina's Ambassador in \nWashington, Hector Timerman, who also attended the meeting, said Chavez \nhad ``expressed a desire to join forces with [Argentine President \nCristina] Fernandez de Kirchner and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \nLula da Silva `to achieve the eradication of anti-Semitism in Latin \nAmerica.' '' The Herald also quoted another meeting participant as \nsaying that the three leaders may sign a joint statement against anti-\nSemitism in September.\n  At my meeting with Jewish leaders, I received generally positive \nreports on the meeting with President Chavez. The group expressed hope \nabout the direction of relations between the Jewish community and the \nGovernment. I would note that, in addition to publicly condemning anti-\nSemitism, there are other concrete things the Chavez government could \ndo to improve relations. As reported by the Associated Press on August \n14, 2008, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has urged Venezuela to \ninvestigate two police raids on the Jewish community center in Caracas, \nincluding one ``on the eve of a contentious referendum vote in \nDecember.'' Especially given his public support of Iranian President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has denied the Holocaust and said that Israel \nshould be wiped off the map, I hope that President Chavez will take \nconcrete and public actions to reassure the Jewish community in \nVenezuela that they are valued members of Venezuelan society.\n  On Friday, August 22, I met with potential opposition candidates in \nNovember's state and local elections. The first of these was a mayoral \ncandidate who, like more than 260 others, has been banned from seeking \nelective office through an administrative decision by Venezuela's \nController General. He denied any wrongdoing and stressed that he had \nnot been given an opportunity to challenge the factual basis for the \nController General's decision. While he and others are challenging \ntheir disqualification, they are concerned that the courts lack \nsufficient independence to issue a fair ruling on the matter.\n  Among those I met was Henrique Capriles Radonski. He is the current \nmayor of Baruta, a borough of Caracas where the U.S. Embassy is \nlocated. Prior to serving as mayor, Capriles was the President of the \nVenezuelan National Assembly 1999/ 2000, the youngest in its history. \nCapriles is currently the opposition candidate for the governorship of \nMiranda State, which surrounds much of Caracas.\n  Mr. Capriles has received international notoriety due to an apparent \npolitical prosecution against him. His case was profiled in a \nWashington Post op-ed by Deputy Editor Jackson Diehl on April 10, 2006. \nAs noted by the Post, the case against Capriles relates to an incident \nduring the brief 2002 coup against Chavez, when Capriles sought to \ndisperse a hostile crowd that besieged the Cuban Ambassador's \nresidence. Despite his efforts at peacekeeping, Capriles was later \njailed and charged with trespassing, intimidation, and ``violating \ninternational principles,'' among other crimes. Although the case was \ndismissed, the charges were later refiled and Capriles remains in legal \njeopardy. The Post op-ed described Capriles as ``one of the brightest \nstars in a new generation of Venezuelan politicians untainted by the \ndiscredited political establishment Chavez replaced.'' I would concur. \nDespite obvious hurdles, he remains optimistic about the future of \ndemocracy in Venezuela--as well as his own prospects for being elected \nGovernor of Miranda in November.\n\n  I should note that, in addition to my meeting with opposition \ncandidates, the U.S. Embassy also arranged for me to meet with several \nscholars, community leaders, business leaders, and representatives of \nthe independent media during my visit. Although it is my normal \npractice to publicly document my meetings during foreign trips, the \ncurrent political situation in Venezuela leads me to be somewhat \ncircumspect about naming everyone with whom I met. Although the \nindividuals expressed a range of viewpoints, those who were not aligned \nwith President Chavez's party expressed concerns about the health of \nVenezuelan democracy, especially in light of the recent Presidential \ndecrees, which appear to run contrary to the 2007 referendum. They also \nexpressed anxiety about the disqualification of opposition candidates \nin advance of the November elections for state and local offices, and \nthey shared concerns about the Government's increased push to \nnationalize key sectors of the economy. All agreed that the upcoming \nelections, much like the constitutional referendum last December, \nrepresent a critical moment in Venezuela's contemporary political \ndevelopment.\n  On Friday, Ambassador Duddy and I also received two pieces of \ndisappointing news: First, we learned that Venezuela had declined to \nschedule a meeting with Director John Walters, America's drug czar. \nSecond, we\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\nlearned that President Chavez had used his regular television program \nto hurl new slurs at President Bush. Specifically, President Chavez \nused a photograph of President Bush stumbling on some steps at the \nOlympics to criticize him as a ``drunk.'' As reported by the Associate \nPress, Chavez said Bush looked ``drunk and quipped to his listeners: \n``Gold medal for alcoholism.''' Despite these setbacks, however, I \nagreed to a meeting with Venezuela's Minister of Foreign Affairs, \nNicolas Maduro, on Friday afternoon. Ambassador Duddy accompanied me to \nthe meeting.\n  Mr. Maduro has served as Foreign Minister, basically Venezuela's \nSecretary of State, since August 2006. Previously, he served as \nPresident of the National Assembly from 2005 to 2006. He is known as an \nardent defender of President Chavez and his socialist program. I began \nthe meeting by emphasizing my belief that Venezuela and the United \nStates share many common interests, such as our mutual interest in drug \ninterdiction, which can be advanced by greater dialogue. I expressed my \nhope that it may yet be possible to arrange a visit by Director \nWalters, and I added that both U.S. Presidential candidates understand \nthe importance of dialog.\n  Minister Maduro said he was open to the possibility of greater \ndialog, but he said the Venezuelan Government was pessimistic because \nthey believed that positive gestures from the United States were too \noften followed by negative statements about Venezuela by U.S. \nspokespersons. He also noted that efforts to improve relations with the \nUnited States were not always received well by the Government's own \ngrassroots supporters. Minister Maduro questioned aloud whether the \ntime was ripe for better relations and said that after the U.S. \nelections might present a new opportunity. Mr. Maduro also mentioned \nhis own involvement in the former ``Boston Group.''\n  I responded that it would be better to lower the negative rhetoric on \nboth sides. I also discussed my positive meeting with members of the \nNational Assembly and said that we should not wait until after the \nelections to begin to build bridges. I pointed out, for example, that \nDirector Walters was not a politician but a professional who could help \nfacilitate greater cooperation against drug traffickers. Minister \nMaduro said Venezuela was taking the proposal seriously and would have \na final answer very soon. He then recited some of Venezuela's successes \nin domestic counterdrug efforts. I left the meeting encouraged that \nfuture dialog may be possible. But, in response to a reporter's \nquestion as I left, I also defended President Bush against the \nridiculous claim that he had been intoxicated at the Olympics.\n  In closing, I would like to add that Ambassador Duddy, a career \nmember of the Senior Foreign Service who most recently served as Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, is doing a \nsplendid job under difficult circumstances. He is a true expert on \nLatin America and exemplifies the best of the Foreign Service. He is \naided by a very able staff, all of whom are seeking to improve \ndiplomatic relations in a challenging environment. Also, on a personal \nnote, the Ambassador and his wife were gracious and charming hosts \nthroughout our stay in Venezuela, and I look forward to working with \nhim in the future. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Almost a week to the day after I left Venezuela, President Hugo \nChavez threatened our Ambassador, Patrick Duddy, with expulsion in \napparent response to criticism by America's drug czar, John Walters. \nMr. Walters, after being denied a visa to travel to Venezuela, warned \nthat the flow of Colombian cocaine through Venezuela has quadrupled \nsince 2004, reaching an estimated 282 tons last year.\n  As the New York Times reported on September 1, 2008, ``Mr. Chavez's \ncomments effectively ended what seemed to be the start of a thaw in \nJuly, when he chatted with Mr. Duddy at a military parade and invited \nhim to lunch.''\n  On September 11, 2008, President Chavez followed through on his \nthreat. He announced that he was expelling Ambassador Duddy and gave \nhim 72 hours to leave the country. According to the New York Times, \nPresident Chavez claimed to have ``discovered an American-supported \nplot by military officers to topple him.'' Of course, the Times also \nnoted that President Chavez has ``claimed at least 26 times in the last \nsix years that there were plots to kill him, according to counts in the \nlocal media.''\n  Since this announcement, relations between our two countries have \ncontinued to deteriorate. On September 12, 2008, the United States \nannounced it would expel the Venezuelan Ambassador and the U.S. \nTreasury Department accused three Venezuelan officials with close ties \nto President Chavez of aiding the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \nColombia, or FARC, which the United States has designated as a \nterrorist organization.\n  To add even more fuel to the fire, as all of this was occurring, \nRussian bombers landed in Venezuela and several media outlets reported \nthat President Chavez is discussing plans for military exercises with \nRussia's navy in the Caribbean.\n  I am deeply disturbed by these developments. During my visit, there \nwere already signs that President Chavez had decided not to follow \nthrough on his July overtures to Ambassador Duddy concerning renewed \ncooperation against drug traffickers, but I did not imagine that within \nweeks he would seek to expel the Ambassador. As I have noted in my trip \nreport, Ambassador Duddy is an exemplary diplomat. His ouster is truly \na tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9396-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9396-S9400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WHERE ARE THEY?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to insert \ninto the Record an article by Michael Smerconish, Esquire, concerning \nefforts by the United States to capture Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-\nZawahiri. Mr. Smerconish is a distinguished columnist who writes for \nthe Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News, has a \nmorning talk show on the ``Big Talker,'' 1210 WPHT-AM, and appears on \nMSNBC. I have known Mr. Smerconish for more than 20 years and have a \nvery high regard for his scholarship, among his other fine qualities. \nWhile I do not agree with all his comments, especially all his \npolitical evaluations, I believe this article should be made available \nto my colleagues and the public generally to the extent that the \nCongressional Record is read. Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the article to which I refer printed in the Record.\n\n                              Pakisourced\n\n                  (Michael Smerconish, Sept. 11, 2008)\n\n       Where the hell are Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri? \n     And why does virtually no one ask anymore? What's changed \n     since the days when any suburban soccer mom would have \n     strangled either of them with her bare hands if given the \n     chance? And what happened to President Bush's declaration to \n     a joint session of Congress nine days after 9/11 that ``[A]ny \n     nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be \n     regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.'' Doesn't \n     that apply to Pakistan?\n       These are things that I wonder as I watch from my perch in \n     Philadelphia, where I'm a talk show host, columnist and MSNBC \n     talking head. I have also spoken and written about them \n     incessantly, so much so that I've exhausted my welcome with \n     many conservative members of my own talk radio audience. My \n     editors at The Philadelphia Daily News and The Philadelphia \n     Inquirer have made it clear that I've published my last \n     column on this issue because I have written seven to date. On \n     the day after the Pennsylvania primary, I told Chris Matthews \n     on Hardball that this was an issue that could help Barack \n     Obama win support among white male voters, he recognized that \n     it was ``[my] issue,'' before adding, ``And I agree with you \n     completely.''\n       I can't help myself. So strong is my belief that we've \n     failed in our responsibility to 3,000 dead Americans that I \n     am contemplating voting for a Democratic presidential \n     candidate for the first time in my life. It's the chronology \n     I find so compelling.\n       We're at the seven year anniversary of 9/11, lacking not \n     only closure with regard to the two top al Qaeda leaders but \n     also public discourse about any plan to bring them to \n     justice. To me, that suggests a continuation of what I \n     perceive to be the Bush Administration's outsourcing of this \n     responsibility at great cost to a government with limited \n     motivation to get the job done. Of course, I may be wrong; I \n     have no inside information. And I'd love to be proven in \n     error by breaking news of their capture or execution. But \n     published accounts paint an intriguing and frustrating \n     picture.\n       To begin, bin Laden is presumed to have been in Afghanistan \n     on 9/11 and to have fled that nation during the battle at \n     Tora Bora in December of 2001. Gary Berntsen, who was the CIA \n     officer in charge on the ground, told me that his request for \n     Army Rangers to prevent bin Laden's escape into Pakistan was\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\n     denied, and sure enough, that's where bin Laden went. Then \n     came a period when the Bush Administration was supposed to be \n     pressing the search through means it couldn't share publicly. \n     But as time went by with no capture, the signs became more \n     troubling.\n       We now know that in late 2005, the CIA disbanded Alec \n     Station, the FBI-CIA unit dedicated to finding bin Laden, \n     something which was reported on July 4, 2006 by The New York \n     Times. At the time, I hoped we'd closed the bin Laden unit \n     because Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was fully \n     engaged in the hunt in his country's northwest territories, \n     where the duo were supposedly hiding. In September 2006, \n     however, Musharraf reached an accord with tribal leaders \n     there, notorious for their refusal to hand over a guest. In \n     doing so, he agreed to give them continued free reign.\n       The following month, in October of 2006, I participated in \n     a week-long, Pentagon-sponsored, military immersion program \n     called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference. This was a \n     unique opportunity for 45 civilians who were invited to play \n     military tourist and learn first-hand about the United States \n     Central Command (CENTCOM). We traveled 15,000 miles and spent \n     time in four nations. Our days began at 5 or 6 a.m. and \n     didn't end until 10 or 11 p.m. Along the way, we boarded the \n     USS Iwo Jima by helicopter in the Persian Gulf, fired the \n     best of the Army's weaponry in the Kuwait desert (just 10 \n     miles from Iraq), drove an 11-kilometer Humvee obstacle \n     course (designed to teach about IEDs), boarded the Air \n     Force's most sophisticated surveillance aircraft in Qatar, \n     and even took a tour of a military humanitarian outpost in \n     the Horn of Africa. In addition to Secretary Rumsfeld, we \n     were briefed by the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, the vice admiral of CENTCOM and other high-ranking war \n     commanders.\n       I came home with the utmost respect for the men and women \n     throughout the ranks of all five branches of the service \n     committed to eradicating the forces of radical Islam. But \n     there was one thing noticeably absent: The search for bin \n     Laden and al-Zawahiri. It was not part of our otherwise \n     comprehensive agenda, and when I did ask specific questions, \n     there was no information forthcoming except a generic \n     assertion that, indeed, the hunt continued.\n       When we were briefed at Andrews Air Force Base by Vice \n     Admiral David Nichols, the No. 2 to Army Gen. John Abizaid, I \n     asked him whether the hunt for bin Laden was, at that stage, \n     completely dependent upon Pakistani President Pervez \n     Musharraf. He told me we respect national sovereignty, and \n     described the search as ``difficult and nuanced.'' I took \n     that as a confirmation of my concern about outsourcing.\n       When in Bahrain, I put the same question to Marine Brig. \n     Gen. Anthony Jackson. He told me that the search was the \n     equivalent of finding one man in the Rockies, an analogy that \n     I heard repeatedly from men I met overseas. He also said that \n     ``no one is giving up,'' and that my question was better put \n     to the guys in special ops.\n       So, when we got to the special ops headquarters in Qatar, I \n     raised the matter yet again, this time with Col. Patrick \n     Pihana, the chief of staff to the Combined Forces Special \n     Operations Component Command. He offered nothing substantive \n     on the issue.\n       No one told me the search was over, but I came home worried \n     that the days of aggressively hunting bin Laden and al-\n     Zawahiri had ended. Of course, I could fully appreciate that \n     an aggressive pursuit was underway but that I, a blowhard \n     from Philadelphia, was simply deemed unworthy of any \n     information. That would have been fine.\n       But there was another consideration. More than one \n     individual with whom I spoke--and no one that I have named \n     here--raised with me the question of what would happen to \n     public support for the war against radical Islam if we were \n     to find and kill bin Laden and al-Zawahiri. They wanted to \n     know: Would the American people then expect the military to \n     pack up and go home? No one ever told me that we're not \n     hunting bin Laden because killing him would cause Americans \n     to want to close up shop in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it was \n     absolutely on the minds of our warriors as support for the \n     war in Iraq dissipated.\n       A few months before my return, there was news of our \n     response to the accord reached between Musharraf and the \n     tribal warlords. The agreement, which was effected on \n     September 5, 2006, stipulated that the Pakistani army would \n     pull back from the tribal areas. A report from the BBC \n     detailed what the tribal leaders would grant the army for \n     withdrawing: ``Local Taleban supporters, in turn, have \n     pledged not to harbor foreign militants, launch cross-border \n     raids or attack Pakistani government troops or facilities.''\n       Meanwhile, there was no demand for accountability by our \n     government. The White House and the Pentagon consistently \n     played down the significance of capturing bin Laden and al-\n     Zawahiri, and President Bush offered only superficial \n     responses to the few questions raised on the status of the \n     search. On February 23, 2007, the Army's highest-ranking \n     officer, Gen. Peter Schoomaker, said he didn't know whether \n     we would find bin Laden, and ``I don't know that it's all \n     that important, frankly.''\n       At a May 24, 2007 White House news conference, when asked \n     why Osama was still at large, President Bush offered his \n     usual refrain: ``Because we haven't got him yet . . . That's \n     why. And he's hiding, and we're looking, and we will continue \n     to look until we bring him to justice.'' For me, somewhere \n     between two and four years removed from 9/11, it had all \n     begun to wear thin--especially because it seemed bin Laden \n     remained active. Unfortunately, the President's standard line \n     has long been accepted by the media and American people.\n       Then, On May 20, 2007, the Times reported that we were \n     paying $80 million a month to Pakistan for its supposed \n     counter-terrorism efforts, for a total of $5.6 billion.\n       In July 2007, a National Security Estimate concluded that \n     the failure of Musharraf's accord with warlords in Pakistan's \n     tribal areas had allowed bin Laden's thugs to regroup there. \n     On July 22, National Intelligence Director Adm. Mike \n     McConnell said on Meet the Press that he believed bin Laden \n     was in Pakistan in the very region Musharraf had ceded to the \n     warlords.\n       I hoped that the presidential campaign would move the issue \n     to the front burner, but despite its 24/7 nature it failed to \n     stir up a discussion about the failure to capture or kill \n     those who pushed us down such a perilous path. In the first \n     seven presidential debates--four for the D's, three for the \n     R's--there was only one question in 15 hours of discourse \n     that touched on the subject of finding bin Laden in Pakistan, \n     and it came from the audience. Though I did not keep count \n     thereafter, I know that the issue never gained resonance in \n     any subsequent debate.\n       Things changed somewhat on August 1, 2007, when Barack \n     Obama delivered a speech at the Woodrow Wilson International \n     Center for Scholars: ``If we have actionable intelligence \n     about high-value terrorist targets, and President Musharraf \n     won't act, we will,'' he said.\n       ``We can't send millions and millions of dollars to \n     Pakistan for military aid, and be a constant ally to them, \n     and yet not see more aggressive action in dealing with al \n     Qaeda.''\n       Finally, I thought, a presidential candidate saying \n     something about this foreign-policy failure.\n       The reaction? Ridicule.\n       Then presidential candidates Joe Biden and Chris Dodd \n     responded derisively. Pakistani foreign ministers did \n     likewise. Across the aisle, John McCain pounded Obama for a \n     perceived lack of seasoning in the realm of foreign \n     relations: ``The best idea is to not broadcast what you're \n     going to do,'' McCain said in February. ``That's naive.'' \n     (More recently, McCain has grown fond of saying that he'll \n     ``follow bin Laden to the gates of hell.'') Not to be left \n     out, Hillary Clinton said, ``You can think big, but, \n     remember, you shouldn't always say everything you think when \n     you're running for president because it could have \n     consequences across the world, and we don't need that right \n     now.''\n       Of course, that didn't stop Senator Clinton from including \n     bin Laden's image--along with reminders of the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor--in a television commercial that aired in the \n     final days before the Pennsylvania primary election. After \n     scolding her opponent for advocating a specific course of \n     action in Pakistan, the world's most infamous terrorist \n     became a bankable issue for the junior senator from New York \n     when her back was against the wall.\n       To his credit, Obama refused to back away from his \n     insistence on reasserting American control over the hunt for \n     bin Laden. I interviewed him on March 21, 2008, and he \n     admitted that a resurgence of the Taliban had occurred in \n     Pakistan.\n       ``What's clear from . . . what I've learned from talking to \n     troops on the ground is that unless we can really pin down \n     some of these Taliban leaders who flee into the Pakistan \n     territories, we're going to continue to have instability, and \n     al Qaeda's going to continue to have a safe haven, and that's \n     not acceptable.''\n       I was pleased by what he had to say about the issue, and \n     asked about it again on April 18, 2008, when I interviewed \n     him for a second time. He told me that Musharraf, despite \n     being flush with billions in American aid, was not taking \n     counter-terrorism seriously.\n       ``That's part of the reason that I've been a critic from \n     the start of the war in Iraq,'' Obama told me. ``It's not \n     that I was opposed to war. It's that I felt we had a war that \n     we had not finished.''\n       ``And al Qaeda is stronger now than at any time since 2001, \n     and we've got to do something about that because those guys \n     have a safe haven there and they are still planning to do \n     Americans harm.''\n       He also pointed out that the Bush administration had \n     actually shown signs of following his lead. Obama reminded me \n     that a late-January airstrike killed a senior al Qaeda \n     commander in Pakistan, calling it an example of the type of \n     action he'd been recommending since August. The CIA, it was \n     reported a few weeks after the strike, acted without the \n     direct approval of Musharraf.\n       Soon after I spoke with Senator Obama, the non-partisan \n     Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of \n     the United States Congress, issued a report dated April 17, \n     2008 with a title requiring no interpretation: ``Combating \n     Terrorism: The United States Lacks Comprehensive Plan to \n     Destroy the Terrorist Threat and Close the Safe Haven in \n     Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas.''\n       The report, undertaken at the bipartisan request of U.S \n     House and Senate members, minced no words in issuing a \n     conclusion that should have made Americans' blood boil: Six \n     years after September 11, the United States had failed to \n     destroy the terrorist havens in\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\n     Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas (known in the \n     report as FATA). The GAO confirmed prior reports that al \n     Qaeda was revitalized and poised to launch an attack, and \n     said that no comprehensive U.S. plan existed to combat \n     terrorism on its most central front.\n       In the days that followed its release, I spoke to Charles \n     Johnson, under whose signature the GAO report was issued. He \n     told me: ``With respect to establishing a comprehensive plan, \n     we found that there were some individual plans that had been \n     prepared by the various entities I mentioned earlier [the \n     Department of Defense, Department of State, U.S. Agency for \n     International Development, among others].''\n       ``But yet there was no comprehensive plan that integrated \n     all of the key elements of national power that was called for \n     by the 9/11 Commission, by the National Security Strategy for \n     Combating Terrorism and the United States Congress. And those \n     elements I'm referring to are: the use of military, economic \n     and development assistance; law enforcement support; \n     intelligence support; as well as political and diplomatic \n     means by which we would want to address the root cause of \n     terrorism in a particular region.''\n       From there the headlines continued to defy the GAO \n     recommendations. ``Pakistan asserts it is near a deal with \n     militants,'' read the front page of the April 25 edition of \n     the New York Times. Pakistan's newly elected government was \n     again on the verge of an accord with the militants running \n     amok in the FATA--despite the new government's previously \n     stated desires to move away from Musharraf's policies in \n     those regions. Less than a week later, under the headline \n     ``Pakistan's planned accord with militants alarms U.S.,'' The \n     New York Times reported that the Bush administration \n     expressed concern that the new agreement could contribute to \n     ``further unraveling of security'' in the region.\n       The arrangement was tailor made for bin Laden. It permitted \n     the local Taliban group, Tehrik-e-Taliban, to assist in \n     keeping law and order in the area known as Swat in the \n     northwest frontier province--while not attacking the existing \n     security forces--in return for an exchange of prisoners \n     between the Pakistani Army and the Taliban. The Army also \n     agreed to withdraw forces from parts of Swat. According to a \n     report from the May 22 edition of The New York Times, the \n     Bush Administration was concerned that the deal would ``give \n     the Taliban and Al Qaeda the latitude to carry out attacks \n     against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.'' Some U.S. \n     officials even went so far as to call it a ``victory'' for \n     bin Laden, as reported by ABC News. What else are we to \n     assume, except that the climate in Pakistan may grow even \n     more hospitable to al Qaeda?\n       In a refreshing opportunity free from the stock answers so \n     often given by politicians, I was given the chance to \n     interview Marcus Luttrell as part of my radio book club \n     series in May 2008. He was the only survivor of Operation Red \n     Wing, a mission that would result in the worst loss in Naval \n     Seal history. He earned a Navy Cross for his valor and wrote \n     about his harrowing story in The New York Times' best seller, \n     Lone Survivor. Unlike most of the bureaucrats from \n     Washington, who have only been able to offer me talking \n     points from a failed policy, Luttrell gave a brutally honest \n     account of the time he spent in the Hindu Kush, a mountainous \n     area located just a few miles from the northwestern border of \n     Pakistan. Luttrell described how his efforts were too often \n     constricted by red tape.\n       ``Yeah, we've got some problems with that border . . . \n     because we'd be chasing the bad guys in there and they had a \n     lot of security set up and we have to stop what we're doing \n     while they just run across and if we don't, we'll get engaged \n     by the Paki border guards and that's an international \n     incident.''\n       Luttrell couldn't delve into the details of the prickly \n     international problem that was created by the tension with \n     the border guard, but when I asked him if the Pakistan issue \n     was a problem in general, he wholeheartedly agreed.\n       ``Hell yeah it's a problem. Heck, they're harboring the \n     enemy. It's such a joke, it's so stupid. [T]hey come over and \n     do their business, whatever is, and if it gets them in to \n     trouble, all they have to do is sink back into Pakistan and \n     stay there. They say, ``We're good here, we're good here' . . \n     . It's frustrating.''\n       Americans may be uncertain about which talking point of the \n     day to believe on this issue, but I'm taking the word of a \n     guy who saw the conditions first-hand. Marcus Luttrell and \n     thousands of other men and women in uniform serve their \n     country valiantly. Don't we owe it to them to aggressively \n     pursue and kill the enemies that seek to destroy them?\n       Supporting the account of Marcus Luttrell is a chilling \n     report released by the RAND Corporation, a think tank, on \n     June 9, 2008. The report warned that the ``United States and \n     its NATO allies will face crippling long-term consequences in \n     their effort to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan'' if it \n     does not eliminate Taliban strongholds in Pakistan.\n       All of this while the presidential contenders and the \n     Americans headed to the polls were mostly silent in the face \n     of a seven year timeline moving in the wrong direction. For \n     his part, Ayman al-Zawahiri was apparently so comfortable \n     that he spent time logging into jihad chat rooms and \n     attracting thousands of questions from the peon terrorists \n     prepared to do his dirty work.\n       All of this drives me batshit, and it just might drive me \n     into the Obama camp. That'd be quite a departure. I've been \n     active in the Republican Party since I turned eighteen and \n     registered to vote for Ronald Reagan in 1980. While a college \n     undergraduate at Lehigh University, I did advance work for \n     then Vice President George H.W. Bush. And soon after I \n     graduated from law school at the University of Pennsylvania, \n     Penn, he appointed me, at age 29, to run the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development in five states under the \n     direction of Secretary Jack Kemp. I supported Bush 43 in both \n     of his campaigns. Hell, in 2004, I MC'd his final \n     Pennsylvania rally with 20,000 people in a suburban \n     cornfield.\n       My frustration is so apparent that a fellow journalist from \n     The Philadelphia Daily News has labeled me ``fixated'' with \n     9/11. At least I'm consistent. In 2004, I donated all of my \n     proceeds from my first book, Flying Blind: How Political \n     Correctness Continues to Compromise Airline Safety Post 9/11, \n     to a memorial in Bucks County, Pennsylvania called the Garden \n     of Reflection for Ground Zero victims. Many of my radio \n     listeners bought that book. Now some of them pound out \n     hatriolic emails to my website because, on the strength of \n     this issue, I said Barack Obama was the better of the two \n     Democrats in the Pennsylvania primary.\n       But frankly, I don't care.\n       The Bush Administration's failure to orchestrate a \n     successful counter-terrorism plan--one topped off with \n     justice for Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri--has left \n     me embarrassed of my party and angry. The oft-repeated \n     explanations of the search being nuanced or covering \n     difficult terrain should have worn thin long ago.\n       Unfortunately, even after dangling my vote in front of \n     Senator John McCain, the nominee from my own party, he only \n     offered a continuation of the Bush Administration's policy. \n     In a conversation I had with the Senator on June 13, 2008, he \n     first attempted to say that our counterterrorism efforts were \n     working and that remaining on good terms with Pakistan was \n     imperative to our safety.\n       ``There has been progress in those areas. Pakistan is a \n     sovereign nation and we have to have the cooperation of \n     Pakistan in order to have these operations succeed. I don't \n     have any classified information, but I do know that there are \n     activities taking place that are intended to counter some of \n     these activities, so all I want to say to you is that if you \n     alienate Pakistan and it turns into an anti-American \n     government, then you will have much greater difficulties.''\n       Even when the Senator attempted to remind me of the fact \n     that the United States also gives a great deal of money to \n     Egypt, who, like Pakistan, could be more helpful in assisting \n     the U.S. in the War on Terror, I pointed out to him that \n     these guys aren't hiding in Cairo. The people responsible for \n     the atrocities of 9/11 are concentrated in an area \n     northwestern Pakistan, a fact which I repeated to the \n     Senator. He then pointed out the historic difficulty with the \n     region.\n       ``I have promised that I will get Osama bin Laden when I am \n     President of the United States, but . . . you can go on the \n     internet, and look at that countryside, and there's a reason \n     why it hasn't been governed since the days of Alexander the \n     Great. They're ruled by about, it's my understanding, \n     thirteen tribal entities, and nobody has ever governed them, \n     not the Pakistani government, not the British--nobody, and so \n     it's a very, very difficult part of the world.'' He added, \n     ``I agree with you that we should've gotten Osama bin Laden, \n     but I can't put all of it at the doorstep of the Pakastani \n     government.''\n       I have a great deal of respect for the Senator, but I have \n     a serious disagreement with him over this issue, something \n     which I let him know would dramatically influence my vote in \n     November. For the entirety of my interview, I tried to keep \n     the Senator focused on Pakistan, and though he answered all \n     of my questions, at the end of the interview, the Senator \n     tried to insert his message of the day, which was about the \n     Supreme Court ruling that granted habeas corpus rights to \n     enemy combatants. When he did, I responded, ``I hear you, and \n     all I think is that the guys who sent those guys over here \n     are still on the lamb and we're writing a big check, and I'm \n     unhappy about it.'' To my disappointment, the Senator said \n     the following, ``Yes, sir, and I understand that, and if you \n     let KSM, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, and others go, they'll join \n     them over there. Thirty guys, who have been released, have \n     gone back to the battlefield.'' It wasn't the fact that he \n     once again dodged my clear dissatisfaction with the Pakistan \n     issue that left me dismayed--I've become quite used to it at \n     this point; it was the fact that I clearly heard an aide \n     mutter the line to him before he delivered it before me and \n     my captive audience. The campaign clearly had a stock answer \n     for me, an answer that I've heard before and have clearly \n     rejected.\n       Put quite simply, the support for this failed policy is \n     driving me to the edge of my long Republican career. And \n     despite never pulling a lever for a Democratic presidential \n     candidate, I believe the election this November will present \n     the chance to relieve this country of the conventional wisdom \n     that President Bush has offered for seven years and Senator \n     McCain appears resigned to advance: That President Musharraf \n     was a friend who did what he could to prevent Pakistan from \n     defaulting towards further extremism; that the hunt for Osama \n     bin Laden is nuanced and U.S. forces are doing everything \n     they can to find him; and that the war\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\n     in Iraq is a necessary one that hasn't distracted from the \n     fight against those who perpetrated and planned 9/11.\n       That wisdom has been proven unequivocally wrong.\n       The kicker? We, the tax payers, are footing the bill for \n     this negligence. According to a June 25, 2008 article in The \n     Philadelphia Inquirer, a GAO report showed that nearly two \n     billion given in aid to Pakistan was spent improperly. The \n     article states:\n       `` `For a large number of claims, Defense did not obtain \n     sufficient documentation from Pakistan to verify that claimed \n     costs were incremental, actually incurred or correctly \n     calculated,' the report concluded. `It seems as though the \n     Pakistani military went on a spending spree with American \n     taxpayers' wallets and no one bothered to investigate the \n     charges,' said Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), a member of the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee. `How hard would it have been \n     to confirm that a road we paid $15 million for was ever \n     built?' ''\n       The leaks about our Pakistani misadventures continued. It \n     was reported in The New York Times on June 30, 2008 that the \n     Bush Administration had created a secret plan in late 2007 to \n     settle disagreements between counterterrorism agencies that \n     were blocking the path of special ops forces into Pakistan. \n     Months after the plan was developed, however, the special ops \n     are still waiting, entangled in bureaucratic red tape. As \n     these highly-trained soldiers, who should be on the prowl for \n     Osama bin Laden, sit with their hands tied, al Qaeda's \n     presence has grown. According to the Times:\n       ``After the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush committed the \n     nation to a `war on terrorism' and made the destruction of \n     Mr. bin Laden's network the top priority of his presidency. \n     But it is increasingly clear that the Bush administration \n     will leave office with Al Qaeda having successfully relocated \n     its base from Afghanistan to Pakistan's tribal areas, where \n     it has rebuilt much of its ability to attack from the region \n     and broadcast its messages to militants across the world.''\n       In light of increasingly negative press about Afghanistan, \n     both the Obama and McCain campaigns addressed the issue in \n     foreign policy speeches on July 15, 2008. Senator Obama was \n     first up to bat. Here's some of what he said:\n\n       ``In the 18 months since the surge began, the situation in \n     Afghanistan has deteriorated. June was our highest casualty \n     month of the war. The Taliban has been on the offensive, even \n     launching a brazen attack on one of our bases. Al Qaeda has a \n     growing sanctuary in Pakistan. That is a consequence of our \n     current strategy.''\n       ``In fact--as should have been apparent to President Bush \n     and Senator McCain--the central front in the war on terror is \n     not Iraq, and it never was. That's why the second goal of my \n     new strategy will be taking the fight to al Qaeda in \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n       ``It is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly \n     3,000 Americans were killed on our soil, the terrorists who \n     attacked us on 9/11 are still at large. Osama bin Laden and \n     Ayman al-Zawahari are recording messages to their followers \n     and plotting more terror. The Taliban controls parts of \n     Afghanistan. Al Qaeda has an expanding base in Pakistan that \n     is probably no farther from their old Afghan sanctuary than a \n     train ride from Washington to Philadelphia. If another attack \n     on our homeland comes, it will likely come from the same \n     region where 9/11 was planned. And yet today, we have five \n     times more troops in Iraq than Afghanistan.''\n       ``The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal \n     regions of Pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents \n     strike into Afghanistan. We cannot tolerate a terrorist \n     sanctuary, and as President, I won't. We need a stronger and \n     sustained partnership between Afghanistan, Pakistan and NATO \n     to secure the border, to take out terrorist camps, and to \n     crack down on cross-border insurgents. We need more troops, \n     more helicopters, more satellites, more Predator drones in \n     the Afghan border region. And we must make it clear that if \n     Pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level \n     terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our \n     sights.''\n       ``Make no mistake: we can't succeed in Afghanistan or \n     secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy. We \n     must expect more of the Pakistani government, but we must \n     offer more than a blank check to a General who has lost the \n     confidence of his people. It's time to strengthen stability \n     by standing up for the aspirations of the Pakistani people. \n     That's why I'm cosponsoring a bill with Joe Biden and Richard \n     Lugar to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani people and \n     to sustain it for a decade, while ensuring that the \n     military assistance we do provide is used to take the \n     fight to the Taliban and al Qaeda. We must move beyond a \n     purely military alliance built on convenience, or face \n     mounting popular opposition in a nuclear-armed nation at \n     the nexus of terror and radical Islam.''\n       ``Only a strong Pakistani democracy can help us move toward \n     my third goal--securing all nuclear weapons and materials \n     from terrorists and rogue states. One of the terrible ironies \n     of the Iraq War is that President Bush used the threat of \n     nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active \n     nuclear program. But the fact that the President misled us \n     into a misguided war doesn't diminish the threat of a \n     terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction--in fact, it has \n     only increased it.''\n       Senator McCain offered a different view:\n       ``A special focus of our regional strategy must be \n     Pakistan, where terrorists today enjoy sanctuary. This must \n     end. We must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who \n     are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there--the \n     strategy used successfully in Anbar and elsewhere in Iraq. We \n     must convince Pakistanis that this is their war as much as it \n     is ours. And we must empower the new civilian government of \n     Pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for \n     development, health, and education. Senator Obama has spoken \n     in public about taking unilateral military action in \n     Pakistan. In trying to sound tough, he has made it harder for \n     the people whose support we most need to provide it. I will \n     not bluster, and I will not make idle threats. But understand \n     this: when I am commander-in-chief, there will be nowhere the \n     terrorists can run, and nowhere they can hide.''\n       My ranting and raving on this issue seems to have caught \n     the attention of the national campaigns. In June 2008, the \n     Obama campaign used my praise of the candidate to supplement \n     their fact check section of the website on the Senator's \n     quest to catch bin Laden.\n       It became apparent that the Obama campaign wasn't the only \n     one to take notice; the interview I had done with Senator \n     McCain in June 2008, and general ire with the Republican \n     establishment on this issue, had obviously raised some red \n     flags over at the campaign. On July 24, 2008, former Mayor \n     Rudy Giuliani appeared on the program at his own request. \n     Though I was thrilled to have Rudy back to the show, as he \n     was my first choice out of the Republican presidential \n     candidates, it was clear that he was sent as a surrogate of \n     the McCain camp. Realizing this, I told Rudy exactly what was \n     keeping me from enthusiastically supporting McCain. \n     Specifically, I referenced a story that had run in The New \n     York Times that morning, describing the Bush Administration's \n     plan to divert $230 billion dollars in aid to Pakistan, which \n     was intended to be used for a variety of military purposes. \n     According to the Times, the money would be used for \n     everything, ``from counterterrorism programs to upgrading \n     that country's aging F-16 attack planes, which Pakistan \n     prizes more for their contribution to its military rivalry \n     with India than for fighting insurgents along its Afghan \n     border.'' In my opinion, it looked like we were continuing to \n     fund a country that had already grossly mismanaged the effort \n     to find bin Laden, and doing so while knowing that the funds \n     would be used to embolden the Pakistani army with regard to \n     the age-old conflict with India. When I asked the former \n     Mayor how he, the leader most defined by the 9/11 attacks, \n     could tolerate this sort of negligence, I ended my question \n     by telling him that I thought we were getting ``rolled.'' He \n     agreed with my analysis at story's face value, but qualified \n     his comments, ``I don't know what the background of this one \n     is. On the face of it, it makes no sense. Pakistan does not \n     face an imminent threat from India. India is becoming a \n     closer and closer ally. I think one of the good things the \n     Bush Administration has done is really turned it to a very \n     positive one, particularly with this deal regarding the use \n     of fuel that can be used for nuclear reactors, but the only \n     was this would make sense, is if it's part of an overall deal \n     to get them to allow us the leeway [to get bin Laden] we were \n     just talking about.''\n       I agreed with his analysis of this one instance, but after \n     a long train of abuses involving Pakistan, it's difficult to \n     keep an open mind. No campaign will ever be able to convince \n     me that we haven't dropped the ball in Pakistan, and have \n     disgraced the memories of the 9/11 victims in doing so.\n       While candidates talk, the dismaying story continues. A \n     recent report from The New York Times in July 2008 suggested \n     that the C.I.A. might not even be receiving proper \n     intelligence on the al Qaeda problem in Pakistan: ``The \n     C.I.A. has depended heavily on the ISI for information about \n     militants in Pakistan, despite longstanding concerns about \n     divided loyalties within the Pakistani spy service, which had \n     close relations with the Taliban in Afghanistan before the \n     Sept. 11 attacks. That ISI officers have maintained important \n     ties to anti-American militants has been the subject of \n     previous reports in The New York Times. But the C.I.A. and \n     the Bush administration have generally sought to avoid \n     criticism of Pakistan, which they regard as a crucial ally in \n     the fight against terrorism.'' It was reported two days later \n     that officers from this same intelligence service played a \n     role in the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul, \n     Afghanistan on July 7, 2008, which left fifty-four people \n     dead.\n       Still not convinced that Pakistan is knowingly harboring \n     the people working full-time to attack us? On August 12, \n     2008, Abu Saeed al-Masri, a senior al Qaeda commander was \n     killed in an American air strike. Where? The border between \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan, of course.\n       When President Musharaff resigned in August 2008 due to \n     political pressure from lingering doubts as to his legitimacy \n     from the previous election, President Bush offered undue \n     praise for the former President. A statement said, \n     ``President Bush appreciates President Musharraf's efforts in \n     the democratic transition of Pakistan as well as his \n     commitment to fighting al Qaeda and extremist groups.'' \n     Commitment? What a farce.\n       I say that because the weeks following Musharraf's \n     resignation have already brought incremental changes in \n     policy and\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\n     faint reasons for optimism. The Pakistani military spent most \n     of August launching airstrikes against the Taliban militants \n     attacking American forces from the fence straddling the \n     Afghan-Pakistan border--an effort that resulted in more than \n     400 Taliban casualties and a shallow retreat by the \n     terrorists. It's ``shallow'' because the Pakistani government \n     followed up those airstrikes by declaring a ceasefire to \n     coincide with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Legislators \n     from the tribal areas promised political support for the top \n     candidate in Pakistan's presidential election in exchange for \n     the truce, which was announced in the days leading up to the \n     country's vote.\n       Less than a week later, though, American forces finally \n     showed signs of taking the matter of the central front of the \n     war on terror into their own hands. A New York Times report \n     indicated that U.S. special ops forces attacked al-Qaeda \n     militants gathered in a Pakistani village called Jalal Khel. \n     U.S. officials said the move might represent the early stages \n     of a more dedicated and aggressive American presence in \n     Pakistan in the wake of General Musharraf's resignation.\n       Don't get me wrong, a more sustained United States assault \n     against the terrorists squatting in Pakistan is welcome news, \n     and it signifies a more urgent effort to hunt down and snuff \n     out the greatest threat to Americans' safety on our own \n     shores.\n       But it's about 2,555 days late and $11 billion short. Seven \n     years after 9/11, the country is stoking what was supposed to \n     be a complete and consuming ``war on terror'' with faint \n     signs of a sustained operation in the country where the bad \n     guys have been hiding for years.\n       How appalling. I doubt the families of the 3,000 innocents \n     murdered on 9/11--and the 4,000 that followed them in Iraq--\n     are content with it. After all, it's seven years, thousands \n     of troops and billions of dollars later, and our country has \n     failed to deliver on what we really owe them: Justice.\n       Nor have we answered the most important question pertaining \n     to our nation's future: Can we really win this war with \n     Islamic extremism? Because if we don't have the fire in our \n     belly to defend the American troops stonewalled by the \n     Afghan-Pakistani border; to hunt down and destroy the Taliban \n     and al-Qaeda militants camping out on the other side of that \n     border; and do everything we possibly can to capture and kill \n     Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, I fear we'll be left \n     to deal with another fire--one raging in another building, \n     burning a hole in another American city.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9400-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise to applaud the Senate's \npassage yesterday, as part of the so-called tax extenders legislation, \nof important tax provisions that will move our Nation toward a green \neconomy. But I also would like to reiterate my support for our budget \npay-as-you-go rule and to express my disappointment that a nonoffset \nversion of the so-called alternative minimum tax, AMT, patch was part \nof the tax package the Senate passed.\n  With our national debt level at a record high, and growing by the \nday, responsible governing requires that we balance new spending and \nrevenue reductions with decreased spending or revenue increases. I am \nproud to have supported Senator Conrad's amendment to the tax extenders \npackage that would have provided for the extension of the AMT patch and \nother tax extenders on a fully offset basis. I also supported Senator \nConrad's effort to raise a point of order under the Senate rules \nagainst the extenders amendment which was not fully offset.\n  Although I strongly prefer Senator Conrad's approach of abiding by \nour budget rules, I decided to support final passage of the partially \noffset tax package because of the many critical energy tax provisions \nin the bill. I have been a strong proponent of growing our green \neconomy, which will both help us combat global climate change and \nencourage investment in new technologies that will create jobs and \nstrengthen our position in the world economy. This tax extenders \npackage includes extensions of incentives for renewable energy, such as \nwind, solar, and geothermal, and the extension of the research and \ndevelopment tax credit on which businesses in Rhode Island and across \nthe Nation have come to depend. In addition, the legislation that we \npassed yesterday includes a mental health parity law long championed by \nCongressman Patrick Kennedy of my State of Rhode Island and his father, \nSenator Edward Kennedy. This landmark provision will ensure that health \ninsurers provide mental health patients with quality coverage and will \ngo down as one of the signature accomplishments of this Congress. I \nwant to take this opportunity to congratulate Congressman Kennedy and \nthe other architects of this important tax legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9400-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9400-S9401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Captain Bruce E. Hays\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute and \nexpress our Nation's sincere gratitude to a remarkable young soldier \nand his family. I was saddened to receive word that on September 17, \n2008, Army CPT Bruce E. Hays of Cheyenne, WY, was killed in the line of \nduty while serving our country in the war on terrorism. Captain Hays \ndied from injuries he sustained while supporting Operation Enduring \nFreedom when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle \nin Gerdia Seria, Afghanistan.\n  Captain Hays first enlisted in the Army in 1984, and joined the \nWyoming National Guard in 2000. He received his commission and became \nan officer later that year. He was a versatile soldier, commanding \nunits ranging from field artillery to information technology. Captain \nHays is remembered by his fellow Wyoming soldiers as an outstanding \nofficer, commander and leader who was both loved and respected by his \ntroops.\n  It is because of Bruce Hays and the blanket of freedom that he fought \nto provide that we sleep safely in our beds at night. The brave men and \nwomen of this Nation who answer the call to service and wear the \nuniform of the Armed Forces deserve respect and recognition for the \nenormous burden that they willingly bear. They put their very lives on \nthe line every day for their fellow countrymen. And because of them and \ntheir families, our Nation remains safe and free in the face of danger \nand those who seek to harm us.\n  Captain Hays represents the epitome of this selfless service to a \ncause greater than one's self. He was deployed as chief of an Embedded \nTraining Team, charged with mentoring the Afghan police forces to \ndefend the people of Afghanistan against terrorism. Laying aside his \nown self interest, Captain Hays gave his life in a far off land helping \na fledgling democracy and a newly freed people to live the dreams that \nfreedom and liberty bring.\n  In the book of John, Jesus said that, ``Greater love has no man than \nthis, that he lay his life down for his friend.'' CPT Bruce Hays gave \nhis life, that last full measure of devotion, for you, me, and every \nsingle American. He gave his life defending his country and its people, \nand we honor him for this selfless sacrifice. And there are no words to \nexpress the profound gratitude that our Nation owes this brave solder \nand his family.\n  Captain Hays is survived by a loving family including his wife Marie \nand their children, Bethany, Eleanor, John, Alfonso, and Genevieve, and \nhis parents Barbara and Leonard. He is also survived by his brothers \nand sisters in arms of the Wyoming National Guard and the U.S. Army. We \nsay goodbye to a devoted family man and an American citizen soldier. \nOur Nation pays its deepest respect to CPT Bruce E. Hays for his \ncourage, his love of country and his sacrifice, so that we may remain \nfree. He was a hero in life and will remain so in death. All of \nWyoming, and indeed the entire Nation, is proud of him. May God bless \nhim and his family, and greet him with open arms.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Nathan M. Cox.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to honor SSgt Nathan M. \nCox who was killed on September 20, 2008 in Korengal Valley, \nAfghanistan. Staff Sergeant Cox was serving with B Company, 1st \nBattalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, out of Fort \nHood, TX, and died following the injuries that he sustained after his \nvehicle encountered an improvised exploding device by the roadside. I \nwould like to express my condolences to Nathan's friends and family, in \nparticular Nathan's parents Jane and Leslie, wife Annie, and 5-year-old \ndaughter Sophia. They are in my thoughts and prayers.\n  Staff Sergeant Cox was deployed to Afghanistan in July of this year, \nhaving spent a year in Iraq prior to his arrival in Afghanistan. He had \nattended Davenport Central High School in Davenport, IA, and enlisted \nin the Army straight after leaving high school. Nathan spent 3 years in \nBosnia during the mid 1990s. Then, in 2005, at age 29, he re-entered \nthe Army to make it his career. Nathan made the ultimate sacrifice \ndefending the country and the\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\npeople that he loved, so that those of us back home can enjoy safety \nand freedom. His bravery and the bravery of all of his comrades will \nnever be forgotten by a grateful nation.\n  Jane Cox, Nathan's mother, said that Nathan was very interested in \nforeign affairs and hence chose the Army to utilize his talents. She \nadded that Nathan had finally come to terms with his ``gift of being a \nleader.'' People who knew him describe a man with a great sense of \nhumor who always looked on the bright side of everything. It is during \nthese times of uncertainty abroad and at home that we look to the \nexamples set by people like Staff Sergeant Cox, who carry out their \nduty in a way that is both courageous and honorable. I know that Nathan \ndid not die in vain, but his tremendous sacrifice has helped to secure \npeace and freedom for the United States and our allies around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9401-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, for 219 years, the U.S. Marshals \nService has helped to bring some of America's worst criminals to \njustice, and our Nation is a safer place because of their service. On \ntheir anniversary, I would like to offer my many thanks for their \ncommitment to upholding the rule of law and their willingness to \nprotect and serve Americans.\n  During their 219 years of service, the marshals have executed \nwarrants, distributed Presidential proclamations, registered enemy \naliens in a time of war, and helped conduct the national census. They \nhave also ensured the safe conduct of judicial proceedings and \nprotected Federal judges and jurors and other members of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  They lead the Witness Security Program; serving nearly 18,000 \nGovernment witnesses and their family members whose lives are in danger \nas a result of the witnesses' testimony against gangs, drug \ntraffickers, terrorists, organized crime members, and other criminals.\n  Recently, the State of Florida enlisted the marshals' services to \nhelp combat rising instances of violent crime. During the 3-month \neffort, known as Operation Orange Crush, the Marshals' Regional \nFugitive Task Force was responsible for arresting more than 2,400 \nviolent criminal fugitives in Florida. The operation was an \noverwhelming success, and Florida is grateful for the men and women of \nthe U.S. Marshals Service for helping to make it possible. I would like \nto offer my special thanks to a few of the officials who made Operation \nOrange Crush so successful: U.S. Marshal Service Director John F. \nClark; U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of Florida, Dennis A. \nWilliamson; U.S. Marshal for the Middle District of Florida Thomas D. \nHurlburt, Jr.; and U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Florida \nChristina Pharo.\n  As Americans, we are fortunate to have such a highly specialized law \nenforcement agency dedicated to protecting our personal freedoms and \nkeeping criminals behind bars. I offer my heartiest congratulations to \nthe U.S. Marshals Service on 219 good years and wish for many more to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9401-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ASHLEY BROST\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       It is a relief to finally see someone in our legislation \n     coming to the people for their input! I am currently serving \n     in the USAF, stationed at Mountain Home AFB. I work in Flying \n     Ops. I put about 35 miles a day on my vehicle, just coming to \n     and going home from work. The base itself is ten miles away \n     from town; my house, about 15 miles away from the base. The \n     average price for a gallon of unleaded here is about $4.09. \n     The base has up until now been able to keep its gas prices \n     under $4, but finally hit it this past Monday. I drive a 4-\n     cylinder VW Jetta, with a 14-gallon tank and it costs me $46 \n     to fill it up. I find myself only driving to and from work, \n     as I do not feel like I can afford to drive anywhere else, \n     which is a bummer as Mountain Home's resources are low and if \n     I need something that I cannot find at Wal-Mart (like clothes \n     and shoes for my infant daughter), I have to drive to Boise \n     to get those, or home improvement material, or clothing for \n     myself. I also find my grocery bill skyrocketing. I used to \n     be able to spend $150 and get food for two weeks. I now find \n     that $150 lasts me about a week, which is unacceptable. I am \n     putting so much money towards the necessities that I hardly \n     do any of the niceties anymore. My husband has parked his \n     truck in favor of driving his motorcycle to work everyday to \n     save us money, and we are selling our boat as it just costs \n     way too much to fill it up, and the truck to tow the boat to \n     any lake. So, in the end, energy costs have driven me to only \n     drive to and from work, sell my boat, park my truck, and \n     spend a ridiculous amount of money on food. Thanks for your \n     time.\n     Jessica, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to express my concerns \n     regarding the escalating price of living in Idaho due in \n     large part to the ever increasing cost of energy.\n       I work for Alaska Airlines in Boise, Idaho. My gas bill to \n     cover my commute has gone from $100 to $300 per month. Our \n     industry has been heavily affected by the obscene rise in the \n     cost of aviation fuel. Alaska Air is a profitable business. \n     They've worked very hard at putting a lot of cash in the \n     bank. They never just spent their way into bankruptcy, then \n     emerged a few years later with all of their debts relieved.\n       Today, in order to stay alive, in addition to raising air \n     fares and reducing routes, they have to charge seemingly \n     ridiculous charges for the ordinary services associated with \n     travel. And still the cost of fuel rises. Just today we \n     received the ``second'' corporate letter, advising us that \n     Alaska Airlines is doing all it possibly can to reduce costs, \n     that\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\n     each of us needs to be conscious of everything we do and be \n     as profitable as we can with each service we provide. I work \n     in a call center. Are those the voices of [foreign] call \n     center agents I hear at Alaska Airline's front door? Not only \n     are some of the finest American customer service agents in \n     danger of losing our jobs, but the least respected of all \n     call center personnel will smudge the here-to-fore finest \n     airline service in the world.\n       I have read that you have worked on alternative fuel \n     development. This is a fine aspiration, but with what result? \n     At present, alternative fuels cannot even begin to touch the \n     huge volume it would take to replace gas and oil energy. And, \n     as a result of corn-based fuels, corn-based commodities \n     around the world have also escalated in price. Cereal, \n     tortillas, breads, dog food, chicken and beef feed, the list \n     goes on, are all affected by increased prices I pay every \n     day. And in Third World countries, where such commodities are \n     staples, people are facing shortages and starvation. When the \n     farmer cannot afford to cultivate his crops, the trucker \n     cannot afford to pick up the crops and bring them to market, \n     and the market has to raise the prices of staples, how far \n     behind are we from becoming a society of haves and have-nots?\n       For far too long now, we have let the environmental \n     movement intimidate our energy policy in this country. It \n     started with a little bit of this and that. We stopped \n     drilling for oil and gas off our scenic coasts and large \n     inland tracts of land deemed environmentally sensitive. We \n     stopped approving refineries and thereby reduced our domestic \n     supplies of fuel, relying instead on ever-increasing foreign \n     sources. One of the biggest environmental accidents happened \n     near Valdez, Alaska. Environmentalists blamed big oil. \n     Ironically, the oil spilled was imported from the Middle \n     East. Accompanying all this was the slow rise in the price \n     consumers pay to run their cars and heat their homes.\n       Our government has played both side of the aisle with CAFE \n     standards that have not improved gas mileage so much as to \n     drive the price of cars to the same price as a good house in \n     the 1960s. Regulations have driven refineries to further \n     increase the price of fuel required to manufacture multiple \n     blends. All of these products are heavily taxed by our \n     government. If the oil companies are accused of making \n     obscene profits, then can we not say the same about the \n     never-mentioned windfall profits that our federal government \n     collects?\n       What would I do? I would ask you to start plans to find and \n     develop our best sources of domestic oil and natural gas \n     resources. I would ask you to find places in this country \n     that would just love to refine petroleum and encourage their \n     communities to do so with plenty of tax incentives. Just \n     getting the plans on the board would burst this bubble of \n     inflationary speculation. (These suggestions, if started \n     today would take at least ten years to get up and running).\n       I would also ask that we start plans to build safe and \n     efficient nuclear power plants. France and Germany possess \n     marvelous examples we can emulate and exceed. And standardize \n     the plan designs. Multiple designs in the past really bloated \n     the cost of construction. And further, we need to fend off \n     the environmentalist's incessant legal maneuvering that have \n     historically subverted and inflated the price of energy \n     development.\n       Well, this is more than two paragraphs. But it contains in \n     my opinion, the elements we need to address today and with \n     haste.\n     Robert, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing to you in response to your newsletter about \n     high energy prices and how that affects the people of Idaho. \n     You have requested me to share my story about how high energy \n     prices are affecting me personally.\n       I am more than happy to share with you my sufferings as an \n     Idahoan in light of the increased speculative energy prices \n     that we, as a nation, are facing. It has not been easy, as I \n     am sure can be difficult for some people who make far more \n     money and have more influence to understand. Month after \n     month we Americans have been struggling to make ends meet in \n     this day and time where our nation has been faced by higher \n     energy costs based off of speculative markets, and foreign \n     energy needs. Never in our recent past has our government set \n     us up for failure as a nation to be more independent on the \n     energy needs of our country. Now we are paying the price for \n     turning a blind eye to a growing energy problem and possibly \n     inappropriate relationships and deals with companies and \n     foreign nations. Never before in American history does it \n     make better sense for us to look at new energy supplies, \n     increase energy efficiency, and break our dependence on \n     foreign oil. There are many different renewable resources to \n     concentrate on, many of which (with government backing and \n     subsidies) would allow us as individuals to incorporate our \n     own energy needs with energy supplies that we can create \n     on an individual basis. I am talking about solar power, \n     wind power, hydro electricity (on a very small scale of \n     course). Not only by allowing individual Americans cheaper \n     more realistic options for creating our own energy would \n     we really grasp the amount of independent energy we could \n     create. This has yet to happen, as time and time again, \n     [partisan politicians] shoot down solar energy bills, \n     renewable resources options, and energy tax benefit \n     programs. I base this solely off of the ignorance of the \n     [party-line politics], especially considering I have \n     written to [my congressional representatives and] all of \n     my other government officials pleading for you to break \n     from [partisanship] to help alleviate our dependence on \n     foreign energy suppliers.\n       To make matters worse for me and fellow Idahoans, you and \n     Larry Craig are now working hard to make our state available \n     to nuclear power. This is not help, in my honest opinion. You \n     call it a renewable energy resource; I call it ignorant \n     energy band aid that carry very long term affects. We \n     Idahoans do not and never did want our state to become the \n     nation's nuclear dumping ground. Yet, you officials continue \n     to make our lands available for the spent nuclear energy of \n     other states, and now other nations. Also, you are opening \n     the doors to corporate entities that want to take advantage \n     of our weak state policies so that they can create nuclear \n     facilities in Idaho that will not even be supplying Idahoans \n     with such said energy.\n       So, again, you ask me how the today's energy crisis is \n     affecting the people that put you in office. I tell you it is \n     affecting me in the pocket book, in my personal values and \n     beliefs of renewable energy options, and now you are allowing \n     it to affect the land that I love so much--the good state of \n     Idaho.\n       If you really want to help, then I suggest that you stand \n     up for the people [who] voted for you. [I would ask that you \n     find ways to] build our options away from foreign energy \n     dependence, and give us more renewable energy options. I \n     implore you to stand up for our state, and help us protect \n     ourselves from corporate greed and nuclear mistakes by \n     protecting the lands we love, and keep them from having half-\n     life pollution dumped on them.\n     Andrew.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a LT in the U.S. Navy stationed in Cape Canaveral, FL. \n     I have been in the Navy for 18 years and claim Nampa as my \n     home of record. My parents still live in Nampa and are \n     retired. The ever-rising fuel costs over the last few years \n     have not only produced a dramatic impact on my day-to-day \n     living activities, but those of my parents' and other family \n     members as well who live in Idaho.\n       I have been driving the same vehicle over eight years and \n     am currently spending approximately $500/month in fuel for my \n     vehicle alone. My wife spends almost $350/month in her \n     vehicle. These costs are almost exclusively utilized for \n     commuting to and from work. We go to the grocery store once \n     every two weeks, and hardly ever go out anymore. I estimate \n     from one year ago a rise of at least $250/month, and probably \n     $400/month from two years ago in gasoline spending. To put \n     this into perspective, that is an estimated $3,000 annually. \n     It does not take a brain surgeon to figure out that my cost \n     of living increase of about $100/month does not even come \n     close to making up the difference. Not to mention the \n     dramatic rise in food costs we have experienced over the last \n     year (and we even have the privilege of shopping at the \n     commissary). Add to that the drastic loss of equity in my \n     home (almost $100k in two years) because of the housing \n     market here in central Florida, and you begin to get a good \n     feeling of how the little guy feels.\n       Now, I have proudly served my country for almost two \n     decades, have contributed significantly to bettering our \n     world and saving money at the same time. (I recently \n     developed and implemented a continuous improvement project \n     here at the Navy Port in Cape Canaveral that saves the \n     taxpayers approximately $300,000 annually!). My question to \n     you, ladies and gentlemen, is what are you doing to help me \n     out in this time of crisis!! Thank you for your attention.\n     Josh, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are happy to hear that President Bush has opened our \n     water borders for oil drilling. Now we need the rest of those \n     places that have oil to be opened to drilling! It is late to \n     be doing such but totally necessary. For the protection of \n     our country, we need to have energy to survive! Many around \n     use are using bicycles to get around or walking. My health is \n     not good enough to do that although I am going to work in \n     that direction. We also need trails where battery golf carts, \n     etc., can maneuver around for the sake of the older \n     generation. Our family has to travel to work so they still \n     have to drive. Please encourage President Bush and the \n     Congress to open all areas with oil for drilling and also \n     point the nation toward many other possibilities for other \n     energy fuels.\n     Art and Lynn, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Actually, I do not agree with your stance on this, at all. \n     The cost of not protecting the environment will far outweigh \n     the costs of increased gas/oil prices. I do not know about \n     you, but I would actually like our children to have a world \n     to live in, even if that means I pay for that right now. I \n     would rather see our government invest in new energy \n     technology, cleaner sources of fuels, mass transit, bicycle \n     lanes to encourage safe bike commuting, etc rather than drill \n     in ANWR and keep taxes on gas down.\n       I have yet to understand the conservative view of \n     supporting oil drilling at the expense of supporting other \n     industries. There is a fortune to be made in developing \n     technologies designed to clean the environment rather than \n     foul it. The U.S. is losing jobs and revenues every year to \n     other countries in old industries. Our strength as a nation \n     has long been in developing brand-new industries. Why not \n     encourage that now? Why not invest in a new biofuel \n     technology like algae farms? Why not invest in companies \n     developing ways to clean smokestack exhaust?\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\n     Why not invest in river clean-up processes? Whether we want \n     to admit it or not, these are the types of technologies that \n     will be America's future. We should be embracing them, not \n     suffocating them by limiting research dollars.\n       Unfortunately, as fledgling industries, they do not have \n     the voice that large, highly profitable industries like oil \n     and gas, do and thus they do not hold as much political \n     influence. It is truly a shame that our country has devolved \n     to such a base motivation as this.\n       I respect and admire your concern for the economic impact \n     rising gas prices are having on individual families in Idaho. \n     And I understand that if you do not work to protect you \n     constituents they will elect someone who will. But there \n     comes a point at which our elected officials need to act in \n     our long term best interests even if it means short term \n     sacrifices by the people. If doing so costs a politician \n     their seat in the next election, they'll still be able to \n     take much pride in having done the right thing, for the right \n     reasons.\n       When do you reach that point? What issue gets you there?\n     Chris.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is not about how energy prices affect my standard of \n     living, but how it affects the standard of living of \n     everyone. We are about to lose many jobs because of high \n     energy prices. The high price of natural gas is going to \n     close down many industries that use large quantities. The \n     impact on Americans lives will be lot worse than $4 gasoline. \n     We are on the edge of a depression if we lose as many jobs as \n     I think we might.\n       Congress needs to immediately lease offshore tracts off \n     Florida, and the east coast. Open up offshore California. Get \n     the Alaska pipeline going. That alone can provide 10% of our \n     nation's natural gas needs. Reinvent the nuclear industry. \n     Financially sponsor a reference nuclear generating plant so \n     that future developers will know the costs. The costs are so \n     uncertain that everyone is afraid of the risk. We need to \n     produce electricity with coal and nuclear not natural gas. \n     Remember, in the 1970s, it was unlawful to construct new \n     natural gas fired power plants because Congress deemed it a \n     waste of the resource.\n       Once we have a stable supply of natural gas encourage it is \n     use as a transportation fuel. Honda makes a Compressed \n     Natural Gas Civic, and I saw one at the Honda dealer in \n     California last week. It is a great car for certain people. \n     We do not have one public CNG filing station in Idaho.\n       By developing our own resources natural gas, oil shale, \n     coal, and nuclear, we can quit sending billions of dollars to \n     the Middle East and create good jobs for Americans.\n       Forget alternative energy sources for the time being. It is \n     a distraction from the emergency we are now facing. Focus on \n     the immediate need to save jobs. If Congress does not quickly \n     declare a National Emergency and allow more energy \n     development by cutting through the regulatory processes for \n     permits and opening up more areas for drilling we face \n     economic collapse.\n       Please try to get Congress to quit grandstanding and work \n     on real solutions. Having oil companies CEOs testify about \n     their compensation packages when the details are already in \n     the public record is pure grandstanding, a disgrace and does \n     nothing to help Americans.\n       Read The Bottomless Well by Peter Huber and Mark Mills.\n     Tyler.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9403-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                RECOGNIZING THE BENJAMIN ROSE INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. BROWN.

And starting in the 1940s, the \nBenjamin Rose Institute began running group homes and, later, nursing \nhomes, for seniors unable to live independently.\n  Over the years, tens of thousands of Ohioans living in the Cleveland \narea have been touched by the institute's work and have come to realize \nthe critical role the institute plays in their community.\n  I commend the Benjamin Rose Institute for a century of charitable \nwork on behalf of older Ohioans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9403-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9403-S9404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MARY JANE FISHER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the \nwonderful life of my friend, Mary Jane Fisher, a greatly admired \njournalist and publicist who passed away last Sunday, September 14, in \nWashington, DC, at the age of 90.\n  Mary Jane was a dear friend whose life experiences were as varied as \nthe people who knew and loved her. From 1976 to 2001, Mary Jane worked \nas the Washington correspondent for the National Underwriter, a \npublisher of insurance and financial services trade publications. Mrs. \nFisher, who reported and wrote weekly columns for the company's \nproperty and casualty and health and life editions, was a well-known \nfigure on Capitol Hill reporting on insurance activities. She was a \nfrequent presence at hearings in the Ways and Means Committee, where I \nserved for many of those years, and interviewed me often on health care \nand insurance matters.\n  A former National Underwriter editor once referred to Mary Jane as \nthe ``Helen Thomas'' of the insurance trade press. Mrs. Fisher had seen \nPresidents, Senators, Representatives, lobbyists, and reporters come \nand go during her more than three decades of covering insurance issues \nin Washington. If a congressional committee debated legislation \ninvolving pensions, retirement issues or health insurance, you could \ncount on seeing her at the press table.\n  During one particularly memorable Ways and Means hearing on Medicare \nprescription drug coverage, I watched from the dais as she beamed with \npride. Sitting next to her on one side was her daughter, Susan, who has \nbeen my communications director for 22 years, and on the other sat her \ngranddaughter Jennifer, who interned in the Ways and Means Democratic \npress office that summer.\n  Her storied career, however, began on the west coast. Born Mary Jane \nJohnson in Berkeley, CA, on December 31, 1917, she was raised in \nSeattle, WA. Mrs. Fisher graduated from Franklin High School in 1935 \nand attended the University of Washington, where she earned a \nbachelor's degree in journalism in 1939. After college, she worked as a \nreporter and editor for the Seattle Times, the Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer, and the Coos Bay World. In addition to reporting and \nediting in Coos Bay, in her spare time, Mrs. Fisher also served as \nforest fire spotter, looking for fires started by Japanese incendiary \ndevices that had been carried across the Pacific via weather balloons.\n  Mary Jane, as a lieutenant in the Waves in World War II from December \n1942 until January 1946, served as a public information officer at the \nSand Point Naval Air Station in Seattle. In 1946, she was assigned to \nthe staff handling publicity at the very first meeting of the United \nNations in San Francisco.\n  In 1946, after a whirlwind courtship of several weeks, she married \nJoel H. Fisher, a Washington attorney, who was then an assistant \nsolicitor in the Commerce Department. They were married in Des Moines, \nIA, and Commerce Secretary Henry Wallace served as the best man. When \nher husband became the European counsel for the American Joint \nDistribution Committee, Mrs. Fisher moved to Paris, where she \nbefriended Alice B. Toklas, a fellow Seattle native.\n  In 1950, pregnant with twins, Mrs. Fisher returned to the U.S. and \nsettled in Washington, DC. After the birth of her children, Susan and \nJohn, she worked on Capitol Hill for 3 years as a staffer for \nRepresentative Don Magnuson of Washington State. Later, as a free-lance \npublicist, she represented the National Ballet, the Institute of \nContemporary Arts, and the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, among many \nother organizations, and served as the NSO's public relations director.\n  From 1962 until 1968, she worked as a speechwriter in the Commerce \nDepartment and in the summer of 1968, she served as press secretary to \nIndia Edwards, the special assistant to DNC Chairman John Bailey, and \nhelped handle press for the Democratic National\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\nConvention in Chicago. In the late 1960s, as a free-lance journalist, \nshe saw several of her articles published in The Washington Star.\n  A long-time resident of Washington's Cleveland Park neighborhood, \nMrs. Fisher was member of the National Press Club, the Women's National \nPress Club, the American Newspaper Women's Club, Mortar Board, and \nTheta Sigma Phi, a journalism and communications professional \norganization.\n  From Washington State to Washington, DC, from Paris to Chicago to the \nHalls of Congress and the National Press Club, Mary Jane Fisher was an \nadmired and respected journalist. She approached every assignment with \nenthusiasm and determination to get the story right. I will miss my \nconversations with her, and I am certain that sentiment is echoed by \nhundreds across the Nation this week as we remember her, and offer our \nheartfelt condolences to her daughter Susan, her son John, son-in-law \nBrian, and granddaughters Jennifer and Karen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9404-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF SHEYENNE, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. From \nJuly 4 to July 6, the residents of Sheyenne gathered to celebrate their \ncommunity and its historic founding.\n  Sheyenne is located in Eddy County. The name is said to have come \nfrom the Cheyenne Indian Tribe; however, it was misspelled by the \narea's first explorers and hasn't been changed since. The town was \ninhabited in 1885 by Clarence E. Bennett and then formally platted in \n1892 under the jurisdiction of J.W. Richter. The Richter family built \nthe first store and elevator on what is now Main Street. Sheyenne began \nas a large wheat growing community and slowly evolved into a small \nbusiness community with the expansion of the railroad and increased \nnumbers of settlers. The nearby Sheyenne River served as a constant \nsource of food and other goods throughout its development.\n  As my colleagues know, the Great Depression left no community in the \nMidwest unaffected. Sheyenne suffered greatly as an agriculture \ncommunity, but--- as they had done during World War I and the influenza \nepidemic--- citizens helped one another and fought through all of the \nhardships\n  Today, Sheyenne is home to Hendrickson Park, the Log Cabin Museum, \nand the Warsing Dam. Volumes of the ``Shining Star'' Sheyenne Newspaper \ndating back to 1897 can be found at the Log Cabin Museum. Outdoorsmen \ncan catch anything from a largemouth bass to yellow perch along the \nbanks of the Warsing Dam. Camping, hiking, and biking are also popular \nactivities in this area.\n  The celebration of 125 years as a community was nothing short of \nspectacular. Sheyenne had an all-school reunion, a parade, a BBQ \ndinner, a Bull-a-Rama, and memorable fireworks to top it off. The \ncommunity also honored the newly remodeled and expanded Equity Elevator \nthat has been in operation since 1910. This was truly a celebration \nunlike any other.\n  Madam President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nSheyenne, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in \nwishing them well for the future. By honoring Sheyenne and all other \nsmall historic towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering, frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Sheyenne that \nhave helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why \nthis fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Sheyenne has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9404-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                125TH ANNIVERSARY OF DAZEY, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. From \nJuly 18 to July 20, the residents of Dazey gathered to celebrate their \ncommunity and its historic founding.\n  Dazey is located in Barnes County. It is proudly named after the \nfamous playwright C.T. Dazey. Classic plays such as ``In Old Kentucky'' \nand ``Abie's Irish Rose'' were written by C.T. and performed on \nBroadway during the turn of the 20th century. C.T. Dazey purchased land \nfrom the Mack Brothers and donated half of it to the Northern Pacific \nRailroad to build a new town with the agreement that it would be named \nafter him.\n  World War I sparked life in Dazey giving this ``boom town'' energy to \nbuild houses, hotels, banks, churches, a newspaper company, and a post \noffice. The first baseball team in Dazey was put in motion in 1888; it \nplayed its first game against the neighboring township of Getchell. \nDazey was a thriving community until the Depression. Despite hard \ntimes, Dazey hung on and began to grow again. Today, homes are being \nbuilt and community members have restored the great atmosphere in \ncharming Dazey.\n  The city's 125th anniversary celebration kicked off with an all-\nschool alumni banquet and karaoke dance.

On \nJuly 26, the residents of Christine gathered to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Christine is a small town located in Richland County in southeastern \nNorth Dakota between the Red River and Wild Rice River. The post office \nwas established November 17, 1884, in the general stored owned by John \nMunger. Settled by Scandinavians, Christine was named for the Swedish \noperatic soprano, Christine Nilsson. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. \nPaul Railroad built a depot at Christine in 1886.\n  Today, Christine remains a proud community that has a prosperous \neconomy consisting of farming. The Christine community center is a \nvaluable asset that provides a place for the citizens to gather. \nResidents of Christine are known for their honesty, strong work ethic, \nand living off the land.\n  The community had a wonderful weekend celebration to commemorate its \n125th anniversary. Residents began the celebration with a breakfast \nserved by Christine Church at the community center. There was also a \nparade, a carnival, a presentation of Christine's history, and a \ndedication of the community center. The evening ended with a city meal \nand dance with music from the Plow Boys.\n  Madam President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nChristine, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in \nwishing them well in the future.

Madam President, it is an honor for me to recognize \na man who has made it his life's work to recognize the contributions of \nIdaho veterans and educate the next generation of Idahoans about the \nsacrifices made by those who have fought for our great Nation. Stewart \nPortela, a teacher at Firth High School, is the author of three books \non Idaho veterans. He has arranged no fewer than eight student tours \nback here to Washington, DC,\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\nand to area Civil War battlefields himself, in order to make the trip \nmore affordable for his students. He accompanies his students on these \neducational tours. He has held graduation ceremonies in conjunction \nwith the Firth High School graduation ceremonies to graduate local \nveterans who enlisted in the military prior to graduating from high \nschool. Named ``Operation Veteran,'' this idea has spread to at least \n10 neighboring high schools.\n  Stewart is responsible for the display of photos of all the local \nveterans in the high school hallways, complete with unit designation, \nyears, branch, and wars. There are over 200 veterans whose photos are \ndisplayed at Firth High School. He conducts the Veterans Day program at \nthe high school every year. In 2007, 87 veterans and 600 people from \nthe local community attended the ceremony.\n  As a teacher, Stewart brings history to life. With close to 40 \nstudents in his military history class every year, Stewart is proud to \nbe able to share experiences firsthand with them, like earlier this \nyear when an 87-year-old veteran who served aboard the USS Pennsylvania \nat Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, told his story to Stewart's class. \nIn fact, Stewart's extraordinary efforts were recently rewarded when he \nwas honored as one of three Idaho recipients of the Veterans of Foreign \nWars Idaho Teacher of the Year for 2007-2008.\n  Stewart has been the featured speaker at more than 40 veterans, \ncivic, or church groups, talking about veterans and their influence on \nour Nation. He has devoted many years, much energy, and great passion \nto remind us, young and old, that freedom is not free and that those \nwho have made tremendous sacrifices for our freedom are a heartfelt \nthank-you away.\n  I am glad to recognize and thank Stewart for his ongoing \ncontributions to inspire patriotism, recognize veterans, and promote \nthe civic education of our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9405-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADEL-DESOTO-MINBURN COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Adel-DeSoto-Minburn Community School District received a 2003 \nHarkin grant totaling $454,290 which it used to help build an addition \nto Adel Primary School and to renovate classrooms in the building. This \nschool is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the \neducational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, \nit is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves. \nThe district also received a 1999 fire safety grant for $75,000 to make \nfire system, exit lighting and electrical improvements in the district.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens.

Madam President, on July 19, 2008, American Legion \nPost 75 in Fond du Lac, WI, named its building in honor of James \nMegellas. James Megellas is one of Fond du Lac's favorite sons and this \nis indeed a fitting honor. I congratulate Post 75 and want to take a \nmoment to honor James Megellas' service to our country.\n  Mr. Megellas was a student at Ripon College in Ripon, WI, when Pearl \nHarbor was attacked. Upon his graduation in 1942, he accepted an ROTC \ncommission as a second lieutenant in the infantry and shortly \nthereafter faced\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\ncombat in the mountains near Venafro, Italy. In 1943 he took part in \nOperation Shingle. In early 1944 he was part of an amphibious assault \nat Anzio. Heavy losses prevented his unit from taking part in D-day in \nNormandy. Instead, they parachuted into Holland under Operation Market \nGarden, the airborne invasion of the Netherlands. Under heavy gunfire, \nmemorialized in the film ``A Bridge Too Far'', he took part in the \nfamous crossing of the Waal River.\n  In December of 1944, his unit was rushed into the Battle of the \nBulge. In January 1945, as his platoon advanced toward Herresbach, \nBelgium, against heavy snow and freezing cold, they surprised some 200 \nGerman troops who were advancing out of town. Megellas's platoon dealt \nthem a serious blow. In an act of incredible bravery, Megellas ran \ntoward a German Mark V tank as it was taking aim toward his platoon. He \ndisabled the tank with a single grenade then, climbing atop, dropped \nanother into the tank saving many of his men.\n  In 1946 he led his company down 5th Avenue in New York in the Victory \nParade. His awards have appropriately been many, including Silver \nStars, Bronze Stars, Purple Hearts and the Distinguished Service Cross. \nHe has been honored by the Government of Holland with the Military \nOrder of Willhelm Orange Lanyard.\n  This son of Fond du Lac served his country with honor and bravery. I \ncommend him and congratulate American Legion Post 75 for bestowing this \nhonor on one of Wisconsin's finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9408-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SPENCER, WEST VIRGINIA, CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, today I honor the town of \nSpencer, WV, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Spencer is a \ntown with a long, rich history that is proudly considered by some as \nWest Virginia's largest small city. It is located centrally in West \nVirginia and is filled with lots of character and many wonderful \npeople. And I am proud stand here today to brag about this town's fine \ncitizens and share their story.\n  Even from the earliest days, the people of Spencer have been tough, \nresourceful, and committed to making good lives for their families. The \nhistory of the great town of Spencer began in 1812 when the first \nsettlers, Samuel Tanner and Jonathan Wolfe, sought shelter for their \nfamilies in a large cave. The area was so beautiful that others decided \nto make it their home as well. As more settlers gathered, the town \nevolved. The town's name was changed from Tanner's Cross Road to \nCassville and then to New California when a settler stopped by on his \nway to California.\n  In 1858, the town was officially chartered by the Virginia General \nAssembly and renamed Spencer, reportedly in honor of Judge Spencer \nRoane. Today we celebrate that official charter and recognize all those \nwho made Spencer what it is today, and those who will help fulfill its \nfuture promise.\n  Spencer currently has a population of nearly 2,300. These residents \nhave really made their home a warm, special place to live and visit. \nAnd they're proud of the events and activities that help define their \nbeloved town and honor its history. Presently, Spencer hosts a variety \nof outdoor events that draw hundreds of people each year. The Black \nWalnut Festival is filled with exciting attractions--from baking \ncontests and car shows, to grand parades and golf tournaments. The Tour \nde Lake brings mountain bike racers from all over the State to compete \nat the scenic Charles Fork Lake. These events, coupled only with the \nwarmth of its people, make Spencer a place people want to visit time \nand again.\n  Spencer is an extraordinary town that embodies the greatness and \nuniqueness of rural America. Its long history and diverse attractions \nand its terrific, one-of-a-kind people represent the very best of our \nMountain State. I hope I have given my colleagues and the rest of our \nnation just a glimpse of our little town of Spencer--which is big and \ngreat in so many ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9408-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING WILBUR YACHTS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, growing and maintaining a \nsuccessful small business is often challenging, but in the end, many \nfind that the rewards are beyond measure. Even more difficult can be \nforming a successful and environmentally conscientious business, but \nwith the extra trials come even greater benefits. I wish to honor a \nsmall business from my home State of Maine that has risen to the top \nand has been recognized for its unsurpassed efforts in sustaining an \nenvironmentally friendly business. For 35 years, Wilbur Yachts of \nSouthwest Harbor has helped to set the standard in the field of custom \nmotorboat construction, and for the last several years, the firm has \nbecome an unparalleled leader in helping to challenge Maine's marine \nindustry to protect the State's pristine environment.\n  In 1973, Lee Wilbur left the field of education to become a boat \nbuilder. Over the next 28 years, because of Mr. Wilbur's stalwart \nresolve and unrelenting desire to effect positive change, he \ntransformed Wilbur Yachts into a company that is widely respected both \nin Maine and nationwide for its high-quality boats and commitment to \nenvironmental excellence. For years, Mr. Wilbur collaborated with other \nboat makers, building vessels for a diverse array of clients ranging \nfrom the Smithsonian Institution to pop singer Billy Joel. In 2001, Mr. \nWilbur and his wife Heidi sold the business to their daughter Ingrid \nand her husband John Kachmar, who have embraced the longstanding \ntradition of providing unrivaled products while remaining globally \naware. Under their leadership, the company has soared to even newer \nheights.\n  This year, Wilbur Yachts celebrated its 35th anniversary, hosting \nowners of boats which the firm has built for a traditional Marine \nlobster bake. Coming from every corner of the globe, the owners of this \nimpressive international fleet are a testament to the exceptional \nnature of Wilbur's yachts. Over the years, the firm's remarkable crafts \nhave been lauded by the likes of Power Cruising, Power & Motoryacht, \nand Motorboating magazines.\n  Just as impressive as the company's proud history and enduring \ncommitment to excellence is Wilbur Yachts' dedication to protecting the \nenvironment in which it works. The State of Maine recently awarded \nWilbur Yachts the gold certification in its Maine Clean Boatyards and \nMarinas Program. The program identifies and highlights companies that \nmeet or exceed Federal and State environmental standards in five \nspecific areas of evaluation, including waste disposal and storage, and \nboat sewage and pump-outs. This honor is truly unparalleled, as to date \nno other boatyard has been acknowledged with this designation, the \nprogram's highest level of recognition. While Wilbur Yachts had \npreviously held the silver certification, the most recent evaluation by \nan independent panel gave the company perfect ratings in all five \ngroups.\n  Second-generation owners Ingrid and John Kachmar have led Wilbur \nYachts to improve safety and reduce environmental impact while \nsimultaneously cultivating a company where, according to its motto, \n``Maine Tradition Meets Modern Technology.'' I applaud both the \ncompany's owners and its employees for all of their efforts in \nproducing yachts in an environmentally responsible manner and wish them \nthe best of luck for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9408-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9408-S9409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO CANYON LAKE ALL-STAR LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM\n\n Mr. THUNE.

After a \nturbulent first three innings in the qualifying game, Canyon Lake \nscored three runs in the bottom of the fourth capturing the lead. They \ncontinued their rally into the fifth inning where they scored another \nfour runs defeating the Coon Rapids Little League team with a final \nscore of 7-1.\n  Canyon Lake was led by manager Doug Simons and assistant managers \nJeff Minnick and Steve Nolan. Of course, this historic season would be \nimpossible without the players themselves. The athletes of the 2007-\n2008\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\nCanyon Lake All-Star Little League team, in alphabetical order, are as \nfollows: Logan Anderson, Cale Fierro, Tanner Hagen, Jonah Hanson, Bill \nHendricks, Matt Minnick, TJ Nolan, Mark Petereit, Jesse Riddle, Tanner \nSimons, Carter Wevik, Matt Wilson, and Alec Winter.\n  As a father of two student athletes, I know firsthand how much time \nand effort is needed from parents and families in order for our \nchildren to succeed. It is because of their support that these young \npeople were able to reach this outstanding accomplishment. All of these \nfamilies should be commended for the dedication they put forth to \nsupport their children.\n  All of these players should be commended for their efforts. These \nathletes should be very proud of all their remarkable achievements. On \nbehalf of the State of South Dakota, I am please to say congratulations \nCanyon Lake All-Stars on this impressive accomplishment and keep up the \ngood work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9409-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL GREGG BLANCHARD\n\n Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I rise to pay tribute to COL \nGregg Blanchard, U.S. Army, on the occasion of his retirement after \nover 21 years of dedicated service. He is a true patriot and \nexceptional military leader--a living example of what is good about \nAmerica.\n  Colonel Blanchard and his wife, Barb, both hail from Rapid City, SD. \n``Doc,'' as he is known to his friends, is a proud graduate of Rapid \nCity Central High School and the University of South Dakota. Barb \ngraduated from Rapid City Stevens High School, and from National \nCollege in Rapid City.\n  Colonel Blanchard served successfully in every echelon of the Army, \nfrom the platoon to the theater army. He commanded troops at the \ncompany and battalion level and served a combat tour in Iraq as the \nDeputy G4, V Corps. As a logistics officer, Colonel Blanchard's entire \ncareer has been devoted to the care and support of his fellow soldiers \nand their families. Over 9 of his 21 years were served overseas, where \nhe tirelessly focused on supporting our warriors and their families.\n  He commanded the 701st Main Support Battalion of the famous 1st \nInfantry Division--the Big Red One. In this assignment, he supervised \nthe training and welfare of over 1,100 soldiers and their families. His \nsuperb leadership and organizational ability were critical to the \nsmooth redeployment of the division from Germany to the United States \nduring the drawdown of forces in Europe. Colonel Blanchard's superb \nleadership and positive attitude were contagious and inspired everyone \naround him to give their best effort.\n  As the Deputy G4, V Corps and Deputy C-4, Multi-National Corps--Iraq, \nColonel Blanchard supervised logistical support to all forces operating \nin the Iraq Theater of Operations. His superior skills as a leader, \nplanner and communicator led to several notable assignments in the \nPentagon with tours on the Army Staff, the Office of the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n  The Army recognized the unique abilities of Colonel Blanchard and \nselected him as one of four Active Army officers to serve as a \nCongressional Fellow in 2003. In that capacity he served this body for \na year in the office of Senator Mark Dayton from Minnesota. This \nassignment led to other legislative liaison assignments in the Army and \nthe Joint Staff.\n  When the first U.S. congressional delegation to Libya in 35 years \noccurred, then-Lieutenant Colonel Blanchard was selected to escort and \ncoordinate the logistical challenges and country schedules for the \ntrip. He was also instrumental in improving the Army's process for \ncongressional notification of our fallen soldiers, and for improving \nthe Army's responsiveness to the tens of thousands of inquiries it \nreceives annually from Members of Congress.\n  In his current assignment as the Deputy Legislative Assistant to the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colonel Blanchard provides \ncritical assistance to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and to \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. His advice and counsel is \nregularly sought by senior defense leaders in the Army, the Joint \nCommunity and by Members of Congress and their staffs.\n  For over 21 years, Colonel Blanchard served this great country from \nlocations all across the world. Whether mentoring and training young \ntroops as a commander, providing for soldiers in combat, developing and \naffecting policy in the Pentagon, or working with Congress, he served \nwith honor and distinction. He will indeed be remembered as an \nexceptional officer, a true patriot, a courageous warrior and a \ndedicated leader with the highest integrity and compassion for all who \nhad the distinct honor of serving with him.\n  Barb and their children, Brittany and Alex, have demonstrated \nunwavering support throughout Colonel Blanchard's distinguished career. \nThis Nation is also grateful for their sacrifices that enabled Colonel \nBlanchard to serve with such distinction. Wherever he served, COL Gregg \nBlanchard set the highest standards of service, professionalism and \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9409-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ART DAWSON\n\n Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I honor Art Dawson of Rapid \nCity, SD, for receiving the President's Volunteer Service Award for \nvolunteering 4,000 hours to his community and to the Nation over the \ncourse of his lifetime.\n  Art Dawson's outstanding service for others began in 1950 when he \njoined the U.S. Army. After 30 dedicated years in the military, Art \nretired as a lieutenant colonel in medical administration, but his \ndesire to serve others continued. Following his retirement Art worked \nin the veteran's administration in California and volunteered for 7 \nyears with the Red Cross.

This \naward is bestowed on one Junior Achievement executive annually, and is \nthe top honor for JA Presidents who demonstrate superior results in \npromoting the growth and development of Junior Achievement in their \narea.\n  Junior Achievement is the world's largest organization dedicated to \nteaching students in Kindergarten through 12th grade about the \nimportance of economics, entrepreneurism, and financial literacy. The \norganization reaches over 9 million students around the world each \nyear, with over 130 local offices in the United States and operations \nin over 110 countries worldwide. One of the things that makes JA so \nunique is its use of adult volunteers to bring business to life for \nstudents. In the U.S. alone, young people in more than 188,000 \nclassrooms benefit annually from these positive role models.\n  Kristie is clearly deserving of receiving this year's Hook Award. She \nhas served as President of Junior Achievement of South Dakota since \n1994. During this period, she has increased the organization's reach \nfrom 2 percent to more than 28 percent of all South Dakota students. \nThe organization now reaches over 37,000 South Dakota students, \nimpacting over 1,700 classrooms. The organization's programs are \nprovided at no cost to schools and are funded entirely through the \nprivate sector.\n  Especially in the current economic climate, teaching students the \nimportance of economics and financial literacy is of the utmost \nimportance, and I congratulate Kristie Fiegen and Junior Achievement of \nSouth Dakota for their efforts in South Dakota.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9410-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROSS A.

A bill to conserve the United States fish and aquatic \ncommunities through partnerships that foster fish habitat conservation \nand improve the quality of life for the people of the United States and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the National Fish \nHabitat Conservation Act, which I am introducing today along with my \ncolleagues Senators Bond and Voinovich. This legislation would \nestablish the most comprehensive effort ever attempted to treat the \ncauses of fish habitat decline.\n  Healthy waterways and robust fish populations are vital to the well-\nbeing of our society. They provide clean water and sustainable \nfisheries. They also provide recreational value to those who fish wild \nwaters or canoe tranquil streams. Unfortunately, today 40 percent of \nour fish populations are in decline and half of our waters are \nimpaired. Unless we act in an informed and coordinated fashion, fish \nhabitats will continue to be lost.\n  Our Nation's current efforts to address threats to fish species are \noften highly fragmented and not comprehensive enough to reverse this \ndownward trend. Under the National Fish Habitat Conservation Act, \nFederal Government agencies, state and local governments, conservation \ngroups, fishing industry groups, and businesses will work together \ncollectively for the first time to conserve and protect aquatic \nhabitats.\n  This legislation leverages Federal, State and private funds to build \nregional partnerships aimed at addressing the nation's biggest \nfisheries problems. By directing critical new resources towards the \nnation's fish and aquatic communities through these partnerships, we \ncan foster fish habitat conservation efforts and improve the quality of \nlife for the American people. Using a bottom-up approach, the goal of \nthis effort is to foster landscape scale, multi-state aquatic habitat \nimprovements across the country that perpetuate not only fishery \nresources but the tradition of recreational fishing.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act authorizes $75 million \nannually to be directed toward fish habitat projects that are supported \nby regional Fish Habitat Partnerships. Based on the hugely successful \nNorth American Wetlands Conservation Act model, this legislation \nestablishes a multi-stakeholder National Fish Habitat Board charged \nwith recommending projects to the Secretary of Interior for funding. \nRegional Fish Habitat Partnerships are responsible for implementing \napproved on-the-ground projects that are designed to protect, restore \nand enhance fish habitats and fish populations.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act lays the foundation for a \nnew paradigm of how fish habitats should be protected and preserved. \nThis bill will bring together all of the different groups that have a \nstake in the health and productivity of our nation's fish habitats and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, today, along with my colleagues Senators \nLieberman and Voinovich, I am introducing the National Fish Habitat \nConservation Act. This legislation will enable us to stop the causes of \nfish habitat decline throughout the Nation.\n  Preventing the decline of fish species and their habitat will require \neveryone working together. Under the National Fish Habitat Conservation \nAct, Federal Government agencies, State and local governments, \nconservation groups, fishing industry groups, and businesses will all \nwork together to preserve our aquatic habitats.\n  Together, they will improve waterways vital to securing a robust fish \npopulation. The well-being of our water resources is essential not only \nfor healthy fish but also those who boat through beautiful streams and \nfish in wild waters for recreational entertainment. This, however, may \nnot be an option if we do not take action now. As of today, 40 percent \nof the fish population is in decline and half of our waters have become \nweakened and polluted.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act will authorize $75 million \nevery year to fund local fish habitat projects supported by regional \nFish Habitat Partnerships. This bill creates a multistakeholder \nNational Fish Habitat Board that will recommend projects to the \nSecretary of the Interior for funding. This idea draws from the already \nsuccessful North American Wetlands Conservation Act model, which has \nbenefited wetlands in America, Canada, and Mexico. The Regional Fish \nPartnerships will also be called on to execute approved on-the-ground \nprojects designed to ensure the improvement of the fish population and \nhabitat.\n  By using a bottom-up approach, we will engage those who most directly \nimpact the health of local waterways and fish populations. These \npartnerships are imperative to our efforts in conserving the fish \nspecies and our goal of improving the quality of life for the American \npeople.\n  I am thankful to Senator Lieberman for his work on this bipartisan \neffort and encourage all of my colleagues to join our efforts to \nprotect fish and fish habitat.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\n  S. 3554. A bill to provide employees of small employers with access \nto quality, affordable health insurance coverage; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I introduce the Affordable Coverage \nfor Small Employers Act of 2008, with my colleague, Senator Joseph \nLieberman. This legislation would tackle one of the nation's most \npressing domestic challenges, ensuring all Americans have access to \naffordable, high quality health care. While the Affordable Coverage for \nSmall Employers Act may not be the panacea to all of our Nation's \nhealthcare woes, I believe it is a reasonable first step along the path \nof reform and it represents a viable solution to cover the uninsured.\n  In my view, that solution begins with helping small employers gain \naccess to affordable, high quality health insurance. Over half of the \nNation's uninsured has a connection to a business that employs fewer \nthan 100 employees. By extending access to affordable health coverage \nto those individuals through their employers, we can make significant \nprogress in reducing the number of Americans who do not have health \ninsurance.\n  Broadly, the Affordable Coverage for Small Employers Act incentivizes \nreform of the existing small group market so employers have access to \naffordable coverage options to meet their particular needs. It provides \nnational direction to ensure consistency across the entire system, but \nrelies upon the existing infrastructure forged by the States and the \nprivate market to ultimately provide new coverage options for small \nemployers. Additionally, it provides graduated, income-sensitive \nsubsidies through tax credits to low-income individuals to help offset \nthe cost of their health coverage. It also provides graduated tax \ncredits to small employers who contribute at least 50 percent toward \nthe cost of their employees' premiums to encourage them to purchase \ncoverage through new, regional purchasing exchanges.\n  One of the key principles of the proposal is regional cooperation. \nThe existing system of state-based regulation of the small group market \nhas resulted in a great deal of inefficiency in the marketing and \nselling of health coverage products. One of the key elements of reform \nfrom the Federal perspective should be encouraging regional \ncooperation--and consistency of regulation--across State lines. The \nAffordable Coverage for Small Employers Act accounts for this by \napportioning States with similar existing insurance regulations into \nnew ``Health Coverage Exchange Regions.'' Each of these regions will be \ncharged with developing a common set of rating guidelines so that all \ninsurance products sold in the health coverage exchange are regulated \nby the same set of rules. Over time, such common regulatory policies \nwill have the effect of stabilizing the small group market, and \ngenerating efficiencies that could lead to longterm stabilization of \npremium cost increases.\n  A stakeholder board will govern each Health Coverage Exchange Region \nand must include at a minimum representation from the insurance \ncommissioners from all member States. That way, States will be the \ndriving force in determining how to harmonize existing rating \nguidelines to improve stability in the small group market. Each \nRegional Board will have the flexibility to develop its own common \nrating guidelines, in addition to allowing other hard-to-cover \ngroups, like sole proprietors and individuals, to participate in \nprograms sponsored by the Health Coverage Exchange Region.\n\n  While adoption of the common rating guidelines is voluntary, the \nAffordable Coverage for Small Employers Act provides States with \ngenerous incentives to do so. First, small employers in a given State \nwill be unable to purchase health coverage through its region's Health \nCoverage Exchange unless their State has adopted the common guidelines. \nAdditionally, small employers and employees only will have access to \nthe Federal subsidies once the guidelines are adopted. Change can be \ndifficult, especially in regard to reform of current regulatory \nstructures. The bill recognizes this fact by allowing States a strong \nvoice in developing the common rating guidelines, as well as additional \nflexibility to implement such guidelines in special cases where they \ndiffer significantly from existing policy.\n  Another key issue the Affordable Coverage for Small Employers Act \naddresses is that of ensuring small employers, regardless of their \nlocation, has access to a comprehensive health benefit package. We \nshould not expect our small employers to settle for coverage that is \nfar less comprehensive than what a majority of Americans have access \nto. Congress can and should do better on this front, and the proposal \ndoes. All small employers will have access to a standard benefit \npackage that mirrors the benefits available to Members of Congress and \nother Federal employees. Over time, this benefit package will be \nupdated to ensure that covered services reflect advances in medical \nscience and are supported by sound, evidence-based research.\n  While the Affordable Coverage for Small Employers Act leaves most \nresponsibility for day-to-day operations of the Health Coverage \nExchange to state-based regional boards, it recognizes the need for \nuniformity across the entire system by creating a National Health \nCoverage Policy Board comprised of key stakeholders representing the \nhealth care field. This Executive-appointed, independent body will \napportion States into Health Coverage Exchange Regions and set broad \npolicy guidelines for the overall system. While I firmly believe the \nreforms needed to improve access in the small group market should occur \nat the State level, there needs to be a national presence in the \noverall effort to ensure health care quality, greater regulatory \nconsistency and maximize administrative efficiencies.\n  I also would like to comment on the subsidies available in the \nlegislation. Researchers and policymakers alike are well aware that \nthere are some working Americans who simply will be unable to afford \nthe cost of health insurance no matter how inexpensive it might be. The \nrhetoric surrounding the issue of the uninsured always includes \nreference to making health insurance more affordable and I fully \nsupport that intent. In the work Senator Lieberman and I have done on \nthis issue, we have found that there are very few politically viable \nreform policies that would significantly reduce the cost of health \ncoverage for small employers. We can implement initiatives to increase \nmarket efficiencies and provide employers with more coverage options, \nbut those efforts still will not always make health coverage affordable \nfor all Americans. In our proposal, allocating targeted, advanceable \nand refundable tax credits to those who need them is the Federal \nGovernment's primary responsibility.\n  To further encourage participation in the Exchange and to recognize \nthe important role employers have in funding health benefits, the \nAffordable Coverage for Small Employers Act also includes advanceable, \nrefundable tax credits for employers. Employers that contribute at \nleast 50 percent of employees' premiums would be eligible for these tax \ncredits to help offset the cost of their share of health coverage. I \nbelieve this approach will help employers who may be struggling to make \nends meet and provide their employees the health coverage they need to \nstay healthy and productive.\n  It is essential that Congress act on this issue. We owe it to our \nsmall employers to ensure they have the same health benefit options \navailable to them as larger employers, whose size and structure allow \nthem to self-fund insurance coverage for their employees. The small \nbusiness community is the backbone of the American economy, \nrepresenting over 99 percent of all the Nation's businesses. But we \noften fail to recognize the essential role small businesses play in the \neconomy. Each year, they provide approximately 75 percent of new jobs; \naccount for over half of private sector output; and provide 40 percent \nof private sales. Small businesses represent the realization of the \nAmerican dream. However, even with all their successes, there are many \nchallenges that threaten their continued vitality.\n  In the unfurling healthcare reform debate, there is no shortage of \ninnovative ideas. Aggressive proposals have been introduced on both \nsides of the aisle just this year. With over 46 million Americans \nuninsured and many more struggling with the cost of coverage, the time \nhas come for Congress\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\nto seriously reform our health care system to ensure all Americans have \naccess to care. Should support exist to pursue a comprehensive change, \nthere are several proposals that hold a number of good ideas that \ncombine the best of private and public section ingenuity. Recognizing \nthat many people like receiving their health insurance through their \nemployer; Congress may choose to pursue a more incremental approach--\nfocusing first on fixing the part of the system that is not working--\nthe small group market. For a reform debate to be successful, we need \nto bring all key stakeholders to the negotiating table, including \nemployers. We share common problems, and we must work to develop common \nsolutions.\n  As Congress continues its discussion of healthcare reform; I am \nhopeful that the concepts included in this proposal will be given full \nconsideration as we begin to develop solutions to the difficult, long-\nstanding problems in the health insurance market. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to craft policies \nthat significantly expand small employers' access to quality health \ninsurance coverage. This is the help they deserve, and this is the help \nthat I know we can give them if we put our ideological differences \naside and begin working together to make real progress on this issue.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator \nSmith's small business health care bill, the Affordable Coverage for \nSmall Employers Act of 2008. The health of our Nation's most vulnerable \ncitizens is too often neglected because they lack the income to access \nour languishing health care system. This legislation marshals our \nresources in response to the health care challenge. First, it \nrecognizes that employees, and their families, should not have to forgo \nhealth insurance merely because they work for a small business. Second, \nit provides small business owners the assistance they need to obtain \nhealth coverage for their workers. Consequently, this bill offers small \nbusiness workers and their families, the security many of us take for \ngranted, by providing them access to medical care through a free and \nindependently-regulated market.\n  The health care problem is nearly ubiquitous. Our fellow citizens who \nlack insurance increasingly find access to care insuperable. As they \nare denied care they increasingly stress the delivery system by seeking \ncare from providers of last-resort, such as emergency rooms. Emergency \nroom visits reached an all-time high in 2006. Americans visited the ER \nmore than 119 million times that year, and the number of visits to our \nhospitals' emergency rooms grew 46 percent in the last 10 years. \nResearchers have examined the link between patient access and \nutilization of providers of last-resort. Health policy experts have \ndefinitively shown that patients who cannot promptly and consistently \naccess quality medical care subsequently choose to forgo care and \neventually seek treatment in emergency rooms. Medical care received in \nemergency rooms and hospitals as a result of neglected ailments nearly \nalways cost more than the care forgone. In the end, patients suffer an \nincreased rate of adverse medical outcomes; outcomes that could have \nbeen prevented and medical expenses that could have been avoided.\n  More than half of the Nation's 47 million uninsured individuals are \nemployed by, or have family members who are employed by, a business \nwith fewer than 100 employees. Smaller businesses are substantially \nless likely to offer their employees health coverage than larger \nbusinesses. The smaller a business is, the less likely it offers health \nbenefits. The lack of insurance--and thus access to care prior to \nsafety-net providers--is particularly galling among low-income workers. \nResearch indicates that small business owners want to offer their \nemployees health benefits but do not, because either they cannot afford \nto or they know their employees lack the income to enroll. In a recent \npoll conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 47 percent \nof small businesses said they would be somewhat likely to offer health \nbenefits if they were offered a tax credit and 30 percent said they \nwere much more likely to offer health benefits.\n  A bipartisan approach is the only viable solution in dealing with a \nproblem of this size. I am pleased to introduce this bill along with \nSenator Smith. I am also pleased to see several other health care bills \nalso brought forward with bipartisan support. In prior years, politics \ninstead of policy limited the practical options for health care reform. \nAs a result, the Congress did not address the problem in a significant \nway. We must look past the assignment of political victors and losers \nwhen we champion health care legislation. In the absence of reform, the \nreal losers are our fellow citizens suffering from preventable diseases \nbecause they could not go to the doctor or did not receive care in \ntime. They will not benefit from a merely political victory. However, \nwhile we have the means to provide succor but fail to act, they most \ncertainly lose.\n  Any effort to reform health care needs to be deliberate. Our \nGovernment was established to prevent rash policy-making. Perhaps with \nthe opportunity design health insurance from scratch, we would not rely \non employers to provide coverage as a benefit. Nevertheless, our burden \nis to transform the system we have in order to make it work for every \nAmerican. We need to assist employers who are nearly, but not quite, \ncapable of offering insurance coverage and reward employers who have \nalready made investments in the health of their employees.\n  The Affordable Coverage for Small Employees Act will help small \nbusinesses and their employees obtain and retain coverage. Moreover, it \nprovides a framework for expanding coverage across the Nation. First, \nthis bill offers tax credits to employers and employees of small \nbusinesses in order to abet their purchase of health insurance. \nEmployers paying for a larger portion of their employee's coverage are \nrewarded with a larger credit. Employees who make a lower income \nreceive more assistance. Without an incentive, it is highly likely that \nthese individuals will not receive the comprehensive coverage they need \nand the security that comes with it.\n  Financial incentives alone are not enough though. Small businesses \nface larger administrative costs then large businesses, and consumers \nin the individual market face higher premiums than consumers in group \nplans. This bill will create a working and competitive marketplace \nthrough regional health boards. These boards will allow for businesses \nand employees to shop for medical coverage from multiple insurers, and \neven across State lines. These boards will establish a health-coverage \n``exchange'' whose main objectives will be to serve as a central \npurchasing site for health coverage, to provide information to \npurchasers and consumers about participating health plans, to \nfacilitate and streamline enrollment, and to ensure health plan \ncompliance with minimum operating and quality standards.\n  Third, in order to protect consumers, an independent advisory board, \nthe National Policy Board, in conjunction with the National Academies \nof Sciences' Institute of Medicine, will establish a standard benefit \npackage in order that employees receive the coverage they need. An \nindependent body provides the governance needed to regulate this \ncomplex marketplace while retaining insulation from the interested \nparties that would seek to benefit themselves at the expense of others.\n  There already exists evidence that this approach will work. Several \nStates are experimenting with various forms of tax credits to expand \ncoverage. In Oklahoma and Arizona employees and employers are being \nhelped through tax credits to secure insurance. The initial results of \nthese programs have been encouraging. The Federal Government has been \nparalyzed for too long, debating which policy prescriptions will yield \nsuccess at an affordable cost. These ``laboratories of democracy'' are \nleading the way and this legislation follows in their spirit.\n  The road to substantial health care reform has been long but the path \nin front of us is lit brighter than the path behind us when we \ntravelled it. Over the preceding years, our knowledge of what works, \nwhat is feasible, and what is improbable has grown immeasurably. With \nthis knowledge and a kindred spirit, I am certain we can guarantee the \nbest health care for every American.\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 3555.

A bill to improve the administration of the Minerals \nManagement Service; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Barrasso and I are \nintroducing legislation to reform the Minerals Management Service at \nthe U.S. Department of Interior. Most Americans have probably never \nheard of the Minerals Management Service. At least they hadn't heard of \nit until the Inspector General of the Interior Department issued a \nreport a couple of weeks ago documenting sordid details of MMS \nemployees accepting gifts and dinners and drugs and sex from employees \nof the oil and gas companies they were supposed to be doing business \nwith on behalf of American taxpayers.\n  The MMS is responsible for collecting over $10 billion a year in \nlease and royalty payments from companies that drill for oil and gas \nand mine coal and minerals on our Federal public lands, both onshore \nand offshore. MMS is also the agency that actually issues the leases \nfor drilling to oil and gas companies off our coasts. And when you hear \nthe call for more oil drilling just remember that it is MMS that's \nresponsible for issuing those leases and making sure that oil and gas \ncompanies protect the environment and pay their fair share of royalties \nto the American people. And that should give everyone pause.\n  Two years ago, I stood here on the floor and spoke for several hours \nto draw the Senate's attention to the mismanagement of our offshore oil \nand gas leasing program involving MMS and the royalty relief program. \nThe problem then was the failure of MMS to include a key clause in \nalmost 1,000 leases that would have required oil and gas companies to \npay the U.S. Treasury higher royalties if the price of oil and gas \nincreased.\n  The law MMS was supposed to be implementing was originally written \nback in the mid-1990's when oil prices were low--around $15 a barrel, \nto encourage drilling by giving oil companies a break on paying \nroyalties on new leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The royalties didn't \nkick in until the price of oil rose to a certain point where the \ncompanies would make a profit. Oil prices, as we now know, didn't stay \nlow, but it turns out that ``royalty relief'' didn't phase out the way \nit should have. We learned that the MMS had bungled things so badly \nthat they forgot to include provisions in their leases requiring any \nroyalties on those particular leases.\n  At the time, the Government Accountability Office estimated that this \nsingle dereliction of duty--which covered leases issued between 1995 \nand 2000--would cost American taxpayers as much as $11.5 billion . . . \nand that was based on oil prices of between $50 and $70 dollars--half \nof what oil prices have been this year. GAO recently updated that \namount to as much as $14.7 billion. We held hearings on this problem in \nthe Energy Committee but the bottom line is that nothing has been done \nto fix this problem.\n  We have also learned from Inspector General and from agency \nwhistleblowers that MMS has essentially stopped conducting audits of \nthe billions of dollars of royalty payments it collects, and it has \nallowed oil and gas companies to improperly change the amount they owe \nby allowing them to self-report adjustments to their royalties \naffecting millions of dollars in payments.\n  Most recently, the Inspector General for the Department of Interior, \nEarl Devaney, has issued a report that details his office's criminal \ninvestigation into the Royalty-in-Kind program at the Minerals \nManagement Service. Under the Royalty-in-Kind program, oil and gas \ncompanies are allowed to pay their royalties to the Federal Government \nnot in dollars, but by physically delivering barrels of oil or cubic \nfeet of gas to MMS. MMS, in turn, is responsible for selling that oil \nand gas and turning the proceeds over to the Treasury. The Inspector \nGeneral found that instead of putting the American people first, \nemployees of the RIK program put themselves first. Mr. Devaney's \ninvestigation, in his words, found ``a culture of ethical failure.''\n  I am not going to go through all of the sordid details of what the IG \nfound, but I do ask unanimous consent to include his four page summary \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The bottom line is that this is an agency that is broken and needs to \nbe fixed. The legislation that Sen. Barrasso and I are introducing will \nstart to fix it.\n  The legislation has five major components\n  It requires that the head of the MMS be appointed by the President \nand must be confirmed by the Senate. MMS is the only major bureau \nwithin the Interior Department that does not require its director to be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  It requires MMS to implement a comprehensive audit program, including \non-site financial audits of royalty payments.\n  It gives the Secretary of the Interior 60 days to implement all of \nthe Inspector General's recommendations from\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\nboth the May business practices report and the more recent September \nethics report. If that deadline is not met, the Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) \nProgram would be suspended.\n  It requires the Secretary to annually ``re-certify'' that the RIK \nprogram meets all Federal ethics and procurement laws and regulations. \nIf that recertification is not completed, the RIK program would be \nsuspended.\n  It directs the Inspector General to annually review the MMS program, \nincluding the RIK certification process.\n  I am pleased that Sen. Barrasso, the ranking Republican member of the \nSubcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, which I chair, has agreed to \nbe an original cosponsor of this bill. While it does not specifically \naddress every single problem at MMS, it will begin to establish some \nbasic accountability in an agency that has demonstrated that it has \nnone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the \n     Department of the Interior.\n       (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Service.\n       (3) Royalty-in-kind program.--The term ``royalty-in-kind \n     program'' means the program established under--\n       (A) section 342 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n     15902);\n       (B) section 36 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 192);\n       (C) section 27 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1353); or\n       (D) any other similar provision of law.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (5) Service.--The term ``Service'' means the Minerals \n     Management Service.\n       (b) Establishment.--The Secretary shall--\n       (1) establish and maintain within the Department the \n     Minerals Management Service; and\n       (2) assign to the Service such functions as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate.\n       (c) Director.--The Service shall be headed by a Director \n     who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (d) Audits.--\n       (1) Royalty audits.--The Director shall ensure that the \n     Service implements a comprehensive program of financial \n     audits of royalty payments and adjustments, including \n     physical on-site audits, on the basis of risk and statistical \n     samples.\n       (2) Standards.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Director shall promulgate \n     regulations that--\n       (A) require that all employees of the Service that conduct \n     audits and compliance reviews meet professional auditor \n     qualifications that are consistent with the latest revision \n     of the Government Auditing Standards published by the \n     Government Accountability Office; and\n       (B) ensure that all audits conducted by the Service are \n     performed in accordance with the standards.\n       (3) Inspector general.--The Inspector General of the \n     Department shall--\n       (A) conduct, annually and as necessary, audits of \n     activities of the Service, including leasing and royalty \n     activities; and\n       (B) report the results of the audits of activities of the \n     Service (including leasing and royalty activities) and the \n     certifications required under subsection (e) to--\n       (i) the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the \n     Senate;\n       (ii) the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (iii) the Secretary.\n       (e) Royalties-in-Kind Program.--\n       (1) Initial certification.--Subject to paragraph (3), not \n     later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall submit to Congress a certification that \n     all of the recommendations made by the Office of the \n     Inspector General of the Department as the result of \n     investigations that culminated in a memorandum dated \n     September 9, 2008, and a report dated May 2008 (C-EV-MMS-001-\n     2008), with respect to the royalty-in-kind program have been \n     implemented.\n       (2) Annual certifications.--Subject to paragraph (3), not \n     later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act and \n     each year thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a certification that the royalty-in-kind program is in full \n     compliance with Federal law (including regulations) governing \n     procurement and ethics.\n       (3) Suspension.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, if the Secretary fails to make a certification required \n     under paragraph (1) or (2), the authority of the Secretary to \n     carry out each royalty-in-kind program is suspended during \n     the period--\n       (A) beginning on the day after the deadline for the \n     certification under that paragraph; and\n       (B) ending on the date the Secretary makes the \n     certification required under that paragraph.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                United States Department of the Interior\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Secretary Kempthorne\n     From: Earl E. Devaney, Inspector General\n     Subject: OIG Investigations of MMS Employees\n       This memorandum conveys the final results of three separate \n     Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigations into \n     allegations against more than a dozen current and former \n     Minerals Management Service (MMS) employees. In the case of \n     one former employee, Jimmy Mayberry, he has already pled \n     guilty to a criminal charge. The cases against former \n     employees, Greg Smith and Lucy Querques Dennet, were referred \n     to the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice \n     (DOJ). However, that office declined to prosecute. The \n     remaining current employees await your discretion in imposing \n     corrective administrative action. Others have escaped \n     potential administrative action by departing from federal \n     service, with the usual celebratory send-offs that allegedly \n     highlighted the impeccable service these individuals had \n     given to the Federal Government. Our reports belie this \n     notion.\n       Collectively, our recent work in MMS has taken well over \n     two years, involved countless OIG human resources and an \n     expenditure of nearly $5.3 million of OIG funds. Two hundred \n     thirty-three witnesses and subjects were interviewed, many of \n     them multiple times, and roughly 470,000 pages of documents \n     and e-mails were obtained and reviewed as part of these \n     investigations.\n       I know you have shared my frustration with the length of \n     time these investigations have taken, primarily due to the \n     criminal nature of some of these allegations, protracted \n     discussions with DOJ and the ultimate refusal of one major \n     oil company--Chevron--to cooperate with our investigation. \n     Since you have already taken assertive steps to replace key \n     leadership and staff in the affected components of MMS, I am \n     confident that you will now act quickly to take the \n     appropriate administrative action to bring this disturbing \n     chapter of MMS history to a close.\n\n\n                      A Culture of Ethical Failure\n\n       The single-most serious problem our investigations revealed \n     is a pervasive culture of exclusivity, exempt from the rules \n     that govern all other employees of the Federal Government.\n       In the matter involving Ms. Dennet, Mr. Mayberry and Milton \n     Dial, the results of this investigation paint a disturbing \n     picture of three Senior Executives who were good friends, and \n     who remained calculatedly ignorant of the rules governing \n     post-employment restrictions, conflicts of interest and \n     Federal Acquisition Regulations to ensure that two lucrative \n     MMS contracts would be awarded to the company created by Mr. \n     Mayberry--Federal Business Solutions--and later joined by Mr. \n     Dial. Ms. Dennet manipulated the contracting process from the \n     start. She worked directly with the contracting officer, \n     personally participated on the evaluation team for both \n     contracts, asked for an increase to the first contract \n     amount, and had Mayberry prepare the justification for the \n     contract increase. Ms. Dennet also appears to have shared \n     with Mr. Mayberry the Key Qualification criteria upon which \n     bidders would be judged, two weeks before bid proposals on \n     the first contract were due.\n       In the other two cases, the results of our investigation \n     reveal a program tasked with implementing a ``business \n     model'' program. As such, Royalty in Kind (RIK) marketers \n     donned a private sector approach to essentially everything \n     they did. This included effectively opting themselves out of \n     the Ethics in Government Act, both in practice, and, at one \n     point, even explored doing so by policy or regulation.\n       Not only did those in RIK consider themselves special, they \n     were treated as special by their management. For reasons that \n     are not at all clear, the reporting hierarchy of RIK bypassed \n     the one supervisor whose integrity remained intact \n     throughout, Debra Gibbs-Tschudy, the Deputy Associate \n     Director in Denver, where RIK is located. Rather, RIK was \n     reporting directly to Associate Director Dennet, who was \n     located some 1500 miles away in Washington, DC, and to whom \n     the unbridled, unethical conduct of RIK employees was \n     apparently invisible (although the Associate Director had \n     been made aware of the plan by RIK to explore more formal \n     exemption from the ethics rules.)\n       More specifically, we discovered that between 2002 and \n     2006, nearly \\1/3\\ of the entire RIK staff socialized with, \n     and received a wide array of gifts and gratuities from, oil \n     and gas companies with whom RIK was conducting official \n     business. While the dollar amount of gifts and gratuities was \n     not enormous, these employees accepted gifts with prodigious \n     frequency. In particular, two RIK marketers received combined \n     gifts and gratuities on at least 135 occasions from four \n     major oil and gas companies with whom they were doing \n     business--a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts \n     from prohibited sources. When confronted by our \n     investigators, none of the employees involved displayed \n     remorse.\n       We also discovered a culture of substance abuse and \n     promiscuity in the RIK program--both within the program, \n     including a supervisor, Greg Smith, who engaged in illegal \n     drug use and had sexual relations with subordinates, and in \n     consort with industry. Internally, several staff admitted to \n     illegal\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\n     drug use as well as illicit sexual encounters. Alcohol abuse \n     appears to have been a problem when RIK staff socialized with \n     industry. For example, two RIK staff accepted lodging from \n     industry after industry events because they were too \n     intoxicated to drive home or to their hotel. These same RIK \n     marketers also engaged in brief sexual relationships with \n     industry contacts. Sexual relationships with prohibited \n     sources cannot, by definition, be arms-length.\n       Finally, we discovered that two of the RIK employees who \n     accepted gifts also held inappropriate outside employment and \n     failed to properly report the income they received from this \n     work on their financial disclosure forms. Smith, in \n     particular, deliberately secreted the true nature of his \n     outside employment--he pitched oil and gas companies that did \n     business with RIK to hire the outside consulting firm--to \n     prevent revealing what would otherwise, at a minimum, be a \n     clear conflict of interest.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       As you know, I have gone on record to say that I believe \n     that 99.9 percent of DOI employees are hard-working, ethical \n     and well-intentioned. Unfortunately, from the cases \n     highlighted here, the conduct of a few has cast a shadow on \n     an entire bureau.\n       In summary, our investigation revealed a relatively small \n     group of individuals wholly lacking in acceptance of or \n     adherence to government ethical standards; management that \n     through passive neglect, at best, or purposeful ignorance, at \n     worst, was blind to easily discernible misconduct; and a \n     program that had aggressive goals and admirable ideals, but \n     was launched without the necessary internal controls in place \n     to ensure conformity with one of its most important \n     principles: ``Maintain the highest ethical and professional \n     standards.'' This must be corrected.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       In conclusion, we offer the following Recommendations.\n       1. Take appropriate administrative corrective action.\n       Some very serious misconduct is identified in these \n     reports. While the OIG generally does not take a position \n     concerning what administrative corrective action might be \n     appropriate in any given matter, in this instance there may \n     be significant enough misconduct to warrant removal for some \n     individuals. Given the unwillingness of some to acknowledge \n     their conduct as improper, the subjects of our reports should \n     be carefully considered for a life-time ban from working in \n     the RIK program.\n       2. Develop an enhanced ethics program designed specifically \n     for the RIK program.\n       Given the RIK culture, an enhanced ethics program must be \n     designed for RIK, including, but not limited to, (1) an \n     explicit prohibition against acceptance of any gifts or \n     gratuities from industry, regardless of value; (2) a robust \n     training program to include written certification by \n     employees that they know and understand the ethics \n     requirements by which they are bound; and (3) an augmented \n     MMS Ethics Office.\n       3. Develop a clear, strict Code of Conduct for the RIK \n     program.\n       A fundamental Code of Conduct with clear obligations, \n     prohibitions, and consequences appears to be necessary to \n     repair the culture of misconduct in the RIK program. This \n     code should include a clear prohibition against outside \n     employment with the oil and gas industry or consultants to \n     that industry. Given the considerable financial \n     responsibilities involved, MMS should also consider \n     implementing a Random Drug Testing program specifically for \n     RIK.\n       4. Consider changing the reporting structure of RIK.\n       The management reporting structure of the RIK program must \n     be seriously reconsidered. Given the challenges that will be \n     faced in rebuilding this program, it seems imperative that \n     RIK have management oversight in immediate proximity, not \n     some 1,500 miles away in Washington, DC.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me at (202) 208-5745.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3569. A bill to make improvements in the operation and \nadministration of the Federal courts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Schumer and \nSessions in introducing a bipartisan bill that would greatly improve \nthe administration and efficiency of our Federal court system. The \nJudicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of 2008 is an \nattempt to assist the Federal judiciary by replacing antiquated \nprocesses and bureaucratic hurdles with the necessary tools for the \n21st century.\n  I previously introduced a court improvement bill in the 108 Congress. \nI hope the bill we introduce today will pass the full Senate with \nunanimous support and not be held up by a Republican objection like the \nsimilar measure I introduced 4 years ago. I have also supported past \nlegislative proposals from the Judicial Conference to improve the \nadministration of justice in our Federal courts.\n  In recent years, the job of the Federal judge has changed \nconsiderably. Today, Federal judges at both the trial and appellate \nlevel are hearing more cases with fewer available judicial resources. \nWe have a responsibility to pass legislation that helps them keep up \nwith changing times and circumstances.\n  Our independent judiciary is the envy of the world, and we must take \ncare to protect it. Just as it is the judiciary's duty to deliver \njustice in a neutral and unbiased manner, it is the duty of the \nlegislative branch to provide the requisite tools for the women and men \nwho honorably serve on our judiciary to ably fulfill their critical \nresponsibilities.\n  The legislation we introduce today contains technical and substantive \nproposals carried over from previous Congresses. The legislation also \ncontains additional proposals that the Federal judiciary believes will \nimprove its operations and allow it to continue to serve as a bulwark \nprotecting our individual rights and liberties.\n  First, the provisions in the bill facilitate and update judicial \noperations. For example, the bill would authorize realignments in the \nplace of holding court in specified district courts. It also would \nremove a ``public drawing'' requirement for the selection of names for \njury wheels, which is now a function performed more efficiently by \ncomputers. These provisions would add convenience to the men and \nwomen--who as lawyers, litigants, and jurors--appear before our Federal \ncourts.\n  Second, the bill contains provisions that would improve judicial \nresource management and strengthen the constitutional protection of \nAmericans' right to serve on juries. The bill would make a juror \neligible to receive a $10 supplemental fee after 10 days of trial \nservice instead of 30 days. Juries serve to vindicate the rights of all \nAmericans, including the poor, the powerless, and the marginalized. I \nam glad this bill takes steps to ensure that economic hardship will not \nbe an obstacle to an individual performing his or her duty to serve on \na jury.\n  No American should be threatened or intimidated from exercising their \nright to serve on a jury. This legislation would strengthen the \npenalties for employers who retaliate against employees serving on jury \nduty. It would do so by increasing the maximum civil penalty for an \nemployer who retaliates against an employee serving on jury duty from \n$1,000 to $5,000 and add the potential penalty of community service. \nThe bill also provides district courts with the discretion to bring \ninto court those individuals who fail to respond to jury summons, \ninstead of having their appearance mandated by statute. This \nimprovement would empower Federal judges to decide what action is \nappropriate for those who fail to respond to a jury summons.\n  Third, in the area of criminal justice, provisions in the bill would \nalso clarify existing law to better fulfill Congress's original intent \nor to make technical corrections. The bill makes technical corrections \nto a Federal probation and supervised release statute. By correcting \nthese technical errors, we restore the original intent of Congress, \nincluding that intermittent confinement applies to supervised release \nas well as probation. As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that \nconfinement, even intermittent confinement, is not always the \nappropriate response. I am glad that this provision includes the proper \nsafeguards and limitations to ensure that intermittent confinement will \nnot be abused.\n  The legislation would also explicitly authorize the Director of \nAdministrative Office to provide goods and services to pretrial \ndefendants and clarifies similar authority recently made available for \npost-conviction offenders through the Second Chance Act of 2007. Under \ncurrent law, there is no explicit statutory authority to provide for \nservices on behalf of offenders who do not suffer from substance abuse \nproblems or psychiatric disorders. This provision would fill in that \ngap by providing services to pretrial defendants to ensure their \nappearance at trial.\n  Finally, the bill would ensure sufficient representation by Federal \njudges among the members of the Sentencing Commission. In 2003, House \nRepublicans saddled the bipartisan and non-controversial AMBER Alert \nbill with numerous unrelated and ill-conceived\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\nprovisions, collectively known as the ``Feeney Amendment,'' that \neffectively overturned the basic structure of the carefully crafted \nsentencing guideline system. The bill we introduce today contains a \nprovision, similar to the JUDGES Act that I cosponsored in 2003, that \nwould reverse the provisions in the Feeney Amendment that limited the \nnumber of Federal judges who can serve on the Sentencing Commission. \nOur Federal judges are experts on sentencing policy, indeed they \npreside over criminal sentencing proceedings daily; I am glad this \nrestoration has been included.\n  This important legislation has the support of the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts, on behalf of the Judicial Conference, and \nsenators on both sides of the aisle. Our judiciary needs these \nimprovements to increase its efficiency and administrative operations. \nI urge my Senate colleagues to quickly pass this noncontroversial \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 3570. A bill to establish a National Public Health Coordinating \nCouncil to assess the impact of Federal health-related socio-economic \nand environmental policies across Federal agencies to improve the \npublic's health; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \npublic's health, and I am introducing two pieces of legislation that \nwill help us assure that healthy people live, work and learn in healthy \nbuildings and healthy communities, S. 3570 and S. 3571.\n  Public health is a shared responsibility of both public and private \nentities--Federal, State, and local governments, as well as independent \norganizations and even individuals in their local communities. We all \nhave a role to play, and we must all do more if we are to truly improve \nthe public's health. That is why today I am introducing the Public \nHealth Coordinating Council Act. This bill will establish a National \nPublic Health Coordinating Council, to be chaired by the Assistant \nSecretary of Health and the Surgeon General. This Council will be a \nforum to improve interagency communication, coordination and strategic \ncollaboration across Federal agencies. We should have confidence that \npolicies and programs from one office support, rather than undermine, \nthe policies and programs in another office. Unfortunately, I'm not \nsure that's the case within today's structure.\n  For example, if the Department of Health and Human Services is \nworking to reduce obesity, the 2nd leading cause of preventable death \nin the Nation, how well do the policies of the Transportation, Interior \nor Agriculture departments support these same goals? Are they working \non programs to encourage public safety, or physical activity and \nhealthy eating, as they should be?\n  I look forward to passing this legislation and increasing the Federal \nGovernment's effectiveness in protecting the public's health.\n  Secondly, another significant issue facing our Nation is escalating \nhealth care costs from chronic diseases--health conditions that can be \nreduced if we use our land responsibly and design and manage our local \nenvironments wisely.\n  Our physical environment is not being designed to protect or promote \nhealth. The built environment--the places where we live, work, shop, \nand play--has an enormous impact on health, and can encourage active \nliving and sound nutritional choices. How we plan and build our \nstreets, homes, businesses and schools can either improve or compromise \nour health, and I am concerned that more often than not, we miss \nopportunities to get it right.\n  Uninformed public policy decisions can contribute to health \ninequities, chronic disease, increased sprawl and traffic, decreased \nair and water quality, loss of green space and inappropriate siting of \nfacilities and other unwanted health consequences.\n  However, with good planning, we can intentionally and predictably \nimprove health outcomes, improve individual safety, protect the \nenvironment, and lower public costs. For example, when car use was \nreduced during the 1966 Atlanta Olympic Games, asthma admissions to \nemergency rooms and hospitals also decreased.\n  Obese and physically inactive workers have higher health care costs, \nlower productivity, increased absenteeism and higher workers' \ncompensation claims. In one state, physical inactivity was estimated to \ncost $128 per person per year.\n  So imagine, if 10 percent of Americans began a regular walking \nprogram, we could save $5.6 billion in heart disease costs. If you \ncombine concerns over growing health care costs with concerns over \ngrowing waistlines and chronic diseases, it becomes clear very quickly \nthat designing our environment to encourage walking and physical \nactivity is a good investment.\n  We can improve health outcomes by how we design our environments. \nPeople living in the most sprawling counties are likely to weigh on \naverage six pounds more than people in the most compact counties, and \nare more likely to be obese and have high blood pressure.\n  We can improve public safety outcomes by how we design our \nenvironments. The 10 most sprawling cities had traffic death rates 50 \npercent higher than the 10 least sprawling.\n  We can protect our environments by how we design them. Improved land \nuse, design and engineering practices, and conservation and recycling \nsubstantially reduce contamination of major public water supplies, and \npreserve habitats and biodiversity of species.\n  We can improve social connectedness by how we design our \nenvironments. Building healthy neighborhoods and communities increases \nsocial cohesiveness, improves mental health, reduces crime, and allows \nmore seniors to ``age in place''. Designing our communities with short \ncommuting distances increases time for extracurricular activities for \nour children, recreation/rejuvenation time after work for adults, and \ntime for family members to spend together or involved in their \ncommunities.\n  My bill, the Health Impact Assessment Act, will encourage community \nenviroments that improve, or at least do not harm the public's health. \nHealth Impact Assessments, HIAs, are a relatively new strategy here in \nthis country, although they have been successfully used for years in \nEurope and elsewhere to protect the public's health.\n  Public health is generally not examined in the Environmental Impact \nStatement process in this country. Some innovative researchers and \nplanners are trying HIAs here, including in Los Angeles and Atlanta. \nOne recent example was an HIA for proposed oil and gas development in \nAlaska's North Slope region. Interestingly, they learned that the local \ncommunity was concerned about loss of hunting grounds, increased \ncontamination of their food supply and water quality, and an increased \ntrafficking of alcohol and drugs. Their findings included measures to \nmitigate these health concerns, such as creating a health advisory \nboard and increasing public safety officers, setting up a public health \nmonitoring system and strategies to control spills and contaminants.\n  My bill requests that the GAO identify what works best for assessing \nplanning, the impact of land use and building design, and social policy \non community health. It also creates a national clearinghouse and \ndemonstration program to improve the built environment and promote \nhealth. Additionally, it strengthens CDC's capacity to promote HIA \nprocesses by developing guidance for assessing the potential health \neffects of social policy, land use and design, housing, and \ntransportation policy and plans.\n  I want to thank the National Association of County & City Health \nOfficials, Partnership for Prevention, American College of Preventive \nMedicine, American Public Health Association, and Trust for America's \nHealth for their help and support of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9423-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9423-S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 679--COMMEMORATING THE 219TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                     UNITED STATES MARSHALS SERVICE\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself and Mr. Nelson or Florida) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 684, introduced \nearlier today by Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 684) calling for a comprehensive \n     strategy to address the crisis in Darfur, Sudan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as we wrap up the work of the 110th \nCongress and look ahead to a new administration, let us take a moment \nto consider a part of the world that desperately needs our continued \nattention. I am talking about the tragic situation in Darfur.\n  The United Nations estimates that more than 300,000 people have died \nin Darfur since 2003. In that time, another 2.5 million people have \nbeen displaced.\n  Just over 4 years ago the House unanimously passed a resolution \ncalling the situation in Darfur genocide. The resolution urged the \nPresident to consider multilateral--even unilateral--intervention to \naddress this crisis.\n  The legislation spoke of Congress's hope that the United States would \nnot allow what happened in Rwanda to happen again.\n  Not on our watch.\n  Since then we have passed legislation increasing economic pressure on \nSudan. The U.N. Security Council has passed resolutions and implemented \narms embargos. Members of Congress have met with Ambassadors and U.N. \nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon.\n  And yet we have failed to bring an end to this nightmare--a nightmare \nthat is now entering its sixth year.\n  In May, Senator Snowe and 27 other Senators joined me in a letter to \nPresident Bush saying that it was time for definitive U.S. leadership \nto bring a long-term resolution to the crisis in Sudan. This bipartisan \nletter from almost a third of the Senate said:\n\n       Fourteen years ago the world watched as genocide unfolded \n     in Rwanda. Despite dire warnings and pleas for help, 800,000 \n     people were brutally killed in less than one hundred days. \n     Today the world looks back in painful regret at its failure \n     to take action. Yet, we are likely to face a similarly harsh \n     historical judgment if we do not once and for all take action \n     against the genocide in Darfur.\n\n  A rogue regime guilty of killing hundreds of thousands of its own \npeople--guilty of rape, torture, and the creation of millions of \nrefugees--must not be allowed to thumb its nose any further at the \ninternational community.\n  Yet the Sudanese regime continues to stall the deployment of a \nhistoric peacekeeping force--a force that is still only one-third \ndeployed more than 1 year after it was approved by the U.N. Security \nCouncil.\n  I and others repeatedly have raised directly with President Bush and \nwith Secretary Rice the need for decisive Presidential leadership.\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\n  Senator Biden has held hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee to ask why the administration cannot do more to help with the \ndesperately needed deployment of peacekeepers.\n  President Bush himself said during a visit this year to Kigali \nMemorial Center, where 250,000 Rwandans are buried in mass graves, that \nhe hoped the world would ``once and for all'' work to halt the genocide \nin Darfur.\n  Today's tragedy in Darfur is of historic proportion. It is our duty \nto step in and show the world we really care. But it takes Presidential \nleadership--not in 6 months, not in a year, but now.\n  The United States is not the only country that needs to act. A recent \nBBC investigation showed that Chinese military equipment is still being \nused by the Government of Sudan in Darfur, despite a U.N. arms embargo.\n  The arms embargo--which my colleague, Senator Bill Nelson, has been \narguing should be strengthened--requires foreign nations to ensure that \nthey are not in any way providing military assistance for the conflict \nin Darfur. Yet, over the years, Amnesty International and now the BBC \nhave documented Chinese and Russian military equipment in Darfur.\n  China and Russia are members of the U.N. Security Council and have a \nresponsibility to ensure their equipment is not adding to the human \nsuffering in Sudan.\n  If China wants the world to see it as a modern and responsible global \nleader, it is time to show real leadership on such issues as Darfur, \nBurma, and Zimbabwe. It should no longer use its Security Council veto \nto protect brutal dictatorships. It must be diligent in its weapons \nsales to conflict zones.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Chuck Hagel, said it perfectly in a \nrecent speech. He said:\n\n       Powerful nations must be the adults in world affairs. \n     Anything less will result in disastrous, useless, preventable \n     global conflict.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  I call on China to stop propping up the Sudanese regime with oil \npurchases. Ensure that Chinese weapons are not fueling the conflict. \nUse your full diplomatic leverage to ensure full U.N. peacekeeper \ndeployment, and work with the global community to help forge a long-\nterm political settlement in Sudan.\n  This week Senators Snowe, Kerry, Feingold, Lugar, Brownback, Schumer, \nMenendez, Dodd, Specter, Leahy, Levin, Obama, Biden and others have \njoined me in introducing a final resolution of this 110th Congress on \nDarfur.\n  It urges the President, the United Nations, the African Union, and \nother key members of the international community to pursue a \ncomprehensive strategy to address the ongoing crisis in Darfur. It also \ncondemns the Government of Sudan for its continued violence and \nobstruction of the international community. A similar resolution is \nbeing introduced in the House.\n  Quite simply, the situation in Darfur has reached a tragic juncture. \nThis administration and Congress will either act soon or, sadly, this \ngenocide will have occurred on our watch.\n  A few years ago, President Clinton faced the reality of the failure \nto halt the genocide in Rwanda. He called it ``my great, great regret \nin international affairs.''\n  That was a brave and honorable reflection.\n  We cannot allow ourselves to have to look back years from now to say \nthe same thing happened in Darfur. The United States and the global \ncommunity, particularly those on the U.N. Security Council and Sudan's \nneighbors, have a moral responsibility to speak out and act to save the \npeople of Darfur.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto; the preamble be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; and any statements \nrelating to this measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 684) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 684\n\n       Whereas more than 300,000 people have died and \n     approximately 2,500,000 have been displaced in Darfur since \n     2003, according to estimates by the United Nations;\n       Whereas Congress unanimously declared on July 22, 2004, \n     that the atrocities in Darfur were genocide;\n       Whereas, on September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell and on June 1, 2005, President George W. Bush \n     described the crisis in Darfur as genocide;\n       Whereas the United States has led the world in financial \n     contributions to humanitarian aid and peacekeeping operations \n     in Darfur;\n       Whereas, on July 31, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council voted to deploy an historic United Nations-African \n     Union (UNAMID) peacekeeping force to stem the violence in \n     Darfur and create conditions for peace talks;\n       Whereas only approximately 10,000 of the authorized force \n     of 26,000 peacekeepers and police have deployed to Darfur, \n     delayed by Sudanese obstruction as well as by a failure of \n     the international community to commit sufficient resources \n     and to overcome logistical obstacles; and\n       Whereas more than four years have passed since Congress \n     declared the conflict in Darfur to be genocide and conditions \n     on the ground in Darfur continue to worsen: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the President, the United Nations Secretary-\n     General, the African Union, and other key members of the \n     international community to pursue a comprehensive solution to \n     the Darfur crisis by--\n       (A) supporting efforts to launch a just and inclusive peace \n     process;\n       (B) ensuring the full and effective deployment of the \n     UNAMID mission;\n       (C) ensuring the free and unfettered flow of humanitarian \n     aid;\n       (D) promoting economic and political development programs;\n       (E) supporting full implementation of the Comprehensive \n     Peace Agreement of 2005; and\n       (F) promoting justice and accountability;\n       (2) condemns the Government of Sudan for its continued \n     obstruction of the deployment of United Nations-African Union \n     peacekeepers and equipment;\n       (3) condemns the ongoing acts of violence in and \n     obstruction of aid to Darfur committed by all parties; and\n       (4) calls upon the Government of Sudan and armed parties in \n     the region to declare and respect an immediate cessation of \n     hostilities, abide by the United Nations embargo on the \n     importation of arms, cease predation and attacks upon \n     humanitarian organizations, and participate in international \n     efforts to negotiate a lasting political settlement for the \n     region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/24/senate-section/article/S9436-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9436-S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STATE-BASED ALCOHOL REGULATION\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Res. 551\n\n       Whereas, throughout the history of the United States, \n     alcohol has been consumed by the people of the United States \n     and has been regulated by government;\n       Whereas, before the passage of the 18th amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States (commonly known as \n     ``National Prohibition''), abuses and insufficient regulation \n     resulted in irresponsible overconsumption of alcohol;\n       Whereas the passage of the 18th amendment, which prohibited \n     ``the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating \n     liquors'' in the United States, resulted in a dramatic \n     increase in illegal activity, including unsafe black market \n     alcohol production, a growth in organized crime, and \n     increasing noncompliance with alcohol laws;\n       Whereas the platforms of the 2 major political parties in \n     the 1932 presidential campaign advocated ending National \n     Prohibition by repealing the 18th amendment;\n       Whereas, on February 20, 1933, the second session of the \n     72nd Congress submitted to conventions of the States the \n     question of repealing the 18th amendment and adding new \n     language to the Constitution requiring the\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\n     transportation or importation of alcoholic beverages for \n     delivery or use in any State to be carried out in compliance \n     with the laws of that State;\n       Whereas, on December 5, 1933, Utah became the 36th State to \n     approve what became the 21st amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States, making the ratification of the 21st \n     amendment the fastest ratification of a constitutional \n     amendment in the history of the United States and the only \n     ratification of a constitutional amendment ever decided by \n     State conventions pursuant to Article V of the Constitution;\n       Whereas alcohol is the only product in commerce in the \n     United States that has been the subject of 2 constitutional \n     amendments;\n       Whereas Congress's reenactment in 1935 of the Act entitled \n     ``An Act divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate \n     character in certain cases'', approved March 1, 1913 \n     (commonly known as the Webb-Kenyon Act) (27 U.S.C. 122), and \n     the enactment of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 \n     U.S.C. 201 et seq.), section 2004 of Aimee's Law (27 U.S.C. \n     122a) (relating to 21st amendment enforcement), the Sober \n     Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (Public Law 109-\n     422; 120 Stat. 2890), and annual appropriations to support \n     State enforcement of underage drinking laws demonstrate a \n     longstanding and continuing intent on the part of Congress \n     that States should exercise their primary authority to \n     achieve temperance, the creation and maintenance of orderly \n     and stable markets with respect to alcoholic beverages, and \n     the facilitation of the efficient collection of taxes;\n       Whereas the legislatures and alcoholic beverage control \n     agencies of the 50 States have worked diligently to implement \n     the powers granted by the 21st amendment for 75 years and to \n     ensure the creation and maintenance of State-based regulatory \n     systems for alcohol distribution made up of producers, \n     importers, wholesale distributors, and retailers;\n       Whereas the development of a transparent and accountable \n     system for the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages, \n     an orderly market, temperance in consumption and sales \n     practices, the efficient collection of taxes, and other \n     essential policies have been successfully guided by the \n     collective experience and cooperation of government agencies \n     and licensed industry members throughout the geographically \n     and culturally diverse Nation;\n       Whereas regulated commerce in alcoholic beverages annually \n     contributes billions of dollars in Federal and State tax \n     revenues and additional billions to the United States economy \n     and supports the employment of millions of people in the \n     United States in more than 2,500 breweries, distilleries, \n     wineries, and import companies, more than 2,700 wholesale \n     distributor facilities, more than 530,000 retail outlets, and \n     numerous agricultural, packaging, and transportation \n     businesses;\n       Whereas the United States system of State-based alcohol \n     regulation has resulted in a marketplace with unprecedented \n     choice, variety, and selection for consumers;\n       Whereas members of the licensed alcoholic beverage industry \n     have been constant partners with Federal and State \n     governments in balancing the conduct of competitive \n     businesses with the need to control alcohol in order to \n     provide consumers in the United States with a safe and \n     regulated supply of alcoholic beverages;
