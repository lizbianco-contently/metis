Mr. President, today, the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 4 o'clock, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled by the respective leaders.\n  The Senate will resume consideration of S. 1082, the FDA bill, at 4 \np.m. today. Upon resuming the bill, the Senate will begin several \nvotes: first, the Cochran second-degree amendment to the Dorgan \namendment, then the Dorgan amendment, and then the cloture vote on the \nsubstitute amendment.\n  I understand the managers will be here very soon to seek consent to \ndispose of amendments they have already worked out. Also, Members have \nuntil 3 o'clock today to file any first-degree amendments. In addition \nto filing cloture on the committee substitute amendment and the bill, I \nalso filed cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 1495, the Water \nResources Development Act, which is known as WRDA. It is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation, led by Senators Boxer and Inhofe. I am hopeful it \nwill not be necessary to have that cloture vote and that we will be \nable to proceed to the bill once action is concluded on the FDA bill.\n  Members should be ready for a number of votes starting at around 4 \no'clock today. The first vote will be 15 minutes, and the remaining \nvotes will be 10-minute votes. Everyone should be alerted to that.\n  Another matter which I mentioned last week is going to conference \nwith respect to the budget resolution. The House was slated to take \nthat up this evening. I think now it may be tomorrow when they will \ntake it up, so that message may not get to us until Wednesday.\n  This is a very busy week, so everyone should be aware of the \ndifferent votes that may be necessary. We hope we can complete work on \nthe FDA bill tonight. That is certainly possible; otherwise, maybe in \nthe early morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5623-7", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5623-S5624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, nearly a week has passed since the President \nvetoed a bipartisan proposal that fully funded our troops and also \nchanged course in Iraq so we could responsibly end the war.\n  Although the President's actions thwarted the will of the American \npeople, very clearly, they--the American people--deserve to know what \ntheir leaders in Congress are doing. We are alerting them that we, as \ncongressional leaders, are doing everything we can to work toward an \nagreement on an emergency supplemental funding bill that will make \nAmerica more secure, fully fund our troops, and responsibly change \ncourse in Iraq.\n  Our proposal called for a change in the mission and the phased \nredeployment of U.S. combat troops no later than October 1 of this \nyear.\n  A bipartisan majority of the House and Senate made it clear they \nbelieve a timeline for the reduction of combat operations will compel \nthe Iraqi Government to take responsibility for their own country, will \nreduce the specter of occupation, and will allow our forces to come \nhome.\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\n  The American people believe this overwhelmingly. But now there are \nsigns the Republican leadership in Congress is beginning to think a \ntimeline is necessary as well. According to the L.A. Times, House \nRepublican Leader John Boehner said:\n\n       Mr. Bush risks defections in the fall if the war situation \n     hasn't improved.\n       By the time we get to September or October, members are \n     going to want to know how well this is working, and if it \n     isn't, what's Plan B.\n\n  The House Republican leader now seems to be saying that he and his \ncolleagues agree there must be a time limit on the President's current \ncourse in Iraq.\n  What is also revealing, and somewhat disturbing, is the Republican \nleader is willing to allow our troops to stay in Iraq with a failing \nstrategy until he and his colleagues decide it is time to part with the \nPresident.\n  President Bush--the same President who vetoed our plan--said this as \na candidate about his predecessor, Bill Clinton, and the war in Bosnia, \nin 1999:\n\n       I think it's important for the president to lay out a \n     timetable as to how long they will be involved and when they \n     would be withdrawn.\n\n  We hope President Bush will keep his own past words in mind as these \nnegotiations continue.\n  We are pleased to see the House Republican leader, speaking on behalf \nof his caucus, adopt our view that this commitment in Iraq must not be \nopen-ended, that there must be a timeline. It is surely no coincidence \nthat his views come at a time when conditions in Iraq grow worse.\n  I am reminded of the Easter sermon of Pope Benedict, delivered only a \nmonth ago. The Pope said:\n\n       How many wounds--how much suffering there is in the world.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Nothing positive comes from Iraq, torn apart by continual \n     slaughter as the civilian population flees.\n\n  Since those words were spoken, conditions have indeed deteriorated.\n  In April, our troops suffered the deadliest month of the year and one \nof the deadliest of the entire 51 months of the war.\n  The President's own Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \nreleased its quarterly report last weekend that painted a dispiriting \npicture of waste, ineffectiveness, and failure to achieve even \nminimally satisfactory results.\n  Despite burning through most of the 20 billion American dollars \nplanned for reconstruction, many Iraqis are without basic necessities \nsuch as electricity and clean drinking water. Of course, oil production \nis down. Only a third of Iraqi children are attending school. Seventy \npercent of the kids are suffering from symptoms of trauma that could \nparalyze an entire generation that we are counting on to harvest the \nseeds of democracy.\n  Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki is accused of sabotaging efforts for \npeace and stability by firing some of the country's top law enforcement \nofficials for doing too good a job of combating violent Shiite \nmilitias.\n  President Bush speaks of pressuring the Iraqi people to take \nresponsibility for their own future. Yet while American troops are \nfighting and dying to secure the country, the Iraqi Government is \nplanning a 2-month summer vacation.\n  Yesterday, eight more courageous American soldiers fell; four the day \nbefore. I have no doubt these developments weighed on Leader Boehner's \nmind when he made his comments suggesting a fall timeline to the war in \nIraq. But I know he is not alone. Many of my Republican friends across \nthe aisle feel strongly that a change of course in our Iraq strategy is \nneeded--one that holds the administration and the Iraqis accountable \nfor real results. Many of my Republican friends across the aisle feel \nit is time for change. This is the time. I know many of my Republican \nfriends also intend to be part of the solution on the way forward, and \nI look forward to working with them. We all look forward to continuing \nnegotiations, which we will work on today. I have spoken to Chairman \nObey today. I talked to him Friday. I will continue to talk to him \nevery day until we reach agreement on a bill that fully funds the \ntroops while providing a responsible new course that makes America more \nsecure.\n  No one wants to succeed in Iraq and make America more secure than I.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5624-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to discuss the amendment which \ndeals with antibiotics and enantiomers, which is included in the \nmanagers' package we are adopting today.\n  I offered this amendment at the HELP Committee markup, but withdrew \nit with assurances that we would work it out prior to floor action. \nThere have been constructive discussions among all interested parties \nand I believe we have worked language out that is acceptable.\n  There is a great urgency to this situation, and I want to make \ncertain my colleagues understand it fully.\n  The Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Alliance for Aging \nResearch, the Institute of Medicine, the Resources for the Future, the \nCenters for Disease Control, and many others have been sounding the \nalarm about the growing threat from resistant microorganisms and the \nneed for innovation in the area of antibiotics.\n  Congress must listen.\n  Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg said it well:\n\n       We are running out of bullets for dealing with a number of \n     (bacterial) infections. Patients are dying because we no \n     longer in many cases have antibiotics that work.\n\n  The Hatch amendment is intended to be an initial step in the fight \nagainst these resistant strains of bacteria by increasing incentives \nand innovation.\n  Additionally, the language in the amendment requests FDA to work with \ncompanies to apply the Orphan Drug Act to antibiotics wherever \npossible. Hand-in-hand with this, it reauthorizes the Orphan Drug Act \ngrant and contracts from fiscal years 2008 through 2012. As many of my \ncolleagues know, this act has resulted in important medicines for rare \ndiseases.\n  The Hatch amendment also ensures that currently existing incentives \nfor new drugs are available for new single enantiomers in new \ntherapeutic areas such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and type II diabetes \namong others. In 1997, FDA issued a Federal Register notice \nacknowledging that the policy needed clarification and this amendment \nwould do that.\n  Let me start with the issue of antibiotics and the need for new \nantibiotics to fight drug-resistant infections. Many of us have become \nmore and more concerned that there is an alarming increase in the \nnumber of drug-resistant infections--many of them serious--and we are \nrunning out of treatment options.\n  My first chart is based on data from the Centers for Disease Control \nand\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\nPrevention and shows how resistant strains of infections have spread \nrapidly from 1980 to 2000. My colleagues, this is a very alarming trend \nand sadly, for all of us, the problem of resistance continues to grow.\n  A report many of us are familiar with, Bad Bugs, No Drugs, from the \nInfectious Diseases Society of America, IDSA, highlights the lack of \nR for new antibiotics.\n  Antibiotics are not profitable compared to medications that treat \nchronic conditions and lifestyle issues. Also, antibiotics are taken \nfor short periods of time--unlike medications for chronic disease which \nmay be taken daily.\n  And, when a new antibiotic comes on the market, it is discouraged \nfrom use to avoid the development of resistance. As a result, it is \nfair to say that major pharmaceutical companies have not been making \nsignificant investments in antibiotics.\n  Given that there are few, if any, antibiotics in the drug development \npipeline, if Congress fails to act, we walk blindly into a future where \nwe must fear basic infections we have long taken for granted are not a \nproblem.\n  Medicine changed dramatically when penicillin was discovered and \nphysicians had a tool to treat deadly infections.\n  Can any of my colleagues imagine life without penicillin? I am sorry \nto inform you, we are about there.\n  Over the years, many infections became resistant to penicillin, but \nwe were OK--we moved on to the next antibiotic. We had methicillin--and \nnow serious infections are resistant to that.\n  We should consider what the health professionals are telling us. Will \nwe listen? We are taking antibiotics and our ability to treat bacterial \ninfections for granted.\n  Infectious disease doctors from all over the country have been \nwriting to their Senators to express their support for my amendment. \nThey tell heart-wrenching stories.\n  Dr. Helen Boucher, a physician at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, MA, \nwrote to tell Congress that patients are routinely lost ``to infections \ncaused by resistant bacteria for which we have few to no options. \n[They] recently lost two bone marrow transplant recipients who survived \nall the chemo but died of multiply-resistant gram negative infections. \nIn both cases, [physicians] pulled an old antibiotic off the shelf and \ngave it as a last resort, knowing how toxic it was but having NO other \noptions for these young people. . . .''\n  She wrote:\n\n       As a doc and an American, it's horrifying to know that few \n     to no companies are investing even in discovery of new \n     antibiotics for these infections . . . just this week [she] \n     was presented a case of a previously completely healthy 33 \n     year-old lady who presented to the hospital in Boston with \n     pneumonia and died within 6 hours from community-acquired \n     MRSA. Her story and so many others that we see ALL the time, \n     make the need for new and powerful options to treat these \n     infections critical.\n\n  Community-acquired MRSA is an infection that was historically \nacquired while in the hospital, but now is impacting young, healthy \npeople. We have heard stories of high school, college and professional \nathletes losing their lives or careers as a result of these infections. \nSadly, this infection has become far too common, difficult to treat and \nhas few options to fight it. It can leave individuals disfigured, if \nthey survive.\n  In my own State of Utah, the number of children with MRSA infections \nat the Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City has \ndramatically increased since 1989.\n  Dr. Andy Pavia of Salt Lake City told me that he ``cared for a 2 \nmonth old girl who developed MRSA pneumonia and almost died as a \ncomplication of an otherwise mild respiratory infection. She survived \nand will be going home to her parents, but only after 2 weeks of the \nmost sophisticated intensive care and an additional 4 weeks of \nintravenous antibiotics.''\n  Dr. Pavia went on to explain that the Primary Children's Medical \nCenter sees the impact of resistant bacteria almost every day.\n  In fact, he wrote:\n\n       Last week a two year old girl [who] was weeks away from \n     being cured of Burkitt's lymphoma developed shock due to a \n     bloodstream infection with a highly resistant strain of a \n     gram-negative bacteria. Fortunately, the bacteria was \n     sensitive to one remaining antibiotic. If it had been \n     resistant, she would not have left the Pediatric ICU alive.\n\n  The doctor related that MRSA is an aggressive, difficult to treat, \nform of staph that has spread rapidly within communities. Half of the \nchildren he sees with severe MRSA infections acquired their infection \nat home.\n  This is a picture of Bryce, whose family tells a similar story. He \nhad his first cold 2 days before Christmas. Before then, 14-month-old \nBryce Smith had never been sick. At 2 a.m. on New Year's Day, his \nparents took him to the emergency room, where the seriousness of their \nson's condition became immediately apparent.\n  An X-ray showed that Bryce had pneumonia. A CT scan showed that his \nright lung was filled with fluid. Four hours after arriving at the ER, \nBryce was scheduled for surgery. Doctors found that a methicillin-\nresistant staph infection had eaten a hole through his lung.\n  For the first 12 days that Bryce was in the hospital, the doctors \ndidn't know whether he would live. Doctors battled to force air into \nthe child's lungs, but as they told his mom, it was like trying to pump \nair into a brick.\n  Doctors prescribed high levels of antibiotics, including vancomycin, \nin a desperate battle to fight the infections. For 6 weeks, the child \ndid not wake up. During Bryce's stay in the hospital, he has suffered \nfrom several additional infections. Bryce is doing much better now, he \nwas released from the hospital, but he still must relearn how to walk. \nHis recovery could take several months. As of April 2007, the Smiths' \ntotal bill for Bryce's care is just under $1 million.\n  Fortunately, the family's insurance does not have a ceiling on \npayments; otherwise, the Smiths say they would be in financial ruin. \nBryce's ongoing care needs are decreasing, but he still has regular \nvisits with the pulmonologist, nephrologist, and his pediatrician. He \nstill tires out easily with exertion.\n  The fact that children acquire this infection at home is significant \nbecause we used to only worry about it in the hospital.\n  Last month, there were numerous articles about CDC's concern that \ncases of resistant gonorrhea have dramatically increased and respond to \nonly one antibiotic.\n  There has been much concern over the past couple months related to \nextensively-drug resistant--XDR-TB. Right now, there is a man in \nPhoenix, AZ, whom authorities took action to isolate in order to avoid \nthe spread of the deadly XDR-TB infection he had contracted while out \nof the country.\n  This comes in addition to the numerous reports of our soldiers coming \nhome from Iraq with Acinetobactor--a resistant infection that is \nespecially difficult to treat and the only option is a very toxic \nantibiotic.\n  One doctor we have heard from, in a local community, indicated he has \nseen two patients just this month with infections resistant to every \nantibiotic currently available.\n  That is becoming a common occurrence.\n  Infections disease specialists can do little more than provide \nsupportive care for those unfortunate patients. Without any new \nantibiotics in the pharmaceutical pipeline, there is no promise of a \ntreatment for years to come.\n  Whatever we do to begin to address this serious concern, we can't \nhope to realize the benefit for more than a decade. Drug development \ntakes time and money. Yet few companies are willing to invest either in \nthe area of antibiotics.\n  I believe this chart shows that is the case. As you can see from this \nchart, the number of new antibacterial agents that have actually been \napproved is minimal. The market forces don't work well for antibiotics. \nWhen we cannot rely on the market, government has an obligation to step \nin.\n  The Hatch amendment focuses on incentives for research and \ndevelopment of antibiotics. Specifically, my amendment: Provides \nequitable treatment for so-called ``old'' antibiotics; promotes \ncommunication and education of current law orphan drug incentives by \ndirecting FDA to convene a public meeting to clarify what ``bad bugs'' \nmay qualify for orphan designation; reauthorizes the Orphan Drug grants \nand contracts program which expired September 30, and requires FDA to \nestablish, update and make publicly available information on antibiotic\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\nbreakpoints. This is important to assure that the antibiotics we and \nour children take are effective against bacterial infections and \nminimize the progression of resistance.\n  Antimicrobial resistance is a public health crisis. In many ways, it \nis even bigger than drug safety, a point our colleague, Dr. Coburn, \nmade at the HELP mark up.\n  This is an issue that touches not just the old or the young, but all \nAmericans throughout every walk of life. Antibiotics are as precious a \nnatural resource as water is to a vibrant and healthy community and, \nguess what, the creek is drying up. The Hatch amendment only takes the \nfirst steps to address these issues.\n  If we cannot work together on these more minor provisions, how will \nwe truly combat antimicrobial resistance? What will we say to the \nchildren, soldiers, athletes, elderly and so many others that contract \nthese deadly diseases which only years before were successfully treated \nwith antibiotics? Are we really willing to walk away and leave nothing \nin our arsenal to fight these bad bugs?\n\n  I would like to turn my attention now to a provision in the Hatch \namendment which encourages innovation in another area. This provision \nprovides for 5-year exclusivity for enantiomers of previously approved \nracemic drugs in different therapeutic areas based on new data.\n  Enantiomers are mirror images of the same drug. You can think of them \nas left-handed and right-handed molecules. We now understand that, in \nsome cases, these enantiomers have very different activity and safety \nprofiles.\n  In simplest terms, imagine the biological target is a glove that fits \none hand better than the other. When Hatch-Waxman was passed \noriginally, we didn't contemplate the isolation of one enantiomer from \nan approved drug made up of a mixture of enantiomers and its \ndevelopment for a new use based on all new data.\n  But today that is exactly what is happening. Sponsors are finding new \nimportant uses for enantiomers of drugs previously approved as a \nmixture of enantiomers.\n  Where FDA is requiring all new data for approval of these single \nenantiomers and will not allow a company to rely on any of the data \nsubmitted in the original application for the mixture of enantiomers, \nthese single enantiomers are effectively new chemical entities and \nshould be entitled to 5-year exclusivity.\n  In 1997, in a Federal Register notice, FDA laid out the issue, \nacknowledging the lack of clarity in the law regarding 5-year \nexclusivity for enantiomers and the need to incentivize this type of \ndevelopment. FDA requested comments but never finalized a policy.\n  The Hatch amendment makes it clear that development of an enantiomer \nfor new use in a new therapeutic area based on new data would qualify \nfor 5-year exclusivity. However, in order to address the potential for \nabuse the revised provision limits 5-year exclusivity to approvals in a \nnew therapeutic class.\n  As this chart states, innovation and development of enantiomers may \nprovide treatments in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes. \nWhen it comes to FDA, we need to get it right.\n  I feel we have done a lot of good with this bill, and I voted for it \nin committee with the understanding the issues I raised on antibiotics \nand enantiomers would be addressed before we reached final passage. I \nam glad that, as of yesterday afternoon, we have worked out all \nremaining concerns and I believe the chairman's commitment at the \nmarkup has been honored.\n  I know that some were concerned about this amendment, specifically \nbecause its incentives provisions were fueled by exclusivity. With all \ndue respect, I understand the importance of the generic drug industry. \nWe spoke earlier about the need to get it right for follow-on \nbiologics.\n  But we should listen to the public health associations, who \nunderstand the need to support innovation. Indeed, the Alliance for \nAging Research, Infectious Diseases Society of America, National \nOrganization of Rare Disorders, and Immune Deficiency Foundation are \ndedicated to advocating for patients and doctors and improving public \nhealth in this country, and they fully support this amendment in its \nentirety.\n  The Infectious Diseases Society of America represents doctors that \nsee the threat of resistant bugs every day. They recognize the need for \ninnovation in their therapeutic area.\n  This isn't different than 10 years ago when the American Academy of \nPediatrics argued passionately for the need for innovation in pediatric \nresearch. Some may not remember that the generic drug industry opposed \nthat provision saying that innovation was not necessary.\n  In contrast, I am pleased that we have achieved an agreement today \nthat recognizes the need for this innovation in research involving \nantibiotics and enantiomers.\n  Ten years ago, Congress passed the last major piece of FDA \nlegislation, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, or \nFDAMA.\n  Those of us who were here then recall ever-so-vividly the infamous \nchart of the feet displayed with great effectiveness by our colleague \nSenator Kennedy.\n  I hasten to say many have had recurring nightmares about the horror \nof these feet. The Senator and his very bright staff were ever-so-\nclever in their effective use of this chart. Today, I hope to have the \nsame effect, although I do not wish to spawn a new generation of \nnightmares.\n  I submit to my colleagues, that if we had adequate antibiotics in \ndevelopment, we never would have had to look at these diseased feet. \nWith passage of my amendment today, perhaps this chart can be relegated \nto the Russell attic forever.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues for recognizing that antimicrobial \nresistance is not a brand issue or a generic issue. Effective treatment \nfor Alzheimer's, cancer, or type II diabetes is not a brand issue or a \ngeneric issue. These are public health issues.\n  I urge my colleagues to take these issues seriously and appreciate \nthat we have joined together and not let these serious concerns fall \nsubject to politics as usual. These are growing problems and require \nattention before it is too late.\n  We need to make sure that innovation is encouraged in these areas and \nhigh scientific standards are maintained and the Hatch amendment does \njust that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb).

Today, we are likely to wrap up consideration of \nlegislation that modifies the rules governing the FDA, an agency that \noversees all of the medical products we use and most of the food we \neat. FDA came into being about a century ago because Americans were \nbeing sold medicines that caused injury, that caused birth defects, \nthat even caused death; and Americans were consuming food products that \ntoo often were not safe. Those kinds of medicines were being sold as \ncures, but they didn't cure anything.\n  FDA's first responsibility--first responsibility--is to safeguard the \nhealth of American consumers. But because the products under FDA's \nauthority account for 25 cents out of every dollar U.S. consumers \nspend, there is a pull on the agency that has nothing to do with \npatient safety and everything to do with drugs, both brand name and \ngeneric, and medical device industry profits.\n  I remember a few years ago, when I served as ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee's Health Subcommittee in the House of \nRepresentatives, a representative from FDA started his testimony to us \nin front of that subcommittee by showing us a chart that tracked the \nU.S. drug industry's global market share.\n  As I told that representative, FDA is not the marketing arm of the \ndrug industry. It is the patient safety arm of the Federal Government, \nto guarantee safe products for Americans who consume medicine, food, \nand the like.\n  But FDA's drug industry dog and pony show is emblematic of the key \nproblem this bill is designed to address. FDA has strayed from its \npublic health mission, and this legislation will help to get us back on \ntrack.\n  S. 1082 requires FDA and drugmakers to work together to assure the \nsafety\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\nof medicines before and after a new drug is approved for marketing. It \ngives FDA more authority to prevent misleading drug ads and limit \npatient exposure to drug risks that may still be emerging.\n  S. 1082 is intended to realign FDA's actions with its public safety \nmission. While there are aspects of the bill that I wish were stronger, \nI believe S. 1082 will improve patient safety and ultimately the bill \nwill save lives.\n  Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi, their staff members, and \nEllie Dehoney on my staff, literally worked night and day on this \nlegislation. Other Senators have been there right along with them \nworking to incorporate other key consumer health and safety provisions \ninto this bill.\n  As a result, this legislation will not only help us prevent drug \nsafety crises, it will help prevent the exploitation of the ``citizen \npetition'' process, which delays access to lower priced medicines.\n  Prescription drug affordability is a patient safety issue. What \nmedicines cost determines who can afford them and who must forego them. \nThat is a patient safety issue.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senators Hatch and Stabenow, among others, \nthis bill also responds to the problem of antibiotic resistance. It \ntakes steps to spur innovation and reduce costs in that market.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senators Dodd, Clinton, and others, this \nbill will help ensure children receive the right medicine at the right \ndosage and that they can benefit from medical devices tailored to their \nspecial needs.\n  S. 1082 is an important bill, and it will be a better bill if this \nbody passes the Dorgan amendment to enable the safe importation of \nprescription drugs and rejects Senator Cochran's amendment to prevent \nsafe reimportation.\n  Consumers are importing prescription drugs today. Seniors in Ohio are \ntaking bus trips to Canada to buy their prescriptions in Windsor. It is \nhappening in border States throughout our country because our country \npays the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\n  Our Government isn't doing anything about that. Too many members of \nCongress--House and Senate--are, frankly, too involved and too \ninfluenced by big drug companies. So American consumers are now taking \nmatters into their own hands. American consumers are importing \nprescription drugs today. We can help them do it safely or we can turn \nour backs and simply wish them well. This Senate, and the House, for \ntoo many years, along with this President, have turned our backs and \nwished them well.\n  It is time for something different. Let's help our citizens import \nprescription drugs safely. Vote for Senator Dorgan's drug safety \ninitiative and vote against Senator Cochran's poison pill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have 18 minutes remaining. I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are two amendments I am going to \nbring up on the bill that will be before the Senate. Amendment No. \n1039, which Senators Mikulski and Brown will also be cosponsoring, \nprovides for joint postmarketing decisionmaking between two offices \nwithin the FDA--the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology and the \nOffice of New Drugs. These offices would address jointly postmarketing \ndrug safety issues.\n  This postmarketing decisionmaking is intended to include labeling \nchanges requiring additional postmarketing studies and restrictions on \ndistribution and use of drugs. The joint decisionmaking would give the \nOffice of Surveillance and Epidemiology signoff authority. This is \ndifferent than its present role of being a mere consultant to the \nOffice of New Drugs.\n  It is very important to understand that the core of this amendment \nwas recommended by the Institute of Medicine last fall.\n  The other amendment is amendment No. 998, which Senator Dodd will \nalso be cosponsoring. It provides for the application of stronger civil \npenalties for noncompliance with approved risk evaluation.\n  Currently, S. 1082 contains penalties that are insignificant for \nlarge companies and amount to nothing more than the cost of doing \nbusiness. This amendment is intended to give the FDA, the watchdog, \nsome bite along with its bark.\n  Big PhRMA doesn't like my amendments because they shake up the status \nquo. The status quo includes FDA's debacle, such as Vioxx and the \nfailure of FDA to notify doctors and parents of potentially tragic \neffects of antidepressants on children.\n  These amendments would make postmarketing safety concerns a \nforethought rather than an afterthought at the FDA. These amendments \nare intended to establish greater accountability, break the stronghold \nbig PhRMA has on the FDA, and make postmarketing safety a meaningful \neffort at the agency.\n  Today, through my amendments, I hope to help Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi finish a very good job they started through the HELP \nCommittee. S. 1082 is a first step in setting a new direction for the \nsafety of prescription drugs. As I said the week before last, I am \nheartened by the fact that this bill attempts to address some of the \nmany failures I have exposed over the last 3 years at the FDA, failures \nthat negatively affect the core mission of the FDA. For the first time \nin almost a decade, we have an opportunity to reform, improve, and \nreestablish the FDA as what it should be: the gold standard of drug \nsafety.\n  The bills Senator Dodd and I have introduced in the past were \nintended to enhance drug and device safety and to bring transparency. \nOver the past two Congresses, I have worked with Senator Dodd on these \nbills. One of these bills asks for the creation of a new center devoted \nsolely to postmarketing drug safety, a center that would bow to no one \nbut the American consumer, a center that would be an independent voice \nfor consumers, a center that would reside in the FDA and decide what to \ndo and when to do it when an unexpected safety risk arises from a drug.\n  There is strong opposition to such a center, I found. This is the \ncase even though scientists and epidemiologists working in the FDA, as \nwell as independent thought leaders, believe the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety Act of 2007 would prevent another Vioxx debacle.\n  The HELP Committee incorporated certain aspects of Grassley-Dodd and \nDodd-Grassley bills in the bill before us, and I thank Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Enzi for doing that.\n  During floor debates, I have seen agreements and long-term \ncommitments fall through. It is clear to me S. 1082 will never include \na separate center for postmarketing safety. The way the process works \nwill not allow a new center to be created in the FDA. That is very \nunfortunate. It is particularly unfortunate for our consumers. Senator \nDodd and I concluded a new independent center was the best way to \nensure postmarketing drug safety. But, again, there is strong \nopposition to such a center, despite the fact that it is the right \nthing to do.\n  The wheeling and dealing and lobbying on this bill have made it \nimpossible for a new postmarketing center to become a reality. So \ninstead, I am here to offer a lesser amendment. It is lesser because it \nis not the best we can do. I know we can do better. Amendment No. 1039 \nhas its roots in the Institute of Medicine recommendations and should \nbe embraced by every Member. Specifically, the Institute of Medicine \nstated in its report:\n\n       The committee recommends that CDER appoint an OSE staff \n     member to each new drug application review team and assign \n     joint authority to OND and OSE for the postapproval \n     regulatory actions related to safety.\n\n  Two members of the Institute of Medicine committee which issued the\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\nreport reiterated recommendations in an article published last week in \nthe Journal of the American Medical Association. In particular, they \nstated:\n\n       The Institute of Medicine identified the imbalance in \n     authority between the Office of New Drugs and the Office of \n     Surveillance and Epidemiology as a major weakness in the drug \n     safety system. In an effort to facilitate a collaborative and \n     constructive team approach, the Institute of Medicine \n     recommended joint authority for the Office of New Drugs and \n     Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology in the postapproval \n     setting.\n\n  These experts noted that the FDA's response to the Institute of \nMedicine's recommendations ``represent incremental progress'' but \nsuggest that the FDA failed to embrace, among other things, ``the \nequality between the preapproval and postapproval activity of the \nagency.''\n  Having equality between the preapproval and postapproval activities \nat the FDA is fundamental to real reform. It is common sense. This is \nespecially true when we think about what we have learned from the \noperation of the FDA over the past few years and those shortcomings.\n  As we debate this bill, we are going to hear a lot about the \nimpressive Institute of Medicine study and its recommendations to \nimprove the FDA. We have and will continue to hear Members talk about \nhow S. 1082 addresses many of the Institute of Medicine's \nrecommendations. However, this is one important and sweeping \nrecommendation that is not addressed in the bill before us.\n  Amendment No. 1039 is intended to address that shortcoming. I have \nseen time and again in my investigations that serious adverse effects \nthat emerge after a drug is on the market do not necessarily get the \nprompt attention they deserve. They are certainly not getting the \nattention from the Office of New Drugs.\n\n  Even the Government Accountability Office report entitled, \n``Improvement Needed in FDA's Postmarket Decision-making and Oversight \nProcess,'' stated:\n\n       FDA lacks clear and effective processes for making \n     decisions about, and providing management oversight of, \n     postmarket safety issues.\n\n  I, for one, have seen too many people suffer from the results of the \nVioxx mess. I also have heard from parents whose children committed \nsuicide on antidepressants.\n  This amendment is about making postmarketing safety in S. 1082 a \nreality, not just another byline. Identifying a safety issue after a \ndrug is on the market is the beginning of the process of protecting the \nAmerican consumer.\n  Once the safety questions are identified, FDA needs to be empowered \nand willing to take action to address those questions and to ensure \ntimely notice to doctors and consumers of new safety risks for drugs \nthat they are already taking.\n  Senator Enzi stated last Monday that with Vioxx, the Food and Drug \nAdministration did not have enough tools to deal with the new risks \nthat became evident only after Vioxx had been on the market for some \ntime.\n  But the problem with the Vioxx mess and the antidepressant mess \nwasn't only about having enough tools, it was about FDA managers \ndisregarding the concerns raised by its own scientists in the Office of \nSurveillance and Epidemiology and not taking action in a timely manner.\n  Amendment No. 1039, which is in the Institute of Medicine \nrecommendations, is intended to curb delays when it comes to safety.\n  I have also been told by scientists and epidemiologists working in \nthe FDA, as well as independent thought leaders, that S. 1082 as it \nstands will not prevent another Vioxx debacle.\n  They have told me that the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology \nneeds, at the minimum, joint postmarketing decisionmaking authority \nwith the Office of New Drugs to ensure prompt postmarketing action.\n  I also am afraid to say, that right now, I am at the beginning of \nanother review that will likely lead to concerns similar to those we \nhave seen in the past--a situation where the postmarketing adverse \nevents are severe and the public knows nothing.\n  The other amendment I want to talk about, amendment No. 998, is just \nplain common sense.\n  For FDA's new authorities to be meaningful, there has to be strong \ncivil monetary penalties.\n  I hear that there is a lot of opposition to having stronger civil \nmonetary penalties than those currently in S. 1082. But that just does \nnot make sense to me.\n  Over the last week I have heard members talk about giving FDA some \nbite. Well, let's add some teeth.\n  Civil monetary penalties need to be more than the cost of doing \nbusiness.\n  If civil monetary penalties are nothing more that the cost of doing \nbusiness, you can't change behavior and, more importantly, you can't \ndeter intentional bad behavior.\n  Amendment No. 998 would increase the penalties that can be imposed if \ncompanies fail to comply with the requirements of the ``risk evaluation \nand management strategies,'' such as labeling changes and requirements \nfor postapproval studies or risk communication plans.\n  These requirements are at the core of S. 1082. But, FDA cannot be an \neffective regulator if it's all bark and no bite.\n  The last thing we need to do with this bill is to provide the FDA \nwith new authorities but little enforcement capacity. That's not \naccountability and that won't help FDA do its job better for the \nAmerican people, and it won't punish bad players.\n  That is why amendment Nos. 1039 and 998 make sense.\n  They fit into S. 1082 and its stated goal of promoting postmarketing \nsafety.\n  I again thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for the tremendous efforts \nthat went into bringing this bill to the floor, and I again thank them \nfor incorporating a number of the provisions set forth in the two bills \nfiled by Senator Dodd and me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5628-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis courtesy and for his cosponsorship of this initiative. I, \nobviously, want to also thank the sponsor of this legislation, with \nwhom I am privileged to join, the Senator from North Dakota, who has \ndemonstrated leadership for the last decade on this initiative which is \nso crucial to the American consumer.\n  I rise to speak today on behalf of the Dorgan-Snowe amendment \nregarding drug importation. I know the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. \nCochran, has offered a second-degree amendment to require the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services certify both the savings and safety of \ndrug importation. Obviously, there is concern for the safety of the \nAmerican people. It is one that I appreciate strongly. It must be our \nhighest priority. But we have been at this juncture before with respect \nto drug importation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, twice before we have seen the Congress adopt \na requirement for the Secretary to certify safety and savings before \nimplementing a program of prescription drug importation, and not a \nsingle prescription drug was imported under either the MEDS Act of 2000 \nor the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Americans deserve access to \naffordable medications, and that access must be safe, but\n\n[[Page S5629]]\n\nit is not made so by simply certifying with respect to drug \nimportation. As I said, twice before we have been through this--in \n2000, and of course in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 under the \nprescription drug benefit for the Part D Program.\n  Many who are in the Senate today supported a certification \nrequirement in good faith, recognizing that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services would certify the safety upon reviewing and evaluating \ncircumstances, but that has not occurred. Most would not think such a \ncertification would block Americans from legally importing medications. \nThat is because for years we have seen our constituents--and certainly \nthose from my State of Maine--using Canadian pharmacies, and both the \nsafety and savings were indisputable. Yet certification did not arrive.\n  As a result, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nSecretary Shalala, declined to make the certification with respect to \nthe MEDS Act, and we know she did so because of three specific flaws in \nthe law, each of which this legislation addresses.\n  After the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act, which included \nthe prescription drug program, we saw that former Secretary Thompson \ncould not certify importation. The fact is, it is patently unfair to \nask the Secretary to make such a certification, especially as to \nsafety. That is because you must give the Secretary the resources and \nthe authority to implement measures to make prescription drugs and \ntheir distribution as safe as possible.\n  So it comes as no surprise that given no standards, no authority, and \nno resources, we have failed to see a Secretary provide certification \nover the last 7 years. Secretary Thompson understood this well. He said \nit simply:\n\n       The law is this: In order to import drugs from any country, \n     and especially Canada, I have to certify that all those drugs \n     are safe. That is an impossible thing. If Congress wants to \n     import drugs, they should take that provision out.\n\n  The certification of savings is no less of a red herring. In fact, it \nhas become a persistent roadblock every time we have passed \ncertification to allow drug importation by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. Without a doubt, Americans would not purchase imported \nmedications if substantial savings were not being realized. Indeed, the \nCongressional Budget Office has told us the countries from which we \nwould import under this bill pay 35 to 55 percent less for brand \nprescription drugs and that we can realize a drug savings alone of $50 \nbillion over 10 years. It should be patently obvious the savings part \nof certifying importation is a nonissue.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed those savings \nagain, estimating that in addition to consumer savings, the Federal \nGovernment would save $10.6 billion--including the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs that would achieve indisputable savings. Every cent \nof that savings, the CBO estimates, will be lost if the Cochran \namendment is adopted because, as we all know, there would be no legal \nimportation.\n  The savings are clear. Yet the advocates of certification continue to \ninsist certification is critical--particularly regarding safety. Yet \nwhat is needed is not a certification requirement, which simply is a \nstamp on the status quo, but real action to assure the safety of \nprescription drugs.\n  By way of analogy, I would like to know where we would be if we \napplied this simple certification approach to other areas. Consider air \ntravel. Americans embark on thousands of flights every day, but the \ntravel of millions is not dependent on certifying the status quo. We \nrely on regulation and oversight of the aircraft that fly and their \nmaintenance--of the individuals who crew, service, and direct those \naircraft--of every critical aspect of aviation. If we were waiting for \nthe FAA and its international partners to simply say flying is safe \nrather than acting to make it safe, we simply wouldn't have commercial \nair travel.\n  I note that last week, as the Senate discussed problems with both the \ndrug and food safety, I did not hear my colleagues suggest FDA certify \nthat imported food is safe. We, instead, spoke about measures to make \nit so. That points to what this amendment is about--not ensuring safety \nbut blocking fair access to imports for Americans.\n\n  The fact is, Americans simply cannot see why it is that they cannot \nbe provided a safe and effective system, which is exactly what the \nDorgan-Snowe amendment does and what this legislation has been drafted \nto accomplish year in and year out. We have taken every conceivable \nconcern regarding safety and incorporated it in this legislation.\n  As you can see on this chart, we incorporate 31 provisions. Compare \nthat to the Medicare Modernization Act, which included the Part D \nprescription drug program for seniors, that included only six safety-\nrelated provisions. We included 31 different provisions. That is \ncrucial to understanding that this sets up a system that will allow FDA \ninspectors to approve registered prescription drugs imported from other \ncountries--in fact, countries that meet or exceed our standards. \nCompare that, for example, to the fact that the FDA approves \nmanufacturing facilities in other countries that actually have lower \nstandards than our country does. We allow medications to be \nmanufactured in other countries with lower standards than what we have. \nYet we are now saying we will not allow importations of medications \nfrom countries that meet or exceed our standards.\n  At a time in which American consumers are paying 35 to 55 percent \nmore for drugs than foreign consumers--in fact, paying the highest \nprices in the world--this amounts to $99 billion more than the foreign \nconsumers. That is what Americans pay today. Some would say: Oh, that \naffects research and development. Well, no, not exactly. In fact, the \npharmaceutical industry spends about 10 percent of that $99 billion. So \nabout $10 billion in research and development more than they do in \nEurope. So we are not seeing the increase in prices that Americans pay \nbeing channeled into more research and development. It simply is not \nthe case.\n  What this does say is that American consumers are paying more than \nanyone else in the world. Not only are they paying more for their \ndrugs, but American taxpayers are underwriting the research and \ndevelopment, as we have seen obviously with the National Institutes of \nHealth. The taxpayer understands how important it is that the Federal \nGovernment remain on the vanguard of research and development of life-\nthreatening medications, and not only are they paying for the research \nand development that benefits foreign consumers, who are paying 35 to \n55 percent less, but they are also paying the highest prices in the \nworld.\n  That is why this legislation allowing for drug importation is so \nessential. We have addressed every safety concern. We create a regime \nfor tracking the shipments, creating a pedigree, creating a history \nwith FDA approval--inspected and registered. So I would urge the \nMembers of the Senate to defeat this certification amendment and to \nsupport the Dorgan-Snowe amendment.

Mr. President, hopefully during this afternoon we will \nhave a chance to move irrevocably toward bringing the FDA into the 21st \ncentury, in terms of safety and security for American families. We do \nthat with our primary focus making sure that in this time of the life \nsciences, the extraordinary breakthroughs we are seeing every single \nday, that the Food and Drug Administration is going to bring those new \nopportunities to American families but do it safely and do it \nefficaciously and do it in a way which is going to ensure that every \nfamily in America is going to have safe prescription drugs and safe \nproducts over which the FDA has jurisdiction.\n  I thank my friend from Wyoming for all his good work. We are going to \nhave a series of three votes, and then we may very well set a pathway, \nhopefully, toward a successful conclusion of this legislation. He and I \nare both eager to see this legislation in the conference to work out, \nwith the House of Representatives, the points of difference with the \nHouse. We are also eager to work out the extremely important area of \nthe follow-on biologics. It is an enormously important area of public \nhealth, and it is going to demand a great deal of time and careful \nattention to make sure we get that issue correct.\n  It is important to not fail the American people but to see progress \nmade in addressing this issue. The only way we can do it is make sure \nwe get legislation that is going to pass the Senate, pass the House of \nRepresentatives, and move into conference. We are strongly committed to \ndoing that.\n  I commend our colleagues for all their good work and assistance. We \nhad a rigorous markup in our committee for several hours. There were a \nnumber of different amendments. We have addressed the issue of food \nsafety with the Durbin amendment. This issue has been on the front \npages all over this country and all over the world, particularly with \nregard to pet food as well as food safety generally. This legislation \nwill go a long way toward giving assurances to American families that \nall of our food products are going to be safe and secure.\n  There are other provisions such as developing a nonprofit foundation \nso we can draw from the private sector and the public sector to make \nsure that agency is going to have the best of new techniques and new \nmodalities, and to try to make sure the products that are before the \nAgency are going to be safe and secure and available as fast as \npossible. There will be a new emphasis in terms of science and also, as \nmy friend from Wyoming points out, a toolbox that will be available to \nthe FDA in order to ensure that we can get drugs more rapidly to the \nconsumer but make sure they will be safer for American families, using \nthe best of new technology, information technology, to make sure they \nare going to be more safe.\n  I am enormously appreciative of the work of my friend from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, on the issue of cost and price. Part of this is \nmaking sure we are going to have drugs that will be safe, but we also \nwant to make them accessible and available. I commend him and all those \nwho have been a part of this process. This is certainly an aspect of \nthe prescription drug issue that we should constantly address.\n  I thank Senator Roberts and Senator Harkin for working with Senator \nEnzi and me on the important issue of DTC, direct-to-consumer \nadvertising. We have accomplished our common goal of a constitutionally \nsound, effective, workable way to make sure that DTC ads provide \naccurate information to patients about the drugs they are taking. This \namendment strikes the moratorium on DTC ads that had given rise to \nConstitutional concerns, and I think we have a very solid resolution. I \nwish to thank Senators Stabenow, Brown, Lott, Thune, Coburn and Hatch \nfor reaching agreement on the difficult issue of citizens petitions. \nTheir amendment prohibits the abuse of the citizens petition process, a \nprocess that led to unwarranted delays in the approval process of FDA \ndrugs, while making certain the FDA can review issues that have merit. \nThe list also includes a novel proposal from Senator Brownback and \nSenator Brown to encourage the development of new therapies for \nneglected diseases. Under this innovative and thoughtful proposal, \ncompanies that have developed new treatments or vaccines for tropical \ndiseases will receive a credit entitling them to a priority review at \nFDA for a product of their choosing. The proposal will not raise costs \nto consumers nor will it change safety standards. It is a very solid, \nimaginative, and creative approach. I commend Senator Hatch for his \namendment on antibiotics, as well Senators Brown, Burr, Stabenow and \nothers for contributing important proposals to this amendment.\n  The amendment strikes the right balance between innovation and \naccess, and closes a loophole that eliminated the incentives to bring \nold but never approved antibiotics to market.\n  If there were more time, I would describe other amendments on the \nlist, but I simply wish to thank all our colleagues. This issue is a \nmatter of enormous importance and incredible consequence to the safety \nand security of the American consumer. This legislation brings the FDA \ninto the 21st century. I commend my friend and colleague Senator Enzi \nfor all his work. Most of all, I want to thank our staffs. They have \nbeen tireless, over this past week, on a variety of different \namendments and prior to that time as we worked our way to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  This is a very comprehensive bill. It is enormously important. We \nbelieve it will help in providing greater safety for American families, \ngreater innovativeness in terms of breakthrough drugs and in terms of \nfood safety, and greater opportunities for the FDA to have the best \nscience there is.\n  Mr. President, whatever remaining time that I have, I yield it to the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will allow the Senator from Kansas, if \nhe would prefer, to proceed for his 5 minutes, asking that I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes following his presentation.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I \nthank the distinguished Senator from Vermont for allowing me to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5630-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5630-S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISASTER IN GREENSBURG, KANSAS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. My colleagues, last Friday evening the town of \nGreensburg, KS, was literally wiped off the map by an enormous, mile-\nand-a-half, level 5 tornado. As a result of this and storms associated \nwith the system, 12 Kansans are confirmed dead--and I fear that number \nmay still rise--and all of the 1,500 residents of Greensburg have been \ndisplaced.\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\n  What we have experienced in Greensburg is unlike any other event in \nrecent Kansas history. The hospital is gone. The schools are gone. \nEvery church is gone. Virtually every business in the community is \ngone, including all of Main Street. Estimates are that fully 95 percent \nof the structures in the town are damaged and destroyed.\n  But this is not all. Even as cleanup is starting, more storms \ncontinue to pound our State. Flooding and strong storms continue to \ncompound the problem.\n  Too often, while government does not communicate and work well as \npartners in times of need and emergency, sometimes we could double that \nfor Congress. However, this weekend my fellow Kansas Congressman and \nthe Governor of Kansas and I all toured the devastated town of \nGreensburg. We were accompanied by our State's top-notch emergency \nofficials. I spoke extensively with all levels of FEMA, in an effort to \nmake sure they had everything they needed to move into place, and I \ntalked to President Bush to give him a personal update from a \nMcDonald's in Pratt, KS. Let me tell you, there is nothing quite like \nspeaking to the President of the United States from a phonebooth in a \nlocal McDonald's to let the surrounding residents know their Government \ndoes mean business.\n  The President has been very supportive. We have been notified by the \nWhite House that he will be making a trip to Kansas to personally view \nthe damage and visit with the people of Greensburg. The credit for this \nnot only falls on Federal shoulders but those of our National Guard, \nall of the first responders, Red Cross, and many volunteers who, along \nwith President Bush and the FEMA team and our State officials, are now \nworking 24/7 to make it possible for the residents of Greensburg to \nrebuild and return home.\n  I stood here this winter, following a blizzard that buried much of \nwestern Kansas, and proclaimed the resiliency of Kansans, our \nwillingness to help each other and our sheer determination when faced \nwith great odds. That determination is being tested again, but I have \nno doubt in the coming days and weeks and months that the story of \nGreensburg will progress from one of horrible tragedy to one of \noptimism and hope for the future as we help one another rebuild, one \nbrick at a time. It may be possible, indeed likely, that as we move \nforward, we may need additional emergency assistance or legislation \nfrom Congress to assist the residents of the town that no longer \nexists. I put our Senate leadership and all our colleagues on notice \ntoday that we will likely be coming to you with any requests for \nassistance to rebuild this Kansas community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5631-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5631-S5632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DRUG ADVERTISING\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member \nEnzi and all of my colleagues for accepting my amendment to improve the \ndrug advertisement provisions included in S. 1082, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act.\n  My amendment, replaces the drug advertisement provisions in the \nunderlying bill with what I believe is a more commonsense approach to \ndealing with prescription drug advertisements.\n  During the markup of this bill in the HELP Committee a few weeks ago, \nthe chairman and Ranking Member Enzi committed to working with me to \naddress my concerns on this issue. This amendment represents the result \nof our efforts to achieve an outcome that is acceptable to all of us.\n  I also want to thank Senators Harkin, Burr, and Coburn for their \nleadership on this issue and for cosponsoring my amendment.\n  Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi, I want to say that I truly \nappreciate the hard work you both have done in putting together this \nbill. I know you and your staff have put in many long months of work to \nget us to this point.\n  I specifically want to thank David Bowen of Chairman Kennedy's staff \nand Amy Muhlberg of Senator Enzi's staff for working so closely with me \nand my office on finding a resolution on the drug advertising issue. \nDavid and Amy, I appreciate your commitment and professionalism in \nhelping us to achieve this compromise.\n  While I strongly support the goals of this legislation to ensure drug \nsafety and to renew some very important prescription drug and medical \ndevice programs, I have serious concerns with provisions in the \nunderlying bill regarding drug advertising. I believe these provisions \nwould infringe on our first amendment rights to free speech.\n  Of most concern to me is a provision in the underlying bill to give \nthe Secretary the discretion to institute a 2-year ban on advertising \nfor new drugs and related restrictions on drug advertising.\n  As a former editor and reporter for several newspapers, I feel that \nthese provisions violate the first amendment and would do nothing to \naddress concerns that have been expressed with drug advertising. \nInstead, we would have a situation where the Secretary would become the \neditor for all prescription drug advertisements and could ban drug \nadvertising for up to 2 years.\n  This would certainly put us on a slippery slope to restricting \nadvertisements in other industries, and I don't think that is a \nresponsible approach.\n  The freedom that is guaranteed to us under the first amendment \ndemands that we carefully consider any proposal that would impose a ban \nor other limitation on speech. The first amendment says, ``Congress \nshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . .'' For \nmore than three decades, this protection has been extended to speech in \nthe form of advertising, or commercial speech.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has set down an explicit four-part test--known \nas the Central Hudson test--to determine if a speech restriction \nviolates the first amendment.\n  I believe the advertising provisions in the underlying bill fail the \nkey parts of that test and my view is supported by constitutional \nexperts, including the American Civil Liberties Union--ACLU, the \nWashington Legal Foundation and several other constitutional experts.\n  However, I understand that there are strong concerns with drug \nadvertising. I agree that we have a legitimate interest in ensuring \nthese advertisements are not false or misleading. This is why my \namendment takes a reasonable and commonsense approach to deal with drug \nadvertisements.\n  My amendment stresses the importance of assuring that advertising is \naccurate and balanced and recognizes that companies should be held \naccountable if their ads are false or misleading.\n  My amendment strikes the 2-year moratorium on advertising in the \nunderlying bill and instead allows the Secretary to assess civil \nmonetary penalties--up to $150,000 for the first violation and $300,000 \nfor subsequent violations--on drug companies that produce false or \nmisleading ads.\n  This will ensure that patients will know truthful and accurate \ninformation about new prescription medications in a timely manner, \nrather than having to wait until 2 years after their arrival in the \nmarketplace.\n  My amendment also allows the Secretary to require the disclosure of a \nserious risk or date of approval of the drug in the advertisement if he \nor she believes the ad would be false or misleading without the \ndisclosures.\n  My amendment requires that major statements about a drug's side \neffects, contraindications and effectiveness in television or radio ads \nbe presented in a clear and conspicuous manner so as not to mislead the \npublic.\n  My amendment also does not change the current language in the \nunderlying bill which allows the Secretary to review direct-to-consumer \nads before a drug company disseminates these ads to the public.\n  This will allow the FDA to comment and provide constructive feedback \nto companies to ensure their ads are appropriate and not misleading. \nMany companies are already submitting their ads to the FDA for review.\n  Truthful and accurate prescription drug ads do provide a benefit to \nthe public. Research has shown that people are more likely to go to the \ndoctor, ask thoughtful questions and discuss sensitive health issues \nwith their doctors as a result of DTC ads.\n  My amendment ensures these positive aspects of advertising will \ncontinue, but also gives the FDA the tools\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\nthey need to protect the public from false or misleading prescription \ndrug ads.\n  The agreement that was accepted today is a fair compromise that \naddresses the concerns of all of the Members involved.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and Ranking Member Enzi for their efforts \nto work on this important issue, and I thank all of my colleagues for \naccepting my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Webb as a cosponsor of the \nDrug Safety Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5632-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5632-S5634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DRUG IMPORTATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if and when we pass the underlying bill, \nwe will have advanced this country's interests, I believe. But if we \npass this bill by adding the Cochran amendment, which effectively kills \nthe underlying amendment on which we have now voted cloture last \nThursday, dealing with the safe importation of FDA-approved drugs at a \nmuch lower price--if we kill that by agreeing to the Cochran amendment, \nwe will have substantially diminished the opportunity to provide for \ndrug safety. That is a fact.\n  The underlying bill doesn't have in it what we have in the Dorgan-\nSnowe amendment, for which we have 33 cosponsors. We have pedigree \nrequirements. We have serial requirements to be written on the pill \nbottles. We have anticounterfeiting measures. We have addressed all of \nthose issues in the amendment. None of those requirements exist today, \nand none of those will exist with the domestic drug supply or with \nimported drugs when this legislation passes.\n  The only way those provisions will exist is if we defeat the Cochran \namendment and then pass the amendment that we have offered, allowing \nfor the safe reimportation of prescription drugs, because we put the \nsafety provisions in our amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to show once again two \nbottles of Lipitor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a prescription drug made in Ireland. It is made \nin Ireland. It is called Lipitor. It is for the reduction of \ncholesterol. It lowers your cholesterol--the same pill, put in the same \nbottle, made by the same company, made in the same FDA-approved plant. \nIt has only one difference--only one. That is, this one costs twice as \nmuch. Why? Because this one was sent to Canada and this was sent to the \nUnited States. The U.S. consumer is told: Congratulations, you get to \npay twice as much for the prescription drug.\n  But that is not unusual. It is happening all the time.\n  Let's talk about counterfeiting. This is a $20 bill. This is a new \n$20 bill, you know, the ones we brag about, the ones the mint has press \nconferences about. We have all kinds of technology in this $20 bill to \nprevent and prohibit counterfeiters from reproducing this $20 bill.\n  We can build a technology in a $20 bill to prevent counterfeiting, \nbut we can't do it for medicine? Are you kidding me? What we have \nprovided in this amendment is a series of steps: complete pedigree, \nserial numbers, RFID technology and anticounterfeiting measures. We can \ndo it for a $20 bill but not for a bottle of medicine? Don't believe \nit.\n  We are going to vote at 4 o'clock. The question is going to be: Will \nthe pharmaceutical industry have their way once again, as they have so \noften?\n  Let me make a point that is important. The Cochran amendment is \nalready law. It was passed in 2003--in 2003. It already exists in law. \nThe result is the Secretary of Health and Human Services says it can't \nbe implemented because I can't certify there is no risk. The fact is \nthe Secretary can't certify there is no risk with any new drug. He \ncouldn't certify there is no risk with spinach coming from Mexico or \nstrawberries coming from any other country. He couldn't certify there \nis no risk with any food product being imported. They can't certify \nthere is no risk with the domestic drug supply. In fact, the domestic \ndrug supply, without our amendment, will be dramatically less safe \nbecause you will not have the protections we put in this amendment.\n  The pharmaceutical industry has never wanted them, and the underlying \nbill doesn't include them. It doesn't include the anticounterfeiting \nprovisions. It doesn't include the pedigree, the serial requirement on \nthe individual bottles to track back. It does not include that. That is \na fact.\n  So don't vote for the Cochran amendment and then tell people you want \nto allow Americans to import FDA-approved, lower priced drugs. The \nquestion is this: Should the American people be paying the highest \nprices in the world for prescription drugs? The answer is, no; it is \nnot fair.\n  Why should that be the case, that we should pay the highest prices in \nthe world? So we have put together a piece of legislation--bipartisan, \npeople on both sides of the aisle, 33 cosponsors. Then we are told, \nwell, it is unsafe to do this. It is unsafe.\n  That is nonsense. It is not unsafe. Europe has done it for 20 years. \nEurope can do it, but we can't do it? It gives consumers the \nopportunity to take advantage of the global marketplace.\n  We are talking about FDA-approved drugs, made in FDA-approved plants, \nsold all over the world with one difference--price. The American \nconsumers are told they have to pay the highest price. Dr. David \nKessler is the expert on this, in my judgment. He was FDA Commissioner \nfor 8 years, the head of the Food and Drug Administration. The Dorgan-\nSnowe bill ``provides a sound framework for assuring that imported \ndrugs are safe and effective.''\n  Safe and effective. End of story, in my judgment. I understand the \npharmaceutical industry does not want this. I understand that. They \nwant to control prices. Yes, we have price controls in America, not \nGovernment price controls but price controls by the pharmaceutical \nindustry.\n  It is the only industrialized country in the world that I am aware of \nthat says to the drug industry: Price it as you wish. It doesn't \nmatter. You just price it as you wish.\n  Well, what they have done--I had a hearing. Here is what they told \nme. They price at the level they price prescription drugs in this \ncountry because they can. Because they can. That might sound OK for the \nbottom line, but what does it mean for the person walking into the \ngrocery store tonight in a small town in the Midwest who does not have \nmuch money and has to decide--the pharmacy is at the back of the \nstore--I better go buy the prescription drugs the doctor says I need \nfirst to find out how much money I have left for groceries?\n  It goes on all the time. Many of us believe, Republicans and \nDemocrats, we ought to at least open the global marketplace for \nconsumers to be able to pursue those FDA-approved drugs, made in FDA-\napproved plants, at lower prices, the prices at which they are sold in \nvirtually every other country in the world. This is unfair to the \nAmerican consumer. That is the point.\n  Interestingly, there was a long description of counterfeit drugs in \nthe New York Times this weekend. None of that would be available to \nreport, in my judgment, because it would not have happened if we had \nhad the provisions, the safety provisions we have in the Dorgan-Snowe \namendment.\n  The fact is, you would not have danger in the drug supply because you \nwould have much more money going to the FDA for the purpose of making \ncertain the drug supply is safe. I am not just talking about the \nimported drugs, I am talking about a drug supply sold in this country, \nproduced here and sold here. The lack of serial numbers, the lack of a \npedigree, the lack of effective anticounterfeiting technology, the lack \nof resources to go after RFID technology, all of that is lacking in the \nunderlying bill.\n  It is not in the bill. The only way it is going to get there is if we \nare willing to defeat the Cochran amendment and to pass the amendment I \nhave offered along with many of my colleagues. This is not a new issue. \nWe have come to this issue on many occasions in the past. Each and \nevery time the pharmaceutical industry has been able to trump us with \nvotes on the floor of the Senate or the House. I hope--first I wish, \nsecond I hope, and finally I expect, that one of these days we will be \nable to prevail. One of these days we may be able to win this debate. \nMaybe it is today at 4 o'clock. I hope so.\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\n  Some say, well, there will be no savings with your amendment. Well, \nthe Congressional Budget Office says it is $50 billion in 10 years--$50 \nbillion. Is that a savings? It seems to me it is. Some say, well, this \nwould be unsafe. You cannot prevent counterfeits from coming in.\n  Once again, we have all of this technology to prevent somebody from \ncounterfeiting a twenty-dollar bill, but we cannot with respect to \nmedicine? Of course we can.\n  Europe has done it for 20 years in a manner that is safe, but we \ncannot because we are not as smart as they are. Nonsense. Finally, at \nlast, at long last, I hope this Senate will stand up to the \npharmaceutical industry and say this: You are a good industry. We \nappreciate what you do. We like lifesavings drugs. But lifesavings \ndrugs save no lives if you cannot afford to take them. We do not \nsupport your pricing policy. We believe a pricing policy that says to \nthe American consumer: You pay the highest prices in the world, we \nbelieve that pricing policy is wrong and you have to change it. That is \nwhat I hope the message will be in this Chamber this afternoon.\n  It is past the time, long past the time, in my judgment, for this \nCongress to stand up on these issues.\n  In this case, let's stand up on the side of the American people who \nhave been denied their right to participate in the global economy, to \naccess a safe supply of drugs, FDA-approved, when it is sold in every \nother country for lower prices.\n  Let me conclude by pointing out, as I did last week, an old man \nsitting on a straw bale on a North Dakota farm told me one day, he \nsaid: I am in my eighties. My wife has fought breast cancer for 3 \nyears. For 3 years we have driven to Canada to buy her Tamoxifen. Three \nyears we have driven to Canada to buy the Tamoxifen.\n  You can bring a small supply across the border if you do it \npersonally. Why? Because it costs three-fourths less than it costs in \nthe United States. He said: I save 80 percent by buying it in Canada. \nYet for 3 years my wife has had to fight breast cancer and fight the \nhigh prices here, and we have had to drive into Canada.\n  Well, the fact is, most Americans cannot drive to Canada. This bill \nis for most of the Americans who are paying prices that are too high. \nThey want a safe drug supply, but they, for sure, finally, at long \nlast, want a fair price, one they have not been getting, one they ought \nto get starting at 4 o'clock today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me congratulate the Senator for his \noutstanding leadership on this issue. Let me just pick up right from \nwhere he left off. He and I and Senator Snowe and a number of us have \nbeen dealing with this issue for many years. My involvement came in \n1999, when I took a busload of Vermonters, including many women who \nwere struggling for their lives with breast cancer.\n  Many of those women did not have a lot of money, and they also went \nacross the Canadian border. They also purchased Tamoxifen. In those \ndays, the price they paid was one-tenth the price, one-tenth the price \ncompared to what they were paying in the United States. Here you have \nwomen struggling for their lives, who do not have a lot of money, and \nwere paying one-tenth the price.\n  This amendment is a big deal. This amendment will mean that Americans \nfrom one end of our country to the other, people with chronic \nillnesses, senior citizens who run into the doughnut hole, so-called \ndoughnut hole on Medicare Part D, that finally these Americans, our \nAmericans, our people, will no longer continue to be ripped off by the \npharmaceutical industry and be forced to pay by far the highest prices \nin the industrialized world for the same exact medicine which people in \nCanada, people in Germany, people all over Europe receive at far lower \nprices--the same medicines, same companies, same factory, except we pay \nfar higher prices.\n  There is very strong support for this legislation. Millions of \nAmericans are already supporting this legislation by getting into their \ncars and going over the Canadian border. The AARP and other senior \norganizations support this amendment. My understanding is that the AARP \nintends to note on their scorecard that a vote for the Cochran \namendment--which is clearly a poison pill--is a vote against \nreimportation.\n  I would urge my colleagues, if you disagree with reimportation, vote \nno. But a vote for the Cochran amendment is, in fact, a vote no.\n  You have heard from Senator Snowe. You have heard from Senator \nDorgan. The arguments over safety are just not accurate. This bill \ndetails in great length an entire regimen as to how we can make sure \nall of the prescription drugs reimported into the United States are \nsafe and FDA approved.\n  I always find it remarkable that every day, huge amounts of imported \nfood are coming into this country. I do not hear a hue and cry about \nwhether that food is inspected.\n  Let me quote from the May 1st New York Times:\n\n       More than 135 countries ship food items to the United \n     States. Canada, Mexico and China have led the way with China \n     shipping nearly five times as much in food items to the \n     United States as it did in 1996.\n\n  China is importing more and more food into the United States. Where \nare the FDA inspectors? Are they all over the farms in China making \nsure these products are safe? I have not heard one word about that \nissue. This legislation has built in the strongest prescription drug \nsafety regimen we have ever seen.\n  Let me tell you what this debate is really about. It is not about \nprescription drug safety. It is about the power of the pharmaceutical \nindustry, which in a city that has enormously powerful special \ninterests, we have the pharmaceutical industry standing uniquely alone \nas the most important, if you will, and, in my view, greedy lobby in \nthe entire United States of America. Here it is. Do you want to know \nwhat the issue is? Here it is: pharmaceutical industry lobbying.\n  From 1998 to 2006 they spent $1.1 billion for lobbying; 1998 to 2006, \n$1.1 billion in lobbying.\n  The pharmaceutical industry has over 1,000 well-paid lobbyists right \nhere on Capitol Hill: former heads of the Republican Party, former \nleaders in the Democratic Party. Whenever anybody stands up for \njustice, whenever anybody stands up to try to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs in this country so that the American people can \nafford these lifesaving medicines, these lobbyists descend like locusts \non all of our offices in the Senate, in the House. That is what they \ndo.\n  It is not just the amount of money they spend on lobbying. They spend \na substantial amount of money on campaign contributions: From 1990 to \n2006, $139 million in campaign contributions; 2006 alone, $19 million. \nThat is power. What this debate is about is not just the need to lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs in America, as important as that is. \nWhat this debate is more significantly about is whether the Congress of \nthe United States has the courage to stand up to the greediest, most \npowerful special interests in this country.\n  In November the American people went to the polls. They said they \nwant a change in the direction in which this country is moving. \nClearly, that election had a lot to do with Iraq. It certainly did. It \nhad a lot to do with global warming, I believe. But it also, in any \nview, had a lot to do with the understanding that year after year \nwealthy and powerful special interests have dictated the terms of the \ndebate, have paid for the legislation which has come through the Senate \nand through the House.\n  The drug companies have managed to do something rather amazing. \nVirtually all of the Members of the Senate and the House look at \neconomic issues through two lenses. No. 1, in order to protect \nconsumers, we say: Let there be free market competition. That is the \nway to lower the costs of the product. And there is truth to that.\n  The other way that we can protect consumers is through Government \nregulation. There is certainly truth to that. What the pharmaceutical \nindustry has managed to do is tell us we cannot regulate the \npharmaceutical companies. We cannot have Medicare negotiating lower \nprices with the drug companies. We cannot do that. They have given us \nall kinds of reasons we cannot do that.\n  Then they have told us, well, we also cannot do free market \ncompetition: No,\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\nyou cannot have the local druggist going out and purchasing the product \nat the best price that he can get, maybe in Canada, maybe Europe. You \ncan't do that. You cannot have regulation. You cannot have free market \ncompetition.\n  Then, on top of all of that, what the drug companies have managed to \ndo is get many billions of dollars in corporate welfare, so the \ntaxpayers of this country subsidize the research and development of \nmany of the most important drugs, while the consumers, the American \nconsumers, get no reasonable pricing despite the many billions of \ndollars that go into research and development that were paid for by \nthem.\n  The drug companies get it all. That is what they get. At the end of \nthe day, year after year after year, they are one of the most \nprofitable industries in this country. They are very profitable, and \nelderly people and working people all over this country find it harder \nand harder to pay for the prescription drugs they desperately need.\n  Let us stand with the people. Let's defeat the Cochran amendment and \npass the Dorgan amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5634-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1082, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1082) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to reauthorize and amend the prescription drug \n     user fee provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Landrieu amendment No. 1004, to require the Food and Drug \n     Administration to premit the sale of baby turtles as pets so \n     long as the seller uses proven methods to effectively treat \n     salmonella.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 990, to provide for the importation of \n     prescription drugs.\n       Cochran amendment No. 1010 ( to amendment No. 990), to \n     protect the health and safety of the public.\n       Stabenow amendment No. 1011, to insert provisions related \n     to citizens petitions.\n       Brown (for Brownback/Brown) amendment No. 985, to establish \n     a priority drug review process to encourage treatments of \n     tropical diseases.\n       Vitter amendment No. 983, to require counterfeit-resistant \n     technologies for prescription drugs.\n       Inhofe amendment No. 988, to protect children and their \n     parents from being coerced into administering a controlled \n     substance in order to attend school.\n       Gregg/Coleman amendment No. 993, to provide for the \n     regulation of Internet pharmacies.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have three critical votes ahead of \nus this afternoon. These votes mean that today is the day we show the \nAmerican people whether we can really pass drug importation or whether \nwe are just giving it lip service and nothing else. The Dorgan \namendment is the moment American consumers have been waiting for and \ntoday is the day.\n  As I said last week, the Dorgan amendment is the result of a \ncollaborative effort by myself with Senator Dorgan and with Senator \nSnowe and Senator Kennedy to finally make drug importation legal in \nthis country.\n  This is the golden opportunity this year to get it done.\n  Now we have heard here on the floor the concerns that some have with \ndrug importation and drug safety. Let me tell you that this is \nsomething I take seriously. Everyone who knows me knows that I care \ndeeply about the safety of drugs, and I would not be standing here \ntoday urging support for the Dorgan amendment if I didn't think it had \nthe right stuff on drug safety. And it does.\n  The fact is that the unsafe situation is what we have today.\n  Today, consumers are ordering drugs over the Internet from who knows \nwhere, and the FDA does not have the resources to do much of anything \nabout it.\n  The fact is that legislation to legalize importation would not only \nhelp to lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans but also \nshould shut down rogue Internet pharmacies selling unsafe drugs.\n  The Dorgan amendment would improve drug safety, not threaten it. And \nit would open up trade to lower cost drugs.\n  We see news accounts on a regular basis describing Americans who log \non to the Internet to purchase drugs from Canada and elsewhere.\n  In 2004, my staff were briefed about an investigation by the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations for the Senate Government \nAffairs Committee.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations conducted an \ninvestigation into current drug importation. They found that about \n40,000 parcels containing prescription drugs come through the JFK mail \nfacility every single day of the year--40,000 packages each day.\n  Now, the JFK airport houses the largest International Mail Branch in \nthe United States, but even then it is the tip of the iceberg.\n  Each day of the year 30,000 packages of drugs enter the United States \nthrough Miami, and 20,000 enter through Chicago. That's 50,000 more \npackages each day.\n  What is worse, about 28 percent of the drugs coming in are controlled \nsubstances.\n  These are addictive drugs that require close physician supervision.\n  While most people are ordering their prescriptions from Canada, they \nare also ordering prescriptions from Brazil, India, Pakistan, the \nNetherlands, Spain, Portugal, Mexico and Romania.\n  Although the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the \nimportation of unapproved, misbranded, or adulterated drugs into the \nUnited States, the fact is that thousands of counterfeit and \nunregulated drugs are seeping through our borders. This is what is \nhappening today.\n  John Taylor, Associate Commissioner of Regulatory Affairs for the \nFood and Drug Administration, FDA, in his testimony before the House \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce in June 2003 stated that, ``the \ngrowing volume of unapproved imported drugs, which often are generated \nfrom sales via the Internet, presents a formidable enforcement \nchallenge.''\n  Despite the hard work of both the FDA and BCBP to control our \nborders, the importation of illegal drugs has become an unenforceable \nproblem. That is because today, the FDA does not have the authority or \nthe resources to do much about it. The Dorgan amendment would change \nthat.\n  The basic approach to assuring the drugs are safe in the Dorgan \namendment which I coauthored with him--is to give FDA the ability to \nverify the drug pedigree back to the manufacturer, require FDA to \ninspect frequently, and require fees to give FDA the resources to do \nthis.\n  For imports by individuals from Canada, the bill requires the \nexporters in Canada to register with FDA and to post a bond that they \nwill lose if they send unsafe drugs. Frequent inspections by FDA ensure \ncompliance.\n  For commercial imports, American wholesalers and pharmacists must \nregister with FDA and are subject to criminal penalties if they import \nunsafe drugs. Again, frequent inspections by FDA ensure compliance.\n  The bill requires manufacturers to inform FDA whether foreign drugs \nmeet FDA standards, and if they don't, the manufacturers have to give \nFDA the information necessary to evaluate the safety of the drug. If a \nforeign drug is manufactured in a plant the FDA has not inspected, FDA \ncan inspect it.\n  The bottom line is the legislation gives the FDA the authority and \nresources it needs to implement safely the drug importation program set \nup under this bill.\n  The fact is that the unsafe situation is what we have today: 40,000 \ndrug packages coming in every day in New York, 30,000 drug packages \ncoming in every day in Miami, and 20,000 drug packages coming in every \nday in Chicago. That is 90,000 packages with drugs coming in from other \ncountries every single day.\n  We are already saying yes to drug importation every day that we allow \nthis unregulated and unsafe situation to exist. We say yes to it 90,000 \ntimes a day.\n  What we need to do and what the Dorgan amendment would accomplish is \ngiving the FDA the resources to clean up this mess.\n  The Dorgan amendment gives the FDA the resources and authority to\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\ncrack down on the unsafe and unregulated importation of drugs. That is \nwhat we need. That is one of the key reasons I have been working with \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Snowe and Senator Kennedy on this \nlegislation. One of our key aims is to improve drug safety.\n  I have been doing a lot of work in the area of drug safety, as my \ncolleagues know, and I felt that I should talk about why the Dorgan \namendment is important for improving drug safety.\n  A vote against the Dorgan amendment is a vote in favor of the unsafe \nsituation we have today.\n  I must also say that a vote for the Cochran amendment is a vote to \nkill the Dorgan amendment. So a vote in favor of the Cochran amendment \nis a vote in favor of doing nothing. It is a vote for keeping the \nunsafe situation we have today.\n  Congress must act now on legislation that will not only shut down \nrogue Internet pharmacies selling unsafe drugs to consumers but will \nalso lower the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Legalizing the importation of prescription drugs through a highly \nregulated system overseen by FDA will stem the tide of unregulated \npharmaceuticals coming into the United States and create a safe and \neffective system for obtaining low-cost prescription drugs.\n  The bill before us is the vehicle this year to get it done. The bill \nwe are debating is a must-pass FDA bill. The Senate should send a \nstrong message that we are committed to finally getting it done this \nyear.\n  And that is what we are working together to do today.\n  Making it legal for Americans to import their prescription drugs is a \ntop priority at the grassroots. It needs to be a top priority here in \nWashington.\n  I have long advocated allowing American consumers access to safe \ndrugs from other countries. I have always considered it a free-trade \nissue.\n  Imports create competition and keep domestic industry more responsive \nto consumers.\n  In the United States, we import everything consumers want. So that \nshould be the case on prescription drugs.\n  We need to do it legally and safely. We need to give the FDA the \nauthority and resources to do it. That is what the Dorgan amendment \nwould do.\n  Consumers in the United States pay far more for prescription drugs \nthan those in other counties.\n  If Americans could legally and safely access prescription drugs \noutside the United States, then drug companies will be forced to \nreevaluate their pricing strategies. They would no longer be able to \ngouge American consumers by making them pay more than their fair share \nof the high cost of research and development.\n  Now, it is true that pharmaceutical companies do not like the idea of \nopening up America to the global marketplace.\n  They want to keep the United States closed to other markets in order \nto charge higher prices here. However, with the Dorgan amendment, \nprescription drug companies will be forced to compete and establish \nfair prices here in America.\n  Now some don't want this to happen. And I want to reiterate that \nthere is an attempt to kill drug importation as has been done many \ntimes before in this Chamber. I am referring to an amendment by my good \nfriend from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. His amendment would require a \ncertification about health and safety. That amendment is designed to \nkill drug importation once again. It is a clever amendment but it is a \npoison pill.\n  Our effort develops an effective and safe system that gives Americans \naccess to lower prices. This amendment requires that all imported drugs \nbe approved by the FDA. The amendment sets a stringent set of safety \nrequirements that must be met before Americans can import drugs from \nthat country. And there are stiff penalties for violating the safety \nrequirements.\n  Don't be fooled by the Cochran amendment. Voting for the Cochran \namendment is a vote to kill drug importation.\n  With the Dorgan amendment, we are working to get the job done.\n  We need to make sure Americans have even greater, more affordable \naccess to wonder drugs by further opening the doors to competition in \nthe global pharmaceutical industry.\n  Americans are waiting. We must make sure they have access to \naffordable prescription drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Cochran amendment and in \nfavor of the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, for many years, the FDA has been \nconsidered the gold standard among the world's drug safety bodies. And \nno one here doubts the desire of the agency's many career employees to \ncontinue to carry out its mission of keeping our drug supply safe for \nall Americans. In the legislation we are considering today, S. 1082, \nthe Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act, we provide these \ndedicated employees with the resources necessary to continue their work \nto ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs and biologic products for \nAmericans.\n  Despite the dedication of the FDA's employees, we know there have \nbeen breakdowns at the agency. We know that, at times, it has taken too \nlong to act when a drug may pose a threat. It took many months from the \npoint when scientists became aware of the elevated risk of adverse \ncardiovascular events associated with Vioxx and the point when it was \nwithdrawn from the market, during which time the FDA had multiple \nopportunities to engage in stronger actions to protect consumers.\n  In recent years, we have seen the scientific process unduly \ninfluenced by political or economic factors. When Senator Patty Murray \nand I worked to secure a decision for over-the-counter availability of \nPlan B, we saw the ways in which science-based decisionmaking was \ncompromised. The Government Accountability Office has confirmed that \nthe FDA's 2004 decision not to approve over-the-counter sales of Plan B \nwas politically motivated. Concerns about undue influence from factors \nother than science extend beyond this one example. According to a Union \nof Concerned Scientists survey, 61 percent of FDA scientists could cite \nexamples of when ``Health and Human Services or FDA political \nappointees have inappropriately injected themselves into FDA \ndeterminations of actions.'' Twenty percent of those responding had \nbeen ``asked explicitly by FDA decision makers to provide incomplete, \ninaccurate, or misleading information ``\n  Because of these examples, I believe that the American public lost a \ngreat deal of confidence in the ability of the agency to ensure the \nsafety of their medications. With this legislation, we can begin the \nprocess of rebuilding consumers' confidence in the FDA. Through this \nbill, we are taking concrete steps to improve drug safety. S. 1082 \nestablishes steps to establish a routine active surveillance system for \nmedications and sets up a process through which the FDA can better \nmanage risks for a range of drugs, from requiring postmarket studies to \nimproving communication about the risks and benefits associated with \nmedications.\n  In addition to establishing a framework to increase drug safety, we \nare also working to implement an atmosphere where science guides the \nagency's decisions. We need to put into place the systems to ensure \nthat employees can engage in the open, evidence-based discourse needed \nas part of the drug approval and review process--discourse not unduly \ninfluenced by political concerns. This legislation goes a long way to \ndoing some of that by increasing the transparency around drug approval \ndecisions, addressing conflicts of interests on advisory committees, \nand creating a climate that protects the rights of employees to publish \nin peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n  I know that many of my colleagues have raised concerns about safety \nin the context of reimportation of drugs, and I am pleased to note that \non this legislation, we have found a way to allow for safe drug \nreimportation. S. 1082 contains the provisions of Senator Dorgan and \nSnowe's Pharmaceutical Access and Drug Safety Act, legislation I am \nproud to cosponsor. This amendment would establish the framework \nthrough which we could phase in drug reimportation from other nations \nwhere regulatory authority is similar to that in our country, allowing \nmillions of Americans to safely obtain medically necessary drugs at \nlower cost.\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\n  Americans pay higher prices for the exact same prescription drugs \nbeing taken by their counterparts in Canada and Europe. The \nCongressional Budget Office has found that prices for brand-name \nprescription drugs are 35 percent to 55 percent higher in the United \nStates. This price disparity affects millions of Americans. Our \nseniors, many of whom are on fixed incomes, end up spending larger \nportions of their income on drugs, especially when falling into the \n``doughnut hole'' or wrestling with other gaps in a Medicare Part D \nbenefit. And this isn't only a problem for seniors--we have 46 million \nuninsured individuals in our country, many of whom are unable to afford \nprescription drugs. Without these drugs, manageable chronic conditions, \nlike asthma or high blood pressure, spiral out of control into serious \nhealth problems.\n  The lack of affordable drugs does not just hurt those who are \nuninsured or underinsured, but it also places greater pressure upon our \nhealth care system. The cost of treating someone in the emergency room \nis much higher than the cost of a prescription. But the way our system \nis set up, we don't help people engage in cost-effective disease \nmanagement by making those drugs affordable, and I believe that we need \nto examine the ways in which importation can lower costs not only for \nconsumers but for our overall system.\n  The Dorgan-Snowe amendment contains many provisions that will ensure \nsafety while giving Americans access to cheaper drugs. This bipartisan \nprovision will allow seniors to safely access drugs from Canada \nstarting 90 days after enactment. It will provide the needed authority \nand funding to the FDA to regulate foreign pharmacies and wholesalers, \nso that we can be sure that any drugs that enter the United States are \nsafe for our citizens. And it will increase the consumer protections \ninvolved with internet pharmacies, so that people who don't live near \nthe border can access imported drugs without being defrauded.\n  We need to make drug reimportation safe, we need to make drug \nreimportation unambiguously legal, and we need to do so as quickly as \npossible. The Dorgan-Snowe amendment would allow us to do all of those \nthings, and I would urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment \nto the bill.\n  In addition to the provisions of this legislation dealing with drug \nsafety and reimportation, I am proud to note that the Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act has an entire title devoted to \npediatric issues. I worked with Senators Dodd, Kennedy, and Enzi to \ncraft these provisions, which will be of great benefit to children. The \npediatric device provisions will help us improve the number and types \nof medical devices designed for pediatric populations, and the \nreauthorization of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act improves \nthe applicability of the pediatric exclusivity incentive and increases \nthe speed through which these studies can be requested by the FDA. When \nthis bill was passed in 2002, I was able to work with Senator Dodd and \nthe HELP Committee to increase provisions to assist pediatric cancer \nresearch, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation this \ntime around.\n  S. 1082 also contains most of the provisions of the Pediatric \nResearch Improvement Act, a bill that I introduced earlier this year to \nreauthorize the pediatric rule. Because of this authority, the Food and \nDrug Administration is able to ensure that drugs that are marketed for \nchildren are safe and effective in children.\n  For the past decade, I have been working to ensure that drugs that \nare marketed to children are safe and effective in children. As of the \nearly 1990s, only about 20 percent of drugs contained specific \npediatric dosing information, but since 1998, we have had over 1,000 \ndrugs fall under the scope of the pediatric rule, resulting in hundreds \nof studies that have helped us gain valuable data about drugs commonly \nused by kids.\n  The reauthorization of the pediatric rule contained in this larger \nbill will allow us to make additional strides in improving pediatric \ndrug development. We will be able to remove unnecessary bureaucratic \nbarriers and improve the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to \nrequire testing on already-marketed drugs when sponsors refuse to carry \nout such testing under the incentive provided by the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act.\n  It will improve our ability to collect and analyze data about \npediatric clinical trials so that we can better evaluate the impact of \nsuch trials upon children's health overall, and it will improve the \nFDA's ability to coordinate the incentives provided under Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act with the pediatric rule so that these \ntwo pediatric programs of the agency can work together more seamlessly.\n  However, I must note that I am disappointed that this bill does not \nconsider what I believe to be a critical part of the Pediatric Research \nImprovement Act--the provision which would have made permanent the \nauthority of the FDA to obtain important data through the pediatric \nrule.\n  Instead, the legislation before the Senate today contains a sunset of \nthis authority, meaning that if this provision isn't reauthorized 5 \nyears from now, the FDA will no longer be able to ensure that drugs \nused in children are safe and effective in children.\n  We would never dream of placing a sunset on the FDA's authority to \ncertify the safety and efficacy of drugs used in adults, and I fail to \nunderstand why we impose a different standard on drugs for children, \nand I will seek to address this issue as the bill moves forward.\n  We must also improve the FDA's authority in the realm of follow-on \nbiologics. While there is nothing in the version of the legislation \nthat is on the floor today that addresses this issue, Senators Kennedy \nand Enzi have made a commitment that we will mark up legislation on \nthis issue on June 13 in the HELP Committee and that we will \nincorporate this legislation into the conference negotiations on this \ndrug safety bill.\n  Earlier this year, in conjunction with a number of bipartisan \ncosponsors, I introduced the Access to Life-Saving Medicine Act, \nlegislation to provide FDA with the authority to approve safe and \neffective generic versions of biotech drugs. By bringing safe and \neffective follow-on biologics to the market, we can provide significant \nsavings to patients, employers, and the government.\n  More than $10 billion worth of biopharmaceuticals will come off \npatent in the next 5 years, and without this legislation, the \nmanufacturers of these biotech drugs can continue to charge monopoly \nprices indefinitely. In 2005, the costs of biologics grew 17.5 percent \ncompared to traditional drugs, which increased 10 percent. And in 2006, \nthe Medicare Part B Program spent more than $5 billion on biologic \ndrugs. It is clear that biotech drugs hold great promise, but this \npromise is wasted if we don't take action to ensure that all Americans \nhave access to safe, effective, and affordable generic versions of \nthese drugs.\n  According to a report released by Engel and Novitt to the \nPharmaceutical Care Management Association, PCMA, passage of this \nlegislation could conservatively save an estimated $14 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Kennedy and my colleagues on \nthe HELP Committee to ensure that we enact legislation that provides \nthe FDA with the authority and flexibility to approve \nbiopharmaceuticals subject to a workable, abbreviated approval pathway \nthat is efficient, effective, and scientifically grounded and that \nincludes measures to ensure timely resolution of patent disputes, as \nwell as adequate incentives for continued innovation.\n  Another issue that has come up during debate on the Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act is food safety. Recent illnesses \ninvolving E. coli in spinach and lettuce, the discovery of Salmonella \nin peanut butter, and the importation of unsafe pet food ingredients \nfrom China illustrate the continued vulnerability of the American food \nsupply and expose weakness in the FDA's food safety program.\n  In the latest case, a chemical used in plastic manufacturing was \nplaced in feed material from China, causing the deaths of an unknown \nnumber of pets. This chemical was also consumed by 2.7 million chickens \nand 345 pigs that were slaughtered for human consumption. Our food \nsystem must be prepared to effectively prevent the chemicals found in \nthese animals from endangering the health of consumers.\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\n  That is why I supported the inclusion of certain provisions in this \nbill to begin to address many of the agency's problems with food \nsafety, as a prelude to overall committee action on this issue.\n  I have long been concerned about the siloing of authority at the FDA \nand Department of Agriculture, and I filed an amendment to this bill \nwhich would establish a joint task force between the FDA, U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, and the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC) to improve our response to foodborne illnesses.\n  According to the CDC, unsafe foods cause an estimated 76 million \nillnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths each year. \nDespite these statistics, safety tests for domestically produced food \nhave dropped nearly 75 percent when compared to the number conducted in \n2003. Meanwhile, the number of food imports has grown from under 4 \nmillion food import line items in 1993 to nearly 20 million in 2007. We \nhave a situation where inspections are declining, yet the number of \noutbreaks and contaminations in our food supply is on the rise. The \nfragmentation in our food safety system must be addressed in order to \nprotect consumers.\n  With several of my colleagues, I have repeatedly written to the \nSecretary of Agriculture, the Commissioner of the FDA and the Director \nof the CDC urging them to create an interagency task force to better \nenable us to prevent such illnesses. To date, no action has been taken \nto grant my request. If the delay is due to concerns that these \nagencies do not have the authority to pursue such authority, I stand \nprepared, along with many others in the Senate, to provide these \nagencies with such authority. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the HELP Committee to address concerns about food safety \nand help restore our Nation's confidence in the ability of both these \nagencies to protect American consumers.\n  I would like to close by noting that while the Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act takes several steps that will improve \nthe agency's ability to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs \nand biologics, it is time that we begin to look at drugs in a new way.\n  It is not enough that we have drugs that are effective--in order to \nreduce overall health care costs, we need to understand how these drugs \nare effective in comparison to each other, in order to assist providers \nand patients make the best health care decisions.\n  While the Vioxx controversy highlighted the need for additional \nsafety protections, many of which are contained in the Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act, it also demonstrates the role \ncomparative effectiveness can play in ensuring the use of the most \nappropriate treatment for a specific condition. I pushed for inclusion \nof comparative effectiveness studies in the Medicare Modernization Act. \nOne of the first studies to be carried out under this provision was a \nsystematic review of osteoarthritis drugs, including Cox-2 drugs. If \nthis information had been compiled earlier, it could have helped many \nevaluate whether to use these drugs, as opposed to other pain \nrelievers, many of which are available at a lower cost without a \ndoctor's prescription.\n  Comparative effectiveness assists physicians and patients in \nselecting the best treatment and helps to reduce inappropriate uses of \ntreatments that pose unnecessary safety risks to patients--and more and \nmore people are recognizing its potential in improving health care. \nEarlier today, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association announced \ntheir support to create a new, independent entity to explore the \neffectiveness of new and existing medical procedures, drugs, devices, \nand biologics. I am grateful for their leadership, and I will be \nintroducing legislation shortly to expand comparative effectiveness \nresearch and its use at the Federal level.\n  I have been involved in the debate over the Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act for several months now and believe \nthat the product we have produced represents a step forward for safety. \nI will be supporting this legislation and look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to ensure that we can continue to strengthen this agency, \nlower prescription drug costs, and maintain a strong commitment to \nconsumer protection and scientific innovation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1010\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided on amendment No. 1010 offered by the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, Americans deserve Continued access to \nsafe and effective drugs which are approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. A number of recent reports demonstrate that serious \nproblems exist with products from other countries. The New York Times \nran a front-page story yesterday about how counterfeit drugs \ncontaminated with an industrial solvent have poisoned hundreds, if not \nthousands, of people around the world. The toxic syrup has been \ninvolved in at least eight mass poisonings around the world in the past \ntwo decades, and researchers estimate thousands have died as a result. \nMost recently an epidemic of contaminated cough syrup was traced back \nto counterfeit medication from China. The FDA last week issued a \nwarning to U.S. consumers to be especially vigilant because of the risk \nof the poison reaching the United States. The New York Times article is \nentitled ``From China to Panama, a Trail of Poisoned Medicine.''\n  Counterfeit products, those that have been tampered with, or those of \nunknown origin, should not be brought into this country.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from North Dakota will put in \njeopardy the process we now have to ensure the safety of prescription \nmedications and protect the health of the American people.\n  I have offered a second degree amendment, with bipartisan support, \nthat requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify \nthat the importation of drug products will not pose additional risks to \nAmericans and will indeed lower costs to consumers.\n  We have had this issue before the Senate on several previous \noccasions. In all of these cases, the Senate has adopted this \ncertification amendment overwhelmingly. Safeguards continue to be \nnecessary and are even more important now considering the terrorist \nthreats we face.\n  I urge the Senate to again support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the New York Times article to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 6, 2007]\n\n           From China to Panama, a Trail of Poisoned Medicine\n\n                  (By Walt Bogdanich and Jake Hooker)\n\n       The kidneys fail first. Then the central nervous system \n     begins to misfire. Paralysis spreads, making breathing \n     difficult, then often impossible without assistance. In the \n     end, most victims die. Many of them are children, poisoned at \n     the hands of their unsuspecting parents. The syrupy poison, \n     diethylene glycol, is an indispensable part of the modern \n     world, an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in some \n     antifreeze. It is also a killer. And the deaths, if not \n     intentional, are often no accident.\n       Over the years, the poison has been loaded into all \n     varieties of medicine--cough syrup, fever medication, \n     injectable drugs--a result of counterfeiters who profit by \n     substituting the sweet-tasting solvent for a safe, more \n     expensive syrup, usually glycerin, commonly used in drugs, \n     food, toothpaste and other products. Toxic syrup has figured \n     in at least eight mass poisonings around the world in the \n     past two decades. Researchers estimate that thousands have \n     died. In many cases, the precise origin of the poison has \n     never been determined. But records and interviews show that \n     in three of the last four cases it was made in China, a major \n     source of counterfeit drugs.\n       Panama is the most recent victim. Last year, government \n     officials there unwittingly mixed diethylene glycol into \n     260,000 bottles of cold medicine--with devastating results. \n     Families have reported 365 deaths from the poison, 100 of \n     which have been confirmed so far. With the onset of the rainy \n     season, investigators are racing to exhume as many potential \n     victims as possible before bodies decompose even more. \n     Panama's death toll leads directly to Chinese companies that \n     made and exported the poison as 99.5 percent pure glycerin.\n       Forty-six barrels of the toxic syrup arrived via a poison \n     pipeline stretching halfway around the world. Through \n     shipping records and interviews with government officials, \n     The New York Times traced this pipeline from the Panamanian \n     port of Colon, back through trading companies in Barcelona,\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\n     Spain, and Beijing, to its beginning near the Yangtze Delta \n     in a place local people call ``chemical country.'' The \n     counterfeit glycerin passed through three trading companies \n     on three continents, yet not one of them tested the syrup to \n     confirm what was on the label. Along the way, a certificate \n     falsely attesting to the purity of the shipment was \n     repeatedly altered, eliminating the name of the manufacturer \n     and previous owner. As a result, traders bought the syrup \n     without knowing where it came from, or who made it. With this \n     information, the traders might have discovered--as The Times \n     did--that the manufacturer was not certified to make \n     pharmaceutical ingredients.\n       An examination of the two poisoning cases last year--in \n     Panama and earlier in China--shows how China's safety \n     regulations have lagged behind its growing role as low-cost \n     supplier to the world. It also demonstrates how a poorly \n     policed chain of traders in country after country allows \n     counterfeit medicine to contaminate the global market.\n       Last week, the United States Food and Drug Administration \n     warned drug makers and suppliers in the United States ``to be \n     especially vigilant'' in watching for diethylene glycol. The \n     warning did not specifically mention China, and it said there \n     was ``no reason to believe'' that glycerin in this country \n     was tainted. Even so, the agency asked that all glycerin \n     shipments be tested for diethylene glycol, and said it was \n     ``exploring how supplies of glycerin become contaminated.''\n       China is already being accused by United States authorities \n     of exporting wheat gluten containing an industrial chemical, \n     melamine, that ended up in pet food and livestock feed. The \n     F.D.A recently banned imports of Chinese-made wheat gluten \n     after it was linked to pet deaths in the United States. \n     Beyond Panama and China, toxic syrup has caused mass \n     poisonings in Haiti, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nigeria and twice \n     in India.\n       In Bangladesh, investigators found poison in seven brands \n     of fever medication in 1992, but only after countless \n     children died. A Massachusetts laboratory detected the \n     contamination after Dr. Michael L. Bennish, a pediatrician \n     who works in developing countries, smuggled samples of the \n     tainted syrup out of the country in a suitcase. Dr. Bennish, \n     who investigated the Bangladesh epidemic and helped write a \n     1995 article about it for BMJ, formerly known as the British \n     Medical Journal, said that given the amount of medication \n     distributed, deaths ``must be in the thousands or tens of \n     thousands.''\n       ``It's vastly underreported,'' Dr. Bennish said of \n     diethylene glycol poisoning. Doctors might not suspect toxic \n     medicine, particularly in poor countries with limited \n     resources and a generally unhealthy population, he said, \n     adding, ``Most people who die don't come to a medical \n     facility.'' The makers of counterfeit glycerin, which \n     superficially looks and acts like the real thing but \n     generally costs considerably less, are rarely identified, \n     much less prosecuted, given the difficulty of tracing \n     shipments across borders. ``This is really a global problem, \n     and it needs to be handled in a global way,'' said Dr. Henk \n     Bekedam, the World Health Organization's top representative \n     in Beijing.\n       Seventy years ago, medicine laced with diethylene glycol \n     killed more than 100 people in the United States, leading to \n     the passage of the toughest drug regulations of that era and \n     the creation of the modern Food and Drug Administration. The \n     F.D.A. has tried to help in poisoning cases around the world, \n     but there is only so much it can do. When at least 88 \n     children died in Haiti a decade ago, F.D.A. investigators \n     traced the poison to the Manchurian city of Dalian, but their \n     attempts to visit the suspected manufacturer were \n     repeatedly blocked by Chinese officials, according to \n     internal State Department records. Permission was granted \n     more than a year later, but by then the plant had moved \n     and its records had been destroyed.\n       ``Chinese officials we contacted on this matter were all \n     reluctant to become involved,'' the American Embassy in \n     Beijing wrote in a confidential cable. ``We cannot be \n     optimistic about our chances for success in tracking down the \n     other possible glycerin shipments.''\n       In fact, The Times found records showing that the same \n     Chinese company implicated in the Haiti poisoning also \n     shipped about 50 tons of counterfeit glycerin to the United \n     States in 1995. Some of it was later resold to another \n     American customer, Avatar Corporation, before the deception \n     was discovered. ``Thank God we caught it when we did,'' said \n     Phil Ternes, chief operating officer of Avatar, a Chicago-\n     area supplier of bulk pharmaceutical and nonmedicinal \n     products. The F.D.A. said it was unaware of the shipment.\n       In China, the government is vowing to clean up its \n     pharmaceutical industry, in part because of criticism over \n     counterfeit drugs flooding the world markets. In December, \n     two top drug regulators were arrested on charges of taking \n     bribes to approve drugs. In addition, 440 counterfeiting \n     operations were closed down last year, the World Health \n     Organization said.\n       But when Chinese officials investigated the role of Chinese \n     companies in the Panama deaths, they found that no laws had \n     been broken, according to an official of the nation's drug \n     enforcement agency. China's drug regulation is ``a black \n     hole,'' said one trader who has done business through CNSC \n     Fortune Way, the Beijing-based broker that investigators say \n     was a crucial conduit for the Panama poison.\n       In this environment, Wang Guiping, a tailor with a ninth-\n     grade education and access to a chemistry book, found it easy \n     to enter the pharmaceutical supply business as a middleman. \n     He quickly discovered what others had before him: that \n     counterfeiting was a simple way to increase profits. And then \n     people in China began to die.\n\n\n                          Cheating the System\n\n       Mr. Wang spent years as a tailor in the manufacturing towns \n     of the Yangtze Delta, in eastern China. But he did not want \n     to remain a common craftsman, villagers say. He set his \n     sights on trading chemicals, a business rooted in the many \n     small chemical plants that have sprouted in the region. ``He \n     didn't know what he was doing,'' Mr. Wang's older brother, \n     Wang Guoping, said in an interview. ``He didn't understand \n     chemicals.'' But he did understand how to cheat the system. \n     Wang Guiping, 41, realized he could earn extra money by \n     substituting cheaper, industrial-grade syrup--not approved \n     for human consumption--for pharmaceutical grade syrup. To \n     trick pharmaceutical buyers, he forged his licenses and \n     laboratory analysis reports, records show.\n       Mr. Wang later told investigators that he figured no harm \n     would come from the substitution, because he initially tested \n     a small quantity. He did it with the expertise of a former \n     tailor. He swallowed some of it. When nothing happened, he \n     shipped it.\n       One company that used the syrup beginning in early 2005 was \n     Qiqihar No.2 Pharmaceutical, about 1,000 miles away in \n     Heilongjiang Province in the northeast. A buyer for the \n     factory had seen a posting for Mr. Wang's syrup on an \n     industry Web site.\n       After a while, Mr. Wang set out to find an even cheaper \n     substitute syrup so he could increase his profit even more, \n     according to a Chinese investigator. In a chemical book he \n     found what he was looking for: another odorless syrup--\n     diethylene glycol. At the time, it sold for 6,000 to 7,000 \n     yuan a ton, or about $725 to $845, while pharmaceutical-grade \n     syrup cost 15,000 yuan, or about $1,815, according to the \n     investigator.\n       Mr. Wang did not taste-test this second batch of syrup \n     before shipping it to Qiqihar Pharmaceutical, the government \n     investigator said, adding, ``He knew it was dangerous, but he \n     didn't know that it could kill.''\n       The manufacturer used the toxic syrup in five drug \n     products: ampules of Amillarisin A for gall bladder problems; \n     a special enema fluid for children; an injection for blood \n     vessel diseases; an intravenous pain reliever; and an \n     arthritis treatment.\n       In April 2006, one of southern China's finest hospitals, in \n     Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, began administering \n     Amillarisin A. Within a month or so, at least 18 people had \n     died after taking the medicine, though some had already been \n     quite sick.\n       Zhou Jianhong, 33, said his father took his first dose of \n     Amillarisin A on April 19. A week later he was in critical \n     condition. ``If you are going to die, you want to die at \n     home,'' Mr. Zhou said. ``So we checked him out of the \n     hospital.'' He died the next day. ``Everybody wants to invest \n     in the pharmaceutical industry and it is growing, but the \n     regulators can't keep up,'' Mr. Zhou said. ``We need a system \n     to assure our safety.'' The final death count is unclear, \n     since some people who took the medicine may have died in less \n     populated areas.\n       In a small town in Sichuan Province, a man named Zhou \n     Lianghui said the authorities would not acknowledge that his \n     wife had died from taking tainted Amillarisin A. But Mr. \n     Zhou, 38, said he matched the identification number on the \n     batch of medicine his wife received with a warning circular \n     distributed by drug officials. ``You probably cannot \n     understand a small town if you are in Beijing,'' Zhou \n     Lianghui said in a telephone interview. ``The sky is high, \n     and the emperor is far away. There are a lot of problems here \n     that the law cannot speak to.''\n       The failure of the government to stop poison from \n     contaminating the drug supply caused one of the bigger \n     domestic scandals of the year. Last May, China's premier, Wen \n     Jiabao, ordered an investigation of the deaths, declaring, \n     ''The pharmaceutical market is in disorder.''\n       At about the same time, 9,000 miles away in Panama, the \n     long rainy season had begun. Anticipating colds and coughs, \n     the government health program began manufacturing cough and \n     antihistamine syrup. The cough medicine was sugarless so that \n     even diabetics could use it. The medicine was mixed with a \n     pale yellow, almost translucent syrup that had arrived in 46 \n     barrels from Barcelona on the container ship Tobias Maersk. \n     Shipping records showed the contents to be 99.5 percent pure \n     glycerin. It would be months and many deaths later before \n     that certification was discovered to be pure fiction.\n\n\n                          a mysterious illness\n\n       Early last September, doctors at Panama City's big public \n     hospital began to notice patients exhibiting unusual \n     symptoms. They initially appeared to have Guillain-Barre \n     syndrome, a relatively rare neurological disorder that first \n     shows up as a weakness or tingling sensation in the legs. \n     That weakness often intensifies, spreading upward to the arms \n     and chest, sometimes causing total paralysis and an inability \n     to breathe.\n       The new patients had paralysis, but it did not spread \n     upward. They also quickly lost their ability to urinate, a \n     condition not associated with Guillain-Barre. Even more \n     unusual was the number of cases. In a full year,\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\n     doctors might see eight cases of Guillain-Barre, yet they saw \n     that many in just two weeks. Doctors sought help from an \n     infectious disease specialist, Nestor Sosa, an intense, \n     driven doctor who competes in triathlons and high-level \n     chess.\n       Dr. Sosa's medical specialty had a long, rich history in \n     Panama, once known as one of the world's unhealthiest places. \n     In one year in the late 1800s, a lethal mix of yellow fever \n     and malaria killed nearly 1 in every 10 residents of Panama \n     City. Only after the United States managed to overcome those \n     mosquito-borne diseases was it able to build the Panama Canal \n     without the devastation that undermined an earlier attempt by \n     the French. The suspected Guillain-Barre cases worried Dr. \n     Sosa. ``It was something really extraordinary, something that \n     was obviously reaching epidemic dimensions in our hospital,'' \n     he said.\n       With the death rate from the mystery illness near 50 \n     percent, Dr. Sosa alerted the hospital management, which \n     asked him to set up and run a task force to handle the \n     situation. The assignment, a daunting around-the-clock dash \n     to catch a killer, was one he eagerly embraced. Several years \n     earlier, Dr. Sosa had watched as other doctors identified the \n     cause of another epidemic, later identified as hantavirus, a \n     pathogen spread by infected rodents. ``I took care of \n     patients but I somehow felt I did not do enough,'' he said. \n     The next time, he vowed, would be different. Dr. Sosa set up \n     a 24-hour ``war room'' in the hospital, where doctors could \n     compare notes and theories as they scoured medical records \n     for clues. As a precaution, the patients with the mystery \n     illness were segregated and placed in a large empty room \n     awaiting renovation. Health care workers wore masks, \n     heightening fears in the hospital and the community.\n       ``That spread a lot of panic,'' said Dr. Jorge Motta, a \n     cardiologist who runs the Gorgas Memorial Institute, a widely \n     respected medical research center in Panama. ``That is always \n     a terrifying thought, that you will be the epicenter of a new \n     infectious disease, and especially a new infectious disease \n     that kills with a high rate of death, like this.'' Meanwhile, \n     patients kept coming, and hospital personnel could barely \n     keep up. ``I ended up giving C.P.R.,'' Dr. Sosa said. ``I \n     haven't given C.P.R. since I was a resident, but there were \n     so many crises going on.'' Frightened hospital patients had \n     to watch others around them die for reasons no one \n     understood, fearing that they might be next. As reports of \n     strange Guillain-Barre symptoms started coming in from other \n     parts of the country, doctors realized they were not just \n     dealing with a localized outbreak.\n       Pascuala Perez de Gonzalez, 67, sought treatment for a cold \n     at a clinic in Cocle Province, about a three-hour drive from \n     Panama City. In late September she was treated and sent home. \n     Within days, she could no longer eat; she stopped urinating \n     and went into convulsions. A decision was made to take her to \n     the public hospital in Panama City, but on the way she \n     stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated. She arrived at \n     the hospital in a deep coma and later died.\n       Medical records contained clues but also plenty of false \n     leads. Early victims tended to be males older than 60 and \n     diabetic with high blood pressure. About half had been given \n     Lisinopril, a blood pressure medicine distributed by the \n     public health system. But many who did not receive Lisinopril \n     still got sick. On the chance that those patients might have \n     forgotten that they had taken the drug, doctors pulled \n     Lisinopril from pharmacy shelves--only to return it after \n     tests found nothing wrong. Investigators would later discover \n     that Lisinopril did play an important, if indirect role in \n     the epidemic, but not in the way they had imagined.\n\n\n                              a major clue\n\n       One patient of particular interest to Dr. Sosa came into \n     the hospital with a heart attack, but no Guillain-Barre-type \n     symptoms. While undergoing treatment, the patient received \n     several drugs, including Lisinopril. After a while, he began \n     to exhibit the same neurological distress that was the \n     hallmark of the mystery illness. ``This patient is a major \n     clue,'' Dr. Sosa recalled saying. ``This is not something \n     environmental, this is not a folk medicine that's been taken \n     by the patients at home. This patient developed the disease \n     in the hospital, in front of us.'' Soon after, another \n     patient told Dr. Sosa that he, too, developed symptoms after \n     taking Lisinopril, but because the medicine made him cough, \n     he also took cough syrup--the same syrup, it turned out, that \n     had been given to the heart patient. ``I said this has got to \n     be it,'' Dr. Sosa recalled. ``We need to investigate this \n     cough syrup.'' The cough medicine had not initially aroused \n     much suspicion because many victims did not remember taking \n     it. ``Twenty-five percent of those people affected denied \n     that they had taken cough syrup, because it's a nonevent in \n     their lives,'' Dr. Motta said.\n       Investigators from the United States Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, who were in Panama helping out, \n     quickly put the bottles on a government jet and flew them to \n     the United States for testing. The next day, Oct. 11, as \n     Panamanian health officials were attending a news conference, \n     a Blackberry in the room went off. The tests, the C.D.C. was \n     reporting, had turned up diethylene glycol in the cough \n     syrup. The mystery had been solved. The barrels labeled \n     glycerin turned out to contain poison.\n       Dr. Sosa's exhilaration at learning the cause did not last \n     long. ``It's our medication that is killing these people,'' \n     he said he thought. ``It's not a virus, it's not something \n     that they got outside, but it was something we actually \n     manufactured.''\n       A nationwide campaign was quickly begun to stop people from \n     using the cough syrup. Neighborhoods were searched, but \n     thousands of bottles either had been discarded or could not \n     be found. As the search wound down, two major tasks remained: \n     count the dead and assign blame. Neither has been easy. A \n     precise accounting is all but impossible because, medical \n     authorities say, victims were buried before the cause was \n     known, and poor patients might not have seen doctors. Another \n     problem is that finding traces of diethylene glycol in \n     decomposing bodies is difficult at best, medical experts say. \n     Nonetheless, an Argentine pathologist who has studied \n     diethylene glycol poisonings helped develop a test for the \n     poison in exhumed bodies. Seven of the first nine bodies \n     tested showed traces of the poison, Panamanian authorities \n     said.\n       With the rainy season returning, though, the exhumations \n     are about to end. Dr. Jose Vicente Pachar, director of \n     Panama's Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, \n     said that as a scientist he would like a final count of the \n     dead. But he added, ``I should accept the reality that in the \n     case of Panama we are not going to know the exact number.''\n       Local prosecutors have made some arrests and are \n     investigating others connected to the case, including \n     officials of the import company and the government agency \n     that mixed and distributed the cold medicine. ``Our \n     responsibilities are to establish or discover the truth,'' \n     said Dimas Guevara, the homicide investigator guiding the \n     inquiry. But prosecutors have yet to charge anyone with \n     actually making the counterfeit glycerin. And if the Panama \n     investigation unfolds as other inquiries have, it is highly \n     unlikely that they ever will.\n\n\n                           a suspect factory\n\n       Panamanians wanting to see where their toxic nightmare \n     began could look up the Web site of the company in Hengxiang, \n     China, that investigators in four countries have identified \n     as having made the syrup--the Taixing Glycerine Factory. \n     There, under the words ``About Us,'' they would see a picture \n     of a modern white building nearly a dozen stories tall, \n     adorned by three arches at the entrance. The factory, the Web \n     site boasts, ``can strictly obey the contract and keep its \n     word.'' But like the factory's syrup, all is not as it seems.\n       There are no tall buildings in Hengxiang, a country town \n     with one main road. The factory is not certified to sell any \n     medical ingredients, Chinese officials say. And it looks \n     nothing like the picture on the Internet. In reality, its \n     chemicals are mixed in a plain, one-story brick building. The \n     factory is in a walled compound, surrounded by small shops \n     and farms. In the spring, nearby fields of rape paint the \n     countryside yellow. Near the front gate, a sign over the road \n     warns, ``Beware of counterfeits.'' But it was posted by a \n     nearby noodle machine factory that appears to be worried \n     about competition. The Taixing Glycerine Factory bought its \n     diethylene glycol from the same manufacturer as Mr. Wang, the \n     former tailor, the government investigator said. From this \n     spot in China's chemical country, the 46 barrels of toxic \n     syrup began their journey, passing from company to company, \n     port to port and country to country, apparently without \n     anyone testing their contents.\n       Traders should be thoroughly familiar with their suppliers, \n     United States health officials say. ``One simply does not \n     assume that what is labeled is indeed what it is,'' said Dr. \n     Murray Lumpkin, deputy commissioner for international and \n     special programs for the Food and Drug Administration. In the \n     Panama Case, names of suppliers were removed from shipping \n     documents as they passed from one entity to the next, \n     according to records and investigators. That is a practice \n     some traders use to prevent customers from bypassing them on \n     future purchases, but it also hides the provenance of the \n     product. The first distributor was the Beijing trading \n     company, CNSC Fortune Way, a unit of a state-owned \n     business that began by supplying goods and services to \n     Chinese personnel and business officials overseas.\n       As China's market reach expanded, Fortune Way focused its \n     business on pharmaceutical ingredients, and in 2003, it \n     brokered the sale of the suspect syrup made by the Taixing \n     Glycerine Factory. The manufacturer's certificate of analysis \n     showed the batch to be 99.5 percent pure. Whether the Taixing \n     Glycerine Factory actually performed the test has not been \n     publicly disclosed. Original certificates of analysis should \n     be passed on to each new buyer, said Kevin J. McGlue, a board \n     member of the International Pharmaceutical Excipients \n     Council. In this case, that was not done.\n       Fortune Way translated the certificate into English, \n     putting its name--not the Taixing Glycerine Factory's--at the \n     top of the document, before shipping the barrels to a second \n     trading company, this one in Barcelona. Li Can, managing \n     director at Fortune Way, said he did not remember the \n     transaction and could not comment, adding, ``There is a high \n     volume of trade.'' Upon receiving the barrels in September \n     2003, the Spanish company, Rasfer International, did not test \n     the contents, either. It copied the chemical analysis \n     provided by Fortune Way, then put its logo on it. Ascension \n     Criado, Rasfer's manager, said in an e-mail response to \n     written questions that when Fortune Way shipped the syrup, it \n     did not say who made\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\n     it. Several weeks later, Rasfer shipped the drums to a \n     Panamanian broker, the Medicom Business Group. ``Medicom \n     never asked us for the name of the manufacturer,'' Ms. Criado \n     said.\n       A lawyer for Medicam, Valentin Jaen, said his client was a \n     victim, too. ``They were tricked by somebody,'' Mr. Jaen \n     said. ``They operated in good faith.'' In Panama, the barrels \n     sat unused for more than two years, and officials said \n     Medicam improperly changed the expiration date on the syrup. \n     During that time, the company never tested the product. And \n     the Panamanian government, which bought the 46 barrels and \n     used them to make cold medicine, also failed to detect the \n     poison, officials said. The toxic pipeline ultimately emptied \n     into the bloodstream of people like Ernesto Osorio, a former \n     high school teacher in Panama City. He spent two months in \n     the hospital after ingesting poison cough syrup last \n     September.\n       Just before Christmas, after a kidney dialysis treatment, \n     Mr. Osorio stood outside the city's big public hospital in a \n     tear-splattered shirt, describing what his life had become. \n     ``I'm not an eighth of what I used to be,'' Mr. Osorio said, \n     his partly paralyzed face hanging like a slab of meat. ``I \n     have trouble walking. Look at my face, look at my tears.'' \n     The tears, he said apologetically, were not from emotion, but \n     from nerve damage. And yet, Mr. Osorio knows he is one of the \n     lucky victims. ``They didn't know how to keep the killer out \n     of the medicine,'' he said simply.\n       While the suffering in Panama was great, the potential \n     profit--at least for the Spanish trading company, Rasfer--was \n     surprisingly small. For the 46 barrels of glycerin, Rasfer \n     paid Fortune Way $9,900, then sold them to Medicom for \n     $11,322, according to records.\n       Chinese authorities have not disclosed how much Fortune Way \n     and the Taixing Glycerine Factory made on their end, or how \n     much they knew about what was in the barrels.\n       ``The fault has to be traced back to areas of production,'' \n     said Dr. Motta, the cardiologist in Panama who helped uncover \n     the source of the epidemic. ``This was my plea--please, this \n     thing is happening to us, make sure whoever did this down the \n     line is not doing it to Peru or Sierra Leone or some other \n     place.''\n\n\n                      A Counterfeiter's Confession\n\n       The power to prosecute the counterfeiters is now in the \n     hands of the Chinese. Last spring, the government moved \n     quickly against Mr. Wang, the former tailor who poisoned \n     Chinese residents. The authorities caught up with him at a \n     roadblock in Taizhou, a city just north of Taixing, in \n     chemical country. He was weak and sick, and he had not eaten \n     in two days. Inside his white sedan was a bankbook and cash. \n     He had fled without his wife and teenage son.\n       Chinese patients were dead, a political scandal was brewing \n     and the authorities wanted answers. Mr. Wang was taken to a \n     hospital. Then, in long sessions with investigators, he gave \n     them what they wanted, explaining his scheme, how he tested \n     industrial syrup by drinking it, how he decided to use \n     diethylene glycol and how he conned pharmaceutical companies \n     into buying his syrup, according to a government official who \n     was present for his interrogation. ``He made a fortune, but \n     none of it went to his family,'' said Wang Xiaodong, a former \n     village official who knows Mr. Wang and his siblings. ``He \n     liked to gamble.''\n       Mr. Wang remains in custody as the authorities decide \n     whether he should be put to death. The Qiqihar drug plant \n     that made the poisonous medicine has been closed, and five \n     employees are now being prosecuted for causing ``a serious \n     accident.'' In contrast to the Wang Guiping investigation, \n     Chinese authorities have been tentative in acknowledging \n     China's link to the Panama tragedy, which involved a state-\n     owned trading company. No one in China has been charged with \n     committing the fraud that ended up killing so many in \n     Panama.\n       Sun Jing, the pharmaceutical program officer for the World \n     Health Organization in Beijing, said the health agency sent a \n     fax ``to remind the Chinese government that China should not \n     be selling poisonous products overseas.'' Ms. Sun said the \n     agency did not receive an official reply.\n       Last fall, at the request of the United States--Panama has \n     no diplomatic relations with China--the State Food and Drug \n     Administration of China investigated the Taixing Glycerine \n     Factory and Fortune Way. The agency tested one batch of \n     glycerin from the factory, and found no glycerin, only \n     diethylene glycol and two other substances, a drug official \n     said. Since then, the Chinese drug administration has \n     concluded that it has no jurisdiction in the case because the \n     factory is not certified to make medicine. The agency reached \n     a similar conclusion about Fortune Way, saying that as an \n     exporter it was not engaged in the pharmaceutical business. \n     ``We did not find any evidence that either of these companies \n     had broken the law,'' said Yan Jiangying, a spokeswoman for \n     the drug administration. ``So a criminal investigation was \n     never opened.''\n       A drug official said the investigation was subsequently \n     handed off to an agency that tests and certifies commercial \n     products--the General Administration of Quality Supervision, \n     Inspection and Quarantine. But the agency acted surprised to \n     learn that it was now in charge. ``What investigation?'' \n     asked Wang Jian, director of its Taixing branch. ``I'm not \n     aware of any investigation involving a glycerin factory.'' \n     Besides, Huang Tong, an investigator in that office, said, \n     ``We rarely get involved in products that are sold for \n     export. `` Wan Qigang, the legal representative for the \n     Taixing Glycerine Factory, said in an interview late last \n     year that the authorities had not questioned him about the \n     Panama poisoning, and that his company made only industrial-\n     grade glycerin. ``I can tell you for certain that we have no \n     connection with Panama or Spain,'' Mr. Wan said. But in \n     recent months, the Glycerine Factory has advertised 99.5 \n     percent pure glycerin on the Internet.\n       Mr. Wan recently declined to answer any more questions. \n     ``If you come here as a guest, I will welcome you,'' Mr . Wan \n     said. ``But if you come again wanting to talk about this \n     matter, I will make a telephone call.'' A local government \n     official said Mr. Wan was told not to grant interviews. A \n     five-minute walk away, another manufacturer, the Taixing \n     White Oil Factory, also advertises medical glycerin on the \n     Internet, yet it, too, has no authorization to make it. The \n     company's Web site says its products have been exported to \n     America, Australia and Italy.''\n       Ding Xiang, who represents the White Oil Factory, denied \n     that his company made pharmaceutical-grade glycerin, but he \n     said chemical trading companies in Beijing often called, \n     asking for it. ``They want us to mark the barrels glycerin,'' \n     Mr. Ding said in late December. ``I tell them we cannot do \n     that.'' Mr. Ding said he stopped answering calls from \n     Beijing. ``If this stuff is taken overseas and improperly \n     used. . . .'' He did not complete the thought. In chemical \n     country, product names are not always what they seem. ``The \n     only two factories in Taixing that make glycerin don't even \n     make glycerin,'' said Jiang Peng, who oversees inspections \n     and investigations in the Taixing branch of the State Food \n     and Drug Administration. ``It is a different product.''\n\n\n                             All in a Name\n\n       One lingering mystery involves the name of the product made \n     by the Taixing Glycerine Factory. The factory had called its \n     syrup ``TD'' glycerin. The letters TD were in virtually all \n     the shipping documents. What did TD mean?\n       Spanish medical authorities concluded that it stood for a \n     manufacturing process. Chinese inspectors thought it was the \n     manufacturer's secret formula. But Yuan Kailin, a former \n     salesman for the factory, said he knew what the TD meant \n     because a friend and former manager of the factory, Ding \n     Yuming, had once told him. TD stood for the Chinese word \n     ``tidai'' (pronounced tee-die), said Mr. Yuan, who left his \n     job in 1998 and still lives about a mile from the factory. In \n     Chinese, tidai means substitute. A clue that might have \n     revealed the poison, the counterfeit product, was hiding in \n     plain sight. It was in the product name.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, if I could have the attention of the \nSenate, I was going to ask consent about a managers' amendment. Is it \nthe intention of the Senator from North Dakota to object?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Am I to be recognized for 1 minute at this point?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, point of order: What is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. One minute is consumed so that is all that remains; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator's point is I am entitled to 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Cochran \namendment. The Cochran amendment has been law since 2003. The Secretary \ncannot certify as a result of it. So it is an amendment that will void \nanything that is in the bipartisan legislation we have offered to try \nto make imported drugs, FDA-approved drugs, at a lower price available \nto American consumers. All Senator Cochran described would be dealt \nwith by the safety amendments in our amendment. If his amendment \nprevails, none of the safety issues--pedigree, certification, \nanticounterfeiting--in our amendment will survive. That is the problem. \nIf we stand with the American people who want lower drug prices--a safe \ndrug supply, FDA approved--and believe they should not be paying the \nhighest prices in the world, vote against the Cochran amendment and for \nthe underlying Dorgan-Snowe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1010.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from South Dakota \n(Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), the Senator from \nRhode Island (Mr. Reed), and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Allard), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback), \nthe Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. \nInhofe), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. \nInhofe) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 151 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     McCaskill\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--11\n\n     Allard\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Dodd\n     Ensign\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Tester\n  The amendment (No. 1010) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I request that the next vote be a 10-\nminute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That request has been granted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes for debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 990, offered by \nthe Senator from North Dakota, as amended.\n  Who yields time?\n  Since no one yields time, time will be equally charged to both sides.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we yield back the remaining time, all \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think we are ready to voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n990, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 990), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmanagers' amendments be agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we \nreceived the managers' amendment about 30 minutes ago and I am still \nreviewing some of the amendments. I object at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes for debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1082.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. May we have order. May we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, again, I thank all of the membership \nfor their cooperation. We have been on this legislation for 1 week. We \nbelieve we have a managers' amendment which reflects the best judgment \nof Senator Enzi and myself and we will offer that at the appropriate \ntime. I mentioned earlier during the debate and discussion, the essence \nof the managers' amendment. I think we probably have possibly two more \nvotes that might require rollcall votes and then we would go to final \npassage. I think we have broad support for this legislation which is so \nessential if we are going to bring the FDA into the 21st century, and \nif we are going to assure safety for the prescription drugs our \nfamilies take, insist on a safe food supply, and ensure that the FDA \nhas the best in terms of science.\n  I again thank my friend and colleague from Wyoming. I hope we can get \na strong vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we please have order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator mind saying that again, please.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 30 seconds. I was reminding the \nmembership, as the Senator from West Virginia knows, this bill is going \nto ensure the safety of our pharmaceutical products. It is going to \nensure the safety of our food products. It is going to insist that the \nFDA promote the latest in terms of science. We need to push the FDA \ninto the 21st century, and this legislation will do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am all for pulling or pushing the FDA \ninto whatever century we determine at this point. I only pointed out \nthat I wish to review some of the managers' package that deals with \nginseng, baby turtles, tanning beds, and more, and I want a bit of \ntime--and perhaps others would if they don't know these amendments \nexist--to take a look at the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, on our side of the aisle I do appreciate \nthe tremendous amount of effort Senator Kennedy and his staff and many \nothers on the other side of the aisle who have worked with those of us \non this side of the aisle to get particularly the major concerns that \nwere brought up during the markup in committee taken care of. There are \ntremendous amounts of things in here both sides have worked on and in \nsome cases come up with a third way of doing it. I think we are on the \nright track here. The product will make a huge difference in the bill, \nand I hope we can move forward.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee \n     substitute amendment, as modified, to S. 1082, the FDA \n     Revitalization bill.\n         Ted Kennedy, Dick Durbin, Byron L. Dorgan, B.A. Mikulski, \n           Patty Murray, Claire McCaskill, Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod \n           Brown, Jack Reed, Herb Kohl, Charles Schumer, \n           Christopher Dodd, Barbara Boxer, Bill Nelson, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Debbie Stabenow.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this question, the yeas are 82, the nays \nare 8. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as far as I know, on this side, I think \nwe have one amendment. We are inquiring of the Senator to see whether \nit will be offered. I think Senator Enzi can speak for the other side. \nWe still have to work through the managers' amendment. I want to make \nit very clear that we are glad to get into the details of all that. I \ntried to summarize the managers' amendment. It involves a great many \nideas from our side of the aisle. So, hopefully, we will be able to \nmove that process.\n  I know Members want to know how we are going to proceed now through \nthe afternoon. We have good attendance, and we would like to at least \ngive the membership an idea about how we are going to proceed. We have \nbeen on this legislation now for a week, and we have made very good \nprogress. I think the vote on cloture demonstrates the strong support \nfor this underlying legislation.\n  We would like to move this legislation in a timely way and not delay \nit needlessly. So we will inquire of our colleagues further--if they \nhave amendments, hopefully, they will let us know. Hopefully, we will \nhave the opportunity to deal with the managers' amendment in a timely \nway. It would be unfortunate if we did not, since we have given \nassurance to Members on both sides of the aisle and worked long and \nhard with them to try to get this through. Obviously, any Senator is \nentitled to review the managers' amendment. We are getting very close \nto the point where we are prepared to move along with this legislation. \nThis would seriously compromise a lot of colleagues who voted with the \nassurance that we were going to move ahead. We are more than delighted \nto get into the description of these various amendments and explain why \nwe have recommended them. I hope we will not have delay for delay's \nsake, but that we will find a way to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask the managers through the \nChair--I have about a 10-minute speech on another subject I would like \nto make at an appropriate time. I don't want to interfere with the \nprogress of the bill. I ask the Chair whether now would be an \nappropriate time or whether they would like me to wait.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think it would be appropriate for the \nSenator to speak now. I thank him for his courtesy.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     English: Our National Language\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, at the end of March, the U.S. Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission sued the Salvation Army for allegedly \ndiscriminating against two of the Salvation Army's employees in a \nBoston-area thrift store by requiring them to speak English on the job. \nThis lawsuit means that every business in America, from the shoe shop \nto Wal-Mart, will need to hire lawyers to prove it has a legitimate \nbusiness purpose if that business wants to require employees to speak \nour national language while at work.\n  I asked the chair of the EEOC in what language she holds staff \nmeetings. She said, in English.\n  We conduct Senate debates in English.\n  Since 1906, no immigrant has been able to become an American citizen \nwithout first learning English. At Hillsboro High School in Nashville, \nwhere my daughter graduated, students speak 28 native languages, but \nclasses are conducted in English.\n  Federal law requires that all children in public schools be tested in \nEnglish, and that if they do not know English, they must learn it as \nsoon as possible.\n  Over the last 40 years, I have voted for or supported, I believe, \nalmost every civil rights or anti-discrimination law that has been \noffered. But in America, requiring English in the workplace is not \ndiscrimination; it is common sense. More important, it is our common \nlanguage. Our common language helps unite the diversity in this Nation \nof immigrants.\n  That is why, during the debate on immigration a year ago, the Senate \nadopted my proposals: First, to provide $500 grants to help prospective \ncitizens learn basic English; second, to allow someone who becomes \nfluent in English to become a citizen after 4 years instead of 5.\n  The Senate also declared English to be America's national language \nand provided that anyone illegally here must first learn English before \ngaining legal status.\n  A few Senators said we were wasting our time debating national unity \nand language. But other nations are discovering just how important and \ndifficult it is to unite one's country. Look at how today Turkey is \nstruggling with whether to become more secular or more Muslim, \nstruggling with what to do about its Kurdish minority. Germans are \nstruggling to absorb Turkish workers. Italians are establishing \nagencies to help new Muslim residents ``feel Italian.'' Three alienated \nBritish citizens, children of Pakistani immigrants, blew up a London \nsubway 2 years ago. The children of disaffected Muslim immigrants in \nFrance burned cars during that country's elections this weekend, a \nsmall echo of much larger riots 2 years ago.\n\n  We Americans are rightly proud of our diversity. But Iraq and \nJerusalem and the Balkans are also diverse. America's greatest \naccomplishment is not our magnificent diversity. Our greatest \naccomplishment is that we have united that diversity into one country.\n  Our original national motto inscribed in the wall right above the \nPresiding Officer's chair is ``One from Many,'' not ``Many from One.''\n  Most nations unite around ancestry or race, making it hard for \nnewcomers. Imagine ``becoming Japanese'' or ``becoming German.'' In \nother words, the United States Constitution says race or ancestry can \nhave nothing to do with someone becoming an American. Instead, American \nunity is based upon ideas, principles found in our founding documents--\nsuch as liberty, equal opportunity, and the rule of law. New citizens \nmust, therefore, pass an exam, which was recently improved, about the \nDeclaration of Independence, our Constitution, and United States \nhistory.\n  The first Europeans in America were French and Spanish, but our \ncultural beginnings and primary institutions\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nand laws were Protestant and English. So English became the way \nAmericans of many backgrounds communicated with one another.\n  In the 20th century, according to the late president of the American \nFederation of Teachers, Albert Shanker, American common--or public--\nschools were created primarily to help immigrant children learn \narithmetic and to read and write in English with the hope that they \nwould go home and teach their parents. Then, in 1906, all new citizens \nwere required to know English.\n  That has turned out to be a fortunate choice. English has also become \na unifying language internationally. For example, every Chinese student \nis expected to study English. When Carlos Ghosn, who speaks several \nlanguages, became chief executive officer of Nissan, he began \nconducting business meetings in Nissan's Tokyo headquarters in English.\n  The most fortunate children in our country are those who grow up \nlearning more than one language, but American parents know that one of \nthose must be English. Mastering English is how an American succeeds in \nschool, in the workplace, on the computer, and in international \naffairs.\n  A century ago, many American companies and private associations led \nan effort to Americanize new immigrants. They taught their employees \nEnglish and the National Anthem. Today, the EEOC is suing the Salvation \nArmy for doing the very same thing, insisting that its employees learn \nand speak this country's common language.\n  According to an article that appeared today in USA Today:\n\n       The number of charges filed with the Federal Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging \n     discrimination based on such English-only policies is . . . \n     six times as large as 10 years ago, [growing] from 32 charges \n     in 1996 to about 200 in 2006.\n\n  This is not only an astonishing waste of the EEOC's time and \ntaxpayers' money--the EEOC has a backlog of 56,000 cases--but it is \nalso contrary to everything we know about the importance of achieving \nunity in our country.\n  Speaking English is not a punitive requirement; it is a requirement \nto help us communicate with one another. A 9-1-1 telephone call isn't \nof much help to a Chinese-speaking person if the employee answering the \nphone speaks only Spanish.\n  In this case, the Salvation Army posted its requirements that \nemployees in thrift stores speak English. The two employees in question \nhad worked for the Salvation Army for 5 years. They were then given an \nextra year to learn English. When they didn't, they were let go.\n  I intend to introduce legislation to put an end to these lawsuits by \nmaking it clear that requiring employees to speak English is not \nillegal discrimination as long as the policy is clearly posted.\n  More than that, I can think of nothing that would be more in our \nnational interest than helping anyone in our country learn our common \nlanguage. That is why later this month, when the immigration \nlegislation comes to the floor, I will introduce again my amendment \nthat the Senate adopted last year giving every adult immigrant a $500 \nvoucher to receive English instruction and allowing those immigrants \nwho want to become citizens to do that in 4 years instead of 5 if they \nbecome proficient--rather than just achieve a basic level--in English.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have discussed the fact that there are too many \nadults eager to learn English standing in line in Boston and Nashville \nfor adult learning programs. They need help learning English, and I \nhope we can rectify that soon.\n  For 10 years I have suggested, most recently to Bill Gates at a \nhearing, that I would like to see established a private foundation that \nwould loan $500 to any person living in this country who wants to spend \nit at an accredited institution learning English, with the hope that \nsomeday that student would pay it back. The payoff to American unity \nwould be worth the cost by itself. But I believe such a bank would \neventually grow to a huge size funded by grateful new Americans.\n  Without our common language we would be a giant Tower of Babel. It \nwould be difficult for Americans to talk with one another, to debate \npolitical issues, and to vote. It would be harder to function as a \ndemocracy and to unite as one country. Without English, we would risk \nbecoming just another United Nations instead of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the article from the USA Today to which I made reference.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, May 7, 2007]\n\n                 English-only Workplaces Spark Lawsuits\n\n                         (By Stephanie Armour)\n\n       Some companies are adopting policies that require employees \n     to speak only English on the job, spurring a backlash of \n     lawsuits alleging that such rules can discriminate against \n     immigrants.\n       The English-only policies are coming as the number of \n     immigrants in the USA soars: Nearly 11 million residents are \n     not fluent in English, according to U.S. Census data, up from \n     6.6 million in 1990. Nearly 34 million residents are foreign-\n     born, according to 2003 U.S. Census data. That's up from 24.6 \n     million in 1996.\n       ``This is becoming a much bigger issue,'' says Amy \n     McAndrew, an employment lawyer at Philadelphia-based Pepper \n     Hamilton. ``Employers want to have policies because of safety \n     and customer service, but they have to be careful not to be \n     discriminatory.''\n       Employers may legally adopt an English-only speaking rule \n     if they can show it is a business necessity, such as the need \n     for communication with co-workers and customers or safety-\n     sensitive situations where use of a common language could \n     prevent an emergency, she says.\n       But Ronna Timpa, owner of Workplace ESL Solutions in \n     Henderson, Nev., says employers go too far in adopting strict \n     policies that prevent co-workers from talking in their native \n     language even during lunch.\n       ``Imagine how you would feel if you couldn't speak your own \n     language in the bathroom,'' she says.\n       The issue typically comes up in lower-wage and service-\n     sector jobs.\n       The number of charges filed with the federal Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging \n     discrimination based on such English-only policies is small \n     but six times as large as 10 years ago, from 32 charges in \n     1996 to about 200 in 2006.\n       ``If the rules enter work breaks, they will be difficult to \n     defend or justify,'' says Dianna Johnston, assistant legal \n     counsel with the EEOC, adding that some employers also have \n     policies requiring employees to be fluent in English.\n       Employers have faced lawsuits for enforcing English-only \n     policies. In April, Flushing Manor Geriatric Center agreed to \n     pay $900,000 to settle an EEOC lawsuit based in part on the \n     company's English-only policy. The New York-based geriatric \n     center barred Haitian employees from speaking in Creole while \n     allowing other foreign languages to be spoken, according to \n     the EEOC.\n       That prohibition also included that no Creole be spoken \n     during breaks, and largely affected employees who worked in \n     nursing, food service and housekeeping, the EEOC says.\n       ``There was no justifiable reason when there's not a \n     specific business necessity,'' says Stella Yamada, an EEOC \n     lawyer.\n       Marc Wenger, a New York-based lawyer representing the \n     geriatric center, says the EEOC characterization is \n     inaccurate and it believes its language policies are \n     consistent with EEOC guidelines. He says there was no \n     restriction on using other languages during breaks, adding \n     the consent decree was not an admission of wrongdoing.\n       Some employers have extended the policy to customers, too. \n     Geno's Steaks, a Philadelphia landmark, generated a storm of \n     media and blogger attention in 2006 when its owner posted a \n     sign requesting that customers order only in English.\n       At New York-based Hakia, which provides an Internet-based \n     search engine, employees who are hired must speak English, \n     and English is the language used for all business \n     communications, says President Melek Pulatkonak. Many \n     employees are immigrants who speak Turkish, German, Russian, \n     Indian, Romanian or Spanish. Employees are free to speak \n     their native language in private conversations.\n       ``We have a very international team,'' Pulatkonak says. \n     ``Sometimes we have slips, and we just e-mail them back in \n     English.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to discuss the amendment Senator \nRoberts and I have worked on, along with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nEnzi, regarding direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. I \nam concerned about the proliferation of this kind of advertising, its \neffect on public health and health care spending, how much money we are \nspending on health care. Senator Roberts and I want to make sure they \nare done in a responsible way so that consumers have good information \nand it deals with safety and efficacy. I believe, along with Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi, we have crafted an amendment that addresses \nany first amendment concerns, and I believe we\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\nhave also crafted an amendment that will help the FDA get better safety \nand efficacy information to consumers who see these ads.\n  I wish to take this time to discuss my concerns with direct-to-\nconsumer advertising of prescription drugs. Keep in mind, we are \ntalking about ads you see on television, you hear on the radio, you see \nin newspapers and magazines for drugs that you cannot buy unless you \nget a prescription. It raises all kinds of questions. Why would you \nadvertise drugs that you can't buy? I can see advertising Advil or \nTylenol or a host of other over-the-counter-type drugs that you can go \ninto a drugstore and buy, such as cold pills and antihistamines. But \nfor prescription drugs, it raises an interesting question: Why would \nthese drug companies be spending so much money advertising directly to \nyou if you can't even buy it unless you get a prescription?\n  Let's look at the history of what has happened. Information that is \nconveyed in these ads is supposed to balance risks and benefits of a \nspecific drug and provide information to the public. But what we have \nseen happening over the last several years is less and less information \nand more and more promotion--ads that minimize the risks associated \nwith the drugs and maximize the benefits. They are not balanced. As a \nresult, in exchange for an increased market share for a drug company, \nthe consumer is left with an incomplete and even a dangerous \nunderstanding of a drug's risks and benefits.\n  More often than not, these ads do not provide consumers with accurate \ncomparisons between new drugs or even older drugs that are still \neffective.\n  For example, in a 2002 FDA survey of physicians, 65 percent of \nphysicians thought patients were confused by the relative risks and \nbenefits of drugs they saw advertised; 75 percent of the doctors \nbelieved the ads led patients to overestimate the efficacy of \nadvertised drugs. All of this can only lead to one conclusion, that \nthere is not a fair balance of risks and benefits in these ads.\n  Worse still, 86 percent of physicians had a patient who asked about a \nspecific drug. They didn't ask about something for their back pain or \nfor allergies, they asked about a specific drug. Eighty-six percent of \nphysicians said the patients asked about specific drugs. As it turns \nout, the patient usually got that drug.\n  Seventy-seven percent of primary care physicians prescribed a drug a \npatient asked for; 74 percent of specialists did.\n  Let's look at some of these drugs and what happened. We all know what \nhappened when Vioxx, a pain reliever now associated with heart attacks, \nwas pulled from the market after being heavily marketed to consumers. \nConsumers never had a clear picture of the risks and benefits \nassociated with the drug. Millions of consumers were put at risk.\n  One wonders how many doctors said to a patient who came in: You know, \nif Advil works for you now, you probably don't need Vioxx.\n  Look what happened with Vioxx: 2 million Americans took it. It was \nmarketed in 80 countries. Madam President, $100 million per year was \nspent on direct-to-consumer advertising of the prescription drug Vioxx \nover about 5 years. So about a half billion dollars was spent to tell \nyou Vioxx was good for you.\n  What happened? Because of all this heavy advertising, there was $2.3 \nbillion in sales in 2003. We all know what happened. It was pulled from \nthe market in 2004. Why? Because thousands of people died of heart \nattacks because they took Vioxx. Yet this product was subject to heavy \ndirect-to-consumer advertising.\n  We all remember the Vioxx ads, how good it was for you. Then we find \nout it was causing heart attacks. Again, this is a clear indication of \nthe irresponsibility of these drug companies in direct-to-consumer \nadvertising. It has just gotten out of hand. It has totally gotten out \nof hand.\n  I will show on the next chart what I mean by getting out of hand. \nHere is the spending on direct-to-consumer advertising. Keep in mind, \nprior to 1996, we didn't have direct-to-consumer advertising very much \non TV and radio. Pharmaceutical companies basically marketed to \ndoctors. You went into the doctor's office. You saw things in the \ndoctor's office. But the doctors were the ones who got the \nadvertisements.\n  In 1997, the FDA promulgated some rules which opened up the system. \nThen, all of a sudden, the drug companies started marketing to \nconsumers. In the first year, they spent $791 million. Look what has \nhappened every year. More and more and more. In 2003, $3.2 billion was \nspent on advertising. I made the chart before I got the latest figures, \nbut today I got the 2005 figures. It is now $4.2 billion. Madam \nPresident, $4.2 billion was spent in 2005 advertising drugs you can't \nbuy unless you get a prescription. Keep in mind, these are drugs for \nwhich you have to have a prescription. So it has gotten out of hand.\n  To make matters even worse, most of this money that is spent, $4.2 \nbillion in 2005, was for the promotion of only 50 brand-name drugs. As \na GAO study found out, these drugs are most often for chronic \nconditions, not for cancer--not for life-threatening diseases--but for \nchronic conditions. GAO found the ads tend to be for antihistamines, \nsleep aids, acid reflux, and--as we all know too well from watching \nevening television--things like impotence. We all know this is true. We \nknow it. Look at the ads on TV every night.\n\n  It is no coincidence these advertisements are for drugs that you must \ntake repeatedly. It is so you will get hooked on a brand and then you \nhave to keep taking it and taking it and taking it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator held up one or two charts dealing with Vioxx, \na pain medicine. He is aware, I know--and I believe it was Dr. Graham \nfrom the FDA who testified--that somewhere around 50,000 to 75,000 \nAmericans died of heart attacks as a result of that drug. I know \nSenator Harkin is talking about the advertising of these drugs. That \nwas a drug that was advertised as a new generation of pain killers--\ndistinctly different and distinctly better. Not only was that not the \ncase, but it turns out that it posed a very substantial risk to tens of \nthousands of people, in the FDA's own testimony, who died.\n  If I might make one additional point. The Senator is raising a \nquestion I have raised on the floor in the last week or so about this \nissue. You turn on the television in the morning while you are brushing \nyour teeth--if you have a little television in your bathroom--and you \nare minding your own business, when a commercial comes on and says: You \nknow what you ought to be doing? You ought to go to your doctor and ask \nhim if the purple pill would be right for you. You don't know what the \npurple pill is, but there is a lot of advertising saying you are \nsomehow unworthy if you don't go to the doctor to see if the purple \npill isn't right for you because life would be a lot better if you were \ntaking the purple pill.\n  That is the way this advertising goes. You can only get these drugs \nby a doctor's prescription. Yet the television set is giving us all \nthis advertising from a pharmaceutical industry saying: You know what \nyou need to do, you need to ask your doctor if you shouldn't be taking \nmore prescription drugs. Maybe a green pill, maybe a purple pill, but \nlife will be better if you would do this.\n  The reason I wanted you to yield, is that doctors are saying that \nwhat they are finding in their offices these days is patients are \ncoming in and the patients are saying: Here is the medicine I want \nbecause I saw it on television. Obviously, the doctors aren't happy \nabout that because they are the ones who should be diagnosing and \nprescribing.\n  I wanted to make the point that I think your presentation is right. I \nthink there are only two countries in the world, us and New Zealand, \nthat allow virtually unrestricted, complete public advertising on \nprescription drugs that can only be prescribed by doctors.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The GAO did this study which found that 86 percent of \nphysicians responded that patients came in to ask about a specific \ndrug--the purple pill, the green pill. You might say: Why are the \ndoctors doing it? One doctor said to me: You are right. They shouldn't \nbe advertising this. Patients coming in would be just as well served by \ntaking an aspirin or something like that, very cheap and readily \navailable, and I tell them that. The doctor is telling me this. I tell \nthem that, and they\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\nsay, no, no, they saw this ad. They want this. I tell them no, but they \nsay: Well, Doctor, if it is all the same with you, I would just as soon \nhave that pill. So he says: Well, if you want it, I will prescribe it.\n  So there is an undue amount of pressure being put on doctors right \nnow to prescribe these drugs because patients are demanding it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is the case with this advertising that if you take \nthis purple drug, you know, you will be riding in a convertible, \nperhaps through a beautiful meadow, where the Sun is shining and the \nbirds are singing and life is wonderful. Why? Because you took the \npurple drug. And by the way, go ask the doctor if you shouldn't have \nsome of this.\n  The Senator is raising a very important question, especially about \nthe dramatic growth in direct-to-consumer advertising about a product \nthat can only be achieved through a prescription by a doctor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I thank the Senator for his great leadership in all \nthese areas on drugs, on reimportation, which I was proud to support \nhim on. We have to get a handle on this.\n  We all have first amendment concerns. People have the right to \nadvertise, but I question whether they can advertise in a way, like \nwith Vioxx, where they tell you all the benefits, but they do not tell \nyou the risks, or they put them in such little fine print that it takes \na 50-power magnifying glass to read them.\n  On television, how many of you have seen the ads where they come on \nwith this wonderful advertisement of a drug, and then in the end it \nsays: Not to be taken by, and it goes so fast you can't understand what \nthey are saying. It is akin to listening to an auctioneer. You can't \nunderstand what they are saying. So you see all the benefits of it, but \nyou don't get any of the downsides.\n  One might ask: Why are companies doing it? Well, simple. They make \nmoney. The Kaiser Family Foundation found an additional $4.20 in \nsavings for every dollar spent on advertising. There you go. If you \ncould spend a dollar and make $4.20, who wouldn't?\n  So we have to ask some questions. What happens when we create an \nartificial demand? What is the effect on our budget? Some people might \nsay: Well, that is OK, but people are spending their own money or the \ninsurance company is. That is not so. Think of all the money we are \nspending on Medicare and Medicaid for these drugs that people are being \nbeaten over the head with every day on these ads on television. Think \nabout the baby boomers retiring.\n\n  I said that by 2005 the spending had gone to $4.2 billion. Think of \nwhat it is going to be this year. I will bet it will be over $5 billion \nthis year, spent on advertising alone, for drugs you can't buy unless \nyou get a prescription. So it is clear to me it has very little to do \nwith patient care and very much to do with making money. I don't mind \ndrug companies making money. That is fine. They do good things. They \ninvest money in research--not as much as I wish they would--and they \ncome up with good drugs. We all take them when we get sick or when we \nhave a disease. The problem is it has gotten out of hand.\n  It was OK when they did a little bit of advertising, but now it has \ngotten out of hand. It has gotten to the point now where an individual \nfrom a drug company--I will not mention who--said to me: Well, yes, you \nwant to turn the clock back to 1996, when we didn't advertise much on \nTV. He said: That would be nice, but you could never get it done \nbecause not everyone would agree. Because, you see, the big drug \ncompanies, the big ones that have some major portion of these 50 drugs \nthat are basically the ones being advertised, they have got the power. \nThe little drug companies out there, which may have good drugs for you, \nlifesaving drugs and things such as that, they have to get in the game \ntoo. They have to compete. So it keeps ratcheting itself up every year. \nEvery year it ratchets itself up with more and more advertising.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to review a little bit the history, \nso we are clear on how we got to this point. In 1962, Congress gave the \nFDA the authority to regulate prescription drug advertising which, at \nthat point, in 1962, consisted of ads in medical journals. Regulations \nfollowed from the FDA, after 1962, which required that all drug ads \ninclude ``a brief summary statement that discloses all the drug's known \nrisks.'' That was done, and all the medical journals, whenever the drug \ncompany would put an ad in a medical journal about the benefits of the \ndrug, they had to include, and they did include--they were very \nresponsible for a long time--all the known risks. After all, they were \nadvertising to doctors, people who were knowledgeable in the field.\n  Until 1997, there was no real guidance beyond that as to what was \nrequired. Today, based on guidance that was finalized in 1999, an ad \nsponsor is only required to disclose ``the most important risks'' in a \n``major statement'' in the audio portion of a TV or radio ad. The FDA \ndoes not require that all risks be read in the ad.\n  Think about that. You can tout all the wonderful benefits, but you \ndon't have to tell what all the risks are. The FDA requires that an ad \nsponsor provide other places to find the list of all the risks. So you \ncould have an ad on TV tell you Vioxx is great--there may be a problem \nwith irregular heartbeat, maybe--but if you want to know all the known \nrisks, you can call this toll-free number or you can go to a health \ncare provider and ask your doctor or print ads.\n  As I said earlier, it can be very easy for a statement about risks \nand benefits to get lost in the creative content of the ads. It is no \nwonder consumers demand newer drugs from their doctors. They don't have \na clear idea of the true safety or the efficacy profile. Over time, it \nhas become clear that sometimes the creative content of the drug ads \nhas the effect of minimizing the safety profile of a drug while \nartificially spurring the demand.\n  I have one other chart I wish to show. This ad right here. Here is an \nad for Cialis. If you have ever watched television in the evening in \nthe last several months, you have seen this ad. You could have seen it \nin the last few weeks. It seems like I can't turn on the TV that I \ndon't see this ad, so I put it on a chart in case someone might have \nmissed it. It is talking about Cialis. It has this wonderful scene at \nthe end, with a woman in a bathtub, a man in a bathtub, and a beautiful \nvalley scene--maybe Napa Valley, I don't know where it is--and they \nsay: If a relaxing moment turns into the right moment, will you be \nready?\n  While this is on the screen and you are looking at this beautiful \nscene and thinking how wonderful it is, they come on and give you a \ncouple of known risks. Are you going to listen to that? Or are you \npaying attention to how wonderful Cialis is for you?\n  This is another example of the amount of money being put into \nadvertising. This is not a drug preventing a disease someone might \nhave. It is not for a life-threatening disease or anything like that. \nNot at all. Yet that is where the money is going. That is what the \nproblem is with a lot of these ads.\n  What our amendment does is it tries to fix some of these problems and \nto help the FDA and the companies to provide better information so that \nconsumers can make real choices, not a choice based on a movie \nendorsement or a slick advertisement. So our amendment does four \nthings:\n  First, the 2-year moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertisements \nfound in the underlying bill is dropped. While I believe this provision \nis constitutional, I understand and respect the concerns others have on \nthis point.\n  Secondly, in the underlying bill, every ad may be prereviewed by the \nFDA. In this amendment, as part of that process, the FDA may require \nspecific safety information in the content of an advertisement as part \nof a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. In addition, the company \nmust include any changes the FDA requests about a serious risk in the \ncontent of the ad or they are subject to civil penalties.\n  Third, civil monetary penalties can be assessed against a company for \nan ad that is false and misleading in the way it presents its safety \nand efficacy information.\n  Fourth, the major statement relating to side effects, \ncontraindications, and effectiveness that is included in every TV and \nradio ad must now be stated--and get this--in a clear, conspicuous, and \nneutral manner. A clear, conspicuous, and neutral manner.\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n  Hopefully, this will clarify the major statement about risk and \nbenefits, which is paramount, and that the creative wonderful scenery \nwill not distract from it. I think it is a good compromise. It is a \nstep in the right direction. Hopefully, we will get the bill through, \nthis will be a part of it, and we will see if the drug companies want \nto be responsible.\n  We don't need to spend $5 billion a year advertising for drugs for \nwhich you have to get a prescription. I would rather they put that \nmoney into research, research on drugs that really are lifesaving and \nhelpful to more people.\n  I hope this amendment will be accepted. As I said, it is a \ncompromise, obviously. It is not everything I wanted to do, but I \nthink, again, it is a step in the right direction, and it will give us \na yardstick. If, a couple of years from now, we see that the spending \nhas gone from $4.2 billion to $5 billion to $5.5 billion to $6 billion, \nthen we will really have to come back here and tighten down on it even \nmore.\n  This is a shot across the bow to the drug companies--rein it in, be \nresponsible, or tougher things are coming in the future. So it is \nreally up to the drug companies to now start to be responsible. It is \nup to FDA to use their authority to make sure the contraindications, \nthe safety measures, the drug interactions--all the things that may \nhappen to people--are presented in a clear, conspicuous, and balanced \nand fair manner. That is the essence of the amendment. I hope it will \nbe adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, one of the biggest drivers of health care \ncosts today is the cost of prescription drugs. This debate over \nreauthorization of the FDA has given us an opportunity to really home \nin on some of the reasons for those high costs of prescription drugs. \nWe say we spend somewhere around $2.2 trillion on health care today or \nabout 16 or 17 percent of our gross domestic product. Of that amount, \nabout 15 to 20 percent of what we spend on health care is for \nprescription drugs. It is an enormous industry in this country.\n  Frankly, some remarkable things have happened. We have wonderful \ntherapies that have prolonged life, have improved the quality of life, \nand for that we can be grateful to those companies which are investing \nin the research and development that is necessary to bring these types \nof new therapies and drugs onto the market.\n  At the same time, we have to be very concerned about the cost of \nthese things. Everybody has to be concerned about that. The taxpayers, \nwho underwrite the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, which is a big part \nof the cost of health care in this country, have a stake in this \ndebate, as does every consumer who, for prescription drugs--whenever \nthey are diagnosed with something and a doctor prescribes a certain \nmedication, a certain drug, and they have to go get it, obviously that \ncost is borne by them as consumers and by their health care provider, \ntheir insurer. Everybody has a stake in the cost of prescription drugs \nand doing everything we can to lower their costs, to make them more \naffordable to average people in this country.\n  We have an amendment, the Stabenow-Thune-Brown-Lott amendment having \nto do with citizen petitions, which was just debated. It has been \ndebated. It is under consideration as part of the managers' amendment. \nI thank the managers, Senators Kennedy and Enzi, for giving us an \nopportunity to perhaps have it included in the managers' amendment. I \nthink this is an important amendment, one that addresses the issue we \nare talking about today, the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  The amendment will reduce the filing of frivolous ``citizen \npetitions'' that delay entry of generic drugs to the market and \nunnecessarily increase drug costs for both taxpayers and consumers. My \ncolleague from Michigan, the distinguished Presiding Officer, has \ndiscussed this earlier.\n  A citizen petition is intended to be just that--it is a petition that \nis filed by an individual or a group in order to raise potential \nconcerns. If you look at what has happened with that, that process has \nbeen abused. You can see that even from what the FDA Chief Counsel has \nsaid about this process:\n\n       These petitions appear designed not to raise timely \n     concerns with respect to the legality or scientific soundness \n     of approving a drug application, but rather to delay \n     approval.\n\n  What has happened in this process is it has become hijacked and is \nbeing used for purposes for which it was not intended.\n  Under current FDA regulations, the simple act of filing a petition, \nno matter how meritorious or frivolous that petition may be, \nautomatically delays the approval of a generic drug. Under current \nregulations, there is no risk or cost associated with filing a citizen \npetition. Yet the benefit to a brand-name company in maintaining their \nmarket share for even a few months is enormous.\n  I want to show another chart which I think further defines why there \nis so much advantage for a company to use this process in a frivolous \nway, to delay the introduction of generic drugs into the marketplace. \nTake Flonase, for example. The delay caused by using the citizen \npetition was 645 days. During that period, the additional sales that \nwere generated were over $1 billion--$1.6 billion. If you look at \nDuoNeb, another drug, 420 days' delay yielded $262.5 million additional \nrevenue generated during that delay period.\n  The amendment will allow the FDA to verify that citizen petitions are \nlegitimate by requiring applicants to verify that they have not \nreceived compensation from another organization to file such a \npetition. It will also prohibit delays of generic drug approvals unless \nthe FDA determines within the first 25 days that a petition is filed \nthat the petition raises a genuine public health concern. This \namendment helps to remove the incentive for drug companies to file \nunnecessary or illegitimate citizen petitions.\n  Even the FDA has said the citizen petition process is inefficient and \nis often abused by pharmaceutical companies. This is troubling to me \nbecause the rising cost of prescription drugs is one of the largest \ndrivers, as I said earlier, of health care costs in our country today. \nThese costs contribute directly to the rising cost of health insurance \npremiums for families and small businesses and the cost to all \ntaxpayers for what we pay for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives in 2002, I sponsored \nlegislation that would help speed access to lower cost generics. Back \nthen, one of the major issues of concern to Congress and consumers was \nthe automatic 30-month stay brand-name companies could request whenever \na challenge was raised to the patent. FDA regulations at the time \nessentially allowed a pharmaceutical company to ask the FDA for an \nunlimited number of 30-month stays as generics sought entry into the \nmarket, effectively delaying their approval. Now we are looking at yet \nanother loophole the industry has found to delay access to lower cost \ngeneric drugs.\n  Access to generic drugs is one crucial part of the solution to \ncontrolling prescription drug costs. As I said earlier, in overall \nhealth care costs, what continues to increase over time is the cost of \nprescription drugs. As I said earlier, there are also some wonderful \ntherapies, some medications that were brought onto the market that are \ndoing remarkable things for health care in this country. But there is \nalso a long period where drug companies that develop these types of \nmedications and therapies have the exclusive right to market those. \nDuring that period, they have an opportunity to recover the cost of the \nresearch and development that goes into that particular drug. But there \nis a point at which that period comes to an end. When that period comes \nto an end and it is opened to competition, then other generic drug \nmanufacturers can enter the marketplace. What you generally see happen \nis drug costs go down dramatically when competition takes hold.\n  I am a big believer in the market. The market works when there is \ncompetition. What we will need, if we want to do something about the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs and the impact they are having in \ndriving health care costs in this country, is to create more \ncompetition in the marketplace.\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\n  What this particular loophole does, the citizen petition loophole, is \nit allows drug companies to take advantage and in a frivolous way use \nsomething that was intended for legitimate purposes; that is, to allow \ncitizens to challenge this process, to extend the period in which they \ncan continue to exclusively market a drug to the tune literally of \nbillions and billions of dollars of additional cost. That is wrong.\n  The amendment we have introduced--the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nStabenow, Senator Brown, Senator Lott, myself--would simply bring some \nclarity to this and make sure, when the FDA has an opportunity to \ndetermine, to take a look at these citizen petitions, that petition \ndoes, in fact, raise a genuine public health concern. I believe this \namendment will help remove the incentive drug companies have to file \nunnecessary or illegitimate citizen petitions in order to continue to \nreap some of these profits and take advantage of a loophole that exists \ntoday that needs to be closed.\n  I hope the managers of the bill, those who have been working with us \nthroughout the course of this process, will find their way to accept \nthis amendment into the managers' package, allow it to be adopted as \npart of the FDA reauthorization and to do something that in a very \nsignificant and meaningful way will address what is a serious problem \nin America today; that is, the high cost of health care which is \ndriving more and more people into the ranks of the uninsured, becoming \na higher cost and burden on small businesses, and, as I said earlier, a \nbig component of that cost of health care is the cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  I think this amendment, along with others we have debated here today \nas well--and I happen to support allowing for the reimportation of \ndrugs from Canada and Europe and places such as that, which will help \nbring drug costs down in this country--these things will all add \ncompetition to the marketplace. Competition drives down costs, it \ndrives down costs for consumers, it drives down costs for taxpayers. \nThat is a good thing. This particular amendment closes a loophole that \nneeds to be closed that will bring about lower costs for consumers in \nthis country.\n  I thank the sponsors and the managers of the legislation for their \ncooperation and willingness to work with us, and I hope in the end we \ncan have this amendment adopted and do something that is serious and \nmeaningful in terms of eliminating unnecessary delays in allowing for \ngeneric drug approvals, getting them into the marketplace, and driving \ndown the cost of prescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have been trying to review the \nmanagers' package, as I indicated before. I read a number of the \nprovisions. The one on domestic pet turtles--I looked that over. I \nguess I don't have an issue with that. Ginseng is all right. Tanning \nbeds--we have a number of amendments, some small, some large, some \nimportant, some perhaps not. I have looked through them.\n  I do think there a couple that ought to be added. I noticed in the \nmanagers' amendment that there is a note that there is additional \nlanguage coming on several of them. I don't know what that would be.\n  I suggested two additions to the managers' package that I hope will \nbe considered. One is country-of-origin labeling with respect to \nprescription drugs:\n\n       Any prescription drug dispensed in the United States shall \n     affix on each dispenser or container of the prescription drug \n     a label that includes the country in which the drug was \n     manufactured.\n\n  The reason for that is there has been an assertion here that somehow \nthe importation of prescription drugs would be unsafe because it comes \nfrom another country. In fact, a substantial portion of our \nprescription drugs comes from other countries. It would probably be \nuseful for consumers to know that. I do not suggest they know that \nbecause it is apparently unsafe, as some seem to suggest with \nreimportation, but nonetheless I think that would be a useful thing.\n  The second is the Secretary shall certify prior to the approval for \nmarketing any new prescription drug that the approval of such drug \nposes ``no additional risk to the public health and safety,'' which is \nthe identical provision in the Cochran amendment dealing with \nreimportation of prescription drugs. I would provide the same \nrequirement for the new prescription drugs that are approved for use in \nthis country.\n  These are at least, to the extent there is validity in the Cochran \namendment, as judged at least by a small majority of the Members of the \nSenate today--to the extent there is validity in that, it seems to me \nthere might be some use for some consistency, and the consistency would \nbe we would want to be able to have the same approval process with \nrespect to no substantial risk from new drugs as they are suggesting \nwould be the case when a U.S. consumer is trying to purchase a \nprescription drug, FDA approved prescription drug from another country.\n  The second, the country-of-origin labeling just makes sense to me \ninasmuch as every time we debate this subject, we have people implying \nthat there is something inherently unsafe about importing a \nprescription drug from another country. As I have indicated time and \ntime again, they do this routinely in Europe and have done it for 20 \nyears. If you are in Italy and you want to buy a prescription drug in \nSpain or if you are in Germany and you want to buy a prescription drug \nin France, there is no problem. There is something called parallel \ntrading, and you can easily, as a consumer, access the best price on \nthat approved drug.\n  It is just, if they can do it in Europe, we are told by our \ncolleagues we do not have the capability or the wherewithal or the \nknowledge or whatever to be able to do it in our country.\n  That, of course, I think, seriously shortchanges the ability of the \nAmerican people to develop a system that the Europeans have used for 20 \nyears, a system that would help consumers. It would allow the global \neconomy to work for consumers. Maybe the little guy ought to have a \nshot at accessing the benefits of the global economy.\n  So I think both of those amendments have merit. I would ask that \nthose who are working on the managers' amendment consider adding these \ntwo amendments to the managers' package. I hope between now and perhaps \ntomorrow, over either supper or breakfast, they might have some sort of \nan epiphany and believe that consistency is a virtue in the Senate, and \nas a matter of consistency include both of these amendments in the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 993\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Ohio who \nwas going to move to morning business by giving me a little respite and \nlet me speak.\n  I rise relative to the amendment I have offered on this bill, which \nis the effort to try to protect people who purchase pharmaceuticals \nfrom Internet pharmacies. This is a major concern today. In fact, just \nlast week I entered into the Record that the FDA reported they had \nidentified 24 different Internet pharmaceutical sites that appeared to \nbe selling adulterated drugs to people. At least in three instances \nthey were selling adulterated drugs which came in packages that had a \nlot number on them, they had an expiration number on them, and they \nlooked exactly like the drugs the individual would have bought had they \nbought them through a pharmacy in the United States.\n  But it turned out those drugs, when they were opened by the FDA and \ntested by the producer of these pharmaceutical products, were \nadulterated, and in some instances the adulterated drugs could have \ncaused severe harm to the person had they taken those drugs. In other \ninstances, the drugs were simply sugar. They had no chemical compound \nin them.\n  We have had a lot of instances of this occurring. The FDA has \nliterally hundreds of instances of people purchasing drugs over the \nInternet sites which come in from international locations, which the \nFDA has no jurisdiction over. When the person received those drugs, \nthey took them and they were harmed. In several instances, death has \nactually occurred as a result.\n  So what I think is important is that we create a system where, when \nsomebody uses the Internet--because everybody uses the Internet today, \nor just\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nabout everyone uses the Internet--to purchase the pharmaceutical \nproduct, that they be able to be fairly confident, in fact very \nconfident, in fact assured that product is FDA approved.\n  This is doable. This is not an impossible exercise. This capacity to \nmake Internet pharmaceutical sites subject to FDA oversight and give \nconsumers the information they need in order to ensure that the \npharmaceutical site is FDA approved is a very doable event. That is \nwhat my amendment creates.\n  Essentially what it will say is that the FDA will receive the \nresources necessary to be able to inspect and review and manage and \noverview Internet pharmaceutical sites after they have put an Internet \npharmaceutical site through the system of testing and make sure that \nsite first has responsibility in the United States, so that they are \nnot in Russia or Albania or Pakistan or someplace and can't be reached \nif they do harm by selling an adulterated drug to an American citizen, \nthat that site has a bonded individual in the United States who is \nresponsible for actions taken by that site in selling products in the \nUnited States.\n  Second, that the products that are sold through that site are FDA \napproved and have a review process which assures that they have been \nFDA approved. At that point the FDA will put a tamperproof recognition \nsymbol on that site so that a person who goes on the Internet and looks \nup a pharmaceutical site will immediately see this tamperproof \nidentification that it has been FDA approved, sort of like in the old \ndays when you used to have the Good Housekeeping seal of approval on a \nproduct. That is what this will do so that an American citizen buying \nthrough an Internet site will know that the product coming through that \nsite is FDA approved, that it is what they say it is, what the \npharmaceutical site says it is. This is a step which needs to be taken, \nobviously, in order to assure that American consumers are safe.\n  As we see, American consumers are more and more going to the Internet \nfor purposes of buying their products. Now, regrettably, some fairly \nlarge pharmaceutical--not pharmaceutical companies but some fairly \nlarge drug retail companies which run Internet sites in most instances \nhave reservations about this language because they are concerned about \nthe fee system which is set up to pay for it. I can understand that. I \nam willing to look at ways of addressing that so that we can alleviate, \nto some degree, their concern.\n  But the simple fact is, you have to come up with a system which \nassures that resources are available for the FDA to be able to go out \nand monitor these sites. It should be a consumer-producer retail sales-\nfee system so that the people who are taking advantage of this site and \nthe people who are benefiting from the site, both economically and \nthrough purchasing the product, are essentially bearing the cost of \nmaking sure the FDA has the resources necessary to monitor the site.\n  That is a reasonable approach. It is something we do on most issues \nof this type. So there is a fee system in this proposal which would \nbasically pay for the resources necessary and give the FDA the support \nit needs financially so that it can expand its review process to cover \nthese pharmaceutical products which are being sold over the Internet. \nThis is a step we have to take. This is not something where we can sort \nof bury our heads in the sand and say, well, we are just going to let \nthis happen. We are going to let these sites continue to function, and \nwe are going to ignore their existence because more and more Americans \nare moving to this process of purchasing drugs.\n\n  You cannot have, in the United States, two different streams of \nsupply of pharmaceuticals for American citizens: one which is \nabsolutely safe and when American citizens are purchasing that product \nthey are sure that it is not going to harm them; and, two, where they \nare basically rolling the dice, playing Russian roulette with what they \npurchase when they use an Internet site but thinking they are actually \npurchasing something that is claimed to be the medication they need.\n  You cannot do that and claim we have a safe and efficient system, a \nsafe system which has efficacy in the quality of the drugs and have \nthose drugs be safe when they are delivered to the consumer. We cannot \nhave two different systems and still make that claim. We are basically \nundermining one of our great strengths as a culture, which is that we \nhave a very strong system for protecting the food that Americans eat \nand the drugs America uses.\n  So it is critical that we face up to this very significant problem we \nhave, which is that the Internet pharmacy situation is basically a \n``wild west'' of supply. Nobody knows what they are getting. Well, they \nthink they know what they are getting, but nobody actually knows what \nthey are getting. They can be harmed as a result. So I believe this \nproposal is a reasoned proposal. It is one I hope we will take a hard \nlook at as a Congress because I believe it is our responsibility. This \nis an area where the Federal Government has chosen to legislate and has \ndone quite well over the years, FDA proposals dealing with the safety \nof drugs and food in our country and in our supply chain. We have a lot \nof history. We can take considerable pride in it. But the market has \nchanged. We need to change the process by which we review the quality \nof the drugs as they come through this new market structure, which is \ncalled the Internet. This is not a partisan or political issue. This is \njust a question of how we substantially improve FDA's capacity on \noversight of the delivery of drugs to the American citizen.\n  So it should, I hope, be accepted at some point. I understand it is \ngoing to be opposed, regrettably, by the other side of the aisle. This \nmakes no sense to me. I think it has something to do with the fee \nsystem that is in place and the fact that the large drug delivery \ncompanies in this country are opposed to this type of system. But as I \nstated, this is negotiable. There should be some way to deal with that.\n  But, in any event, at some point I hope we face up to the reality of \nneeding this type of an amendment and giving the FDA this type of \nauthority. At this point I am not going to ask for a vote on the \namendment. I may before we move to final passage. But I am also \nconsidering other approaches to getting this type of language \nconsidered.\n  I will review the situation as we go down the road. But I did want to \nspeak tonight to outline again the need for this type of protection. As \nI said, just last week the FDA sent out a warning, actual warning to \nAmerican consumers, that said: Do not use these 24 Internet sites \nbecause we cannot tell you that the drugs you purchase over these sites \nare going to be safe, that they are going to be what they say they are. \nIn fact, we can tell you in these three incidents that they were not.\n  That means people were put at risk by purchasing drugs from these \nsites. So we need to give the FDA this authority, and hopefully we \nwill. If not now, at least before this bill completes the whole process \nand comes back from the conference committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I have a few comments on this afternoon's \nproceedings. I was disappointed, as I know many in the Chamber were, in \nthe passage of the Cochran amendment and what that means to the price \nof prescription drugs.\n  An awful lot of us believed--those of us running for election last \nfall, those of us who were just observers of the American political \nscene--understand that the drug industry has had way too much influence \nin the Senate and the House and particularly the White House in the \nlast many years.\n  Many of us talked about reimportation of prescription drugs, \nparticularly from Canada. Many of us--I know the Presiding Officer has \ndone this. I have, from my Northeastern Ohio Congressional District \nbefore I was elected to the Senate last fall, taken busloads of senior \ncitizens to Canada to buy less expensive but identical--same drugs, \nsame dosage, same packaging, same manufacturing,--drugs in Canadian \ndrugstores.\n  We all thought that it made no sense for Americans to leave our \ncountry to buy drugs, often made in the United States, but certainly \ndrugs that are safe as those at a drugstore in Elyria, Ashtabula or \nToledo or Dayton.\n  Many of us were disappointed at the passage of the Cochran amendment,\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\nwhich is what the drug companies wanted, and what again stands in the \nway of direct reimportation so that American seniors and other \nAmericans could get less expensive drugs. There is simply no reason the \nCanadian drugs--that our drugs should cost two, three, four times what \npeople pay for the same drug, same manufacturer, same dosage, the same \npackaging in Canada.\n\n  I am intrigued by Senator Dorgan's idea of country-of-origin labeling \non prescription drugs. We know, for example, that a doctor prescribes \nLipitor, and the patient buys Lipitor; that these actual drugs were \nmanufactured--that medicine was manufactured in Ireland. We do not seem \nto think there is anything wrong with that. So it makes sense to me to \nput on country-of-origin labeling because then Americans would see that \nthese drugs, whether they are made in Ireland, whether they are made in \nCanada, whether they are made in Germany, whether they are made in the \nUK, whether they are made in the United States, that because of the FDA \nwe know those drugs are safe in our country. We know they are safe if \nthey are coming from Britain or Ireland or Canada.\n  I am intrigued by Senator Dorgan's idea. I also, for a moment, wanted \nto speak on the amendment that the Presiding Officer has led the charge \non with Senator Thune and with Senator Lott and myself, on the citizen \npetition issue. That, I understand, is in the managers' amendment. I am \nhopeful that will become part of this bill as it moves through the \nprocess.\n  We know of abuse of the citizen petition process. We know that while, \nof course, we want to protect peoples' rights in this country to \npetition their Government always, we also note the drug companies have \ngamed that system, turned that system to their advantage and used that \npetition process to block the generics getting on the market.\n  We know the drug companies will do darn near anything to get their \nway, to keep their prices higher. It is the most profitable industry in \nthe country--return on investment, return on sales, return on equity--\nfor almost a generation, almost every year except for when the oil \nindustry does slightly better than the pharmaceutical industry. We know \nthey will try almost anything.\n  But Senator Stabenow's work on this issue and this amendment will \ndraw a balance so that citizen petition rights are protected, that \nconsumers are protected, which will mean generics are earlier to \nmarket, safe generics, identical generics that will mean lower prices \nfor our consumers.\n  I am hopeful we can get this bill in better shape than it has been. I \nappreciate particularly the efforts of Senator Dorgan on reimportation.\n\n\n                        BIOEQUIVALENCE STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise to speak about the amendment I offered to S. 1082 \non antibiotics access and innovation. My amendment is supported by the \nInfectious Diseases Society of America, IDSA, the Alliance for Aging \nResearch, the National Organization of Rare Disorders, and the Immune \nDeficiency Foundation. It is intended to take initial steps to address \nthe important issue of drug resistant microorganisms and the need for \nnew antibiotics. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee Chairman Ted Kennedy and its Ranking Member Mike Enzi have \nworked with me on the provision as well as Senators Burr, Brown, and \nCochran. I appreciate all their efforts to address this important issue \nand am pleased that we have reached an agreement on language to include \nin S. 1082.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to thank the Senator from Utah for introducing \nthis important amendment. I am concerned with the alarming increase in \nthe number of drug-resistant infections. Physicians from Massachusetts \nhave written me in support of this amendment saying that patients are \nroutinely lost to infections caused by resistant bacteria for which we \nhave few to no options. I appreciate the efforts of infectious disease \nexperts from the Infectious Diseases Society of America to raise these \nconcerns and propose solutions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Kennedy has always been a leader in public health \nissues and I appreciate the efforts of him and his staff to address \nthis important matter. However, I am concerned one provision of my \namendment that was not included which deals with bioequivalence \nstandards for locally-acting non-absorbed drugs. In the amendment I \nfiled for Committee, I had asked for the Food and Drug Administration \nto establish a new bioequivalence standard for these drugs through a \nguidance allowing for transparency and a public process. The underlying \nbill deals with drug safety and although I am a supporter of the \ngeneric drug industry, I want to ensure that their bioequivalence \nstandards are based on science--we need to ensure that FDA is applying \nhigh scientific standards and allowing for public input when these \nstandards are developed by the Office of Generic Drugs.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate his leadership on this matter and want to \nwork with him to ensure that we exercise appropriate oversight over FDA \nand hold the agency, and in this case, the Office of Generic Drugs, \naccountable for its decisions. I also appreciate working with him and \nother members of the HELP Committee on the issue of antimicrobial \nresistance. So my question is, isn't this a public health crisis that \nrequires immediate action?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, it is. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nOhio. I yield to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I want to thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership \non this issue. I have been working on this issue of FDA standard \nsetting and process for bioequivalence standards for almost a year now. \nWe have not yet had resolution to concerns regarding bioequivalence \nstandards and I had hoped to include language in this bill requiring \nFDA to engage in a process to inform the public of a change in \nstandard, explain their scientific rationale, and allow for public \ninput before a new standard is implemented. I understand we have agreed \nto continue to work with FDA on this issue and defer including the \nprovision in this bill. I am hopeful that we can address these concerns \nthrough our continued work with the FDA. However, I think we all \nunderstand that if FDA does not sufficiently answer our questions, \nCongress will revisit this issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his leadership on \nthis matter. I agree that we need to pursue this further if we don't \nget good answers from the FDA. The agency's lack of a response is a big \nconcern to me.\n  I might also add that your health advisor, Leigh Ann Ross, who is a \npharmacist, has been very helpful in explaining the issues of \npharmaceutical science at issue here. I also want to acknowledge the \nwork of my colleague from Massachusetts who has shown great leadership \nhere and his dedicated staffer, David Dorsey, who has worked tirelessly \non this entire bill and this issue in particular. I also appreciate the \nhard work of Senator Enzi's staff person, David Schmickel, who has made \ngreat efforts to reach an agreement on this issue. We would not have \nbeen able to reach this point without Senator Kennedy's and Senator \nEnzi's leadership on the entire bill.\n  In addition, I would like to acknowledge Senator Brown's health \nstaffer, Ellie Dehoney, who has made valuable contributions to this \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. ENZI. Would the Senator yield for a moment? I want to commend \nSenator Hatch for raising this issue of antimicrobial resistance and \nthe need for innovation. The problem that the Senator is addressing \nhere is a real threat to public health. The Director of the CDC reports \nthat more than 63,000 patients in the United States die every year from \nhospital-acquired, antibiotic resistant infections. Although I strongly \nsupport this amendment as it is an excellent first step, a \ncomprehensive response is needed. I hope we can continue to address the \nbroader issue within the Committee this Congress. I also agree that we \nneed to continue to work with FDA on this issue of accountability and \nlook forward to working with the Chairman and other members of the \nSenate on this issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I appreciate my colleagues' \nwillingness to work with me on this important issue. Although the \nlanguage on the bioequivalence issue is not in the agreed-to version of \nthe amendment, by accepting the revised amendment, I want to make it \nperfectly clear that we want to have clear answers from the FDA on its \ncurrent process in establishing a bioequivalence standard for\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\nlocally-acting non-absorbed drugs. It is certainly not my intent or the \nintent of my colleagues to suggest that we have concluded the oversight \nof FDA on this issue. Instead, we have agreed to engage with FDA \nthrough the oversight function of the HELP Committee to ensure that the \nscientific standards and procedures used in establishing bioequivalence \nfor this life-threatening antibiotic are appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator yield for a question? My office has \nalso been in contact with FDA on this issue of bioequivalence for a \nlife-saving antibiotic because leading infectious disease experts in my \nstate have expressed concern that FDA did not take appropriate steps to \nestablish this new standard for demonstrating bioequivalence. I would \nlike to work with my colleagues on this important issue as well.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and I know that he \nhas been in communication with FDA regarding this issue. His \ncontributions to this dialog have been considerable. I look forward to \nworking with him, Senator Cochran and my HELP Committee colleagues in \ngetting some answers from the FDA on this situation.\n\n\n                          Authorized Generics\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today with my colleagues to \nspeak about so-called authorized generics. An authorized generic drug \nis a brand-name prescription drug produced by the same brand \nmanufacturer on the same manufacturing lines, yet repackaged as a \ngeneric in order to confuse consumers and shut true generics out of the \nmarket. Because it is not a true generic drug and does not require an \nadditional FDA approval, an authorized generic can be marketed during \nthe federally mandated 6-month exclusivity period for generics. This \ndiscourages true generic companies from entering the market and \noffering lower priced prescription drugs. I have introduced \nlegislation--the Fair Prescription Drug Competition Act--in order to \nban authorized generics during this protected 180-day period, and I had \nhoped that this legislation could be accepted as part of this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from West \nVirginia on this important issue. He has been a staunch advocate of \nconsumer access to lower cost generic prescriptions, successfully \nworking to include authorized generics in the Medicaid best price \ncalculation. I support his efforts and believe that the bill before us \nincludes significant provisions to lower prescription drug costs. While \nI know that our legislation does not directly address the Senator's \nconcerns, I want to continue to work with him on this important issue \nand believe that we can reach consensus on authorized generics as part \nof the patent settlement debate.\n  Mr. ENZI. As the Senator from West Virginia knows, we included \nlanguage in the underlying bill on authorized generics in part due to \nhis urging. Our bill would require the Food and Drug Administration to \nkeep track of authorized generics marketed since January 1, 1999, and \nto make such data publicly available in electronic form. The language \nin our bill will help the Federal Trade Commission complete its study \nin a timely fashion, and it will also help to shed some light on this \nelusive marketing practice. Let me be clear: I do not agree with the \nother policy statements being made regarding authorized generics \nbecause I don't believe we have enough information yet to make those \nassessments. However, I do agree that we need more information to shed \nlight onto this subject. That is why I supported the language in the \nunderlying bill to allow us to have that data and to provide a strong \nplatform for future discussions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I appreciate the chairman and ranking member's \ninterest in looking into this deceptive marketing practice. And, while \nI had hoped that we could reach agreement on my legislation as part of \nthis bill, I appreciate the chairman's commitment to working with me to \nsolve this problem as part of the patent settlements discussion. I am \nalso grateful for Senators Kennedy, Enzi, and Hatch's support of the \nauthorized generics language Senator Brown and I worked to include in \nthe underlying bill. This language will undoubtedly help the FTC finish \nits work, but I want to be clear that I do not believe Congress needs \nto wait on the FTC study to be completed to act on the problem of \nauthorized generics. At the very least, Congress should impose a \nmoratorium on authorized generic drugs until such time as the FTC study \nis complete.\n  Mr. HATCH. My friend from West Virginia has had a longstanding \ninterest in looking into this issue, and I certainly don't fault his \ntenacity in this area. When Congressman Henry Waxman and I wrote the \nDrug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act in 1984, our \nintent was to improve generic competition, while preserving the ability \nof brand-name manufacturers to discover and market new and innovative \nproducts. I think this legislation has worked fairly well at achieving \nits intended goals. I know there have been a few problems along the \nway, but I think we addressed many of them in the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003. In that law, Congress closed several \nloopholes that were delaying generic competition and hindering consumer \naccess to lower cost generic drugs. The law also clarified the 180-day \nperiod of market exclusivity for generic manufacturers. Now, I know \nSenator Rockefeller is very concerned about authorized generics, and I \nthink we should have updated data on the number of authorized generic \ndrugs are on the market. The language already included in S. 1082 will \nhelp the Federal Trade Commission complete its authorized generics \nstudy, which I know Senator Rockefeller requested along with Senators \nGrassley and Leahy. I support the completion of that study; however, \nCongress shouldn't contemplate additional legislation before having \nnecessary data on authorized generics. I will work with my good friend \nand colleague from West Virginia to ensure that the FTC has the data \nneeded to complete its study. So, I want to let my friend from West \nVirginia know that I want to continue to have a dialogue about this \nissue.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleagues for these commitments. I look \nforward to working together with Chairman Kennedy, Senator Enzi, \nSenator Hatch, and the cosponsors of this amendment Senators Schumer, \nLeahy, Kohl, and Stabenow to develop strong consensus language that can \nbe enacted as part of the patent settlements legislation.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1042\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, prescription drugs and medical \ntechnology save lives. Advances in medicine have given patients who are \nfighting deadly diseases or managing chronic conditions hope for a \nhealthier future.\n  Prescription drugs are working to meet the emerging diabetes \nepidemic, save the lives of cancer patients, and forestall the terrible \nburden of Alzheimer's. These advances in medicine are helping patients \ntoday.\n  Although these lifesaving drugs have the enormous potential to \nimprove lives, at times they also have the potential to harm. We all \nknow that no prescription medication is absolutely safe. There is \nalways some degree of safety and health risks.\n  Drug companies selling products in the United States must comply with \nregulations and procedures mandated by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. FDA approval, however, does not always guarantee drug \nsafety.\n  The bill we are debating today intends to improve drug safety and \nwill significantly change the drug approval process at the FDA. I \nbelieve it is important to improve the drug approval process and, at \nthe same time, ensure patients access to new and innovative therapies. \nIn order to achieve this goal, a carefully balanced approach is \nnecessary.\n  As we debate how to improve the drug approval process, it is \nimportant for Congress to take actions to ensure that legal efforts to \nenforce drug safety are directed toward the appropriate parties.\n  I am particularly concerned that this bill does nothing to protect \nphysicians and pharmacists from being named in product liability \nlawsuits. We cannot allow for additional waste in our legal system by \nnaming doctors and pharmacists to these lawsuits--especially when these \nprofessionals have nothing to do with the design or manufacture of the \nproduct in question. It is for that reason that I rise to speak on \namendment No. 1042.\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\n  Product liability lawsuits usually involve claims that a product is \nunreasonably dangerous, either in its design, manufacture, or its lack \nof a proper warning or instructions regarding use.\n  Historically, trial lawyers name the product manufacturer as well as \neach party that handled the product in the stream of commerce as a \ndefendant. This includes the shipper of the product, as well as the \nstore owner who sells the product. In most cases, the store owner is \nnever liable for a design defect, manufacturing defect, or failure to \nwarn. Why? Because these cases have nothing to do with the negligence \nof the store owner.\n  Doctors and pharmacists are similar to store owners. They have \nnothing to do with the design or manufacture of a product. Yet time and \ntime again, doctors and other health care providers are named as \nparties to product liability lawsuits involving prescription drugs and \nmedical devices. Why? Because class action lawyers are constantly \nlooking for the best courtrooms to file their lawsuits. These lawyers \nroutinely shop for venues that are known for siding with the patient \nwho has been harmed. By bringing their cases in front of plaintiff-\nfriendly judges and juries, these lawyers immeasurably enhance their \nprobability of securing a jackpot jury award.\n  Judgments are virtually never entered against doctors and pharmacists \nin product liability lawsuits. Yet these health care professionals are \noften forced to spend thousands of dollars in legal costs and take \nvaluable time off from work, time away from the patients who need them, \nto provide lawyers with rounds and rounds of depositions and to provide \njuries with testimony. This is completely ridiculous. We need doctors \nin our emergency rooms and family practice centers--not in the \ncourtrooms when they have nothing to do with the product in question.\n  I want to tell you about a woman named Hilda Bankston. Hilda owned a \npharmacy in Jefferson County, MS, and has been named as a defendant in \nso many lawsuits that she has lost count. In each instance, Hilda was \nsued for doing nothing more than filling legal prescriptions. In other \nwords, she wasn't doing anything wrong. Nevertheless, Hilda has been \ndragged into court to testify in hundreds of national lawsuits brought \nin Jefferson County against the pharmacy and out-of-State manufacturers \nof drugs. Why is this? Because the party who initiated the lawsuit was \nshopping for a friendly court in order to file their national lawsuit \nin that county.\n  Does this bill we are considering today provide any protection to \nHilda Bankston? No, it does not. Does the bill provide any protection \nto doctors and pharmacists with respect to product liability lawsuits? \nNo. It doesn't do that either. The bill allows these health care \nproviders to continue to be named in product liability cases. This is \noutrageous.\n  My amendment is simple. It prohibits a health care provider, \nincluding a doctor or a pharmacist, from being named in a product \nliability lawsuit or in a class action lawsuit merely because the \nhealth care provider prescribed or sold a drug or device that was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  My amendment does not deprive patients of the right to sue a \nphysician or a pharmacist who behaves in a negligent manner. It does \nnot provide blanket immunity to a physician or pharmacist who behaves \nin a negligent manner. That would be a separate cause of action, which \nlies outside the scope of my amendment. What my amendment does say is \nthat health care providers should not be dragged into a product lawsuit \nthat they have no business being in. Doctors and pharmacists are \nroutinely named in product liability lawsuits and are virtually always \nremoved from these cases without having damages assessed against them. \nThey are not responsible for the design or manufacture of drugs and \ndevices and should not be dragged into these types of lawsuits.\n  Patients pay for product liability lawsuits in the form of higher \nhealth benefits and premiums.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in taking action to curb this abuse \nof our legal system. Let's protect our health care providers from \nincurring frivolous unnecessary costs. Our health care providers should \nbe focused on providing the best care possible to their patients, not \non product liability lawsuits when they have nothing to do with the \nproduct in question.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport for my amendment from the American Medical Association and the \nAmerican Osteopathic Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                         Chicago, IL, May 3, 2007.\n     Hon. John Ensign,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ensign: The physician and student members of \n     the American Medical Association (AMA) commend you for \n     introducing an amendment to S. 1082, the ``Prescription Drug \n     User Fee Amendments of 2007,'' that would clarify physician \n     and other health care provider liability.\n       Specifically, the amendment would prevent physicians and \n     other healthcare providers who prescribe or dispense a drug, \n     biologic product, or medical device approved, licensed, or \n     cleared by the Food and Drug Administration from being named \n     in class action product liability lawsuits for forum-shopping \n     purposes. The amendment would address situations in which a \n     local physician or other health care provider is named as a \n     defendant as a way to file a lawsuit in a legal jurisdiction \n     more likely to award large damage awards, even though such \n     jurisdiction has little or no connection to the local \n     defendants. In such cases, the local physician or other \n     health care provider is often dropped from the suit or not \n     found liable for damages. Instead, liability attaches to the \n     manufacturer, whose conduct is the real subject of the \n     litigation. Nonetheless, physicians and other health care \n     providers are exposed to the significant legal costs, \n     distress, and time away from their patients.\n       The AMA is pleased to offer its support for this amendment \n     and looks forward to continuing to work with you to bring \n     about common sense liability reforms, such as this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael D.

John Ensign,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ensign: As President of the American \n     Osteopathic Association (AOA), I am pleased to inform you of \n     our support for your amendment to the ``Prescription Drug \n     User Fee Amendments of 2007'' (S. 1082), which would provide \n     clarification on physician liability.\n       Your amendment seeks to clarify that a physician who \n     prescribes a drug, biological product, or medical device, \n     which has cleared successfully the Food and Drug \n     Administration's approval process, cannot be named as a party \n     in a class action lawsuit. The AOA shares our concerns that \n     physicians and other health care providers frequently are \n     names as defendants in such cases as a means of securing a \n     venue which is more likely to produce larger monetary awards. \n     In most cases, physicians are dismissed from he lawsuit or \n     found not liable for damages. Regardless of the ultimate \n     outcome, physicians face significant legal costs and time \n     away from their patients as a result of this practice.\n       We believe your amendment takes the appropriate steps to \n     ensure that future class action lawsuits are targeted at \n     those whose conduct is in question. Additionally, we believe \n     your amendment rightfully prevents attorneys from using \n     physicians as a means to pursue legal action in venues they \n     deem more favorable. For these reasons, we re pleased to \n     offer our support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               John A.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \nremarkable son of Hawaii, entertainment legend, Don Ho. Don's big heart \ngave out on April 14, in Waikiki. He was 76 years old. On Saturday, May \n5, Hawaii bid a fond aloha to Don Ho, during a ceremony on Waikiki \nBeach in celebration of his life. Thousands of people attended his \nmemorial.\n  Don didn't plan on a career in entertainment. After his college \ngraduation, he served in the U.S. Air Force, attaining the rank of \nfirst lieutenant. When\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\nhe returned home, he began helping at his mother's quiet neighborhood \nbar, playing music with friends. That was the beginning of a show \nbusiness career spanning more than four decades including hit records, \nmotion pictures, television, and sold out performances world-wide.\n  Hawaii was still a young State when Don Ho became an international \nstar, and in many ways he helped put Hawaii on the map. In my travels \naround the world, people always ask me about Don Ho. Don was a big star \nwherever he went. He even played in Washington, DC, when I was in the \nHouse. And I can tell you, it was a big show.\n  Despite his stature as an entertainment icon, Don was never too busy \nto spend a few minutes with his fans; young honeymooners, servicemen \nand women stationed in the islands, or senior citizens on a dream \nvacation. He had tremendous charisma and talent and because of that he \ntouched many people. Hawaii has lost a beloved son and he will be \nsorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5652-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5652-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5652-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1429.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \nlife insurance benefits for disabled veterans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Disabled Veterans \nInsurance Improvement Act of 2007.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to make certain improvements in \nthe insurance programs available to service-connected disabled \nveterans. It has two main components.\n  First, this legislation would increase the maximum amount of Veterans \nMortgage Life Insurance, VMLI, that a service-connected disabled \nveteran may purchase from the current maximum of $90,000 to $200,000. \nThe VMLI program was established in 1971 and is available to those \nservice-connected disabled veterans who have received specially adapted \nhousing grants from VA. In the event of the veteran's death, the \nveteran's family is protected because the Department of Veterans \nAffairs will pay the balance of the mortgage owed up to the maximum \namount of insurance purchased.\n  The need for this increase is obvious in today's housing market \nwhere, during February, the median sale price of a home in the United \nStates was estimated by the Bureau of Census to be $250,000. My \nlegislation would ensure that this important benefit, which helps \nsecure the financial future of many veterans and their families, keeps \npace with changes in the economy.\n  My bill would also establish a new program of insurance for service-\nconnected disabled veterans that would provide up to a maximum of \n$50,000 in level premium term life insurance coverage. This new program \nwould be available to service-connected disabled veterans who are less \nthan 65 years of age at the time of application.\n  Under the new program, eligible service-connected veterans would be \nable to purchase, in increments of $10,000, up to a maximum amount of \n$50,000 in insurance. Importantly, unlike existing life insurance \nprograms, the premium rates for this program would be based on the 2001 \nCommissioners Standard Ordinary Basic Table of Mortality rather than \nthe 1941 mortality table that the Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance, \nS-DVI, program is based upon.\n  When an insured veteran reaches age 70, two things would occur under \nthis new program of insurance. First, the amount of insurance would be \nreduced to 20 percent of the amount of insurance in force prior to the \nveteran's 70th birthday. Second, the veteran would cease making premium \npayments. This means that during those years where the family's \nfinancial obligations would be commensurately higher because of \nchildren, mortgages, and the potential impact of any loss of income, \nthe veteran's family would be able to purchase the maximum amount of \nterm life insurance. At age 70, when resources are likely to be most \nrestricted and the need for substantial insurance to take care of a \nfamily's needs after the veteran's death have lessened, the veteran \nwould no longer have an obligation to continue to pay any insurance \npremiums.\n  My proposal provides that application for this insurance would need \nto be submitted by an eligible veteran within 2 years from the date on \nwhich VA establishes a service-connected disability to exist but not \nlater than 10 years after a veteran's release from active duty. It \nwould further provide that during the first year of the program, any \neligible veteran who is presently insured under the S-DVI program could \nconvert that insurance to a policy under this new program.\n  Both of the proposals contained in the legislation I am introducing \ntoday are compatible with the provisions of S. 643, the proposed \nDisabled Veterans Insurance Act of 2007, which I introduced on February \n15 of this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\n                                S. 1315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish and clarify that Congress does not \nauthorize persons convicted of dangerous crimes in foreign courts to \nfreely possess firearms in the United States; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with \nSenators Durbin and Kennedy in introducing the Firearms by Foreign \nConvicts Clarification Act. This bill would close a loophole that \nexists in current law, by stating that people convicted of foreign \nfelonies and domestic violence, just like people convicted of similar \nAmerican crimes, cannot possess firearms in the United States.\n  I imagine that most Americans may be surprised, as I was, to learn \nthat foreign felons actually have greater gun rights than American \ncitizens who have been convicted of felonies and domestic violence in \nour own courts. Our country has been trying to keep guns out of the \nhands of criminals for at least the last 40 years, since the landmark \nGun Control Act of 1968. Unfortunately, in 2005 the Supreme Court \ncreated a gaping loophole in this longstanding felon-in-possession law.\n  That happened in the case of Small v. United States, where a majority \nof the Court essentially held that foreign convictions don't count for \nthe purpose of being a felon in possession of a firearm. This was not \nbecause the Justices somehow thought that exempting foreign convictions \nfrom our felon-in-possession laws was wise public policy. In fact, as \nJustice Thomas noted in his dissent, ``the majority's interpretation \npermits those convicted overseas of murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, \nterrorism and other dangerous crimes to possess firearms freely in the \nUnited States.''\n  The problem in Small was that a majority of the Court felt that our \n1968 law had not been written clearly enough. Although Congress had \nsaid that a person convicted of a felony ``in any court'' could not \npossess a firearm, the majority said that this phrase, ``any court,'' \nmight have been meant to apply only to ``any American court'' rather \nthan what the legislation actually said--``any court.''\n  The Federal felon-in-possession law had already been applied to \nforeign felons in several prosecutions since 1968, but the Court found \nunpersuasive both this history and the statute's express language. \nDissenting Justices Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy accused the majority of \ncreating a novel canon of legal construction that will ``wreak havoc'' \nwith established rules of extraterritorial construction. But whatever \nwe may think of the Court's analysis, there is no doubt that the Small \ndecision is now the law of the land. And if we want to close this legal \nloophole, it is clear that we need to pass some clarifying legislation. \nThe bill I introduce today would do just that.\n  Under this bill, section 921 of Title 18, the definitions section, \nwould be amended to state clearly that ``[t]he term `any court' \nincludes any Federal, State, or foreign court.'' Similar changes would \nbe made in other sections of the Gun Control Act, where there are \nreferences to ``state offenses'' or ``offenses under state law, the \nbill would expand these terms to include convictions of foreign \noffenses and offenses under foreign law.\n  In other words, the bill would make clear that if someone is \nconvicted in a foreign court of an offense that would have disqualified \nhim from possessing a gun if that conviction had been handed\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\ndown in the U.S., the same laws relating to gun possession will be \napplied. The only exception will be if there is reason to think the \nconviction entered by the foreign jurisdiction is somehow invalid.\n  In that situation, this bill would create an exemption, allowing a \nperson convicted in a foreign jurisdiction to challenge its validity. \nUnder the bill, a foreign conviction will not constitute a \n``conviction'' for purposes of the felon-in-possession laws, if the \nforeign conviction either (1) resulted from a denial of fundamental \nfairness that would violate due process if committed in the United \nStates, or (2) if the conduct on which the foreign conviction was based \nwould be legal if committed in the United States.\n  I expect that these circumstances will be fairly rare, but the bill \ndoes take them into account and will provide a complete defense to \nanyone with an invalid foreign conviction. And in any event, it is \nclear that we should not keep in place a policy in which the tail wags \nthe dog. The current state of the law is that we essentially treat \nevery foreign conviction as invalid. And that is simply illogical.\n  An example of why we need to fix this law occurred in 2001, when U.S. \nagents with bulletproof vests raided the New York hotel room of suspect \nRohan Ingram. Ingram was found with 13 firearms and had an extensive \ncriminal background, including at least 18 convictions for crimes such \nas assault and use of firearms during crimes. Law enforcement had \nflagged him as ``armed and dangerous.'' But because all of his \nconvictions had occurred in foreign courts, his felon-in-possession \ncharge was eventually thrown out of court. That is simply not a \ntolerable state of affairs in a post- 9/11 world.\n  Particularly in these times, America cannot continue to give foreign-\nconvicted murderers, rapists and even terrorists an unlimited right to \nbuy firearms in the United States, including even assault weapons that \nthey might try to send to colleagues abroad, or use to develop a cache \nof weapons to use to kill our citizens within the United States. \nAmerican citizens convicted of identical crimes at home are denied the \nability to buy and possess such firearms, and the time has come to fix \nthis loophole so that foreign convicts are placed in the same category.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

A bill to provide for the conversion of a temporary \njudgeship for the district of Hawaii to a permanent judgeship; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to support this bill \naddressing the need for a fourth permanent judgeship for the District \nof Hawaii.\n  Hawaii currently has four active District Court judges. However, if \nany of its four active judges either accepts senior status and retires, \nor becomes otherwise unable to serve, the District of Hawaii will not \nbe able to replace that vacancy with another active judge. This will \npose a problem for not only the active judges, as their workload will \nincrease, but also for the public because an unfilled vacancy may have \na disastrous effect on our court's caseloads. This bill ensures the \ncontinued efficiency of Hawaii's District court system.\n  Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to share with you the \nimportance of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1319\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVERSION OF TEMPORARY JUDGESHIP TO PERMANENT \n                   JUDGESHIP FOR THE DISTRICT OF HAWAII.\n\n       (a) In General.--The existing judgeship for the district of \n     Hawaii authorized by section 203(c) of the Judicial \n     Improvements Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 133 note; Public Law 101-\n     650; 104 Stat. 5089) shall, as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, be authorized under section 133 of title 28, United \n     States Code, and the incumbent in that office shall hold the \n     office under section 133 of title 28, United States Code, as \n     amended by this Act.\n       (b) Tables.--In order that the table contained in section \n     133(a) of title 28, United States Code, will reflect the \n     change in the total number of permanent district judgeships \n     authorized as a result of subsection (a) of this section, the \n     item relating to Hawaii is amended to read as follows:\n\n``Hawaii...........................................................4''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Hawaii, \nSenator Daniel Inouye, to introduce legislation to convert a temporary \njudgeship for the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii to a \npermanent position.\n  There are currently 3 permanent Federal judgeships and one temporary \nFederal judgeship in the U.S. District Court, District of Hawaii. The \nJudicial Improvement Act of 1990, P.L. 101-650 created the temporary \nposition and mandates that the first vacancy occurring in Hawaii after \nOctober 2004 cannot be filled. The District of Hawaii will be left with \nonly 3 Federal judge positions upon a judge vacating his or her \nposition. The loss of a judgeship will severely impact Hawaii's \njudicial system.\n  In March 2007, the Judicial Conference recommended that Congress \nconvert 5 temporary judgeships, one of which is in the District of \nHawaii, to permanent status. Their recommendation is largely based on \nthe significant increase in weighted filings that would occur if a \njudgeship is lost. The Conference projects that the current weighted \nfiling of 380 per judgeship would climb to 507 per judgeship, which is \n18 percent above the Conference standard, should the District of Hawaii \nlose a judgeship.\n  In addition, the Conference reported that the median time from filing \nto disposition for criminal cases in Hawaii has continued to increase \nfrom 1999 to 2005, making Hawaii's case processing times the second \nslowest in the nation. Since 2001, the District Court of Hawaii has \ncompleted an average of 50 trials per year, significantly less than the \nnational average. Although Hawaii has 4 judgeships, 2 are senior judges\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nwho only handle a small number of civil cases. The limited assistance \nprovided by these senior judges is likely to decline further in the \nnear future. These judges are not able to retire due to the constraints \nput forth by the loss of the temporary judgeship seat, should one of \nthe current judges decide to leave. Furthermore, receiving assistance \nfrom visiting judges is made difficult by the high cost of travel to \nHawaii. For these, and many other reasons, the Judicial Council of the \nNinth Circuit supports the Judicial Conference's recommendation to \nconvert this temporary judgeship to a permanent position.\n  I share the concern of many in Hawaii's legal community that the lack \nof a fourth permanent position will delay the timely issuance of \njustice in matters pending before the U.S. District Court, District of \nHawaii. This is a disservice to all. The economic impact of extending \ntrials and prolonging time spent in jail will burden Hawaii's \ntaxpayers. Moreover, the lack of timely judicial review will have \nnegative social impacts by prolonging the disruption in individuals' \nfamilies and lives. The bill we introduce today would ensure 4 Federal \njudgeships remain active in Hawaii to address the needs of the District \nCourt of Hawaii and the people of Hawaii.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Obama (for himself and Mr. Harkin)):\n  S. 1324. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions from transportation fuel sold in the United States; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we heard from a panel of top climate change \nexperts from around the world earlier this year that global warming is \na certainty and that most of the temperature increase is very likely \ndue to rising greenhouse gas concentrations. Reducing America's \ndependence on oil should be one of our top priorities, but any policy \nthat affects our production and consumption of fuel must also address \nthe pressing problem of global warming. Because the oil used in the \nU.S. transportation sector accounts for about one-third of our nation's \nemissions of greenhouse gases, we must adopt a policy that curtails \nthese emissions in an effective manner.\n  Today, along with Senator Harkin, I am introducing the National Low-\nCarbon Fuel Standard Act of 2007, which calls for a reduction in the \nlifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation fuels sold in \nthe U.S. of 5 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2020. These reductions \ncan play an important role in stemming the dangerous transformation of \nour climate.\n  According to one estimate, the National Low-Carbon Fuel Standard, \nNLCFS, would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 180 \nmillion metric tons in 2020. This is the equivalent of taking over 30 \nmillion cars off the road. If enacted in conjunction with the bill I \nintroduced earlier this year to raise fuel efficiency standards, the \nNLCFS would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 530 million metric \ntons in 2020, the equivalent of taking over 50 million cars off the \nroad.\n  The effect on our oil imports would also be dramatic. By making \ngreater use of home-grown, renewable fuels, the NLCFS could reduce the \nannual consumption of gasoline derived from foreign oil imports by \nabout 30 billion gallons in 2020.\n  The NLCFS will greatly expand the market for domestic renewable fuels \nsuch as corn-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. By one \nestimate, the NLCFS will create a market for over 40 billion gallons of \nbiofuels by 2020. To provide near-term demand certainty for renewable \nfuel producers, the bill expands the Renewable Fuel Standard \nestablished in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require 15 billion \ngallons of renewable fuel by 2012.\n  The bill also contains a minimum requirement for fuels with lifecycle \ngreenhouse gas emissions that are 50 and 75 percent lower than \ngasoline. This requirement signals to investors that there will be a \nmarket for advanced fuels with ultra-low carbon emissions, but still \nallows significant leeway for fuel blenders to choose the optimal mix \nof fuels to meet their overall greenhouse gas emissions targets.\n  Because the NLCFS will encourage a rapid expansion of our domestic \nrenewable fuels production capacity, the bill contains provisions that \nprotect sensitive areas like national wildlife refuges, national parks, \nold-growth forests, national grasslands, and national forests. The bill \ncalls for an assessment of the impacts of the expansion compared to the \nbusiness-as-usual scenario of continued reliance on petroleum-based \ntransportation fuels, and the development of standards by 2012 to \nprotect air, land, and water quality. This approach strikes a balance \nbetween the need to rapidly expand our domestic renewable fuel \nproduction capacity and the need to ensure sustainability and \nenvironmental protection. I urge my colleagues to support the National \nLow-Carbon Fuel Standard Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5660-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 189--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION \nIN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA V.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CERTAIN PATENT \n                   INFRINGEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The value of American innovation in developing life-\n     saving prescription drugs saves millions of lives around the \n     world each year.\n       (2) The protection of intellectual property is vital to the \n     continued development of new and life-saving drugs and future \n     growth of the United States economy.\n       (3) In order to maintain the global competitiveness of the \n     United States, the United States Trade Representative's \n     Office of Intellectual Property and Innovation develops and \n     implements trade policy in support of vital American \n     innovations, including innovation in the pharmaceutical and \n     medical technology industries.\n       (4) The United States Trade Representative also provides \n     trade policy leadership and expertise across the full range \n     of interagency initiatives to enhance protection and \n     enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n       (5) When other countries do not respect the intellectual \n     property of American drug companies, all patients suffer \n     because of diminished incentives to develop new life-saving \n     medications and the American economy is unfairly harmed.\n       (6) Strong intellectual property protection, including \n     patent, copyright, trademark, and data protection plays an \n     integral role in fostering economic growth and development \n     and ensuring patient access to the most effective medicines \n     around the world.\n       (7) Certain countries have engaged in unfair price \n     manipulation and abuse of compulsory licensing. This results \n     in Americans bearing the majority of research and development \n     costs for the world, undermines the value of existing United \n     States pharmaceutical patents and could impede access to \n     important therapies.\n       (8) There is a growing global threat of counterfeit \n     medicines and increased need for the United States Trade \n     Representative and other United States agencies to use \n     available trade policy measures to strengthen laws and \n     enforcement abroad to prevent harm to United States patients \n     and patients around the world.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Trade Representative should use all \n     the tools at the disposal of the Trade Representative to deal \n     with violations of intellectual property rights, including--\n       (A) bilateral engagement with United States trading \n     partners;\n       (B) transparency of the annual ``Special 301'' review and \n     reviews of compliance with the intellectual property \n     requirements of countries with respect to which the United \n     States grants trade preferences;\n       (C) negotiation of intellectual property provisions as part \n     of bilateral and regional trade agreements; and\n       (D) multilateral engagement through the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO); and\n       (2) the United States Trade Representative should develop \n     and implement a strategic plan to address the problem of \n     countries that infringe upon American pharmaceutical \n     intellectual property rights and the problem of countries \n     that engage in price manipulation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1059.

Mr. President, I hope we are not moving forward with a \nplan that would introduce the immigration bill we considered in the \nSenate last year. That is what I am hearing. I believe there are talks \nongoing today--bipartisan talks--talks in which the White House and \nother members of the President's Cabinet are participating where they \nare at least talking about a framework of a comprehensive immigration \nreform of which we could be proud.\n  The bill that was introduced last year was fatally flawed. It was not \nthe kind of legislation we should have passed. If it had been passed, \nit would never have worked and would have been an embarrassment to the \nSenate. I cannot say how strongly I believe that to be true. There was \nno way we could repair that bill by amendment. I talked about that last \nyear. It was important that we start over with a new piece of \nlegislation. We worked on it, and a majority of the Republicans in the \nSenate, last year, voted against the bill. The House refused to even \nconsider it. They would not take it up. Four Democrats voted against \nthe bill last year.\n  So the only way to enact comprehensive immigration legislation is to \nstart over and write a new bill on which both the Democrats and a \nmajority of Republicans can agree. Until this week, I had hopes that \nwas ongoing. I have not been in the detailed negotiations, but I have \nbeen briefed on some of the framework for reform that, to me, is very \nconsistent with what I pleaded with my colleagues last year to do.\n  Now, over the past several weeks, up to 10 Members of the Senate have \nbeen actively meeting to write a new bill. They started with the \nprinciples laid out by the White House in a 23-page Powerpoint that \npromptly got leaked. Maybe they wanted it leaked. I don't know. Those \nPowerpoints just have one or two lines. They do not have fine print. \nBut they do set fourth agenda items and principles.\n  The principles laid out in that Powerpoint are much closer to a bill \nI could support and I think the American people would be willing to \nsupport.\n  This is what they included in that presentation. Although I am not \ninvolved in the details, I think it is what Members are discussing at \nthis moment--have been discussing, at least. Apparently, people \nperiodically walk away from the discussions, and they say this isn't \ngood enough or I don't like this, but that is negotiation, hopefully, \nand we can work forward with it. Let me just tell you some of the \nthings that are in this bill that were not in last year's legislation.\n  There is an enforcement trigger. Before any new immigration programs \nor green card adjustments could begin, the principles in the Powerpoint \nwould require an ``enforcement trigger'' to be met. Senator Isakson \nfrom Georgia offered that. He basically said: We are not going to trust \nyou this time--the American people are not. We want to see that you \nfollow through on the things that are critical to a lawful immigration \nsystem before we pass the green card adjustments and deal with those \nother issues.\n  It also requires that the Border Patrol be increased to the numbers \nagreed upon--with a total of 18,300. It is one thing to say we are \ngoing to authorize 18,000 Border Patrol agents, which I think is a \nminimum, really not sufficient to cover the border--but it is an \nincrease of significance. We are not going to go forward with the bill \nuntil you actually hire them and put them on the payroll and train them \nand they are out there.\n  Also, 200 miles of vehicle barriers and 370 miles of fencing must be \nconstructed. We talked about that, and I offered the amendment. It \npassed several times and eventually was passed last year.\n  The catch and release at the border must be ended. This idea of \ncatching people at the border who have violated our immigration laws \nand have come into the country illegally--they are being taken inland, \ntaken before some administrative officer or judge and released on bail \nand asked to come back. Well, 95 percent are not showing up. That is \nwhat they wanted to do: to be brought into America. They were released \non bail. Nobody ever went out and found them or looked for them. It is \njust a broken system. It is not working. Those are things that are part \nof the trigger as to what has to be fixed before we go forward with the \nlegislation. That would be in the principles.\n  The future flow of temporary workers is critical. As to the future \nflow temporary worker program, the so-called Y visas--the principles \noutline a new program for truly temporary workers. The White House plan \nwould admit new workers for 2 years and could be renewed three times, \nfor a total of 6 years.\n  Between each 2-year period, workers would be required to return to \ntheir home countries for 6 months. Workers could not bring their \nspouses or their children but could return home to visit them if they \nchoose. They would be able to go back and forth as often as they liked. \nThere is no cap specified in the White House plan, but the plan \nenvisions an annual cap set by the Secretary of Homeland Security in \nconsultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Commerce, depending on \nAmerican needs.\n  Workers would be eligible to apply for green cards through regular \nchannels. Regular channels are adjusted to a more merit-based system. \nIt would include a merit-based system. I think this is a great \nimprovement over last year's legislation. But I have to tell you, I am \nconcerned about people coming to stay more than 1 year because I think \nit becomes more and more difficult for them to leave. They are less \nlikely to leave. Many of them are more likely to violate the law and \njust embed and stay. I think a 1-year plan would be far better. But \nthose are things that are being talked about which would be \nsubstantially better than last year's legislation.\n  There is a seasonal worker program that makes much more sense than \nwhat was in last year's bill. The principles also contain a ``new and \nimproved'' seasonal worker program that would combine the current \nagricultural--the H-2A plan--and unskilled--H-2B--seasonal worker \nprograms. We combine those two programs, as they should be combined, \nbecause they are each for temporary workers.\n  Workers could remain in this country for 9 months at a time, under \nthis proposal, and would be required to return to their home countries \nfor 3 months in between. This is a temporary worker program that \nappears to be actually temporary, unlike last year's legislation, in \nwhich the temporary guest worker program in last year's immigration \nbill said an individual could come to this country temporarily, but \nthey could bring their wife and children. They could come for 3 years. \nThat 3 years could be extended again and again and again. And they \ncould apply for citizenship within the first year they got here. That \nwas the temporary worker program last year. How broken was that? It \nwould never have worked. People bring their children, they get settled \nin the country, a decade goes by. Who is going to be able to ask them \nto leave? What kind of painful scene would that be? Teachers, \npreachers, family members, neighbors--they have gotten to know people. \nThey have a whole new mindset, an incorrect mindset.\n\n  The bill, last year, said ``temporary guest worker program,'' and \nthis is what it was. It was really a permanent entry into the country \nfor very extended periods of time where it could be difficult for \npeople to leave.\n  Under this plan, the outline that is being discussed, they could \nactually work--and it is what I suggested last year--and spouses and \nchildren would remain in the worker's home country.\n  Renewals under the seasonal program would be unlimited, which may be \nproblematic. We would need to discuss that some.\n  But these workers would also be eligible to apply for green cards \nunder regular channels, if they are willing to compete against others \non a merit-\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nbased basis to see whether or not they could come.\n  Then the principles focus on a more merit-based entry policy into the \nUnited States. The principles I hear being discussed would eliminate \nthe Diversity Visa Lottery and some chain migration categories, such as \nbrothers and sisters and adult siblings of U.S. citizens.\n  Green cards that have been given out for those individuals would be \ntransferred over to a point system which selects legal permanent \nresident applicants based on merit. So I am concerned that the White \nHouse plan also appears to increase the total number of green cards \navailable each year. Page 21 of the Powerpoint indicates that 1.4 \nmillion green cards would be available each year. We are at about 1 \nmillion now. That would be a 40-percent increase. I want to look at \nthat carefully. But I like the idea of the entry being based on a more \nmeritorious program.\n  They have a plan to clear the current backlog of green card \napplications, which also has dangers in that it could substantially \nincrease the number of people who would come. I am not sure \ncomprehensive immigration reform is designed to increase--at least the \nAmerican people have an idea that it is designed to increase \ndramatically the number of people who come legally today. I don't think \nthat is what most people have in mind when they think about immigration \nreform.\n  What about the population that is here today illegally? This plan \nthat is being discussed would have given legal status to illegal aliens \ncurrently in the country through a new ``Z'' visa, which would be \nrenewable indefinitely. Those holding Z visas will be eligible to apply \nfor green cards through regular channels after they go back, \n``touchback,'' across the border. But regular channels are adjusted to \na more merit-based system. So they would have to compete with people \nwho have other qualities and merits that may make them less likely to \nbe admitted.\n  If these principles are the ones that form the framework for a newly \ndrafted, bipartisan bill, then I think it is possible that we could \nsuccessfully enact immigration reform this year.\n  Now, I cannot tell you that I am going to be able to vote for this \nplan in the end because I intend to read the fine print. That is what I \nlearned last year. The rubric, the caption in the bill last year was \n``temporary guest worker program'' in big print right in the middle of \nthe bill. Then, when you read it, what did you find? We found that the \nindividuals came here for 3 years, with their family, and they could \nreup, reup for 3 years, time and time again, and, frankly were never \ngoing to leave this country.\n  It was not a temporary guest worker program at all. It was a scheme \nto confuse the American people about the real meaning of it. In fact, I \nthink it confused Senators. I think they thought it was a temporary \nworker program, and it absolutely was not. It would never have worked. \nBut the people who wrote it--I think that was their plan. They never \nwanted it to work to begin with. That is the true fact about it. So the \nfine print could contain things that will not work.\n  So I think the framework, the outline, if we are honest and serious, \ncould be the basis for a historic reform of immigration that could \nactually work, that we could actually be proud of. It is possible. But \nthere are forces, special interests that are driving this process, and \nthey do not respect the views of the American people. They want to ram \nit through on their terms, and they want to have it say what they want \nit to say.\n  This is what the news reports are saying, and I am getting very \nconcerned about it. It is now being reported that instead of being \npatient and waiting for this new bipartisan bill to be completed and \nactually written up so people can read it, the majority leader, Senator \nReid, is forcing the immigration bill to this floor Wednesday, May 9, \nthe day after tomorrow. According to Roll Call, this morning:\n\n       According to an aide to Reid, the Majority leader is \n     expected to bring up the . . . package passed by the \n     Judiciary Committee last year . . . if negotiations produce a \n     deal he will allow lawmakers to propose it as a substitute \n     amendment. . . .\n\n  Now, this plan is not a wise approach. Why do we want to bring up a \npiece of legislation that is fatally flawed, that should never, ever \nbecome law? I see no reason. I have one idea, though, or one suspicion \nI am going to discuss.\n  It puts undue pressure, an artificial timeline, on those who are \ntrying to work through this extremely complex and important piece of \nlegislation we do not need. We don't have to set that kind of deadline. \nWhat we need them to do is to spend the necessary time to produce a \nstrong, thoughtful, bipartisan product that will actually work. That is \nwhat we need to do. Then we can vote for it with pride instead of \ntrying to sneak it through this Senate without anybody knowing what is \nactually in it. As I said last week when I heard about this plan, the \nDemocratic leadership acts as if this is another piece of everyday \nlegislation, but it is not. The immigration bill is one of the most \nimportant to come through the Senate in the decade I have been here. I \nbelieve that. I think the American people understand that. So this \noption is not new.\n  In April, we heard news reports that the Democratic majority would be \nabandoning efforts to write a new bill and would be starting with the \nfatally flawed bill produced by the Judiciary Committee last Congress.\n  ``Immigration Daily,'' an online immigration law publication, \nreported:\n\n       There is good reason to believe that the CIR--that is the \n     Comprehensive Immigration Reform--\n       Language will finally be introduced on the Senate floor \n     within 2 weeks or less. What will the CIR language look like? \n     CIR begins with S. 2611, the McCain-Kennedy bill which \n     cleared the Senate last year.\n\n  The New York Times reported a similar story:\n\n       Senator Edward M. Kennedy has abandoned efforts to produce \n     a new immigration bill and is proposing using legislation \n     produced last March by the Senate Judiciary Committee as the \n     starting point for negotiations this year. Mr. Kennedy \n     dismissed the notion that his efforts to produce a new \n     immigration bill had failed. He said he had decided that the \n     committee report was the best starting point.\n       We have had extensive hearings on the essential aspects of \n     this bill,\n\n  Mr. Kennedy said.\n\n       We are effectively ready to mark up and for going to the \n     floor.\n\n  I am very disappointed--beyond disappointed--to hear those news \nreports. I have been pleased, I guess, today that so far these plans \nhaven't come to fruition, that the majority has begun to engage or has \ncontinued to engage Republican Senators and the White House in a real \neffort to write a good bill. I hope that is what the majority will \ncontinue to do.\n  I hope the majority will abandon last year's fatally flawed bill, not \nstart with it. It cannot be amended and an effective bill created. It \nmeans this cannot be the starting point to come to the floor with a new \nbill this Congress. I implore our leadership to continue trying to \nwrite a bill that a majority of Republicans could support, that is \npossible if we follow through on the real principles people are talking \nabout and saying they can agree to.\n  It is not a question of the principles we are dealing with. The \nquestion is: Will we write the bill in such a way that the principles \nare carried out? That is the key thing. It was not done last year. In \n1986, it was to be the amnesty to end all amnesties. They had 3 million \npeople--I think they thought there were 2 million people--here \nillegally. They created amnesty for them and they promised we would \npass a new law and that this new law would be such that we wouldn't \nhave to do amnesty again. That was in 1986, 20 years ago. We had, it \nturned out, 3 million people who claimed the amnesty.\n  What has happened since? Now we have 12 million people here \nillegally--maybe 20 million--who knows for sure. So why wouldn't we \nlearn from that? Why wouldn't we understand this is not a political \nfootball to be kicked down the field? This is important legislation \nthat ought to be passed and written correctly, so 5 years from now, we \ncan go to our constituents and say: We did something good. It is \nworking as we promised you it would work. Why not?\n  Well, I will tell my colleagues what appears to me to be happening. \nBy bringing up the old bill, last year's bill, which many people in \nthis Senate voted for and probably still believe is good legislation, \nthough it certainly is not, they can start it--they can start it and go \nforward with this bill that perhaps they never intend to be offered as \nthe final legislation. You burn the time\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\non the motion to proceed to the bill for the bill to be discussed, and \nthey can go past that and move to proceed to the bill, and then file \nfor cloture on the bill, and then offer a substitute, 700, 800 pages. \nThat is how many pages it was last year--over 600. If they write this \none well this year, it should be more than that. They drop a 700, 800-\npage bill and substitute the old bill, and there is no time to \ndebate it, and they slide it right through, railroad time. I am telling \nmy colleagues, that appears to me to be what it is about. That would be \nan abrogation of our responsibility.\n\n  The American people care about this legislation. The American people \nare not unengaged. They know something compassionate is going to have \nto be done about the 12 million people, but I think most people agree \nwith me that someone who came here illegally should not be given every \nsingle benefit we give to somebody who comes here legally. We need to \nset a principle that we are not going to reward illegal behavior in the \nfuture. So you work something out on that, and you work something out \non these other complex issues, and we set up a policy of immigration \nfor the future that reflects some of the principles Canada has: its \npoint system, its merit-based system. That was never discussed last \nyear. Not one hint of it is in the bill Senator Reid is apparently \nintending to bring up on Wednesday.\n  How can we possibly talk about comprehensive immigration reform and \nnever consider a merit-based immigration system? Isn't America based on \nmerit? Don't we know far more people want to come here than can be \naccepted? Don't we know Australia does that, New Zealand does that, the \nUnited Kingdom is looking at that--all developed and highly \nsophisticated nations committed to humanity and civil rights, world \nleaders in that regard. Are their proposals somehow immoral and unfit? \nOf course not. Those ideas were not even discussed in last year's bill. \nSo they say we might have something such as that in this legislation. \nWell, let's see it. Let's see what the words say. What is it going to \nsay? Is it going to be like last year when it said ``temporary guest \nworker,'' and that was nothing but a sham when you read the fine print \nunder it? Is that what we are going to get this year, a bill they ram \nthrough at the last minute, burning the time for debate so we have only \nthe most minimal time to debate? Is that the plan? I hope the American \npeople are keeping their eye on this one. They deserve more. The \nAmerican people are concerned about immigration. It is an important \nissue. It is a very important issue to us.\n  We had a group from Ireland testify at the Judiciary Committee last \nyear and they told us only 2,000 people got into our country from \nIreland last year. We had over 1 million come in legally. What is this? \nHow do we create a system that does not give people throughout the \nworld an equal chance, an opportunity to apply to come to America? We \nneed to work on that. We can do it. There is a framework here that, if \nfleshed out with good legislation, good language, enforceability, we \ncan be proud of.\n  I am afraid that is not what we are doing. I am afraid there is an \nattempt here to move a fast one. I am afraid the masters of the \nuniverse who run this place, some on both sides of the aisle, don't \nwant the American people to know what is in the bill. They don't trust \nthem to be in on the negotiations. They want to do it and slide it \nthrough.\n  I remember last year we offered--someone offered a good amendment, I \nthink it was the Isakson amendment, on a trigger, and one of the \nSenators said: Oh, we can't accept that amendment. Why not? We can't \naccept it because it would upset that delicate balance of negotiations \nwith the parties who put this bill together. So I asked: Who were they? \nWho are these parties who put the bill together? Where did they meet? \nDid they have votes? Did people elect them to go in this caucus to \nwrite this piece of junk that was the bill last year? Who was that? Oh, \nthey wouldn't talk about who actually wrote the bill. They wanted to \nram it through, and nobody could amend it because it would upset their \ndelicate compromise. Well, phooey on that. We need to do this in the \nlight of day. We need to stand up and explain to our constituents and \nask them to support a good bill, and we need to stand up and oppose a \nbill that is a bad bill. We are going to live with it, as we have lived \nfor over 20 years now with 1986, that failed piece of legislation that \nhad so much promise and people were so happy about when it passed, and \nit never worked.\n  There are several reasons we need to be cautious. You can put in a \npiece of legislation an authorization to add a bunch of Border Patrol \nofficers or workplace enforcement rules, or you can put in an \nauthorization to spend money to create a computer system that will \nactually work, and it can. We can create a system that will work, but \nauthorizing doesn't mean anything. That doesn't mean anything. You have \nto come up with money, and the money comes up in the years to come. If \nthis Congress isn't serious about what it is doing and we pass a bill \nthat authorizes a bunch of provisions that could actually help and be \nworthwhile and we never come up with the money to do it, the system is \ngoing to collapse as badly as it is right now.\n  We need a national debate, a national consensus on a good piece of \nlegislation. The President needs to be committed to leading instead of \nundermining the enforcement of laws. They are getting a little better \nin the White House now, but Presidents in the past have had no interest \nwhatsoever in seeing immigration laws passed. If they did, they would \nhave come to Congress and said: We need more border enforcement, we \nneed fencing, we need more Border Patrol, we need an end catch and \nrelease. They never came to Congress and said the law was not being \nenforced. American constituents talk to Members of Congress and the \nMembers of the Senate and explain about the plain as day illegality \nthat is going on, and the Congress is trying to make the system be \nenforced. My colleague, the Presiding Officer, is a former U.S. \nattorney. The President, the executive branch has the responsibility to \nenforce the law, not the Congress. What do we know about how to catch \nall these people. They ought to be asking us for the laws. They should \nbe telling us what is needed. But no, no, because nobody, not any \nPresident since 1986, has ever taken his responsibility to enforce the \nlaws of the United States seriously as they apply to immigration. So \nthat is what we have.\n  I have points I will not go into tonight that detail the incredible \nflaws that existed in last year's bill.\n  Senator Specter offered a bill that I didn't favor, but it was \nbetter--he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee last year--it was \nbetter than the other two that arose. After he offered it in Judiciary \nCommittee, we went on in a day or so, or two or three, and we had this \ndeadline. Like Senator Reid, Senator Frist said: I have to have the \nbill out Monday. If you don't bring it out Monday, I am going to \nintroduce another bill--a pretty good bill, actually, which was an \nenforcement-oriented bill. Also, the Judiciary Committee got in a \nflutter, and we ran around, and Senator Kennedy offered the \nsubstitute--Kennedy-McCain. The Specter bill was gone, and an entirely \nnew Kennedy-McCain bill was on the floor. Then the controversial AgJOBS \nportion of immigration that had been floating around here and had been \nblocked over the years was offered up as an amendment to Kennedy-\nMcCain, and it was added with no debate. We voted this out and it was \non the floor, and the next day we were debating this 600-page bill.\n  That is not the way to do business in the Senate. My chief counsel \nhere studied this legislation, and we read the fine print, that 600 \npages, and when we looked at it, we were shocked at the loopholes it \ncontained. We identified--and I spoke here several hours on it--17 \nloopholes in that legislation. It began to lose steam. We found out \njust, for example--mind you, Senator Reid, I understand from the New \nYork Times and others, is talking about introducing the Judiciary \nCommittee bill. This is what the Judiciary Committee bill would have \ndone last year, the one that passed out of the Committee, the so-called \nMcCain-Kennedy bill. Under current law, over the next 20 years, this \nNation would issue 18.9 million green cards--quite a substantial \nnumber. Under the Kennedy-McCain bill passed out of committee last \nyear--hold your hat--it would have been, at a minimum, 78 million over \n20 years to\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nas many as 200 million. That is two-thirds of the current population of \nthe United States of America. They tried to move that bill without \namendments. I cannot recall the gymnastics they went through, but they \nwere even denying Senators Kyl and Cornyn amendments they wanted to \nhave, and Senator Reid wanted no amendments.\n  Finally, we began to have amendments. Senator Bingaman offered two \namendments, eventually, as time went by. It was brought back the third \ntime. They brought those numbers down from 78 million and 200 million \nto 53 million, almost 3 times the current rate of immigration.\n  So Senator Reid, as I understand it, according to a news report, is \ntalking about bringing up the Judiciary Committee bill. This is not the \n53 million people being brought in here permanently with a green card--\npermanent residents--but we would go back to the 78 million to 200 \nmillion. How amazing is that?\n  So I am just flabbergasted by the way this matter is being treated. \nThere is only one way to do it; that is, we stand up like real Senators \nand we write a bill and work out a bill, and we give the Members of the \nSenate the time to read it, time for the American people to understand \nwhat is in it, and see if it can be amended and made better, and make \nsure it will actually work, not just be a political show--not some \npolitical sham but a piece of legislation that would actually work, and \nthen we would pass it. We would be responsible to our constituents for \na ``yes'' or ``no'' vote because we do need to pass comprehensive \nreform. I said that many times last year. Of course, we need that.\n  The whole system is broken. Nothing about it works. Of course, we \nneed to reform it from the ground up. But the legislation last year is \nno place to start. We don't need to be using some gimmick to get the \nbill up, with last year's language, and then substitute new language \nthat nobody has read and ram it through the Senate. The American people \nshould not be happy with that.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his patience and those who \nlistened to my remarks. I believe we can do something better. I support \nreal and genuine reform of immigration in America. I will support \nlegislation that provides a compassionate solution to the people who \nhave been here for years and have been dutiful, law-abiding people \nexcept for their illegal presence. We can work through those things.\n  We need a future flow system, much more like Canada's, much more like \nNew Zealand's. We need a temporary worker program that is really \ntemporary. We need a workplace enforcement system that the average \nemployer will have no problem in following. We need a biometric, \nidentifying cards for immigrant workers so they cannot be illegally \nforged. That is all possible to do if we want to do it--unless the \npeople who are driving this bill, the architects of this, just want to \ngo through the motions of creating an immigration system that would \nwork, unless that is their plan, to just go through the motions and \npass a bill that has no chance of being successful, just like we did in \n1986, and 8 or 10 years later, they can say: We are heartbroken; we \nthought it was going to work.\n  I think we can do it, and I think we ought to do it. I hope the \nmajority leader will not bring up the last year's bills--any one of \nthem--and that he will bring up the bill that was drafted through this \ncompromise process because I think it at least has some possibility to \nbe a bill we could support, unlike the one last year, and then we can \nstudy it and debate it. The American people could be engaged in it, and \nwe ought to stand up and vote and do the right thing for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/07/senate-section/article/S5673-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
