There are people who think it is the best thing in the \nworld, and there are people who think it is the worst thing in the \nworld. We are going to continue to work on this legislation and see if \nwe can satisfy people so they think it is good legislation and we are \nworking out of a necessity to solve some major problems in America \ntoday as relates to legislation dealing with immigration.\n  I will be happy to yield to my distinguished Republican friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S6971-7", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I attended, as Senator Ensign and I do every \nMemorial Day, a service at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial \nCemetery, which is located in Boulder City, NV. I am struck by two \nconversations I had.\n  One was with a World War II veteran by the name of Ken Brown. \nBasically, he has lost his hearing. He was a machine gunner on a \ndestroyer. As you know, Mr. President, the noise on one of those ships \nwas deafening, and he certainly was deafened in the process. But he \ntold me--and this is the first time he has ever expressed anything \nother than total support for what President Bush has been doing as \nrelates to the military--he told me in no uncertain terms that we \nDemocrats were headed in the right direction; we had to stop what was \ngoing on in Iraq.\n  Then, a wonderful woman came up to visit with me. She visited me a \nyear and a month ago here in my office. Her boy had been killed in \nIraq. A year ago, I traveled with her and her husband after the \nceremony in Memorial Cemetery in Boulder City out of the auditorium and \nout to one of the graves. There are 22,000 graves in that new cemetery \nin Boulder City. It is very new. There are 22,000 graves. One of those \ngraves is her son, John Lukac, who was killed in Iraq. She is as sad \ntoday as she was a year ago. She asked me with tears in her eyes if \nthere is some way I can get her to Iraq. She wants to go where her son \nwas killed. We said: No, we don't want you to go to Iraq; you shouldn't \ngo there. She is a wonderful woman, a wonderful mother. This is a \nwonderful family. Her husband is so gracious and nice.\n  I am grateful beyond words for the sacrifices of the men and women in \nuniform from Nevada and around the Nation who have done so much for our \ncountry and are serving in the military. We focus on those who have \nbeen injured and killed, and those are the people who have given a \ntremendous sacrifice. But there are other people who serve, and \nsometimes in not so glamorous positions, but it is as a result of their \nservice that we are able to conduct military warfare as we need to. In \nthis work period, we will continue to do everything we can to honor the \nsacrifices of these men and women with a responsible end to the Iraq \nwar.\n  During the work period, I had a chance to visit with many Nevadans. \nNo. 1 on their minds is the war, and No. 2 is the high gas prices. We \nare better now in Nevada. Gas prices keep going up. We are no longer \nNo. 3 in the Nation. I guess that is some distinction. We have dropped \ndown to 11 or somewhere in that area. And, of course, immigration \nreform is on everyone's mind. I assured them that these issues--the \nIraq war, the situation with the gas prices and, of course, \nimmigration--are on our radar screen. We are going to be working on \nthose issues this work period.\n  On the first day of the 110th Congress, Democrats, because we won the \nmajority, were able to introduce the first 10 bills, the first 10 \npriorities as we saw them. Last Friday, we concluded a 7-week work \nperiod, and we have taken action on 7 of these 10 priorities.\n  We passed the toughest ethics and lobbying reform in our Nation's \nhistory. We will soon go to conference with the House on that bill.\n  We passed a 10-year overdue minimum wage that the President has \nsigned.\n  We attempted to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug \nprices. We were prevented from doing so because of a Republican \nfilibuster.\n  We passed the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission after \nalmost 3 years of them being set aside. We expect to complete the \nconference on that legislation within the next couple of weeks and send \nit to the President.\n  Stem cell research, giving hope to millions of Americans, was again \npassed in this body, and we expect to send it to the President after \nconferencing with the House, which we expect to do in the next couple \nof weeks, and we think in the Senate we are going to send a veto-proof \nbill to him.\n  In addition, we were able to pass what was not one of the top 10 \npriorities but something we have been trying to do for 3 years; that \nis, disaster relief for the struggling farmers and ranchers in this \ncountry.\n  We were able to send to the President something he signed dealing \nwith giving the victims of Katrina the relief they deserve since the \nactual hurricane struck. The President has gone there lots of times but \nrefused to cooperate with us in sending the money.\n  We were able to send a downpayment on SCHIP, which is helping to fund \nhealth care for children.\n  And, of course, we were able to send $1 billion in homeland security. \nWe fought with the President for years. I have to say, his people \nfought us to the very end. We were forced to take some of that money \noff homeland security. But with $1 billion, we can at least go forward \nand do a better job of checking cargo containers coming into this \ncountry. We can do a better job of checking for nuclear weapons coming \ninto this country, dirty bombs. We will do a better job of taking a \nlook at what is happening with our rail safety.\n  So we are comfortable that we have done some good things. We passed a \nbalanced budget that restores fiscal discipline and puts the middle \nclass first--cutting their taxes while increasing investment in \neducation, veterans care, and children's health care.\n  We began debate on the complex, crucial issue of immigration reform, \nwhich I spoke about a short time ago. This week, we are going to \ncomplete that legislation and hopefully bring to final passage a \ncomprehensive bill that will strengthen our border security and bring \n12 million undocumented Americans out of the shadows and help our \neconomy move strongly.\n  In the days ahead, we will work to improve the bill to protect and \nstrengthen family ties while improving the structure of the temporary \nworker program.\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\n  Following immigration, we will turn our attention to the 3 remaining \nbills from the original 10: an energy bill that will take crucial steps \ntoward weaning our country of our addiction to foreign oil; we are \ngoing to reauthorize the Higher Education Act which will address \nskyrocketing costs of college; and a Defense authorization bill to make \ncritical investments to address troop readiness problems in the \nmilitary, and that debate will be led by the Presiding Officer.\n  Readiness will be led by the distinguished junior Senator from \nVirginia, someone who has experience in battle and more than just \nwords. We look forward to following the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia in making sure our troops are ready, their rotations are \nright, they are trained right, and that they are not going back, as \nhappened in Nevada 2 weeks ago when someone was going back for a fourth \ntour of duty and acknowledged to his family he was tired and knew he \nwouldn't come back. He had survived too many explosions to go back for \nanother tour of duty and survive another explosion, and he was right. \nHe is now dead.\n  We will also reconfigure our national security strategy to better \nmeet the threats and challenges we face today that the President, we \nbelieve, is overlooking.\n  We have made great progress this year, especially when we have put \nour partisan differences aside to work toward common goals. But for all \nthe good that has come in the shadow of President Bush's catastrophic \nIraq war, we need to do so much more. Ending the war will continue to \nbe our No. 1 priority every single day as the year continues.\n  The month of May 2007 was the third deadliest month in the war. It \nwas close to being the deadliest, but they didn't break that record, \nthank goodness. But May was the third deadliest month in the entire 51 \nmonths of this war. June is off to a horrifying start. Sixteen \nAmericans have been killed in the first 3 days of the month.\n  The President's troop escalation is now complete. Yet a New York \nTimes article this morning reports that security goals are far, far, \nfar short of the military's hopes, with just about one-third of \nBaghdad's neighborhoods in some semblance of order.\n  In the midst of this growing chaos, the Senate Intelligence Committee \nreleased a new bipartisan report just before the Memorial Day deadline. \nMy good friend and colleague, Chairman Jay Rockefeller, working with \nthe vice chair of the committee, Kit Bond--and the Intelligence \nCommittee has become a nonpartisan committee, as it was set up to do--\nthey worked on a bipartisan basis, and the information they came up \nwith is long overdue. Previously, there was not cooperation between the \nmajority and the minority. The chairman of the committee basically \nstonewalled everything the committee was trying to get done, and that \nis the reason we shut the Senate down. But that information has now \ncome forward, and my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, deserves enormous \ncredit for putting together this crucially important report.\n  It further brings to light the administration's decision to go to war \nin Iraq regardless of the facts and warnings issued by the Intelligence \nCommittee. The Intelligence Committee foretold much of the chaos we now \nface. They told the President, among other things, the following: that \ninstalling democracy would be a long, difficult, and probably turbulent \nchallenge in Iraq, and that was an understatement; No. 2, that al-Qaida \nwould try to take advantage of U.S. attention on postwar Iraq to \nreestablish its presence in Afghanistan, and they have done that; that \nIraq was a deeply divided society that likely would engage in violent \nconflict unless an occupying power prevented it, and we have not \nprevented it; that the U.S. occupation of Iraq would result in a surge \nof political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups, and that \nhas proven to be true; that Iraq's neighbors would jockey for influence \nin Iraq, including fomenting strife among Iraq's sectarian groups, and \nthat is true; that some elements in the Iranian Government could decide \nto try to counter aggressively the U.S. presence in Iraq or challenge \nU.S. goals, and they have done that; and, finally, that our action in \nIraq would not cause other regional states to abandon their WMD \nprograms or their desire to develop such programs, and that also has \nproven to be true.\n  Clearly, the intelligence community got it right, and their warnings \nwere not issued in a vacuum. Perhaps the most striking finding of the \nreport is that all the key administration players were made aware of \nthese warnings--Doug Feith, Paul Wolfowitz, Steve Hadley, Scooter \nLibby, all key Bush officials at the National Security Council, the \nState Department, the Department of Defense, and the Vice President \nwere all on the distribution list.\n  The Bush administration cannot hide behind ignorance. Whether out of \nhubris or incompetence, the President and his men willfully ignored the \nexperts and sent our troops to battle unprepared for the consequences.\n  Some might say, what is past is past. If the President's prewar \nfailure was a one-time event, we could maybe forget about it, even \nthough that would be hard. But if President Bush's prewar failure was a \none-time event, we could leave it to the historians to study and judge \nthe tragedy of his incompetence. But even today, after almost 3,500 \nAmerican deaths and more than 20,000 wounded, the President continues \nto cherry-pick facts in order to paint a rosy but very misleading \npicture of Iraq.\n  After tens of thousands of injuries to our troops, the President \ncontinues to ignore the advice of experts. After nearly $500 billion of \nAmerica's treasure has been spent in Iraq--some say it is approaching \n$1 trillion, but a vast amount of our treasury--he is still dreaming \nhis way through this epic tragedy. The country's eyes are wide open, \nand it is time for the President to wake up.\n  I understand some Americans are frustrated that we here in Congress \nhave not been able to move more quickly to end the war. Many who voted \nfor change in November anticipated dramatic and immediate results in \nJanuary. They did get some dramatic changes. This is what we have given \nthem: more than 75 hearings on Iraq, the Walter Reed scandal brought to \nlight and steps taken to make it right, a supplemental bill sent to the \nPresident that set a firm policy to responsibly end the war--only a \nsmall step but a step, a second supplemental that set benchmarks and \nvoided the President's blank check--the first was vetoed, this was not.\n  Our resolve has never been stronger. With a razor-thin majority--and, \nremember, it is a razor-thin majority--an obstinate President, and a \nRepublican minority that continues to bow to his will, we are \nnonetheless making real progress. However, under the Senate's rules and \nour Constitution, there is only so far a determined majority can go, \nespecially with our 49-50 disadvantage, which is due to Senator \nJohnson's illness. We can only end this war if the President changes \ncourse, or more Republicans join with us to force him to do so.\n  When we take up the Defense authorization bill, we will not just work \nto correct the President's neglect of troop readiness and protection, \nwe will give our Republican colleagues another opportunity to join us \nand bring a responsible end to this war. We will fight for that every \nday this year, as long as the President and a few allies left here in \nCongress continue to defy the reality the rest of us see clearly.\n  We owe it to the men and women serving overseas and serving at home, \nto families who await the return of those overseas, and all Americans \nwho want the Iraq tragedy to finally end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S6973-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would just say to my friend, Senator \nReid, the able Democratic majority leader in the Senate, that I hope we \ndon't continue in a debate about the Iraq situation in ways that are \ndestructive to our Nation but that we can conduct the debate in a \npositive way.\n  For example, I know there has been an intelligence report that has \nbeen produced, but it also had within it projections of things of a \npositive nature, some of which occurred and some of which didn't. It \nhad within it projections of things of a negative nature that did not \noccur. Even with regard to its prediction of violence and persistent \nviolence and sectarian strife that could occur that report predicted it \nwould be phasing down after 3 or 4 years. So predictions are \npredictions.\n  I don't think those possibilities were not discussed in the debate \nleading up to our giving authorization to the President to conduct this \nwar. To suggest that this intelligence report was some sort of smoking \ngun that raised issues nobody had even discussed, and that somehow the \nPresident misled the public, is wrong and it hurts the President of the \nUnited States, whoever he or she may be; and who, right now, we assume \nwill be traveling the world and meeting with leaders of foreign \nnations. To make those kind of accusations is not healthy, in my view, \nand not responsible.\n  Now, we had a vote week before last, fortunately, to provide funding \nthrough the emergency supplemental for our soldiers, sailor, airmen and \nmarines in Iraq. That was too long in my view, but we did it. And we \nvoted to send General Petraeus to execute the surge that the President \nhas called for, and that was the funding that we approved week before \nlast to fund that surge. He is to give us a report in September on how \nthe situation is in Iraq, and we are all watching with a great deal of \nanxiety because we are concerned about what is happening in Iraq. We \nknow the United States has only limited ability to affect what we would \nlike to occur there. We have done a great deal to help that nation \nestablish itself, and we want to continue to utilize our resources \nwisely, but this was a surge and we need to evaluate the situation in \nSeptember.\n  What I would urge my colleagues on the other side to do, even though \nthey may be concerned about it, in the debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill, and perhaps the Defense appropriations bill that \nwill occur later on this summer, we ought not to utilize rhetoric and \nlanguage that undermines what our soldiers are doing right now, what we \ndirected them to do, and what we have funded them to do, and that is to \nhelp create stability and more security for the people of Iraq. We \nought not to debate in such a way that it makes it harder for them to \nsucceed.\n  Don't we all want that to occur? Don't we all want to see a stable, \ndecent Iraq occur? They have had elections, but they are having a very \ndifficult time bringing that country together in a stable fashion, as \nwe all know. So I would encourage my colleagues, in the course of the \ndebate, that we conduct ourselves in such a way that we don't place at \ngreater risk our soldiers and that we don't make our foreign policy \nthat we have in a bipartisan way authorized more difficult to achieve \nand provide any ability for the enemy to think that they are able to \nprevail by lack of resolve on our part.\n  I want to spend a few minutes talking about the immigration bill that \nis before us. I think it is a critically important piece of \nlegislation. The American people are concerned about it. They are \nfollowing it quite closely. They know we have a difficult time in Iraq, \nand they do not expect an easy solution there. They know we have \ndifficulties with energy prices and other difficulties, and they want \nus to do what we can in that regard.\n  With regard to immigration, they are rightly of the view that we can \ndo something about it. We can create a lawful system of immigration \nthat serves our national interest if we desire to do so. If we, as a \nCongress and the executive branch, want this to happen, we can make it \nhappen. Don't let anybody suggest otherwise. It is not impossible. It \nis absolutely possible, and we ought to be working on that. That is \nwhat they have asked us to do, and I hope we will.\n  Let me just mention the debate so far has been sporadic and \ndesultory. Members have not had a chance to be very engaged in the \nmatter. We were off last week for Memorial Day, but the week before \nthat we were in debate on the bill. The week before that, the old bill, \nlast year's failed bill, was introduced and sat on the calendar until \nTuesday morning of the week before the recess. They then plopped down a \ncomplete substitute, a completely new bill last Tuesday.\n  On Monday, we talked about immigration. I talked about it at some \nlength, but there were no Senators here, really. The only vote we had \nwas on the motion to proceed to the new bill. We had a mere six roll \ncall votes last week, and we didn't do anything Friday even though we \nwere in session. A few hardy souls, myself included, came down and \nspoke, but nobody was here to really listen. There were no votes, and \nmost Senators had already gone home for the recess.\n  Here we are again, now on the Monday after recess, with very few \nSenators here and no votes scheduled for today. All of these days \nthough, even though we did not do anything, are going to be counted, \nyou see, as time we spend analyzing and amending the immigration bill \nthat is before us.\n  I suggest that at this painfully slow pace of amendments, the bill \ncan't be done this week, that we need a great deal more time on this \nbill before final passage.\n  The way the bill was brought up was that our colleague, Senator Reid, \nunder rule XIV, just introduced it and immediately brought it up. It \ndid not go to committee. It was brought straight to the floor. It \nreally had only been written over the weekend, and, bam, here it was on \nthe floor. Senator Reid really wanted to pass it the first week it was \non the floor, but there was a lot of push-back on that, and now we are \ninto this week of debate.\n  I see from his comments today that the majority leader seems to think \nthe bill can pass this week. I suggest it cannot. There is no way it \ncan be done in a week. I think 100 amendments have been filed. To get \none brought up, though, is not easy. You have to basically get the \nconsent of the majority leader to get an amendment brought up and made \npending. So there are not nearly so many pending as there are problems \nthat need to be fixed.\n  There are flaws in the legislation. I am going to talk about those at \nsome length. I will be talking about at least 20 serious flaws in this \nlegislation, but I do not want that to suggest that flaws alone are the \nonly problems with the legislation. In this bill, we do not have a \nprincipled approach to the future flow of immigrants into America, that \nis not a loophole, that is a major flaw. We have not thought through \nphilosophically what we want to do about immigration. We have not made \nthe real commitment I had hoped we would to a more merit-based, skill-\nbased immigration system. I am concerned about all of that. I think the \nAmerican people are too.\n  The administration and Senator Kennedy and the others who promoted \nthe legislation talked about some principles as a part of talking \npoints they handed out as the foundation for immigration legislation \nthey would be offering. I first say to my colleagues, the bill does not \nmeet the promises contained in those talking points and those \nprinciples. It just simply does not. If it did, we would be in much \nbetter shape than we are today, because many of those principles were \nsound. It contains, as I will note, a host of fundamental, serious \ndefects and flaws that make the legislation not one that ought to be \npassed now.\n  Finally, I still do not believe the White House and the Congress have \nheard the American people. They still think we can pass a piece of \nlegislation here on the floor of the Congress, and we can push it \nthrough and get it off\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\nour plate, and it will be some years before the American people find \nout this will not work either, anymore than it did in 1986, and it will \nbe up to the next President, or the next President, and they will be \nthe ones who will have to answer for it, but we will not pay a price. \nThat is just the way they think it is going to be.\n  Although I believe the American people deeply and strongly and \nintelligently are committed to a lawful immigration system that is \ncompassionate and will work, I am not sure the leadership in the \nCongress is, or the White House. Indeed, we have not had a President \ncommitted to enforcement of immigration laws in the last 40 years.\n  Those are the fundamental questions I have.\n  Let me talk about some of the loopholes. With regard to the trigger, \nin 1986, amnesty was given. No one disputed it. They said it would be \nthe last amnesty we ever had and that enforcement would occur. Promises \nwere made about enforcement. Those promises for enforcement in the \nfuture were never kept. That was the problem. We had 3 million people \nclaim amnesty in 1986; today we have, they say, 12 million prepared to \nclaim amnesty in the United States today. What happened? The promised \nenforcement did not occur, so more people came illegally.\n  Some will say you cannot really enforce immigration law. Of course \nyou can enforce immigration law; we just have not been willing to do \nthe things necessary to do that. I reject that concept. But this time \nbill supporters are saying if we give amnesty, we are going to try to \nensure the enforcement does occur and we are going to do that by having \na trigger mechanism. This enforcement mechanism will say if you do not \ncomply with the requirements of Border Patrol agents and fencing and \nother matters, if you do not comply with those, Mr. President, the \namnesty does not occur.\n  That idea made some sense. People believed that was a good idea. I \nthink I originally suggested it in committee last year. Senator Isakson \noffered a full amendment on the floor in the last year's debate--that \namendment was defeated, so last year's bill did not include a guarantee \nto have any enforcement first. Why would the trigger fail last year? \nWhy would it fail? Does that suggest some people are not serious about \nenforcement? I think it does.\n  But look at this trigger this year. The guys who were promoting the \nbill last year opposed a trigger, no trigger they said--but this year \nthey say we will accept one, they are telling the American people not \nto worry we are going to have a trigger this bill.\n  I want to briefly mention some things about it. The amnesty benefits \nsimply do not wait, under this trigger, for the enforcement to occur. \nAfter the filing of an application by a person here illegally, under \nthis legislation, and waiting for only 24 hours, illegal aliens will \nimmediately receive probationary benefits. They will be lawfully in the \nUnited States, complete with the ability to legally live and work in \nthe United States, to travel outside the United States and to return, \nand to have their own Social Security card. That is what happens within \n24 hours.\n  Astonishingly, if the trigger requirements are never met--that is \nthese requirements that are supposed to be met first--and green card \napplications or permanent residents' applications are never approved by \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the probationary benefits granted \nto the illegal alien population never expire, the cards issued to the \npopulation are never revoked, and they will be able to stay in the \ncountry indefinitely, forever maybe. After this bill passes, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has 180 days to begin accepting Z visa \namnesty applications. They will accept them for 1 year and can extend \nto accept them for another year and so forth.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to my colleague Senator Bingaman, there is not 30 \nminutes but an hour equally divided. I will be pleased to yield to the \nSenator at this time and thank him for his amendment to contain the \nguest worker--the temporary worker program that was in the bill as \nintroduced earlier, before we recessed. His amendment, as he knows--\nalthough I am not sure a lot of people know--brought the new temporary \nguest worker program from 400,000 a year to 200,000 a year. Some think \nthat is all it is. But if you read the bill carefully, you knew it was \n400,000 for the first year and they got to stay for 2 years; another \n400,000 for the second year with an accelerator clause in it, and for \nboth years a certain number got to bring in family members, so in 2 \nyears there would have been almost a million people in the country \nunder that new temporary worker program--far more than it appeared on \nthe surface. I am glad the amendment of Senator Bingaman was agreed to. \nI think it brought the numbers more in line.\n  I am pleased to yield the floor at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S6975-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6975-S6982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Alabama \nfor his strong words and strong support for the amendments we offered a \nfew weeks ago on the guest worker program. Let me thank my colleague \nfrom Alabama for his support particularly for that amendment 2 weeks \nago.\n  I want to take a few minutes in morning business today, before the \nSenate gets into its busiest period of the week--which we all know \nbegins on Tuesday, usually--to talk about two other amendments I have \nfiled to this bill, and I hope I will have a chance to have the Senate \nvote on before the bill is completed.\n  Let me first talk about one of those amendments that is addressing a \nprovision in the immigration bill that I think is impractical and I \ndon't think makes any sense, the provision I am trying to correct.\n  Before addressing the specific provision, let me once again put this \nin context. This bill, the underlying legislation, calls for three so-\ncalled temporary worker programs. There is an agricultural temporary \nworker program, and I am not suggesting any change to that program. \nThat is part of the underlying bill. There is a seasonal temporary \nworker program, where people can come in for up to 10 months and then \nhave to leave the country for 2 months and then come back the next \nyear. That one I do have a second amendment on, which I want to talk \nabout in a minute. Then there is the new temporary worker program that \nwas the subject of my amendment 2 weeks ago.\n  Let me briefly describe how this third so-called temporary worker \nprogram works. It contemplates a new guest worker program. It says \nguest workers would be permitted to come to this country and work for 2 \nyears. At the end of the 2 years, they have to leave the country for a \nyear. Then that same worker could come back for another 2 years and \nthen leave the country again for another year; then come back and work \n2 more years and then have to leave the country permanently. So over a \nperiod of, I guess it would be 9 years--during that period the worker \ncould be here up to 6 years, but there would have to be two periods of \na year each during which the worker was outside the country.\n  My amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Obama, would remove the \nrequirement that guest workers leave the United States before they \nrenew their visas to work under this program. It would not modify the \ntotal period they could stay here, which would still be limited to 6 \nyears. It would not change the terms of their visa. But the amendment I \nam offering would provide that guest workers would be given a 2-year \nvisa they could then renew twice and do their full 6 years of work and \nthen their visa would no longer permit them to stay.\n  Requiring these workers to leave the country for a lengthy period of \ntime between each 2-year work period is a problem for several reasons. \nIt is bad for the employers, first. It is also bad for American workers \nwho might also want to have some of these jobs--and these are generally \nconstruction type jobs. These are not agricultural jobs. These are not \njobs for teenagers in seasonal employment.\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\n  Obviously, another problem with this provision is it is extremely \ndifficult and costly to enforce. I doubt seriously if we have the \ncapacity to enforce it at this point. It increases dramatically the \nlikelihood that individuals are going to overstay their visas.\n  First, let me talk about the employers. It would be very costly and \nburdensome to require that employers rehire and retrain new workers \nevery 2 years. Employers are not going to give an employee a 1-year \nvacation. When one of these so-called guest workers leaves the job in \norder to comply with this provision of law, the employer will have no \nchoice but to find somebody else to bring on. The 1-year leave \nprovision would be especially harmful to small businesses, and it would \ncause enormous instability in the workforce if they actually depended \nupon guest workers for some of that work.\n  Governor Napolitano from Arizona recently wrote a column in the New \nYork Times. Let me quote a couple of sentences from that column.\n  She says:\n\n       The proposed notion that temporary workers stay here for \n     two years, return home for a year, then repeat that strange \n     cycle two more times makes no sense. No employer can afford \n     this schedule, hiring and training, only to have a worker who \n     soon will leave. It will only encourage employers and workers \n     to find new ways to break the rules.\n\n  Now, that was on June 1 in the New York Times. In my view, Governor \nNapolitano is absolutely correct. The current bill is also bad for \nAmerican workers. American workers will be forced to compete with a \nconstant flow of guest workers who would always be at the low end of \nthe salary scale by virtue of the fact that they would have to leave \nevery 2 years.\n  So if guest workers are kicked out of the country every 2 years, \nwages cannot increase, there will always be a justification to pay \nthose workers the lowest possible wage. The requirement that these \nguest workers leave the country every 2 years would also result in an \nincrease in the number of individuals who overstay their visas in order \nto avoid having to leave the United States for that lengthy period of \ntime. It would also create additional costs in terms of tracking those \nindividuals and ensuring that they, in fact, do leave the country. \nThese costs, of course, would have to be borne by the taxpayer. It also \nassumes that we even have the administrative capacity to track all \nthese people. Here we are talking about at least 1.2 million so-called \nguest workers under only this program. I am not talking about the other \ntwo so-called temporary guest worker programs. But under this so-called \ntemporary guest worker program, we are talking about 1.2 million \nworkers.\n  So we are saying that we would then have administrative \nresponsibilities somewhere lodged in the Federal Government to keep \ntrack of the comings and goings of these workers every year. I have \nreal doubts about our ability to do that. Obviously, that is an \nassumption. It is assumed, as part of the underlying bill, that we do \nhave the ability to do that. So if the program is designed in a manner \nthat is bad for employers, it is bad for employees, it is difficult and \ncostly to implement, it will lead to an increase in the number of \nindividuals who overstay their visas, then obviously the question \narises: What is the justification for keeping this provision in the \nbill?\n  I think, unfortunately, the only justification I have been able to \nfind is that it is being kept in the bill in order to fit this \npolitical mantra that we have been hearing now for months about \n``temporary means temporary,'' rather than to implement any sound \npolicy.\n  When you look at these guest worker programs, unlike the other \nexisting guest worker programs, such as the H-2B seasonal program for \nnonagricultural workers, the H-2A agricultural program, which were \ndesigned to fill jobs that, in fact, are of a temporary nature, the new \nY-1 program, which we are talking about here, is designed to fill jobs \nthroughout the economy that are permanent jobs. These are jobs in the \nconstruction industry, primarily. The 2-1-2 requirement, which is in \nthe underlying bill, artificially tries to turn these workers into \ntemporary workers by kicking them out of the country every 2 years, \neven though they will be filling jobs that are not temporary, they are \npermanent jobs.\n  Last year's immigration bill, S. 2611, allowed new guest workers to \nstay in the United States for a period of 3 years to renew that visa \nfor a total of 6 years. There was no requirement that the individuals \nleave the country before they renewed that visa. I think that type of \nframework is much more sensible.\n  One of the primary goals of comprehensive immigration reform is to \ncreate a new and workable system that would ensure that we are not in \nthe situation we are in now once again 20 years from now. I do not \nbelieve the current framework of this so-called temporary worker \nprogram advances that goal.\n  Let me also take a moment to address concerns that the adoption of \nthis amendment will somehow kill the immigration bill. During debate on \nthe immigration bill, questions keep arising about whether a particular \namendment being offered by one Senator or another is consistent with \nthe so-called ``grand bargain'' that has been reached.\n  I commend the Senators who worked tirelessly to come up with an \nagreement on this difficult issue. This agreement was reached between a \nhandful of Senators. That should not be considered, in my view, a \nsubstitute for deliberation by the full Senate. One of the first \namendments I offered was the one the Senator from Alabama referred to, \nan amendment that reduced the number of guest workers under this \nprogram to 200,000 per year--the number of new guest workers, I should \nsay.\n  Despite the fact that amendment was adopted by or supported by 74 \nSenators, I have heard repeated questions about whether this was a deal \nkiller. It is interesting to me that a measure which garners the \nsupport of three-quarters of the Senate somehow is considered a threat \nto the prospects of passing the legislation. Frankly, I believe we are \nfocused on the wrong set of issues. We ought to be trying to \nconcentrate on getting a bill that has the broadest bipartisan support \nin the Senate. I think that each of those amendments, the one I offered \n2 weeks ago and this amendment I have been talking about, will help us \nto achieve that. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the \nconsequences of leaving the existing procedures in place for Y-1 guest \nworkers.\n  I strongly believe that if we keep this provision in its current \nform, we are going to create an expensive and unworkable program for \nemployers, a system that harms American workers, and an incentive for \nguest workers to overstay their visas. For that reason, I hope, when \nthe opportunity comes for a vote, my colleagues will support our \namendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would then continue to speak as in \nmorning business for another few minutes to talk about another \namendment.\n  I have also today filed an amendment on another part of the bill. The \nsecond amendment is aimed at addressing a different issue related to \nthe Y-2 temporary worker program. Now, the Y-2 program is a temporary \nworker program, and it revises and incorporates the existing H-2B \nseasonal nonagricultural program.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this amendment would address the problem of \npeople whom we bring into the country for up to 10 months, allow them \nto work here, whether they are working at resorts or working at some \nkind of seasonal employment, nonagricultural seasonal employment, and \nthen we require them to go home for 2 months. Then they can do that \neach year.\n\n  As Senators have discussed this program, and as it has been discussed \nin the press, its been stated that the underlying substitute amendment \nprovides for an annual allocation of visas from 100,000 initially to up \nto 200,000 each year, depending upon the market demand.\n  I have a chart I can put up that I think will describe what the Y-2 \nguest worker program--if, in fact, the 15 percent increase is triggered \nin the years, the first 4 years of the program, and how you get from \n100,000 up to 200,000.\n  Well, that is the description. This chart is a fair description of \nthis program as it has been reported in the\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\npaper. However, before the substitute amendment was filed, the \nunderlying bill--I call it a substitute amendment because that is the \ntechnical, correct name for it--a provision was handwritten into the \nbill that provides that in any year from now on, the returning Y-2 \nworkers who are present in the United States in any of the preceding 3 \nfiscal years would not count against the cap.\n  So the whole idea of 200,000 is not right. The yellow represents the \n200,000, the increase from 100,000 to 200,000. But the red on the chart \nrepresents the potential pool of returning workers. You can see this is \ntaken from an analysis that was done for me by the Congressional \nResearch Service. We asked them to please look at the provision and \ngive us their analysis of what is the size of the group that could come \nin under this program with this provision in it.\n  They said: Well, it could be up to about 1.6, 1.7 million people over \n10 years; they would be eligible to come in every year. Now, that is \nnot cumulative, that is every year that many people would be able to \ncome in.\n  The impact of this little-noticed provision is quite profound. \nObviously, this is the high end of the approximation because we would \nnot expect that every single worker who came here to work for 10 months \nduring 1 year, or for some period during 1 year, would choose to come \nback the next year. But I think a reasonably high percentage of them \nmight choose to come back.\n  Today, we have about 135,000. This year, in 2007, we have about \n135,000 workers in the country or connected in this country this year \nunder this seasonal temporary worker program. I have no problem seeing \nthat increased to 200,000. That is what the initial draft of the bill \ncontemplated. I do have a problem when it might increase by well over a \nmillion. I think that is not what many Members of the Senate understand \nis going to happen under this bill. I do not think it is what should \nhappen under this bill. I think it is reasonable to require that the \nnumerical limitation already in the bill actually means something; that \nis, the 200,000 limit.\n  The amendment I am offering does not eliminate the returning worker \nprovisions, not by any means. It says: If you want to change the number \nfrom the current law, which is 66,000 up to 100,000, fine. If you want \nto then say it can grow from 100,000 to 200,000 per year, fine. But \nlet's not also say that anyone who has worked here in any of the 3 \npreceding years can come in on top of that because that is when your \nnumbers get totally out of control.\n  The amendment is aimed at ensuring the bill does what I believe a \nmajority of Senators believe it does; that is, it would allow the \nissuance of up to 200,000 Y-2 visas each year for these seasonal \nworkers. I think that is something which I can support as a matter of \npolicy.\n  Again, my amendment merely brings the underlying language of the bill \ninto line with what I believe most Senators think the bill now \nprovides; that is, keeps it under 200,000.\n  That is a description of the two amendments I have filed today. I \nthink they are both meritorious amendments. I urge my colleagues to \nlook at them, to consider them. I hope very much that I have an \nopportunity to get votes on those amendments this week before we \nconclude action on the bill because I think both amendments would--each \nof the two amendments would improve the bill and make it much better \npublic policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his work on \nthis. It is obvious he has read the legislation and attempted to see \nwhat it actually means, which is a good thing, and done too little in \nthis Senate, but it is important especially in this legislation where \nit is so critical.\n  Let me say what I understood the whole deal was supposed about. It \nwas put very simply to me how we were going to have a new immigration \nsystem, in this new legislation that was going to be better than last \nyear's bill. The way I understood it, from the talking points that were \nsuggested and floated around and that we were briefed with, there would \nbe a temporary worker program that would actually be temporary. To me \nthat means a person would come for less than a year but could come back \nrepeatedly after that, as long as their employer is happy and they have \nwork to come to and they have not gotten in any trouble. And, they \nwould not bring their families with them.\n  That is what I thought we were talking about. Then we were told that \nthere would be a separate second flow for people who enter America \npermanently, coming into America to go on a citizenship track. And we \nwere told that track would be evaluated using a different system, it \nwould be more skill based.\n  In other words, a person would apply, and they would compete for the \nslots based on the skills they had and that we have in the United \nStates. So I am concerned and share the concern of Senator Bingaman \nthat the temporary worker program which allows 2 years' entry, then \nsays go home and come back 1 year from now for another 2 years and then \ngo home for a year, and come back for the final 2 years and never come \nback again seems less workable than the temporary seasonal worker \nprogram we have today. I am concerned about that.\n  Remember, we are still going to have the constant flow of people who \ncome in on the citizenship track and get a green card and become \npermanent citizens. They will also be workers, their family members \nwill also be workers. We are not stopping that. But this bill creates a \nseparate temporary worker program. I believe a system of temporary \nworkers needs to work, needs to make sense, needs to be consistent with \ncommon sense, and ought to be in a way that is practical. I am not sure \nthe legislation as introduced does that.\n  Senator Grassley spoke before we recessed and asked this question: \nWhy is it nobody has said this time, as they did in 1986, that there \nwould be no more amnesties? He said he was here in 1986. He remembered \nwhat they said. It was admitted that they were having amnesty and they \nmade a promise we wouldn't have amnesty anymore. People said: If we do \nit this one time, we won't do it again. He asked why we weren't hearing \nit said again. Of course, he answered his own question. The answer is, \nbecause bill sponsors can not make that promise. How can we say we are \nnot going to have it anymore, after having said we would not do it \nagain, and doing it again, and presumably we would be doing it again \nafter that?\n  I mentioned the enforcement trigger. This was designed to make sure \nif we give amnesty, enforcement would occur. We put some things in the \ntrigger that had to be done before some of the benefits of this program \nwould accrue, but a lot of things were left out, and the things left \nout were quite troubling. They make you wonder how serious we are about \ncreating a lawful system in the future, for example. The enforcement \ntrigger that has the requirements that must be met before the new \ntemporary worker program begins does not require the exit portion of \nthe US-VISIT system, that is the biometric border check-in, checkout \nsystem first required by the Congress in 1996, be working. That is a \ncause for concern because it is already well past the year 2005, when \nthis bill required that the U.S. visa exit system be in effect.\n  In other words, in 1996, we said: OK, we are passing a law, and we \nare going to have an exit-entry visa system at the border that will \nclock you in when you come in with a biometric card, and it will clock \nyou out when you go out, just as you do when you are working at a job. \nJust like a lot of employment agencies and businesses have those kind \nof things. OK? It was due to be completed in 2005. Without the U.S. \nvisa exit portion, the United States has no method to ensure that the \nworkers or their visiting families, who are allowed under certain \ncircumstances to visit them, do not overstay their visas.\n  Senator Bingaman has been talking about his concern over the \ntemporary worker program. Let me ask this: How do we know they are \ngoing to go home when their time is expired if the exit portion of the \nUS-VISIT system is not up and working? We don't know. It is a \nfundamental loophole of monumental proportions, and I am surprised it \nis not in there. Once again, it suggests those promoting this \nlegislation may not be serious about creating an immigration system \nthat works. They may\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\nlike a system that allows virtually anyone determined to come here to \ncome here.\n  There is another matter I wanted to mention in the trigger \nrequirement. If it is not in the trigger, there is no way to say the \nbills sponsor really intend for it to happen. The example of the U.S. \nVISIT system indicates something about the nature of the Senate. \nRemember, in 1996, this Senate passed legislation that required the US-\nVISIT exit system be in effect by 2005. Then 2005 came and went. That \ndid not occur. What does that mean? It means you can pass any law here \nand say you are going to do something in the future, but if you don't \nfund it or future Congresses don't fund it or future Presidents don't \nfight for it, it may not ever occur. That is all I am saying. That is \nwhy the American people need to be concerned about amnesty coming \nbefore all of the needed enforcement items.\n  Another matter that involves what we are doing here involves having \nenough bedspace to end catch and release at the border. We passed a law \nin 2004 that requires 43,000 beds to be in place by the end of 2007. \nThis is to end the catch-and-release section of the bill. Those beds \nhave not been completed. In this legislation, it only required 27,000 \nbeds. We had already required 43,000, but as I said, we are going to \nhave to have 27,500. Then Senator Gregg offered an amendment to \nincrease that to 31,500. We passed legislation in 2004, as part of the \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004, to require much more bed space than \nthis, and they have not been completed. Because we pass legislation \ndoesn't mean it is going to happen.\n  There is another loophole I will mention. I have 25. I should have \nadded the problem Senator Bingaman just mentioned. I could have added \nmany more than 25. Let's look at No. 4. Aliens who broke into this \ncountry a mere 5 months ago are provided permanent legal status in our \ncountry and are treated better than foreign nationals who legally \napplied to come to the United States more than 2 years ago. Aliens who \ncan prove they were here illegally in the United States on January 1 of \nthis year are immediately eligible to apply from inside the United \nStates for amnesty benefits, while foreign nationals who \nfiled applications to come to the United States after May 1 of 2005, \nover 2 years ago, must start the application process all over again \nfrom their home countries.\n\n  The bill sponsors continue to claim this bill is necessary because \nillegal aliens have deep roots in the United States and are, therefore, \nimpossible to remove. They claim that they have families here. They \nhave been working here for many years. They can't be asked to leave. \nThere is some truth in some of those situations, for sure, but it \nsimply is not true in all cases. It is simply not true in many cases. \nThe young man who ran past the National Guard out at the border \nsomewhere last December is going to be given amnesty here in this \ncountry.\n  The American people want us to treat the illegal alien population \ncompassionately, I do believe, but there is no reason to lump all \nillegal aliens, regardless of when and how they got here or how deep \ntheir roots are, into the same amnesty program. Last year's Senate bill \nwould have given illegal aliens amnesty if they could prove they had \nbeen in the United States since January 7, 2004. A lot of people want \nus to believe that this is a tougher bill than last year's bill. At \nleast last year they said you had to have been in the country by \nJanuary 7, 2004. This year the bill expanded the amnesty window by 3 \nyears to 2007. Under this year's bill, illegal aliens who have rushed \nacross the border in the last few years, including those who came 5 \nmonths ago, will be given all the amnesty benefits as those who have \nbeen living here for decades, have U.S. citizens in schools, and have \nbeen good workers.\n  The January 7, 2004 date, why was that date selected last year as a \ncutoff date? It was important because that was when President Bush \nfirst gave his speech saying we needed a lawful system of comprehensive \nreform of immigration in America. We knew that when he gave that \nspeech--and he was talking about amnesty for people here illegally--\nthat that would encourage more people to try to come into the country \nso they could be provided amnesty too. So they cut off the dates and \nsaid: If you came in after the President's speech, you can't get the \nadvantage of the amnesty. That makes sense, I think.\n  Then even more significantly, last year, in May 2006, President Bush \nannounced the beginning of Operation Jump Start. Do you remember that? \nThat was the program to put the National Guard at the border. He called \nout the National Guard. So this bill says if you ignored our \nannouncement that we are going to make a lawful system of comprehensive \nreform, if you ignored the announcement that the border is closed, if \nyou ignored and ran past the National Guard we put on the border to \ncreate a lawful system there, as long as you got here by December 31 of \nlast year, you get to apply for full amnesty. You are home free. You \nare in.\n  I don't think that is required. I don't think that is good policy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the minority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The bill's drafters say amnesty applicants will be at \nthe back of the line and will not be treated preferentially to those \nwho have followed the law. That is not true in a number of cases and in \nthis case. The bill allows the illegal aliens who got here 5 months ago \nto cut in line in front of people in the family green card backlog who \nfiled their applications after May 1, 2005, 2 years after. Illegal \naliens who came to the United States 5 months ago will get probationary \nZ visa status 1 day after filing a Z visa application. I suppose those \nwho followed the law, who made their application properly, who waited \nin line may wonder why they didn't come illegally also. Isn't that the \nmessage we are sending? So this provision in the bill does not restore \nrespect for the rule of law. It erodes it. At a minimum, no illegal \nalien should be treated better than a foreign national who applied to \ncome legally. The amnesty date should be moved back to May 1, 2005. I \nwill have an amendment to that effect.\n  I see my colleague here, Senator Dorgan. I appreciate his insight \ninto these issues and his willingness to ask some tough questions about \nthe system and the bill before us and to point out some of the \nweaknesses in it. That has been helpful to the debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak in morning business for such time as I may consume, and to the \nextent that exceeds the limit of the majority in morning business, I \nwould ask that the minority be accorded the same amount of time if they \nso desire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not sure I quite understand that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much morning business remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized in morning business \nfor as much time as I may consume. My understanding is we will be going \nto the bill as soon as I finish speaking.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wondered if the Senator was going to continue and how \nlong he might speak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is my intention to speak for perhaps 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have no objection, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this issue of immigration is a very \npassionate issue and raises the passions in this country in a \nsignificant way. I understand all of that. I have described often on \nthe floor of the Senate the circumstances of what has brought us to \nthis point.\n  This country we live in is a remarkable country. If you have a globe \nin front of you, and spin the globe, and take a look at all the land \nthat exists on your globe, you will see there is just one little spot \ncalled the United States of America, but it is a very different spot \nthan much of the rest of the world.\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\n  We have raised incomes in this country, expanded the middle class, \ncreated a standard and a scale of living that is pretty unusual and \npretty remarkable. Because of that, because we have dramatically \nexpanded the middle class and have created a country that is very \ndifferent than many other countries on this Earth, there are many who \nlive on this planet who want to come here.\n  Last week, I described being in a helicopter, flying between Honduras \nand Nicaragua, up in the mountainous jungle areas some long while ago, \nand we ran out of gas. I discovered on a helicopter when you run out of \ngas, you are going to be landing very soon. We were not hurt, of \ncourse, but the red lights and the alarm bells were ringing and going \noff, and our pilots put us down in a clearing.\n  While we were there, I heard from some campesinos who came up to see \nwho had landed in these helicopters. Through an interpreter, I visited \nwith the campesinos. I heard from them what I have heard in virtually \nevery part of the world in which I have traveled. I spoke with a young \nwoman in her early twenties. She had three children with her. I asked \nher--after we visited--through an interpreter: What do you want for you \nand your children?\n  She said: Oh, I want to come to the United States of America.\n  That is not unusual. I have heard that all over the world: I want to \ncome to the United States of America. I asked her why.\n  She said: Well, there is opportunity there--an opportunity for a \nbetter life for me and my children.\n  We have built something quite unusual in this country, and many from \naround this planet would like to come here. I understand that. Let me \ngive you an example of why.\n  If you live in China, the average hourly wage for factory workers is \n33 cents an hour. If you are in Bangladesh, 33 cents an hour is the \naverage annual hourly wage, if you can find a factory job. If you are \nin Nicaragua, 37 cents an hour is the average annual hourly wage. In \nIndia, 11 cents an hour is the average wage. In Haiti, it is 30 cents \nan hour, if you can find a job. In Russia, it is 51 cents an hour. I \ncould go on.\n  But my point is, there are people living in countries where, if they \ncan find a job, they are going to be paid 30 cents an hour, 20 cents an \nhour, 11 cents an hour, and they take a look at this country, and they \nevaluate: Perhaps I need to go to the United States and be a part of \nthat great country.\n  Well, because so many want to come here, we have immigration laws and \nquotas. We actually allow into this country, under legal quotas, a good \nmany immigrants every single year. Well over 1 million people come into \nthis country every single year legally as part of our immigration quota \nsystem. We have quotas for various countries and regions of the world, \nand we accept legal immigration from those countries. We would have had \nlast year over 2 million people come into this country legally, with \nboth agricultural workers and also under the legal immigration system.\n  But think for a moment if we decided to do it differently, after what \nwe have spent well over the last century building in this country to \nexpand opportunity, expand the middle class, and create an economy that \nis the wonder of the world--the real economic engine of the world is \nthis economic engine of ours. Think of the consequences if, in fact, we \nsaid this: We have a new policy on immigration. Our policy is that \nanybody in this world who wants to come here--to stay here, to live \nhere, to work here, to be part of the American experience--come right \nahead, with no restrictions. Come into this country and be a part of \nour great Nation.\n  If we said that, if, in fact, that were our country's policy, we \nwould be literally overrun by those who wish to come to be a part of \nthis American experience--an America with opportunity, an America that \noffers hope to people living in squalid poverty, people working for 11 \ncents an hour. We would be overrun. As a result, what we do have is a \nseries of immigration laws that provide for legal immigration. It \nrestricts numbers who come in, but we still have a pretty substantial \nnumber who come in legally into this country.\n  Now, we are told we have a new immigration proposal put together by a \ngroup of Senators in the Senate with, I understand, the assistance of \nthe White House--or at least the involvement of the White House--and \nbrought to the floor of the Senate saying: Here is a new plan. It is 20 \nyears after the last plan, which was in 1986. It was called Simpson-\nMazzoli. It was the immigration plan of 1986. That was a plan that, \nback then, promised it would end the problem of illegal immigration by \nchoking off the demand for illegal labor through tough enforcement and \nguest worker programs and also through amnesty of people who were then \nin the country at that point in time.\n  Let me read some quotes for what was done in 1986. Here are quotes in \nthe Congressional Record. Quote:\n\n       The guts of immigration reform are here. All of it. \n     Employer sanctions, increased enforcement, worker \n     authorization system, verification systems, and legalization \n     is [all] there. . . .\n\n  That is what was promised 20 years ago. One Senator said:\n\n       This bill also . . . should help the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service to increase Border Patrol personnel by \n     50 percent.\n\n  Border enforcement, employer sanctions--well, they said: We are going \nto ramp up border security, provide employer sanctions, so you don't \nhave the lure of a job and, therefore, we, at the same time, will \nprovide amnesty--this is 1986--to about 1 million illegal immigrants. \nWhen amnesty was in fact granted following that, it turns out there \nwere 3 million or so. Everyone was pretty stunned to learn there was so \nlittle control over the borders then. But now, today--fast-forward 20 \nyears--we have a bill on the floor of the Senate that promises almost \nexactly the same thing: tougher border enforcement, employer sanctions, \nguest workers, temporary workers--except now, 20 years later, after we \nsolved the problem 20 years ago, we have 12 million--it is estimated 12 \nmillion--people who came here without legal authorization. We do not \nknow that for sure. We think it is somewhere around 12 million people. \nSo we have ``comprehensive immigration reform.''\n\n  Well, let me go back for a moment and show you that this issue of \nborder enforcement and employer sanctions is all a matter of \nenforcement and will. I have just taken the period from 1999 to 2004. \nThe current administration, as you can see, has had almost no worksite \nenforcement. In fact, in 2004 there were three cases in the entire \nNation brought against employers who hired illegal aliens. Think of \nthat. In the year 2000 there were 213 cases out of all of this country; \nout of the millions and millions of employers in this country, there \nwere 213 cases. In 2004, it dropped to three, which meant there was no \nenforcement at all--no will, no interest, nothing.\n  Is it surprising, then, that the employers in this country would \ndecide: Why don't I just risk it, just hire illegal aliens because \nnobody is checking?\n  Here on this chart are the fines that have been levied with respect \nto employer sanctions. As you can see, $118,000 for the entire country. \nYou can see what has happened under this administration. They \napparently decided: We are not going to enforce this at all. The result \nis a dramatic increase across the border of illegal immigrants.\n  Now, I know some do not like the term, and I do not mean the term as \na pejorative term, but it is what it is. We have immigrants who come \ninto this country--some legally and some illegally. That is just a \nfact. So there has been virtually no enforcement by this administration \nor really any administration, although the previous administration did \nmuch better.\n  But now we are told this new plan has an ability to solve this \nproblem. We are going to have employer sanctions, we are going to have \nborder enforcement--sound familiar? Yes, it was 20 years ago that was \npromised--and we are going to have temporary workers. They now call \nthem guest workers, but they are temporary workers.\n  Last week I was interested that some of my colleagues, when they \ndefeated an amendment I had by a one-vote margin--an amendment I had \nthat would deal with the temporary worker issue. First, I wanted to \nabolish it. That lost by a broader margin. Then I wanted to at least \nsubset it, and that lost by one vote. Incidentally, there was a lot of \narm twisting to get that\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\nvote. I have not seen any casts or anything on arms, but I know there \nwas a lot of arm twisting.\n  We were told during the debate on the guest worker provision the \nfollowing: The manager of the bill and the manager on the minority side \nsaid the same thing. They said: Look, if you do not have a temporary \nworker provision to allow those who are not now in this country--even \nas we legalize 12 million who are here with a work permit immediately--\nif you do not allow millions more to come in--600,000 a year; now \n200,000 a year--if you do not allow additional people to come into this \ncountry, they will come anyway. They will come as illegals across the \nborder.\n  So I asked the question: Wait a second. You are saying we have to \nhave a temporary worker program to bring people into this country who \nare not now here and declare them legal to take American jobs because \nif we don't have a temporary worker program, they will come anyway? I \nthought you said you had border enforcement. What you appear to be \nsaying is, you do not have border enforcement, so for those who would \ncome illegally, let's just see if we can label them as legal under \ntemporary workers.\n  You cannot have it both ways. There either is border enforcement or \nthere is not. You cannot say to me we must put in a temporary worker \nprogram because if it is not there we will have illegal immigration, \nand then in the next breath--while thumbing your suspenders--say, and \nby the way, we really have effective border control. If you have \neffective border control, why then would you have illegal immigration \nthat necessitates you to say there are millions who live outside this \ncountry who now must be allowed in? That is on top of the 12 million \npeople who, under this underlying bill, will be declared legal, to have \nlegal status.\n  Anyone who came across by December 31 of last year--across an ocean \nor across a river or across any border--anyone who entered this country \nby December 31 of last year would be told: You now have legal status in \nthis country and will be able to work.\n  My colleague, a while ago, asked a very important question: What \nabout the people in other parts of the world who thought this was all \non the level and there was an immigration system and they applied \nthrough the quota system and have waited now 8 years to see if they \nwould be allowed to come to this country and they are near the top of \nthe list, but now they discover something that makes them feel as if \nthey made a big mistake? What they discovered is, while they waited all \nof those years to get toward the top of the list under the legal \nimmigration system we have, with the quotas we have, they should have \nsnuck across the border on December 31 because those who did will have \nbeen declared, by this piece of legislation, as legal. And those who \nwent through the process and have waited years--7 years, 8 years--and \nare near the top of the list are told: You are just out of luck.\n  That does not make any sense to me. It just does not make any sense. \nLet me describe some quotes from the week before last.\n\n     . . . this legislation has tough border security and tough \n     interior enforcement provisions.\n       Even if you have a secure border--we are hopeful of having \n     secure borders--it won't stop illegal immigration.\n\n  That is from a Senator on the floor of the Senate 2 weeks ago in \nsupport of this bill.\n\n       The fact of the matter is, some workers will come here \n     illegally, or legally, one way or the other they come in.\n       That is where the temporary worker program comes in . . . \n     if we eliminate this program, you will have those individuals \n     that will crawl across the desert . . . or you can say, come \n     through the front door and you will be given the opportunity \n     to work. . . .\n\n  That is unbelievable. This is from the architects of the proposal \nbefore the Senate who come here boasting it has real security on \nAmerica's borders, and then say: By the way, if we do not allow--in \naddition to legalizing 12 million people who came here illegally--a \nsubstantial additional number of people who do not now live here to \ncome and take American jobs, they will come anyway because they will \ncome as illegal immigrants--which suggests to me, at least, there is \nnot meaningful border protection or border security in this \nlegislation.\n  Let me describe for a moment the guest worker provision. These are \ntemporary workers--I do not know why you call them guests--but these \nare temporary workers who would come in and take jobs at the low end of \nthe economic scale and, by and large, put downward pressure on income \nfor American workers. But here is how it would work.\n  It seems to me, you could not sit down and think of what kind of an \napproach we could use to put together a guest worker provision and come \nup with this sort of Rube Goldberg scheme. There is just no way you \ncould possibly put this together and believe it to be serious. Here is \nwhat they say. In the case of the original proposal, which was 600,000 \na year, and now it is going to be 200,000 a year, it will amount to 1.2 \nmillion over the first 10 years, and here is what they say: You can \ncome for the first 2 years; you can bring your family if you come for \nthe first 2 years. Then you have to go home for a year and take your \nfamily with you, then come back for 2 more years. Then you leave again. \nIf you never brought your family to begin with, you can then come back \nfor 2 more years. So you can be here for a total of 6 years and you can \nonly have your family here for 2 years and you all have to leave this \ncountry twice. That is unbelievable. Who on Earth can sit in a room and \nconstruct that sort of nonsense?\n\n  Aside from the fact that we shouldn't have that provision in the \nbill, we are told, this is the way it will work. How many believe you \nwill have 1,200,000 people come for 2 years, with their families, if \nthey wish, and then all of them will go home? Let's assume they all \nwent home, they get to go home for a year and come back for 2 years and \nthen again go home for a year and then come back for 2 years, how many \nof you believe they are all going to leave? They are not.\n  Let me emphasize that the guest worker program has nothing to do with \nagricultural work. These are nonagricultural workers. These will be in \nmanufacturing and in other areas.\n  Also, the guest worker program applies in sectors of our economy \nwhere the vast majority of the jobs are done by U.S. citizens. That is \na fact. They say this is necessary because you can't find U.S. workers \nto take these jobs. That is not the case. These jobs are not picking \nstrawberries. Those jobs are in the agricultural worker provisions. But \nthese temporary workers are in construction, manufacturing, \ntransportation, all of which have a wide majority of U.S. workers--80, \n90 percent of the workers are U.S. workers. So don't tell me you can't \nfind U.S. workers to fill these jobs. In all of these cases--\nconstruction, transportation, manufacturing--80 to 90 percent of them \nare already U.S. workers.\n  What does immigration do to American workers? One of the points I \nhave made is this is a way of putting downward pressure on wages in our \ncountry. This is from Professor George Borjas, John F. Kennedy School \nof Government at Harvard. He says, on average, the impact of 1980 \nthrough 2000 immigration on U.S. wages, on average, it has reduced \nwages by about 3.7 percent. I don't think there is much question that \nif you bring in a lot of people through the back door to compete for \nlow-wage jobs, you are going to put downward pressure on wages. That is \na fact.\n  Here is an example of my concern and one of the things that persuades \nme we ought to do better. Hurricane Katrina hit on the gulf coast and \nwe had a lot of cleanup to do. When Hurricane Katrina devastated that \ngulf coast, FEMA and others began to let contracts to try to see how we \ncould create this cleanup, and here is what happened October 22, 2005: \nSam Smith was an electrician. He lost his house. He lost a lot during \nthe hurricane. His house was in the ninth ward. It was destroyed by \nHurricane Katrina. He was an electrician, age 55, who returned to the \ncity for the cleanup, the promise of a $22-an-hour wage, and guaranteed \nwork for 1 year, a qualified electrician. He lost his job within 3 \nweeks--within 3 weeks. Let me show you why these folks--Sam Smith lost \nhis house, lost his job, and here is who the subcontractor brings in. \nTake a look at the barracks: Illegal workers brought in living in these \nsqualid conditions. Can you get them to work for less? Sure, you can. \nIs it the right thing to do? No,\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\nof course, it is not because an American worker who lost his house and \nthen lost his job--Sam Smith--deserves better. But that is a small \nexample of what we face with respect to the downward pressure on income \nfor those who work at the bottom of the economic ladder.\n  Now, the Wall Street Journal ran a very interesting story in January \nof this year. It showed that in an area where there is a sudden drop in \nthe availability of illegal immigrants, the wages for U.S. workers then \nrise. There was a series of raids by Federal immigration agents in \nStillmore, GA, and this is again quoting from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       A local poultry processing company called Crider Inc. lost \n     75 percent of its 900 member work force when they were found \n     to be illegal aliens--\n\n  Illegal workers. The company apparently, according to the story, had \na pretty good idea that a good number of its workers had been illegal.\n\n       One worker--\n\n  It says in the story--\n\n     arrived at the plant in 2004. As she filled out an \n     application, she tried to use the Social Security number, a \n     tax payer identification number that started with the numeral \n     9. The company clerk stopped her and said valid Social \n     Security numbers never begin with a 9.\n\n  The clerk kept saying: Maybe you want to put down a 4 or a 6. So the \nillegal immigrant wrote down a 6, and of course the application was \naccepted.\n  After the raid, almost 75 percent of the workers were determined to \nhave been illegal immigrants and the company decided it needed to find \nworkers, so they decided to raise wages. An advertisement in the weekly \nnewspaper titled ``Increased Wages'' at Crider, starting at $7 to $9 an \nhour. That was more than a dollar an hour above what the company had \npaid many immigrant workers. It began offering free transportation from \nnearby towns, free rooms in company-owned dormitories near the plant, \nand for the first time in years, the company aggressively sought \nworkers from the area State-funded employment office, which is a key \navenue for low-skilled workers to find jobs.\n  Continuing again to describe the Wall Street Journal article, it \nsaid: Hundreds of local workers, many of them minorities, accepted the \nhigher wages and were happy to take these jobs. Pretty soon this \nGeorgia company was apparently hiring back some additional illegal \nimmigrant workers who had been previously caught up in the raid. They \nturned to a ``temporary labor provider'' who began to provide the \ncompany with the same illegal immigrant workers who had been caught in \nthe first raid. So the immigration officials conducted a second raid \nand the company then finally agreed to stop working with temporary \nlabor.\n\n  The point of this story is very simple: If you have substantial \namounts of illegal immigrant labor coming in, it puts downward pressure \non wages. Eliminate that illegal labor from the marketplace, and what \nhappens is you raise wages at the bottom of the economic ladder.\n  Robert Samuelson wrote an editorial in the Washington Post some while \nago. He said: It is simply a myth that the U.S. economy needs more poor \nimmigrants. He pointed out that in March the unemployment rate for \ncollege graduates in this country was 1.8 percent. The unemployment \nrate for the 13 million U.S. workers without a high school diploma is \nover 7 percent. Those 13 million U.S. workers without a high school \ndiploma compete directly with the immigrant workers who come here \nillegally and who do not have a high school diploma. That is what puts \ndownward pressure on wages in this country.\n  This is, as I indicated earlier, a very difficult issue, filled with \npassion, and I understand that. I think there are a lot of immigrant \nfamilies living in this country, perhaps many who came here without \nlegal authorization, and many came here 5 years ago, 10, 15 years ago, \n20 years ago. They have lived model lives. They have gone to school \nhere. They have gotten jobs. I understand all that. I think we should \ndeal with that in a sensitive way. There are many who should not be \nexpelled from this country. We are not going to round up 12 million \npeople and deport them. We are not going to do that. So we need to find \na way to deal appropriately with these issues. But that appropriate way \ndoes not say anyone who came across illegally into this country on \nDecember 31 of last year is deemed to have come here legally. That is \nnot the right approach. You can't do that.\n  Second, you should not be oblivious to the needs in this country of \nthe low-income workers. We have a whole lot of people today who got up \nthis morning who are going to work hard all day long and come home with \nvery little to show for it, in many cases two and three jobs. You know \nthe people. They are the ones who know about being second. The people \nwho know about secondhand, second mortgage, second job, second shift. \nThey are always in second place. They are the ones who have the least \nopportunity in this country to get a decent wage because their \nproductivity goes up and their wage does not. As long as there are \nemployers who are able to bring in across the border--a border that \nleaks like a sieve when it comes to illegal immigrants--as long as \nthere are employers who are willing to put downward pressure on income \nfor American workers, we are going to see people at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder in this country continuing to struggle. That is a fact.\n  The question is: Are we going to do something about it? When we deal \nwith immigration, we ought to do 2 things. First and foremost, we ought \nto have a bill on the floor of the Senate that deals with border \nsecurity. You can't deal with this issue without stopping illegal \nimmigration. After all, we allow nearly a couple million people in this \ncountry every single year under a legal system. But if you don't stop \nat the border this unbelievable avalanche of illegal immigrants, you \ndon't have any hope of dealing with this issue. First and foremost, you \nhave to deal with border security. That ought to be the bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. Then, after we have dealt with border security, we \nought to deal with the question of the 12 million people who are here \nwithout legal authorization. I would be the first to join those who say \nlet's be sensitive and let's be thoughtful about that. We are not going \nto round up 12 million people. There are some who have been here a long \nwhile and raised families here who have contributed to this country and \nwe need to understand that. That is a different issue than the issue of \nborder security. If we don't do border security and do it right, this \nis another way to say: Let's provide amnesty this time for 12 million \npeople; we did it for 3 million people 12 years ago. By the way, let's \nmeet again. In fact, let's set a date right now. We will meet again in \n10 years, if, in fact, those who wrote this bill were telling me what \nthey believe 2 weeks ago and that is if you don't have a temporary \nworker program, you are going to have people come here illegally \nanyway. What that means is they don't have real border security or the \nleast bit of confidence in the border security and their bill. That is \na fact.\n  There is a generous amount of discussion on the floor of this Senate \nabout issues that are completely devoid of the well-being and the best \ninterests of people in this country who work very hard and show very \nlittle for it. I would love to see a long discussion on the floor of \nthis Senate about international trade and the $830 billion trade \ndeficit, and American companies being given a tax break by this \nCongress and previous Congresses, American companies who shut their \nmanufacturing plant, fire all their workers, and ship their jobs to \nChinese or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or Indonesia. They actually get a \ntax break for doing it. I have tried four times to shut it down. I have \nbeen unsuccessful. I would love to have a debate about that. In fact, \nit is the same coin, just the reverse side. Shipping American jobs \noverseas is the reverse side of the coin of bringing cheap labor \nthrough the back door. That is a fact.\n  I understand where the impulse comes from. It comes from many large \nenterprises, many big businesses who have convinced this Congress--or \ntoo many in this Congress--that you can't fill jobs with Americans, you \nhave to bring in people from across the border or from around the \nworld. There aren't enough Americans to assume these jobs.\n  I don't believe that. I believe as long as you keep a constant supply \nof cheap labor coming into this country, you keep downward pressure on \nwages, and the person across the convenience store counter, the person \nwho made the bed\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nin your hotel room where you stayed last night, the person who works in \nall of those jobs at the lower end of the economic ladder, they will \nnever, ever see a better income.\n  It took us nearly 10 years to pass an increase in the minimum wage in \nthis Congress. One of the reasons for that is the same influence in \nthis Chamber that exists in support of this bill. The biggest \nbusinesses in this country didn't want an increase in the minimum wage \nand they blocked it for nearly 10 years. The biggest interests in this \ncountry that want to shift jobs overseas, want to continue to bring \ncheap labor through the back door, and that is the genesis of this kind \nof legislation.\n  I am not averse to resolving the status of the 12 million who are \nhere without legal authorization, but I wouldn't do it this way. I \ncertainly wouldn't point to December 31 and say: By the way, if you got \nhere last December 31, good for you, we declare you to be legal. That \nis a thoughtless approach, not a thoughtful approach, to dealing with \nthese issues.\n  Mr. President, one final point: It is the case that I come to the \nfloor of the Senate on this issue concerned about a lot of people in \nthis country who work hard and get little for it. We have seen a \ndramatic increase in the largesse of this country going to the top 1 \npercent of the income in this country--the top 1 percent, I should say, \nof the people who earn income in this country have seen dramatic \nincreases in their income. Yet the bottom 20, bottom 40 percent, in \nmany cases, have seen that they have not been able to increase their \nincome at all.\n  I think an aggressive debate about how we improve the lot of all \nAmericans would be helpful. But we don't improve the lot of Americans \nwho have done the work they wanted to do, to go find a job and get \neducated, we don't do their bidding and help them by deciding we are \ngoing to keep downward pressure on their wages. This is exactly the \nwrong approach.\n  I know the Chair and the ranking member are here. They wish to get to \nthe bill. I know there will be many amendments this week. Let me say \nthis. I would be very interested in voting for a piece of legislation \nthat I thought was on the level, that will provide real border \nsecurity. That is the first and most important need in dealing with \nimmigration. But 2 weeks ago, the very people who wrote this bill said \nif we don't have temporary workers coming in under the temporary worker \nprogram, they will come in illegally anyway.\n  I think that unmasks the fallacy of this bill. There is not border \nprotection here that will work. There has not been a will to enforce it \nin the past. This legislation will continue to put downward pressure on \nthe income for American workers. That is exactly the wrong thing for us \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S6982-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6982-S6994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin).

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Colorado is here. He and I \nare in the unenviable position on a Monday evening of managing this \nbill for a little while. Senator Salazar will speak on behalf of the \nmajority. I do think it is the majority's desire that no amendments be \nlaid down this evening. We would like to get Members to come to the \nfloor first thing tomorrow morning to begin laying down amendments, and \nwe will work out an order for the amendments, voice votes and rollcall \nvotes, and advise Members of when those will occur tomorrow. We hope to \ndo that later this evening.\n  We wish to encourage our colleagues to bring their amendments to the \nfloor and get them pending after this evening, so that we can work as \nmuch as possible this week in getting the bill concluded.\n  I have several things I would like to say in response to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Let me yield at this point to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, as we resume the immigration reform \ndebate in the Senate this week, I am mindful of the fact that we have \nindeed come a very long way and that this Senate has spent a \nsignificant amount of time dealing with the issue of immigration. Last \nyear, we were on the issue of immigration for over a month. This year, \nthrough the dialog and discussion of immigration, we have been working \non this for the last several months. We were on the bill through last \nweek and will continue to work on it this week. Hopefully, at the end \nof the week, we will be able to act on comprehensive immigration reform \nfor our country.\n  As I have often said, from my point of view, this is an issue of \nnational security. It would be an abdication on the part of the Senate \nin Washington today if we were not able to move forward with \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Since in the days after 9/11, it has \nbecome clearer and clearer to us that we need to secure the borders. \nOur legislation does, in fact, secure the borders.\n  Secondly, the legislation makes sure that we move forward to enforce \nthe laws of America. The legislation we have proposed is a tough law-\nand-order piece of legislation that will make sure we have the \nresources, that the United States doesn't look away from the \nenforcement of our laws, and that we enforce them.\n  Third, our legislation also deals with the economic realities that \nare so much of the immigration debate, the components of the economic \nrealities relating to the guest worker program, as well as the \nagricultural job workers,\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\nas well as other provisions of the bill that speak to the economic \nrealities our country faces. I hope we will be able to move forward to \nthe conclusion of this legislation this week.\n  I note there was progress made on the legislation during the last \nweek. We disposed of 13 of the 107 amendments that were filed. Seven of \nthem were disposed of by rollcall vote and six by voice votes with \nunanimous consent. At this point, we have 14 amendments that are \npending and that we will vote on. Some of them we hope to begin voting \non tomorrow morning and work our way through some of the more difficult \namendments in the afternoon.\n  Let me also say at this point that as the President of the United \nStates has spoken out around the country on the issue of immigration \nreform, he has taken a lot of heat for his position. A lot of people, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, have taken a lot of heat on what we are \ntrying to do with immigration reform. I think it is a responsibility of \nthe Members of the Senate, the Members of the House of Representatives, \nand the President to do what is right for the country. There are some \nwho, frankly, will argue that we ought not to do anything, that the \nanswer to dealing with immigration reform is simply to not do anything \nfor a year, 2, 3 or 4 years and to do what they call an enforcement-\nonly approach. We know, from a realistic point of view, that will not \nwork; we will not be able to secure our borders or to enforce our laws \nwithin our country, and we would not be able to deal with the reality \nof the 12 million undocumented workers who toil in America today.\n  So the comprehensive, bipartisan approach we have brought forward for \nconsideration by the Senate is our best attempt at coming up with \nsomething that makes sense for comprehensive immigration legal reform \nin our country. I appreciate Senator Kyl and his leadership, the \nleadership of many on the Republican side of the aisle as well as those \non the Democratic side, who have said we are going to get the solution.\n  For those who say there is no solution to this issue or that we can \nwait 4 years to resolve it, they are wrong. We have it within our \ncapacity and within the courage of the Members of this Chamber to get \nto a good conclusion on immigration for the United States.\n  I yield the floor for my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Colorado, who \nfrequently during the very difficult negotiations over the last several \nmonths was able, because of his legal skills and sunny personality, to \nbring contending factions together. I could not agree with him more \nthat, as responsible public servants, we cannot allow this problem to \ncontinue to fester. Surely, working together in a bipartisan way, \ncommitted to fairness, justice, and a solution, we can come up with a \nresolution of the problem that will work, as well as anything might \nwork.\n  Our colleague from North Dakota said a moment ago that he disagreed \nwith this bill and that we need to find a way, and he described pretty \nmuch what we are trying to find a way to do. He is right. Well, we have \ntried to find a way. It is just that not everybody agrees with exactly \nwhat we have come up with. One of the reasons for that is that if you \nare not part of the process of trying to reach a bipartisan consensus, \nyou may have the idea you can get most of what you want without \nconceding anything to people who have a different point of view. The \nreality is that this is one of the most contentious, complex, emotional \nissues of our time, and no one is going to get 100 percent of what they \nthink is the right solution. We are alleging we have to recognize that \nthere are other points of view and that in order for us to be able to \npolitically reach a decision, we might have to be supporting something \nthat none of us like 100 percent, and that is certainly the case with \nme.\n  I wish to explain this evening a couple of things that came from my \ndiscussions with constituents during the time of the Memorial Day \nrecess and why I agree with the Senator from Colorado that this is the \ntime to try to tackle this very tough issue. I was asked by a reporter \nwhy I was doing this, especially since I voted against the bill last \nyear. The answer is that last year I didn't have an opportunity to \nparticipate in the construction of the legislation the Senate voted on. \nBy the time it came to the Senate floor, the die was essentially cast. \nWe had several amendments we offered; some were accepted and some were \ndefeated. It was not possible at that point to substantially change the \nlegislation. I thought it was a bad bill and I voted against it.\n  It is also true that the situation in the United States, and in my \nState in particular, is getting worse every day. If you represent a \nState such as Arizona, on the border with Mexico, you simply cannot \ncontinue to ignore the problem, hoping it will go away or some magical \nsolution will be developed that everyone can support. You realize you \nare going to have to get in there, fight like heck to do the best you \ncan, and get the problems resolved, even though the solution is not \ngoing to be perfect from anyone's perspective.\n  Here is what is happening every day: Thousands and thousands more \nillegal immigrants are pouring across the border. We wish to stop that. \nWe have crime and violence increasing at an unprecedented rate, much of \nit due to illegal immigration. The drug smugglers are using the illegal \nimmigrants as decoys to try to get the agents to chase the illegal \nimmigrants so they can bring the drugs across. Because the Border \nPatrol is getting much more effective at controlling the border now, \nthe violence is increasing because the people smuggling immigrants and \ndrugs are finding their territory is now being contested by the Border \nPatrol. They are fighting back. They are fighting back with weapons, \nincluding large caliber weapons. This violence is a scourge not just at \nthe border but on our society as a whole. We had a shootout on the \nfreeway between Tucson and Phoenix, where two rival gangs were fighting \nover a load of illegal immigrants. Why? Because those illegal \nimmigrants represented more potential income for whoever controlled \nthem. They are essentially kidnapped and ransomed, and their families \nback in El Salvador, Mexico, or wherever they are from, are contacted \nand are told if they want their relatives to be freed, they have to pay \nadditional money. As a result, a lot of money is paid and there is a \nlot of violence. The harm perpetrated on the immigrants--and, frankly, \nthe harm perpetrated by some of the coyotes and smugglers and other \ncriminals crossing the border--is infecting our State to an \nunacceptable degree.\n  Last year, over 10 percent of the illegal immigrants coming across \nthe border from Mexico were criminals, people wanted for serious \ncrimes. These are not just nice people wanting to work in the U.S., \nthough that is far and away the majority of them. It is a national \nsecurity problem. We don't know how many of these people may have \nterrorist inclinations. Many come from countries that are on the \nterrorist list. Again, between 10 and 13 percent, approximately, we \nknow to be criminals. As a result, we have to do something about the \nproblem.\n  I was mentioning to a reporter this morning--she said: What \ndifferentiates Arizona from a Midwestern or an Eastern State? Well, two \nthings. The violence associated with this, first, has a deleterious \neffect, all the way from the people the violence is perpetrated on, to \nthe court system which cannot handle it, to the jail system, to the \nsocial network that has to be established; all of this is enormously \nexpensive and disruptive.\n  Secondly, I said, you have the problem of the environmental \ndegradation, with thousands of people--millions over the years--\ncrossing through into our State, and the impact on the desert \nenvironment has been dramatic. We have national monuments, parks, game \nrefuges, military bases, Indian reservations, as well as private land \nand national forests right on the border.\n  With this many people coming across with very little regard for the \nimpact on the environment, they have left thousands of tons of trash. \nThey have cut fences. They have let water run. They have let animals \nrun loose. They have threatened, in some cases, to hurt individuals. \nThey have burned property. They have trashed the properties, as I have \nsaid, and they cut literally thousands of trails which will take \nthousands of years to revegetate. That is the least of the problems. \nBut one\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\ncan see it in my State of Arizona, and I think anybody who says we \nshouldn't try to do something to stop that simply has no sense of \nresponsibility, especially if they are in a position to do something \nabout it, as we in the Senate are. That is what has motivated me to do \nsomething about this problem as best I can.\n  One can sit on the sidelines and complain about how bad the \nlegislation is. One could say, as some of my colleagues have said, we \nneed to find a way to do something to solve this or one can try to find \na way and work with their colleagues on the other side of the aisle, do \ntheir best to come up with a consensus that has a chance of passing and \nbeing signed into law. That is what those of us who have worked on this \nlegislation have tried to do. Is it perfect? No way. Are there many \nprovisions in it I don't like? Absolutely. Or that my friend Senator \nSalazar doesn't like? Absolutely. But that is the nature of attempting \nto reach a bipartisan consensus.\n  I next wish to talk about what my constituents have told me in the \nlast couple of weeks. It is very interesting that the same question \nkeeps coming up over and over. In my campaign last year, it was the \nsame question: Why do you think a new law will be enforced when the \nexisting law is not being enforced? And that is a very good question \nbecause the truth is, neither the current administration nor the \nprevious administration nor Congresses working with the administration \nnor the bureaucracies and people responsible for enforcing the law have \ndone a good job of enforcing the law. One can argue that in some cases \nthere hasn't even been a significant attempt to enforce the law. When \nwe do attempt to enforce it, a lot of roadblocks are thrown in the way.\n  So it is a legitimate question: Why do we think this new law might be \nenforced when the current law is not being adequately enforced? Unless \nyou can answer that question, you can't really support some new \nproposal, as we have here.\n  Before I answer the question, let me say something else. It is \nabsolutely wrong to accuse the people who ask that question, who are \nskeptical of our ability to enforce a law and, therefore, skeptical of \nthis new law, and call them bigots or restrictionists or nativists or \nleftwing or rightwing nuts or people who simply want to obstruct the \nprocess. The reality is, these are hard-working, tax-paying Americans \nwho believe in the rule of law and are extraordinarily upset that their \nGovernment has let them down, and that is exactly what has happened--\ntheir Government has let them down. They have a right to be angry, and \nthey have a right to ask the question: Why should we believe a new law \nis going to be enforced when the existing law is not being enforced?\n  Remember, I say to my colleagues, we work for them. They hired us. \nThey pay our salary, and they pay the President's salary and all of the \npeople who work in the executive branch. They have a right to answers \nto these questions rather than having people suggest that because they \nmay oppose what we are proposing, somehow or another we think less of \nthem. I think a great deal of them, especially those people who \ndisagree with me agreeably, such as one of my constituents with whom I \nspoke today. She said: I trust you, but I don't like this new bill \nwhich has been proposed. I appreciate the question she asked, which was \nthe same one: How are you going to enforce it? So let me try to answer \nthat question.\n  First of all, we understood that the experience of 20 years ago with \nthe amnesty bill of 1986 demonstrated that unless we took enforcement \nseriously, we would end up with something unenforceable. So we tried to \ndo that in this new legislation.\n  The first thing we did was to ensure that several new actions will be \ndone for enforcement before any of the benefits accrue to people who \nare here illegally. That is a way of ensuring that at least some \nenforcement gets done. What did we do? We applied triggers. We said \nthat until the following things are done, no temporary visa will be \nissued to an illegal immigrant in the United States. What are those \nthings?\n  No. 1, we are going to increase the numbers of the Border Patrol. By \nthe way, this isn't the end of it. We said 18,000, and an amendment has \nbeen adopted that says take it to 20,000, and that is great, and we \nwill need more than that. Do you know what 20,000 Border Patrol agents \nrepresents, Mr. President? It is half the New York City Police \nDepartment. So if they have about 39,000 people on the New York City \nPolice Department--and I don't know how many square miles that is, but \nwe have 2,000 miles of border to Mexico, not to mention our northern \nborder--I think one can appreciate probably 20,000 Border Patrol agents \nis not enough, but we at least get to that mark before any of those \ntriggers are pulled.\n  We do the same thing with fencing. We have authorized 700 miles of \nfencing. We are going to have at least 371 of those miles completed \nbefore the trigger is pulled. We are going to have over 300 miles of \nvehicle barriers.\n  Incidentally, on fencing, there is a rumor, a myth out in the land \nthat we only have 2 miles of fencing. We have over 80 miles of fencing, \nand it is being built several miles a day. I have seen it being built \non the border near Yuma, AZ.\n  We will have something like 70 more radars, maybe more than that. I \nhave forgotten the exact number. We will have four unmanned aerial \nvehicles. We have over 26,000 detention spaces, so there will be no \nmore catch and release of people who are detained.\n  These are some of the items which will actually have to be done \nbefore the trigger is pulled and a visa can be issued to an illegal \nimmigrant, even a temporary visa.\n  In addition to that, we will have up and operating and ready to go \nthe electronic employee verification system, or so-called EEVS. This \nwas lacking in the bill in 1986. We had a requirement that employers \ncheck to verify the eligibility of employees. Mr. President, do you \nknow what they had to check? A driver's license and Social Security \ncard, which are counterfeitable and I think cost 30 to 35 bucks apiece, \nor about $60 for the two of them, and employers can't hold them up to \nthe light and say: This is a counterfeit and that one is real. We \ncannot expect employers to do that, as a result of which they suspect a \nlot of the people on their payroll are illegal immigrants, but they \nhave the documents to prove they are legal, and the U.S. Government \nvery seldom comes to audit them to check to see whether the people they \nhired are legal. Of course, we preclude them from asking insensitive \nquestions that might violate their legal rights, such as: Are you an \nillegal immigrant? So employers are stuck in a catch-22 situation. That \nis the situation today.\n\n  For those who say we don't like the bill, I say, fine, do you want \nthe situation where today we have a totally unenforceable employee \nverification system or would you like to see something like that which \nis in this bill put into place? It is very effective. It will require \nthe Government to do the validating, not the employer.\n  The Government will have two different items to validate. No. 1, it \nis going to clean up the Social Security system and the database, and \nwhen an individual applies for a job, that database is going to be \naccessed with algorithms developed to ensure that not only do you \nensure that the number which has been issued is a valid number issued \nto that person on that date but that it hasn't been used by somebody \nelse for employment purposes or the individual hasn't died and so \nforth. So they can determine whether the Social Security eligibility is \nreal.\n  Second, you can determine who the individual is. There is a variety \nof ways to do this. If you have a U.S. passport, that is the gold \nstandard because the information is typed in and the real passport that \nwas issued will then be displayed on the computer screen of the \nemployer. All the employer has to do is match that with the passport \nthe prospective employee has given them and determine if they are \nidentical. If the photographs are identical, it looks like the \nindividual in the photograph, that is him. If they are not, then that \nsituation is noted and the individual cannot be employed. If it is a \ndriver's license, a REAL ID Act driver's license, it is the same \nthing--the photograph has to match.\n  There is a system, in other words, that will be put into place that \nthis time will not rely on the employer trying to determine the \nvalidity of the\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\ndocument but, rather, having that document checked through the database \nof the U.S. Government or States in the case of driver's licenses or \nbirth certificates, and the employer is able to verify that, in fact, \nis a proper document.\n  There are very difficult sanctions. If an employer violates this law \nmore than once, it is a $75,000 fine, as opposed to $250 for a \nviolation today. This is serious. And I think employers want a legal \nway that doesn't impose too big a burden on them to ensure the people \nthey hire are, in fact, eligible to be hired. I think they will \nappreciate the speed and the ease with which this new system will allow \nthem to determine eligibility of their employees. This will work so \nthat the combination of strong border security and the inability to get \na job if you are here illegally will reduce, we believe right down to \nthe bare minimum, the number of people who shouldn't be here but are. \nThat bare minimum, of course, is the criminal element--absconders, gang \nor terrorist members, and those people who have committed crimes. They \nare here today, and it is going to be much easier to find and catch \nthem tomorrow if they are the ones on which we can concentrate. Instead \nof having to concentrate on 100 percent of the people who are here \nillegally, we can focus on that 15 percent or so we really want to \ncatch. This is the second way in which we have anticipated we need to \nenforce the law.\n  Third, amazingly, in the 1986 law, you couldn't even prosecute \nsomeone for fraud if they told you they had been here for longer than 3 \nyears or 5 years and it turns out they hadn't been. Last year, there \nwas an attempt to amend the bill to at least allow people who made such \nfraudulent claims to be prosecuted, and that amendment failed. Needless \nto say, the ability to prosecute fraud is in this legislation.\n  There are many other ways in which we have sought to ensure this \nlegislation, unlike the past, will be enforced.\n  I conclude this part of my remarks with this statement. Let me answer \nin another way the question about whether the law will be enforced. If \nyou are unhappy with the status quo, if you don't like the way things \nare today, then why would you oppose a change that at least offers the \nprospect that the new law will be enforced when we know the old law is \nnot being adequately enforced? If you say: Let's just enforce the \ncurrent law, I ask you, with regard to the employee verification system \nI just discussed, how can you enforce a law that is inherently not \nenforceable? You can't prosecute for fraud, you can't check the status \nof prospective employees, you cannot hold an employer liable because \nyou can't prove that person knowingly hired the illegal immigrant. You \ncan't enforce the existing law at the workplace. We have to change the \nlaw. That is the whole point of this legislation. I think you have to \nargue that the status quo is better than what this bill offers if you \nare going to oppose the bill.\n  Let me mention two other points since I see my colleague from New \nMexico is in the Chamber. Like me, he appreciates the impact on our \nsociety of illegal immigrants who are imposing themselves, who are \nusing social services, who are stressing our court system, and I \nappreciate the fact that the senior Senator from New Mexico has offered \nlegislation to add judges so that we at least have enough judges to \nhandle the cases that come before the courts.\n  A lot of our colleagues say that the problem with this legislation \nand the only reason they can't go along with it is that it represents \namnesty. Of course, everybody has a different definition of what \namnesty is. I don't think it is amnesty. It seems to me that arguing \nover whether something is amnesty or isn't amnesty is a dead-end \nargument.\n  The question is, What would you like to see done so it isn't what you \ndon't like? I argue this: If merely allowing the illegal immigrants to \nstay here is amnesty, which is what a lot of my constituents have said \nthey believe, then the status quo is amnesty because we are letting \nthem stay here and we are not doing anything about it. So if your \ndefinition is the mere fact you allow them to stay here is amnesty, \nthen I say, fine, you, too, are for amnesty. I am just trying to do \nsomething about it.\n  What are we trying to do about it? The first thing is that what we \nwant to do is to ensure the people who came here illegally will \nappreciate that they did something wrong, they are going to have to pay \na penalty for it, and for them to continue to stay, they are going to \nhave to meet serious conditions of probation. They are going to have to \nsay: I came here illegally; if you find I committed fraud or if you \nfind I am ineligible for the benefits of this program in any way, I \nwaive my right to contest that, in effect, and I am going to pay a \nfine, and I am going to be on probation, I am going to have to not \nviolate the law, I am going to have to continue to work, if you are the \nhead of the household. If you violate any of those conditions, you are \ngoing to have to go home, and so are your family members. If you want \nto stay here permanently, you are going to have to go home and apply \nlike everyone else. You are going to have to get in line. You are going \nto have to pass an English test. And that is all simply to get a green \ncard. After that, of course, if you want to be a citizen, you have to \nwait the 5 years and do the things necessary to become a citizen. That \ndeals with the second point.\n\n  To me, one of the definitions of amnesty is this automatic path to \ncitizenship. We have done away with that. In addition, we have \nestablished a merit-based system for green cards for those people who \nwant them who are here illegally.\n  Finally, one of the benefits of amnesty is the ability to chain \nmigrate your family. We have eliminated that in this legislation. You \nno longer have the right to chain migrate your family. By that, what we \nare talking about is to bring in the nonnuclear family, someone other \nthan your spouse and minor children, simply because you are a green \ncard holder or a U.S. citizen. We say: no longer. When this bill goes \ninto effect, once the current backlog is cleared up, there will be no \nmore chain migration of this nonnuclear family.\n  Incidentally, there was an error made in the description of our bill \nby one of our colleagues. The visa that will be issued to people \nillegally here today does not allow chain migration. In fact, it \ndoesn't even allow the migration of your nuclear family, your spouse, \nor minor children, if they are in another country.\n  The last thing I want to talk about is the matter of the amendments \nwe will have to deal with during the course of this next week. There \nwill be a lot of amendments, some of which improve the bill. I know the \nPresiding Officer has an amendment which I think is a good amendment, \nand it doesn't in any way disrupt the basic agreement that was reached \non a bipartisan basis but strengthens the bill. There will be many \nother amendments that either do or do not strengthen the bill, and we \nwill have a chance to vote on them. We also understand there are some \namendments which go right to the heart of the negotiation that \noccurred, to the agreements that were reached, and there are some \nMembers in the Senate who, frankly, want to see them adopted because \nthey do not want to see the bill passed. They know they are killer \namendments, and they have been so dubbed, and I wish to illustrate what \nI mean.\n  We have a temporary worker program. We worked very hard to make sure \nit gave people an opportunity to come here temporarily to work and to \nreturn home. Any amendment that would allow them to morph into legal \npermanent residency and citizenship would convert that from a temporary \nworker program to a permanent worker program, and that would violate \nthe basic understanding of the bill. We already have a permanent worker \nprogram.\n  Now, speaking of that, we were very careful to try to balance that \npermanent worker program, the so-called green card program, legal \npermanent residence, based on worker visas. We carefully calibrated \nthat with family visas and the need for high skills versus low skills. \nWe developed a merit-based system that establishes points for that and \nallocated the different visas for different groups. It would be a deal \nkiller, a killer amendment, a breaking of the bipartisan agreement here \nif that is substantially altered. There is an amendment out there that \nwould in fact substantially alter it by increasing by something\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nlike 300,000 per year the number of green cards that would be provided \nfor employers to dole out to their prospective employees, as a \ncondition of employment, basically. This is not a green card applied \nfor by the individual. This is a green card the employer applies for \nand says to a prospective employee from another country, if you will \ncome work for me for 5 years and take substandard wages, I will give \nyou a green card at the end of that 5-year period.\n  I remember studying in school the concept of indentured servitude. \nYou come and work off your debt for 7 years and then you get to stay in \nthe United States of America. It is not the same thing, but it is \nanalogous. What we say here is we are going to make visas available for \nboth the employee to apply for and the employer, and we are going to \nsubstantially increase the number of those visas. But we are not going \nto substantially increase it and then add another 300,000 on top of \nthat. That would break the deal.\n  Moreover, that particular amendment goes right to the heart of some \nother reforms, reforms that I support, that the Presiding Officer \nsupports, and would, frankly, undercut what we have tried to do here in \nterms of worker rights. To be real clear about it, we already have \n150,000 green cards per year, most of which will go to skilled workers \nbecause of the merit-based system we have. In addition to that, we have \ncreated another 107,000 per year to clear up what we believe is a 5-\nyear backlog for those high-skilled workers, those so-called H-1B \nworkers, and we add another 240,000 at the end of 8 years when they are \nno longer needed for family purposes. We have a merit-based system, as \nI said, that will pretty much ensure these green cards go to the best \nand the brightest, the high-skilled people who will bring with them the \nkinds of things we need to compete in the global economy.\n  Another killer amendment has to do with the nonnuclear family \nmigration, the so-called chain migration. We have decided that, even \nthough some people would literally never get to this country with a \nfamily visa because the backlog is too long, we are going to allow \nabout 4 million people to come into the country over an 8-year period. \nThis is extraordinarily generous, and let me mention one country where \nI believe the backlog for our neighbor to the south, Mexico, is 176 \nyears. You cannot argue that you have a reasonable expectation you are \never going to get a visa granted and get to the United States and have \nanything left of your life if the timelag before you could get it is \n176 years. It is also long for many other countries. Nevertheless, we \nsaid if you had applied by May of 2005, you would be able to come into \nthis country within an 8-year period. We had originally said 2004, \nbecause I believe in March of that year, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity sent a letter to everybody who was pending and said, look, we \nhave stopped processing these applications because there is no \nreasonable expectation we are ever going to get to them. So if you \napplied after that date, especially if you are from one of these \ncountries that has a long backlog, forget it, you are never going to \nmake it here. Nevertheless, we said, we will allow you to come in \nduring this 8-year period.\n  Well, there is an amendment that would move that date from May of \n2005--remember, we moved it from March of 2004, in the spirit of \ncompromise, to May of 2005--this amendment would move it 2 years \nforward to today, basically, for another over 650,000 applicants. These \npeople have no reasonable expectation of ever coming into the country.\n\n  Finally, there is an amendment that deals with spouses and children. \nBoth legal permanent residents and citizens are enabled to bring in \nspouses and legal children. If you are a legal permanent resident, \nthere is a cap and there is some waiting period. It is not substantial, \nbut it is a waiting period. This amendment would eliminate that \ndifference between citizenship and legal permanent residence for the \nsake of bringing the nuclear family in. I think it is very important \nfor us to retain the distinction. Citizenship has to mean something in \nthis country, and one of the key things we think it means is being able \nto bring your spouse and minor children into the country when you want \nto do that.\n  My point in discussing these amendments is to make the point that as \nanxious as I am to solve this problem by getting legislation passed \nthat we believe does offer the opportunity for enforcement to end \nillegal immigration, to end the employment of illegal immigrants, and \nto ensure that from now on people who are here are playing by our rules \nrather than someone else's rules, as much as we want to ensure this \nlegislation can pass the Senate and the House and be signed by the \nPresident, we also appreciate the fact that it represents a consensus \nbased upon an extraordinary amount of negotiation.\n  I go back to the point I made starting out. Nobody got 100 percent of \nwhat they wanted. We all made sacrifices in the sense that we agreed to \nthings we didn't like. The end result was a bipartisan bill which I \nbelieve can pass. But if any of these other amendments are adopted, \nthen many of us have made the commitment that we will no longer support \nthe legislation. I certainly will not support the legislation, and I \nwould do everything I could to get it defeated.\n  It seems to me unless there is a bipartisan consensus that represents \na balanced bill that can pass both Houses and that the President will \nsign, we are simply engaging in an exercise in futility, and perhaps \nworse. So I want my colleagues to appreciate the fact that I am very \nanxious to support some of their amendments, that I will oppose others, \nbut they need to come down and get their amendments pending so we can \nget them voted on.\n  Again, there are some things which go right to the heart of this \nbargain, and many of the people who will support those amendments know \nthat. I am sad to say one of the reasons they will be supported by some \nMembers is precisely to kill the bill. I don't want to see the bill \nkilled. I want to see the bill passed. As a result, I hope my \ncolleagues will keep this in mind when we consider these various \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I think there are other people here now who wish to \nspeak to the bill, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the \nleadership Senator Kyl has given to this Senate in so many different \nareas. I am normally one of his righthand guys, but on this deal, I \ncan't be with him.\n  I don't agree that a small group of Senators can meet in closed \nmeetings and reach a compromise nobody can amend. In fact, Senator \nBingaman noted earlier today that he offered an amendment to change the \ntemporary guest worker program. They said that amendment would be a \ndeal breaker. But it passed with 74 votes. So we obviously ought to be \nable to amend this thing, and hopefully we will.\n  I will speak briefly, because my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, is here, and I will yield to him in a moment, but I will add \na couple of things.\n  I do believe we need effective, comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation, and I support that. I was hopeful the legislation that was \nbeing discussed was based on the principles contained in the talking \npoints utilized by members of the President's Cabinet and those \nSenators who were meeting to discuss the bill. Those principles struck \nme as being far preferable to last year's legislation, and I said \npublicly I was most intrigued by it.\n  I must say, however, that on reading the fine print in this \nlegislation, I have concluded the legislation does not effectuate the \npromises and principles announced beforehand.\n  For example, they said this year we would have an effective trigger; \ntrigger being proof that enforcement measures were in place before any \namnesty would occur. That was defeated last year. The people this year \nassured us it would be in there. But reading the language on the \ntrigger, it has very little teeth in it. It is trigger locked. It is \nnot an effective trigger, and I have demonstrated that in earlier \nspeeches.\n  They promised we would end chain migration and move to a merit system \nof immigration. However, for the next 8 years, the number of people \nentering under the chain-migration, nonskill-based status will increase \ndramatically, almost three times the current rate. Indeed, only after 8 \nyears will the merit-based system have the kind of teeth I had hoped it \nwould have immediately. But I would note that Senator\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nObama has indicated he is filing an amendment to sunset the merit \nsystem and eliminate even that.\n  The temporary worker program gives me great concern because I am \nafraid it will not work. I also note it allows spouses and parents to \nvisit. A spouse can visit a worker even if that spouse indicates they \ndo not intend to stay in the country they are living in--the foreign \ncountry. So I am worried about how that will work. Who is going to \napprehend those who don't return?\n  People who came into our country in the last 5 months, who got past \nthe National Guard that President Bush called out, who got into our \ncountry December 31 of last year, will be given permanent status in \nthis country. Those who are members of MS-13, an international gang, if \nthey say they are a member of that gang but that they renounce the \nprinciples of that gang, will be able to stay and be given citizenship \nin the United States.\n  They said the bill would have greater emphasis on assimilation, \nbecause we all agree we need to do a better job of assimilating those \nwho come to our country. I believe it is only mentioned once in the \nbill, and that is at page 300-something of the bill--almost the last \npage of the bill.\n  They said we would emphasize English much more. But under the bill, \nthose who would be given amnesty won't have to produce any proof of \nEnglish skills for 12 years.\n  They said there would not be a benefit of welfare. But the earned \nincome tax credit will be given to people immediately upon their being \ngiven lawful status in the country; not a Z visa, even, but the \nprobationary status. An average recipient of the earned income tax \ncredit gets about $1,800 a year, and that is not chickenfeed. It was \ndesigned to encourage work by working Americans, not to provide an \nincentive for people to come to our country illegally. The document \nthat is required to enable you to prove you were here before January 1 \nof this year is simply an affidavit by someone. I submit that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is not going to be able to check on \nthose affidavits and we are going to have massive fraud. Indeed, most \npeople, probably, who are working here today carry false documents of \nsome kind or another. It certainly would not be difficult at all to \nobtain a false affidavit in that regard.\n\n  I have listed 20 loopholes or objections I have identified with the \nbill--actually, 25, and Senator Bingaman pointed out another one \nearlier today that we did not include in our list. There are many \ndiscrete, specific defects in the legislation. But the problem is that \nthe defects and mindset behind the legislation indicate a lack of \ncommitment to creating a lawfully enforceable system of immigration and \nindicate a lack of commitment to moving to a more skill-based system \nlike Canada's--which system, I note to my colleagues, the Canadian \nsystem, was favorably reviewed in a USA Today editorial yesterday. That \nabsolutely should be a part of this legislation.\n  I salute my colleagues for working to move to a more merit-based \nsystem and for taking some steps that would be better from the \nenforcement side, but I have to say I believe it is not sufficient. I \nwish it were. It is not. We need immigration in America. We are a \nnation of immigrants. I do not oppose immigration. I just think we \nought to create a system that serves our national interest, that allows \ntalented people from around the world to apply and come here, those \npersons most likely to flourish in our system. It should serve our \nnational interests and should be effective. I am afraid this bill is \nnot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Alabama for \nexpediting his remarks. I did not get to hear all the speeches this \nafternoon, including the speech of my good friend Senator Salazar from \nmy neighboring State of Colorado or even all of the speech made today \nby my very good friend from another of my adjoining States, Arizona, \nSenator Kyl. But I heard a little bit of both of their remarks.\n  I came to the floor after hearing some of the speech of Senator Kyl \nto tell him how I analyzed his work on this bill.\n  Senator Kyl, I have known you ever since you have been in the Senate. \nAs luck would have it, I can call you my junior. That is only because \nNew Mexicans sent me up here a few years before Arizonans sent you. In \nno other respect would the use of that word be appropriate because you \nare a terrific Senator. It would have been a shame if you would have \nlost this opportunity, with your talent and your ability to convince \npeople, to get the United States of America a new immigration bill.\n  I say to my junior friend from the State of Colorado, the same goes \nfor you as far as your work on this bill. The same goes for Senator \nKennedy and the other Senators who were in the group who worked \ntogether on this bill. But since the two of you are here, I will use \nyou as an example of all of those who decided they had enough and they \nwere going to work until they had a bill.\n  Let me say that we are not elected to the Senate to handle easy \nproblems, nor are we elected to the Senate to let other people handle \nproblems and then argue that they didn't do it right, so we can be on \nthe defensive all the time and argue against anybody who is trying to \ndo something for the country. We were not elected for that. It happens \nthat we have parties, so most of the time we choose up sides on bills \nand amendments.\n  Let me suggest to the American people who do not understand it--and I \ndon't say that in any pejorative sense--something good has transpired \nin the Senate with this bill. One of the worst problems we have is an \nimmigration system that does not work. If there is anybody in the \nUnited States who believes the borders of this great, marvelous country \nare being policed so we can determine who comes in and who goes out--\nmore significantly who comes in, of course--if they think we can do \nthat, then they are living in another world. They are not talking about \ntheir home country because we have little border control yet. We know \nit in the State of Arizona, my State's neighbor, by just going out and \nlooking. We know it in New Mexico because our Border Patrol agents tell \nus all the time that thousands of illegal immigrants have come across \nand thousands more are coming across and we can't stop them. That is \nbecause we do not have a comprehensive system, so we get them, they are \nsent home, and they come back. We arrest them inside the country, we \ntell them to come to court in 2 or 3 days, they never show up, and we \nnever find them again.\n  The truth is, this great country has about reached a point where we \nhave lost total control of our borders as to citizenry, occupancy, who \nraises their children here and what influence they have over our \nsociety. We have come very close to living under no border or \nimmigration law.\n  For anybody who says to the Senate or to a Senator, either a media \nperson or citizen, ``we do not want this bill because we don't like \nthis or that piece of it,'' let me ask them the question, Do you like \nwhat we have? Is that not the right question to ask, Senator? Do you \nlike what we have? If you don't like what we are trying to do after \nmonths of work, do you really know what you are advocating for when you \ntell us don't do it and fax our offices and call us long distance? What \nyou are asking us to do is do nothing.\n  We don't have anything effective. If you want us to not pass a law, \nyou want us to do nothing and you want to leave us with nothing. You \nwant to leave the people of the country open as to who can come to the \nU.S., how many can come, what they can do when they get here and what \nkind of opportunity we give them. Right now we do not know who they \nare, where they come from, or why we are doing what we are doing. That \nis exactly where we are today.\n  I say to Senators who will come here in the next few days and say: I \nlooked at this bill with my staff, and they told me I had to have an \namendment--I urge you be very serious about amendments. I know, better \nthan most, you can make an argument that a few Senators, no matter how \nwell motivated or how good they are, when they get together for months \nupon months and write a bill, they have not given everybody a chance, \nin the institution called the Senate, to participate. But I suggest if \nthose people--led by Senator\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nKennedy, Senator Kyl, Senator Specter and others--if they have produced \nsomething that is substantially better than our current laws, do you \nthink there is anything else that is apt to make it through the \nCongress if this bill dies? Are we really going to go through this \neffort again next year? I think we are going to have to wait until \nthere is a whole new group of Senators before we write another bill. So \nbefore you insist you are going to offer an amendment, even if it kills \nthis bill, so you can exercise your senatorial rights, then I urge you \ngive some serious thought to the proposition: Just so you can say you \noffered an amendment, do you want to kill a bill which is dramatically \nbetter than the laws we are living with, without question? Do you want \nto kill a bill about which many people who have analyzed it carefully \nsay that if we provide sufficient resources, sufficient manpower, the \nstrength we need and the law enforcement we need, it has a chance of \nsecuring our borders so people cannot come in unless they are supposed \nto?\n  What we are living under has no chance of providing the security we \nneed. The laws cannot be enforced. The laws are not currently, with \ncourt interpretations and the like, endowed with the capacity to be \nenforced. The current law of the land cannot be enforced in a way that \nwill sustain our borders. That is just not possible. So don't wish for \nus nothing. Don't say: Enforce our current law. There is no good law to \nbe enforced. We have a bushel basket full of loopholes and of \nopportunities for people to obfuscate and get out of trouble through \nrules and regulations, so much so that our Border Patrol is so \nfrustrated that they have been for years crying out to us to give them \nhelp. When they say help, they always say: Change the law. Fix the law \nso we can do what you want us to do. This is our chance to do that.\n  I went home for recess like most Senators. I did not travel overseas; \nI went home. I spoke at three editorial boards in three cities, and I \nthen spoke to a couple of groups, such as the Hispano Chamber in \nAlbuquerque, about 50 to 100 men or women were there. When I had time \nto answer questions on this bill and to explain its principal \nprovisions, nobody stood up to challenge me, to say that it was bad, \nexcept one person who insisted that I was defining amnesty wrong. I \nended up in an argument. Maybe I should not have done that, saying ``it \ndoesn't matter whether it is amnesty, here are the words describing \nwhat the bill does. Is there something wrong with this accumulation of \nwords we put in the bill that says when somebody can stay here if they \nhave worked for at least 13 years and then they apply for citizenship? \nIs there anything wrong with those words? If there is not, then we \nshouldn't worry about amnesty, whether we define it that way or not.''\n  I believe there is no general amnesty in this bill. The minimum time \nyou must be here to become a citizen is 13 years under 2 different \ncards, a Z card and a green card. You must spend 13 years being a good \nresident--not counting how much time you spent here before getting a Z \ncard--and paying fines along the way for violating the law, having to \nknow sufficient English and sufficient civics. Is that amnesty? I \nthought amnesty was more like a gift. There is no gift here. You have \nto work and you have to learn and you have to pass an exam and you have \nto pay fines.\n  And the first thing undocumented workers have to do is get up from \nwhere they are, half incognito, and turn themselves in and have enough \ntrust that the Federal Government is going to treat you right. That is \nthe first thing the bill is going to do after securing the border. A \nlot of people are going to wonder about that. You are going to find \nout. We are going to put plenty of resources into that, going out and \nasking them to turn themselves in. Is that right? That is one of the \nfirst actions in this bill. Go to where they hide out, because they are \nillegal aliens, and ask them to come forward. They are not going to be \nillegal anymore. They are going to get a legal work card.\n  I worked on the immigration bill last year. It was not nearly as good \nas this bill. I have not worked as long as those who have worked the \nlongest this year. I have worked long enough to be sure I have \nsomething here that I can tell my constituents is much better than what \nwe have now. In fact, this bill has a real chance of controlling the \nborders. Once we have it passed, if we do not throw up our hands and \nabandon it but keep with it and enforce it and put the money into the \nequipment needed to do the work required, if we do all those things \nwhen we have this bill finished--and we are going to have to do that--\nwe will have legislation we can be proud of. If we do that, I will be \nglad to say, in this year, in this month, I worked on and helped pass a \nbill in spite of many people being against it in the media--we passed \nsomething good for the American people from a set of facts that were \ndifficult, from laws we had to amend, which had many special interests \nthat made them difficult to change.\n  I will be saying in that month, this month, this year: We got it \ndone. I will be very happy and very proud in the meantime, for those \nwho are working on the bill--I have a lot of other things on other \ncommittees--but I stand ready to be of help wherever I can during the \nweek. You can put me down as one who is ready to help.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, first I want to make a comment about the \nprocess that has been underway on immigration. We sometimes think about \nwhat is the most important thing we are given as Senators. What is the \nprivilege we get to exercise on behalf of the American people in \nrepresenting our States? We get to work on issues of enormous \nimportance to civilization, to the United States, and to our respective \nStates in this country. But one of the decisions that is made here by \nthe majority leader is what kind of time is going to be allocated on \nwhat kinds of issues.\n  Well, this majority leader, Senator Reid, said 2 months ago he would \nset aside May, some time in May, for us to deal with the issue of \nimmigration. He did the right thing, because what he did is he held \npeoples' feet to the fire to deal with this issue that some people \nwould rather not deal with at all. He said for us in the Senate, the \n100 Members of this Chamber would be spending a significant amount of \ntime in May and now into June dealing with this issue. But the amount \nof time we spent working on the issue of immigration goes far beyond \nthe current effort we have on this bill.\n  Last year, through the Judiciary Committee hearing that lasted for \nweeks prior to a markup and then for almost a month here on the floor \nof the Senate, we labored hard day and night to come up with a \ncomprehensive immigration reform package. When all was said and done, \nsome 35 votes were cast on that legislation, and there were over 60 \nvotes in the Senate to move forward with comprehensive immigration \nreform. That was a month of struggle in this Chamber, trying to come up \nwith a solution to deal with the very significant challenges we face \nwith immigration.\n  The group that has been working with Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, \nSenator Specter, the Presiding Officer, and others who have spent so \nmuch time in trying to come up with a comprehensive bill that would \nallow us to deal with this issue and move it forward worked very hard \nover the last several months. So we have been on this legislation for a \nvery long time. We were on this legislation for all of last week. There \nwere 13 amendments that were made to the legislation during the week we \nhad on this legislation last week.\n  At this point there are 14 pending amendments. We hope we will begin \nto vote on those amendments tomorrow morning and will continue through \nthe rest of the day and through the rest of the week. It is my hope at \nthe end of the day we will have an immigration reform package that is \nadopted by the Senate, and will then move forward.\n  I wish to make a comment on one of the attacks that has been made on \nthis legislation by many Members around the country where they said \nwhat we are trying to do is give people amnesty. Well, when I looked up \nthe definition of amnesty in the Merriam Webster on-line dictionary, it \nsays essentially amnesty is a pardon. Amnesty is a pardon.\n  This is not a pardon. What we are calling for in this legislation is \na far\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\ncry from a pardon. This is a probationary status people are being put \nin.\n  I come from a law enforcement background. I spent 6 years as attorney \ngeneral. I helped put thousands and thousands of people behind bars. I \nprosecuted gangs and white-collar crime, and made sure that murderers \nwere serving their time in the prisons of my State. That is a part of \nwhat I did as a prosecutor, as a member of law enforcement.\n  In law enforcement we say: If you do the crime, you got to do the \ntime; you got to pay the fine. Well, what is it we are asking people \nhere to do? We are asking them to do a tremendous amount of work and \nactivity to demonstrate that they are, in fact, entitled at some point \ndown the road to a green card.\n  The first thing you are asking people to do under the new program we \nare setting up is that they have to come out of the shadows into the \nsunlight of society, and to register with the Government. That is not a \nrequirement we make of any citizen in the United States, but it is a \nrequirement we are going to make to have undocumented workers here in \nAmerica, that they have to register with the Government and they have \nto do that and then go into a probationary period that is going to last \nfor a very long period of time.\n  At the time they register, they have to pay a fine. Now, it is not a \n$5 fine, a $25 fine, a little slap on the wrist. You are talking about \nan accumulation of fines and processing fees and impact fees that at \nthe end of the day is probably going to be somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $7,500 to $8,000 per person.\n  At the time they pay their penalty, they have to pay $1,000. After \nthey pay their penalty of $1,000, they have to pay $1,500 dollars to \nget their Z card application, and then 3 years later they have to pay \nanother $1,500, at 8 years of going through this purgatory where we \nrequire them during those 8 years to take English classes, to make sure \nthey stay out of trouble with the law, to make sure they are gainfully \nemployed. If they survive that 8-year period of purgatory, at that \nperiod of time they have to pay an additional amount of money in order \nto get their green card.\n  When you add up all of that money they have to pay, you are talking \nabout somewhere in the neighborhood of $8,000. That is not amnesty. \nThat is people having to pay a very significant fine and take on a very \nsignificant number of affirmative actions that ultimately, after \nwaiting for a period of 8 years, might qualify them to get a green \ncard.\n  For those who cry the word ``amnesty'' when we talk about immigration \nreform, they are continuing to play into the hands of those who want to \nmake a political debate with no end. They believe if you label people \nwho are for comprehensive immigration reform with the word ``amnesty,'' \nsomehow it will never get done. That is the do-nothing crowd. In fact, \nthat is what happened in the House of Representatives last year, when \nin this body, in a bipartisan vote, Democrats and Republicans coming \ntogether, passed comprehensive immigration reform. The other body, the \nHouse of Representatives, then decided they did not want to take it \nup--not because of the national security issues that are at stake; not \nbecause of the economic security issues which might be dealt with in \nthis legislation; not because of the human and moral issues which are \nat stake in the immigration reform debate, they did not want to take it \nup in the House of Representatives, the then Republican majority did \nnot want to take it up in the House of Representatives simply because \nof the fact that they thought it was their trump card to keep the \nmajority in the November elections.\n  So those who parade around the country with the shrill cry of \n``amnesty'' are doing the American people a great disservice. What they \nare doing is they are playing politics and having politics trump the \nnational interests. The national interests, which we are trying to \nserve in this legislation, to me are important, fundamental, simple, \nbut they are interests which we cannot escape as the leaders of this \ncountry.\n\n  They are first securing our country. We came here as Members of the \nSenate because we want to protect America. We all say we want to \nprotect America. Well, what more can we do to protect America than to \nmake sure the borders of our country are, in fact, being secured? This \nlegislation we now have in this Chamber will, in fact, secure our \nborders.\n  Those of us who come here to the Senate also say we need to do \nsomething to enforce our laws. One of the values we have as the people \nof America is we say we are a nation of laws.\n  What makes us different today than the circumstances we see happening \nin places such as Iraq, such as Lebanon, and other places? What makes \nus different here in the United States of America is we are a nation of \nlaws. We enforce our laws. We pass laws here in the Senate, the House \nof Representatives, that are signed by the President, and then we have \nan executive branch that enforces the laws of America.\n  Well, they haven't been enforced very well. In fact, I think in the \nlast several years we have seen the lowest number of enforcement cases \nthat have been taken against employers who have hired people who were \nnot authorized to be in this country.\n  What we have set up in this legislation is a program that will, in \nfact, make sure we are enforcing the laws of our Nation, and that that \nvalue of being a nation of laws is something we can celebrate.\n  Certainly the legislation before us as well deals with the reality of \nthe 12 million undocumented workers who are here. We deal with the \nother issues that are part of the economic challenges we face in \nAmerica. The 12 million people who are here working with undocumented \nstatus are providing very valuable assistance to the American people.\n  For every American who is watching the debate on immigration, they \nought to ask themselves: Who is it that is cleaning your yard? Who are \nthe landscapers of America today? Who is it that is working out in the \nmeat-packing plants making sure you have the meat and produce that ends \nup on your table for your evening dinner? Who is it that is working \nout, in resort areas, making sure that not only your landscaping is \nbeing taken care of but the needs of your household are being taken \ncare of? Who is out working in the homes of America making sure that \nthe children of America are being taken care of? Who is it out there in \nAmerica today making sure that the nurses' aides working in homes of \nAmericans taking carry of our elderly are there?\n  Many of them are the undocumented workers of America. Most of those \npeople today live very much in the shadows of our society. They live in \nthe shadows of our society. They often are subject to exploitation. \nOften when they come from whatever country, they are subject to the \nkind of exploitation that is very un-American. What we are trying to do \nis move our immigration system from a system that does not work, from a \nsystem that is a system of lawlessness, of broken borders, to a system \nthat is a lawful and orderly program for immigration in our country.\n  At the end of the day, my hope is as we debate the issues on \namendments the rest of the week, that we in this Chamber, in this \nSenate, will move forward and we will say we are going to move with an \nimmigration reform legislation that will address the issues of national \nsecurity, that will address the economic security issues here in our \ncountry, that realize the human and moral issues that are very much at \nstake.\n  Let me conclude, before I yield to my colleague from Arizona, by \nreminding people about the moral issues which are very much at the \nheart of this debate issue. Last year when we opened the debate on \nimmigration reform in the Senate, Senator McCain, who has been an \nadvocate for comprehensive immigration reform, talked about the number \nof people who had died in the desert in his State. He said at the time \nthere had been 400 people who died in 2004. I believe 600 people died \nin 2006. He said: These are not just statistics; those are people who \nwere found dead in the desert.\n  If I remember correctly, he talked about a young mother who was found \ndead in the desert holding her child, who also died, in her arms.\n  In my own church in the State of Colorado, our archbishop, Archbishop\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\nChaput, has often spoken out about the moral issues which are at stake \nwith respect to the immigration debate. He wrote a column that was \nwidely published in the Catholic Register last year which he titled \n``Dying to Live.'' What he meant to say in that title, what he said in \nhis article, is that people who are coming here to live the American \ndream were actually dying in our deserts as they came here to live the \nAmerican dream.\n  It seems to me what we can do as a Senate, working with the House of \nRepresentatives, working with the President, is come up with a system \nof law and order that will give people an understanding of how our \nimmigration system works, that will make sure our borders are secure, \nthat will make sure we enforce our laws in the United States of \nAmerica, and that will make sure we end the immorality that has been \nvery much a part of our system of lawlessness and chaos we have made \nwith immigration in our country.\n  I hope my Democratic and Republican colleagues will help us move \nforward as we address amendments through the rest of the week and to \nproduce legislation that we can move forward to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Colorado. He \nhas correctly pointed out that there are moral, humanitarian, judicial, \nand fairness dimensions to this debate. The stories of people dying in \nthe desert are well known to Arizonans because we are coming into the \nhot time of year. That is when it begins to hit home that there are \npeople who, because of desperation on their part, seek to cross the \ndesert, which is difficult under the best of circumstances, and they \nare frequently ill-prepared. The coyotes take advantage of them. They \ntake their money and send them on their way without adequately \npreparing them to cross. The stories are heartbreaking, and there is a \ngreat deal of other crime--sexual assaults and other kinds of crime--\nthat is perpetrated on people and has to stop. The best way to stop it \nis to get the border secure, find a legal way for people to come here, \nand help them to realize their dream.\n  People say we are a nation of immigrants. We are also a nation of \nlaws. One thing that distinguishes us from other countries is that we \nhave respect for law. I always use the example of the intersection on \nthe street. When you have a green light and you drive through, you \ndon't think about it. You know that because other people respect the \nlaw, you can drive through the intersection without worrying that \nsomeone else is going to run the red light and hit you. It is very rare \nthat happens. Because we understand and respect law in our society, \nwhen we see law that is not enforced, we begin to wonder whether we are \na society of law, and some people decide it is OK for them to begin to \nbreak the law in little ways. It is corrosive, when you drive down the \nstreet you see people whom you presume to be illegal immigrants \ncongregating around a hardware store, looking for work in the morning, \nor you hear stories about people being picked up.\n  It is, frankly, hard to fool the American people. They know there are \nmillions of illegal immigrants employed in the country today, and they \ndon't like it. They don't like the fact that we can't control the \nborder. It is corrosive to respect for the rule of law.\n  They say: Gee, it is nice not to be able to pay your taxes. Maybe I \nwould like not to pay my taxes, too.\n  You don't want American citizens beginning to think the Government \ndoesn't care about enforcing the law and that they should begin to \ndisrespect and therefore not abide by the law. Yet that is exactly the \nkind of attitude that crops up when the Government is not careful about \nenforcing the law in a fair and just way.\n  Unfortunately, we have a law today that is not easy to enforce. It \nrequires employers' cooperation in ways that make it very difficult. \nOne of the reasons we need to work our hardest to pass a new bill is so \nthat we have a law that can be enforced. It will be up to us and to the \nadministration, whatever administration is in power, to see to it that \nit is enforced, but at least it has to be something we can work with.\n  When those who say: Let's just let the situation be by enforcing the \nlaws today, that is the answer to the problem, my response is, the law \ntoday is very difficult to enforce and, as a result, we have to change \nit. That is one of the reasons for adopting a new law. Getting back to \nrespect for the rule of law and recognizing the humanitarian aspects of \nthis are two of the things that are not discussed enough.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Colorado bringing them up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to respond to a couple of \nsuggestions proffered before the Senate as it relates to those Senators \nwho have amendments to offer to the comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation. I am compelled to do so because the way they are \ncharacterized ultimately demeans what should be a clear process of what \nis the greatest marketplace of ideas, the Senate.\n  The first item that I have heard several times is the suggestion that \ncertain amendments are killer amendments. When one of our colleagues, \nparticularly those who were part of constructing the bargain, suggests \nthat a certain amendment is a ``killer amendment,'' a killer amendment \nwhere the intention, the purpose, the main goal is to kill the \nlegislation before us because they don't like it and they don't want to \nsee it pass, maybe they are a part of the universe who believes we \nshould just seek to deport everybody in the country, 12 million people, \nthe greatest deportation in the history of mankind. Maybe it is those \nwho believe we should spend $250 billion in order to accomplish that. \nBut, regardless, there is a universe of individuals that clearly does \nnot like this bill or the idea of comprehensive immigration reform, and \nthey seek to have amendments that would in essence destroy the essence \nof the legislation.\n  I am chagrined to hear my distinguished colleague from Arizona, in a \nlisting of amendments, suggest that my amendments on family \nreunification are killer amendments. I didn't know that family \nreunification rose to the level of being a killer amendment because \nunlike some of our colleagues who last year opposed comprehensive \nimmigration reform, I was here advocating for and casting votes \nfor final passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Yet some \nwho come to the floor now and suggest that certain amendments are \nkiller amendments weren't there last year for comprehensive immigration \nreform. I do want to see comprehensive immigration reform. I worked for \nit last year and voted for last year's version. I spent countless hours \nin negotiation sessions this year to try to achieve a bill that I could \nsupport.\n\n  It is still my fervent hope that we will pass a comprehensive bill, \none that is tough but also smart; one that provides security at our \nborders north and south because it is amazing to me how in this entire \ndebate we never hear about security at our northern border. Yet last \nyear approximately 50,000 people came across the northern border. I \nguess we are not worried about those people. But we do focus a lot on \nthe southern border. We forget that the millennium bomber came through \nthe northern border. There must be something about that northern border \nthat is OK. The southern border is a little bit of a problem. I don't \nknow what it is, whether there are different people crossing those \ndifferent types of borders, but they are still crossing in an \nundocumented fashion. So I am for security at the northern and southern \nborders.\n  I am also one who understands, in terms of the comprehensive nature \nof this bill, the economic realities of our country; that it helps fuel \nour economy and drives it forward, and also to stop human trafficking, \nthe use of people enslaved for certain purposes and exploitation. I \nwant to know who is in America to pursue the American dream versus who \nis here to destroy it. That is real security.\n  In the pursuit, I heard a lot about the rule of law. I am for the \nrule of law. But how does the rule of law get promoted when we say to a \nU.S. citizen who has applied for their family member waiting abroad, \nwaiting their time, following the rules, obeying the rule of law, that, \nin fact, they have an inferior\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\nright to someone who did not follow the rules, who did not obey the \nlaw, and who ultimately will receive a benefit superior to that U.S. \ncitizen who is claiming their family member and waiting under the law \nand pursuing the law. I think it sends the wrong message about what the \nrule of law is all about.\n  Our amendment very simply says a U.S. citizen claiming their family \nmember waiting under the legal process, waiting abroad, that their \nright should not be snuffed out like that under this bill in May of \n2005, when those who have crossed the borders of our country through a \nprocess that is unchecked, undocumented, get a benefit January 2007. \nBreak the law, you get a benefit January 2007; follow the law, the rule \nof law, obey it, your right is snuffed out in May of 2005. I think if \nwe want to send a message about the rule of law, what we want to do is \nensure that we put on an equal footing the right of a U.S. citizen \nclaiming their family member, obeying the law, to give them the same \nopportunity as those who have not. That is what our amendment is all \nabout. Killer amendment? Family reunification, rule of law, following \nthe rules, a killer amendment?\n  I have heard a lot about family values in my 15 years in the \nCongress. It is interesting. The voices of family values don't have the \nsame values when it comes to this issue. Clearly, this vote will be a \ntest of those who say they are for strengthening families, for bringing \nfamilies together, for understanding the very essence of how strong \nfamilies make for strong communities, of how we want to bring families \ntogether. Family reunification is at the core of the amendment I have \noffered before the Senate and that I believe we will be voting on \ntomorrow.\n  I believe it is a false choice to suggest that this legislation \ncannot move forward and that, in fact, we will have a killer amendment \nsimply because we want to give a universe of people who have obeyed the \nlaw, followed the rules, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, \nchildren of U.S. citizens, a chance over time to be able to come in. It \nseems to me that is a false choice.\n  It is also a false choice, under the new point system that is being \ndevised for future immigration, that this new point system, in which \nthere is 100 points maximum score, well, yes, we need new workers who \nwill be highly skilled. I believe we can reconcile that need. I am \nhoping that we will actually do a much better job of educating \nAmericans who will be able to be the engineers, the scientists, the \nresearchers, and developers; those in the new technologies who will \nfuel America's prosperity. But while we move toward making that a \nreality, sure I am for saying that, OK, we are going to subscribe a \nseries of points toward those people who have the skills. But must it \nbe largely at the exclusion of family reunification? Is there no \nsignificant value to the idea that when you have someone come that \ntheir family members are ultimately a significant part of the strength \nand vitality of the country, of the success of those individuals on \nbehalf of the country?\n  Servicemembers, who are not United States citizens or were not United \nStates citizens, in different branches of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States, who were worthy of wearing the uniform of the United \nStates, worthy of fighting for the United States, worthy of being \ninjured and shedding blood on behalf of the United States, but not \nworthy--not worthy--of being able to claim their family members? Is \nthat what our values have come to?\n  I believe under both our amendment that offers the opportunity for \nU.S. citizens to claim their family members and Senator Clinton's \namendment, which I have cosponsored with her, to have U.S. permanent \nresidents to be able to claim their family members, if you are worthy \nto fight, then you are worthy to claim your family members.\n  It seems to me, isn't family worth 10 or 15 points in the 100-point \nsystem--and not with a barrier that says: Well, you get some points \nonly if you reach a certain numeric number, and then the family is \nworth something. No. Families are worth something, it seems to me, from \nthe very beginning, the very get-go.\n  In the 100-point system, 10 or 15 points is not worth going toward \nfamily? I think it is. If you are worthy of serving, you are worthy of \nclaiming your family members.\n  Here is someone who served his country exceptionally well, I believe: \nColin Powell. He served his country both as Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and as Secretary of State. Under this system we are \ndebating in the Senate, his parents would not have made it to America \nand he would not have served the country as well as he did. We are \ntalking about the future Colin Powells, as we debate this legislation \ntoday.\n  GEN David Petraeus is right now leading our efforts in Iraq--a \ndifferent challenge. Under this legislation, his parents would have \nlikely not have made it to this country and his service would not have \nbeen realized. We are talking about the future General Petraeuses.\n  Under this bill, the person who discovered the polio vaccine, Jonas \nSalk, and eradicated polio--his parents would not have made it to this \ncountry and we would not have been the beneficiaries of his genius. He \nwould not qualify with that high-tech percentage and certainly would \nhave gotten very little for family reunification as it is presently \nconstructed. If he happened to be among those family members now being \nclaimed by a U.S. citizen after May 1, 2005, he would be out of luck, \nhis right to be here would have been gone, and we would have lost one \nof the great scientists of our time.\n  Thomas Edison. His is the effort that in fact has made this Chamber \nlight up, our homes light up, our businesses light up. I am \nparticularly proud of Thomas Edison, of Menlo Park, New Jersey. Under \nthis bill--if we do not change it by that which are being described as \nkiller amendments--we would not have had a Thomas Edison because his \nparents would not have qualified under this bill.\n  Bob Hope. He went across the globe making sure our service men and \nwomen--who were giving of their all--were entertained. He brought \nlaughter to us. He brought laughter to them in some of the most \ndifficult theaters in the world. Under this bill, it is likely we would \nnot have had Bob Hope as a national treasure.\n  So it seems to me when I listen to the suggestion that amendments on \nfamily reunification, particularly those upholding the right of a \nUnited States citizen today, who has filed for his family member--and \nwhere that right has been snuffed out, yet someone who crossed the \nborder illegally and did not wait their turn, follow the rules, and \nobey the law has a better position--that is not about the rule of law.\n  The second set of propositions I want to talk about--and I spent a \nlot of time with these Senators, and I appreciate enormously the work \nthey did. I really do. I think there are many aspects of this bill that \nare very good. Certainly, the security aspect is out there, big time. \nThere are a lot of elements of the security aspect of this bill.\n  There are aspects that certainly recognize the economic future of our \ncountry. There is certainly finding a pathway to earned legalization--\nand it is earned legalization. It is not amnesty. Amnesty is something \nfor nothing. This is certainly not something for nothing. As a matter \nof fact, under this bill, if you happen to have a family of four in an \nundocumented status, by the time the process is finished, it costs you \nnearly $29,000, $30,000.\n  I was looking at the Federal Criminal Code. You can commit crimes on \nnarcotics trafficking, you can commit crimes on possession of weapons, \nyou can commit a series of crimes that have, as a maximum fine, $5,000. \nThis is a civil penalty, and yet we are going to have people doing some \nof the harder jobs in America and their families of four paying about \n$29,000. That is not amnesty.\n  But even though I respect the incredible work of those 12 Senators \nwho finally agreed to move forward with the bill we are debating today, \n12 is not 100. It is not even a majority. No one has a monopoly on how \nto best provide for comprehensive immigration reform. Proponents say \nthis now: that family reunification amendments are killer amendments or \nthat any set of amendments may be killer amendments. But at the end of \nthe day, when it does not go to the heart of security, does not go to \nthe heart of employment verification, does not go to the heart of \nBorder Patrol, does not go to the heart of employment verification, \ndoes not\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\ngo to the heart of even a new system for determining who comes into the \ncountry under a new point system, does not go to the heart of violating \nthe rule of law--but, in my mind, promotes the rule of law--I find it \ndifficult that anyone can say those are killer amendments.\n  They may suggest it now in this context, but I am sure there will be \na future piece of legislation in which they will be arguing on the \nother side, saying that as well intentioned as 12 Senators may be, it \nis not, in fact, even a majority of the Senate; it certainly is not \n100.\n  This is the Senate. It represents, collectively, 300 million \nAmericans. That means all of us come together on behalf of the Nation's \ncollective will, its collective purpose, and its collective common \ngood.\n  Now, in that respect, the bottom line is, when you have amendments \nthat do not go to the heart of security, employment verification, \nBorder Patrol, that do not go to the heart of the ability to follow the \nrule of law, that do not go to the heart of the very essence of worker \nprotections, that do not go to the heart of employment verification, do \nnot go to the heart of the undoing of the balance in the earned \nlegalization system--my God, we are talking about people who are \nwaiting under the law to come to the country in a legal process.\n\n  So I have to take strong umbrage to the suggestion that there is \nsomehow a monopoly on how to provide for comprehensive immigration \nreform, and particularly when amendments that are being offered by some \nof us on family reunification are suggested to be killer amendments.\n  I want to see comprehensive immigration reform pass. A killer \namendment is offered by someone who wants to see it not pass. I did not \ndedicate all this time and effort to try to change one of the Nation's \ncritical challenges in a way that can be tough, can be strong, can be \nsmart, can provide for our security, can fuel our economy, and, at the \nsame time, end human trafficking, exploitation, and bring people out of \nthe shadows into the light--to know who is here to pursue the American \ndream versus those who are here to destroy it--I did not spend all that \ntime to try to kill legislation. I am seeking to improve it.\n  I hope our colleagues, who travel across the country and talk about \nfamily values, are going to join us tomorrow on that amendment. This \ninstitution is the greatest marketplace of ideas. That is what the \nSenate is about. It is in the clash of ideas that we hopefully come \ntogether and provide some of the best possible solutions to some of our \ngreatest challenges.\n  I hope the amendments we are offering in that respect are not \ncategorized as killer amendments but they are categorized as ideas \nwithin this marketplace to improve this legislation in a way we can all \nbe proud of.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I commend my good friend, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Bob Menendez. Since he has been in the Senate, he has \nbrought a passion and a voice of reason to so many issues. It is a \ndelight to have his voice heard in the Senate.\n  In every way, each of the 100 Members of this Senate brings our own \npersonal history and our own personal perspectives to this debate on \nimmigration. The Senator from New Jersey brings a tremendous sense of \npractical experience and personal knowledge, and a sense of how \nimmigration has affected his family and his parents and his community \nin a way, perhaps, that is very unique in this Chamber. His \ncontributions to the whole debate on immigration reform--not only here \nin the Senate this year but throughout his entire history in public \nservice--are something we all very much appreciate. We hope to be able \nto work with him as we move forward and try to get to a final \nconclusion on this bill. His comments are comments which are not only \neloquent, they are comments which are very much heartfelt by me and \nothers in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, we continue to make significant progress \nas we move forward to getting to some final votes on this legislation.\n  Last week, we disposed of 13 amendments. In comparison, last year, \nthere were approximately 35 amendments throughout the entire debate on \ncomprehensive immigration reform. So last week we accomplished \ndisposing of 13 significant amendments to the immigration reform \nlegislation before us.\n  The unanimous consent request I will propound in a second will add an \nadditional four amendments to this legislation.\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 1167; 1163; 1238; and 1166, As Modified\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto consider en bloc the following amendments, that they be considered \nand agreed to en bloc, and that the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table en bloc: Cantwell amendment No. 1167; Alexander amendment No. \n1163; Cornyn amendment No. 1238; and Grassley amendment No. 1166, as \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1167\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the Attorney General to carry out a program, \n known as the Northern Border Prosecution Initiative, to provide funds \nto northern border States to reimburse county and municipal governments \n for costs associated with certain criminal activities, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I would note that with the adoption of \nthose 4 amendments, when you add them to the 13 amendments that were \nadded to this legislation last week, we have now acted on 17 amendments \nthat have been proposed to the Senate. We have a number of other \namendments that are pending, and we encourage our colleagues to come \nforward with other amendments they may also have. We are also ready to \nmove forward to schedule votes on additional amendments beginning \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, June 5, when \nthe Senate resumes consideration of S. 1348, the immigration \nlegislation, that the time until 11:50 a.m. be for debate with respect \nto the Allard amendment No. 1189 and the Durbin amendment No. 1231, \nwith the time to run concurrently on both amendments and divided as \nfollows: 10 minutes each, the majority and Republican managers or their \ndesignees and Senators Allard and Durbin; that no amendments be in \norder to either amendment prior to the vote; that the amendments be \nvoted on in the order listed here; that upon disposition of the Durbin \namendment, the Senate stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. in order to \naccommodate the respective party conference work periods; that there be \n2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the second vote and that \nthe second vote be 10 minutes in duration, with no further intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me make a closing comment prior to \nadjourning the Senate for the day.\n  We begin our work on immigration reform legislation in this time \nafter the work period for Memorial Day. We have a lot of work ahead of \nus in this week ahead. It is my hope we will be able to work together \nto get to a position where we will have a final vote in the Senate this \nweek on immigration reform legislation.\n  We will hear, as this week continues, many personal stories about \nimmigration, how the families of some Members of the Senate came into \nthis country from different places. You will hear the stories which \noften tell us of immigration which has made us a rich country. I am \nsure we will hear the story of Senator Domenici and his parents and how \nhis parents and his grandparents came to this country as immigrants--\nillegally at one point--and became part of the American dream. You will \nhear lots of those dreams told here as we deal with the issue of \nimmigration reform.\n  For me, the issue of immigration is an important one for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. Today, it is a very important issue for us because \nof the national security issues which are at stake. Unless we are able \nto fix our broken borders, I don't think any of us can say we are truly \nadvancing the ball of national security for our country. The Presiding \nOfficer knows well that as attorney general, the members of the law \nenforcement community hold ourselves up with pride to say we are \ndifferent from other countries around the world because we honor the \nfact that we are a nation of laws and we uphold those laws in our \ncountry. That is integral to making this the great democracy we have in \nour country. So it is very important for us to move forward because we \nneed to uphold those values which are so fundamental--the value of \nnational security, the value of upholding a nation of laws. Those are \nfundamental values.\n  For me, the issue of immigration reform also has some history in my \nwhole family because my family did not immigrate to this country as is \noften thought about with respect to many of the immigrants we have here \nin the United States, families who came here in the last generation or \nthe last 100 years. My family settled the city of Santa Fe, NM, in \n1598. That was some 409 years ago. It was a time when, for the next 250 \nyears following 1598, the part of the Southwest which is now northern \nNew Mexico and southern Colorado was in the hands of the Spanish \nGovernment through 1821 and under the sovereignty of Mexico from 1821 \nuntil 1848. So for 250 years, my family farmed and ranched on the banks \nof the Rio Grande River in northern New Mexico and the southern part of \nColorado and were very much a fabric of that landscape of the \nSouthwest, very much a fabric of those non-Native American settlers who \ncame and who found the great American dream to be a true dream in the \nUnited States in later years.\n  In 1848, the treaty between the United States and Mexico was signed \nand Mexico ceded the northern part of its territory to the United \nStates of America. At that time, those generations who came before me \nand my family were given a choice--a choice to become American citizens \nunder article 10 of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo or, in the \nalternative, they could move some several hundred miles to the south to \nwhat had been a new border that had been created, now several hundred \nmiles along the Rio Grande River, about 400 miles to the south of Santa \nFe, NM, some 500 miles to the south of where our current ranch resides.\n  At that time, my family, like many families of the day and in other \ngenerations as well, made the decision that they would stay. They would \nstay because they knew that this land was their land and those \ncommunities were their communities, that those landscapes were their \nlandscapes and that they would make it their home.\n  So for the generations in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico \nsince 1848 until today, they continued to contribute greatly to the \nAmerican dream in many different ways.\n  In my own case, many members of my family have served in the U.S. \nmilitary and have contributed greatly to the American dream. My own \nmother and father came here to Washington in the early years of World \nWar II. My mother worked in the War Department\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\nat the age of 19, coming from a village in northern New Mexico, and \nspending 5 years working in the War Department as part of that \n``greatest generation'' which gave back so much to America to give us \nthe kind of greatness we have had for the last 60-plus years here in \nthe United States. My father became a soldier in the Army. He retired \nas a staff sergeant after having served his time in the U.S. Army.\n  There were other members of my family. My uncle Leandro, who is my \nmother's brother, 2 years older than my mother, gave his life in the \nsoils of Europe defending this country's efforts in World War II as the \nUnited States of America saved this world from the hands of the Nazis \nand the hands of the fascists who would have turned civilization back \nto a place none of us ever wanted to go back to.\n\n  So today, as we stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate debating \nwhat we should do with the immigration laws of this country, it is \nimportant to remember that this country has indeed come a long way, \nthat we are, in fact, an America in progress, that the America in \nprogress we have seen for centuries and for generations is one we must \nbuild upon. For us here in the Senate to simply accept what some would \nsuggest--and that is that we do nothing with this issue of \nimmigration--is, in my view, a dishonor to our country and to the \nresponsibilities we have. It is an abdication of duty, for those of us \nwho have taken the oath of office to uphold the laws of the United \nStates and the Constitution of our country to make this country greater \nthan it is today, for us to simply say that this issue of immigration \nis too tough for us to deal with and that all we ought to do is somehow \nignore it or figure out ways of sidestepping it and go on to work on \nother issues.\n  I so much admire Senator Harry Reid because he has said to the Nation \nthat he would hold the feet of the Senate to the fire as we deal with \nthe issue of immigration. It may not be a comfortable issue for most \npeople to deal with. It is a contentious issue. The phone calls and e-\nmails--and I am sure every Senator, both Democratic and Republican, has \nhad their phones ringing off the hook for the last several weeks as we \nhave dealt with this issue. Through the courage of Senator Reid, he has \nsaid we will move forward with this issue, and we are dealing with the \nissue. Through the courage of other Senators, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, we have said this is an issue we can tackle. Yes, there \nare tough amendments, and we are working our way through those tough \namendments, trying to make this immigration legislation which is on the \nfloor better legislation, perhaps, than what was introduced here at the \nbeginning of last week, and we are making progress.\n  As I said, I think there are now 21 amendments which have been made \nto the legislation. There will be others we will make as the week goes \non. But at the end of the day, America's greatness really depends upon \nchambers like this Chamber here, which holds the keys to the democracy \nof our country, and debating those issues which are difficult and \ngetting us to a point of a conclusion to deal with these issues which \nare so fundamental to the 21st century of America. When we deal with \nthis issue, what we will have done is we will have found solutions to \nthe issue of a broken border that has been broken for a very long time. \nWhen we effectively deal with this issue, we will deal with the reality \nof the economic demands of the United States of America and how we \ntreat people with the kind of humanity and morality we would expect of \nothers.\n  It is true that when one looks back at the immigration history of \nthis country, there have been chapters in that immigration history \nwhich have been very difficult and very painful for those involved.\n  From 1942 until 1964, there was a chapter in our immigration laws \ncalled the national Mexican immigration program, or the Bracero \nProgram, in which people were brought into this country because there \nwas a need for labor, and we had many of our men and women in uniform \nserving in faraway places, as those in my family were serving at that \nparticular time, but because there was a need for labor in our \nfactories and on our farms, people were brought to this country under a \nprogram. But it was a program that did not have worker protections, and \nthe consequence of that program was that there were many people who \nsuffered and who lived through a tremendous amount of pain because they \ndid not have the protection of the laws of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Today, in the legislation we have brought forward, we have included \nthe worker protections that will ensure these people are protected. At \nthe same time, the legislation we brought forward recognizes the \nimportance of the American worker because even under the temporary \nguest worker program, which is a controversial issue being debated on \nthis floor, what we have said in that part of the legislation is that a \njob has to be advertised first to the American worker and that if an \nAmerican anywhere is willing and ready to take that job, it will not be \navailable to somebody who would come in under the temporary guest \nworker program.\n  So the economic issues, the national security issues, the human and \nmoral issues which are at stake in this debate are some of the most \nimportant issues we face. I am hopeful that colleagues, working \ntogether in the Senate for the remainder of this week, will be able to \ncome to a successful conclusion with respect to immigration reform \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The report was approved by a majority vote of the \n     Committee at a meeting held on May 8, 2007.\n       Senate Resolution 400 of the 94th Congress (1976) charges \n     the Committee with the duty\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\n     to oversee and make continuing studies of the intelligence \n     activities and programs of the United States Government, and \n     to report to the Senate concerning those activities.

Mr. President, on May 24, I voted for H.R. 2206, but I am \ndisappointed that it took so long to complete work on this legislation, \nwhile we have troops deployed and under fire fighting against an enemy \nthat, as few others have in history, seeks our total destruction.\n  For 108 days, the majority held up vital funding for our troops' \nequipment and training. All this time, the majority was playing \npolitics with this funding, even sending to the President a bill that \nthey knew would be vetoed. And this is not my analysis; we know this \nthrough the Democrats' own words. Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic \nleader in the Senate, said, ``We are going to pick up Senate seats as a \nresult of this war.'' And ``well, it doesn't matter what resolution we \nmove forward to. You know, I can count. I don't know if we'll get 60 \nvotes. But I'll tell you one thing, there are 21 Republicans up for \nreelection this time.''\n  So, with that in mind, we finally received the final version of the \nsecurity supplemental at 8 p.m., the last night before the Memorial Day \nwork period. While Democrats finally decided to listen to our generals \nand not MoveOn.org and yielded to Republicans' demand to exclude an \narbitrary withdrawal date, this bill still has serious flaws. A policy \nthat would potentially restrict the very economic reconstruction funds \nthat are necessary to achieve the political and diplomatic solution \nGeneral Petraeus says we need represents bad public policy, to say the \nleast.\n  What's more, I am disappointed to see, yet again, that the majority \nwould use the needs of our troops as leverage to include extraneous, \nand in many cases ill-conceived, spending and policy provisions. Among \nthese are a raise in the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour; $22 \nmillion in Corps of Engineers funding specifically earmarked for Long \nIsland and Westchester County, and certain areas of New Jersey; $40 \nmillion in agriculture assistance specifically earmarked for certain \nareas of Kansas affected by the recent tornadoes; $10 million for \nradios for the Capitol Police; several new provisions to give certain \nlabor unions and Continental and American Airlines relief from their \nemployer pension plan contribution obligations; and a provision that \nmandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services approve a \nstate's request to extend a waiver for the Pharmacy Plus program, \nmaking Wisconsin the only state to benefit from this provision.\n  The delay in passage of the security supplemental caused by the \nmajority party created significant disruptions for the Department of \nDefense and for our men and women deployed in the war against \nterrorists.\n  Since the emergency request was submitted by the President, the \nDepartment of Defense has realigned significant funds internally and \nsubmitted to Congress approximately six reprogramming requests driven \nby the delays in the supplemental.\n  Secretary Gates stated in an April 11 letter to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, ``[i]t is a simple fact of life that if the . \n. . [supplemental] is not enacted soon, the Army faces a real and \nserious funding problem that will require increasingly disruptive and \ncostly measures to be initiated--measures that will, inevitably, \nnegatively impact readiness and Army personnel and their families.''\n  Then, Secretary Gates in a May 9 letter to Senator McCain wrote:\n\n       [i]n submitting the FY07 supplemental request in early \n     February, the Department planned on these funds becoming \n     available by not later than mid-April. Accordingly, starting \n     in mid-April, the Department began a series of actions to \n     mitigate the impact of the delay in the supplemental on our \n     deployed forces by slowing down spending in less critical \n     accounts. In addition, funds budgeted for fourth quarter Army \n     operations and personnel costs have been or are in the \n     process of being moved forward and expended to partially make \n     up the shortfall.\n       These actions have resulted in the Army having to take a \n     series of steps including deferring repair of equipment and \n     restraining supply purchases. In short, these steps, while \n     necessary to account for the delay in the supplemental, have \n     already caused disruptions within the Department.\n\n  Mr. President, here are just a few specific examples of disruptions \nthat have occurred within the Army:\n\n       Facility maintenance and purchases for barracks, mold \n     abatement projects, and dining facilities has been deferred. \n     As a result, there is a risk of troops returning from combat \n     tours to sub-standard barracks and facilities that had been \n     scheduled for renovation or updates while soldiers were \n     deployed;\n       Orders of supplies have been reduced. Deferring orders for \n     major repair parts and unit level maintenance items creates \n     system lag and an accumulation of backlogged orders waiting \n     to be placed. Units can sustain operations for only a limited \n     time by consuming existing inventory.\n\n  In his May 9 letter to Senator McCain, Secretary Gates also made \nclear that these disruptions would have effects on the war effort:\n\n       [T]he lack of timely supplemental funds has limited the \n     Department's ability to properly contract for the \n     reconstitution of equipment for both the active and reserve \n     forces. This situation increases the readiness risk of our \n     military with each passing day should the nation require the \n     use of these forces prior to the equipment becoming \n     available. In other cases, the funding delay negatively \n     impacts our forces in the field by needlessly delaying the \n     accelerated fielding of new force protection capabilities \n     such as the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle \n     and counter-IED technologies developed and acquired by the \n     Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO). Finally, the ongoing \n     delay resulted in the depletion of funds necessary to \n     accelerate the training of Iraqi security forces.\n\n  Multinational Force-Iraq spokesman, Army Maj. Gen. William Caldwell, \non April 4 said, ``At the current moment, because of this lack of \nfunding, MNSTC-I--Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq--is \nunable to continue at the pace they were in the developmental process \nof the Iraqi security forces . . . It is starting to have some impact \ntoday, and will only have more of an impact over time.''\n  While I firmly believe that the manner in which Democrats managed \nthis legislation reveals their misplaced priorities, it is absolutely \nnecessary that we get this funding to the men and women on the front \nline without further delay. That is why I voted for this supplemental. \nHaving forced our troops to wait 108 days for this needed funding, \nthere is no other choice but to accept this legislative blackmail.\n  I would also like to speak to a larger point, Mr. President. My \nfriends on the other side of this issue in both houses talk about a \nfailed strategy, and about a war that is lost. How do they know the \nPetraeus strategy has failed? It isn't even in place yet. The fifth \nbrigade of the surge isn't there yet, and the fourth has only just \narrived.\n  Even commentators like Joel Klein of Time magazine, no friend of this \nadministration or this policy, have been forced to admit that progress \nis being made. While pointing out the many struggles that remain, Mr. \nKlein said:\n\n       There is good news from Iraq, believe it or not. It comes \n     from the most unlikely place: Anbar province, home of the \n     Sunni insurgency. The level of violence has plummeted in \n     recent weeks. An alliance of U.S. troops and local tribes has \n     been very effective in moving against the al-Qaeda foreign \n     fighters. A senior U.S. military official told me--confirming \n     reports from several other sources--that there have been ``a \n     couple of days recently during which there were zero \n     effective attacks and less than 10 attacks overall in the \n     province (keep in mind that an attack can be as little as one \n     round fired). This is a result of sheiks stepping up and \n     opposing AQI [al-Qaeda in Iraq] and volunteering their young \n     men to serve in the police and army units there.'' The \n     success in Anbar has led sheiks in at least two other Sunni-\n     dominated provinces, Nineveh and Salahaddin, to ask for \n     similar alliances against the foreign fighters. And, as \n     Time's Bobby Ghosh has reported, an influential leader of the \n     Sunni insurgency, Harith al-Dari, has turned against al-Qaeda \n     as well. It is possible that al-Qaeda is being rejected like \n     a mismatched liver transplant by the body of the Iraqi \n     insurgency.\n\n  What is now happening is an attempt to reconsider the vote of four \nyears ago\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\nwhen, by large bipartisan majorities in both chambers, we authorized \nthis war. In an effort to appease far left-wing groups, some are \nattempting to distance themselves from their votes to authorize this \npolicy, and from their own statements acknowledging what the \nintelligence information told us: Saddam Hussein posed a grave threat \nto America's national security.\n  What they're not doing is talking about the consequences of defeat. \nIt is clear from respected national security figures like General \nAnthony Zinni that ``This is no Vietnam or Somalia or those places \nwhere you can walk away. If we just pull out, we will find ourselves \nback in short order.''\n  Additionally, even the Brookings Institution released a study that \nargues:\n\n       Iraq appears to have many of the conditions most conducive \n     to spillover because there is a high degree of foreign \n     ``interest'' in Iraq. Ethnic, tribal, and religious groups \n     within Iraq are equally prevalent in neighboring countries \n     and they share many of the same grievances. Iraq has a \n     history of violence with its neighbors, which has fostered \n     desires for vengeance and fomented constant clashes. Iraq \n     also possesses resources that its neighbors covet--oil being \n     the most obvious, but important religious shrines also figure \n     in the mix. There is a high degree of commerce and \n     communication between Iraq and its neighbors, and its borders \n     are porous. All of this suggests that spillover from an Iraqi \n     civil war would tend toward the more dangerous end of the \n     spillover spectrum.\n\n  We cannot forget that Iran and Syria are fostering instability in \nIraq. Al-Qaida and Hezbollah are both active there as well.\n  As I have mentioned before, but have not heard answered from the \ncritics, we know that chaos in Iraq could draw in others in the region. \nFor example, Saudi Arabian officials have threatened ``massive \nintervention to stop Iranian-backed Shiite militias from butchering \nIraqi Sunnis.'' A Kurdish secession would likely cause Turkish \nintervention.\n  Does anyone in Congress disagree that failing in Iraq would be a \ndramatic setback in the war against terrorists? Iraq must not be \ndivorced from its context--the struggle between the forces of \nmoderation and extremism in the Muslim world. After all, al-Qaida has \nbeen in Iraq since before the U.S. invaded and has dedicated itself to \nfomenting sectarian violence there. Osama bin Laden referred to Iraq as \n``capital of the Caliphate,'' arguing that ``[t]he most . . . serious \nissue today for the whole world is this Third World War . . . [that] is \nraging in [Iraq].''\n  Terrorism expert Peter Bergen has told us that a:\n\n       [U.S. withdrawal] would fit all too neatly into Osama bin \n     Laden's master narrative about American foreign policy. His \n     theme is that America is a paper tiger that cannot tolerate \n     body bags coming home; to back it up, he cites President \n     Ronald Reagan's 1984 withdrawal of United States troops from \n     Lebanon and President Bill Clinton's decision nearly a decade \n     later to pull troops from Somalia. A unilateral pullout from \n     Iraq would only confirm this analysis of American weakness \n     among his jihadist allies.\n\n  Failure in Iraq will encourage further attacks against the United \nStates and provide a base from which to plan and train for attacks.\n  I will remind my friends who pushed so hard for this legislation, and \nwho cheered for votes on an immediate withdrawal, and the passage of \nthe first security supplemental which the President correctly vetoed, \nif you are going to advocate a strategy for failure or a precipitous \nwithdrawal, you have the responsibility to tell the American people \nwhat the consequences would be, and to tell them how you would respond. \nThese are the burdens of leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S6996-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6996-S7000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last August, Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye \nled a bipartisan group of Senators to China for a parliamentary visit. \nDan, of course, was accorded great respect because of his winning the \nCongressional Medal of Honor during World War II. But it was Ted \nStevens for whom the Chinese rolled out the red carpet. Ted had flown \nwith the Flying Tigers. He flew the first plane to land in Beijing \nafter World War II ended, and the top Chinese leaders had not \nforgotten. They made more time for our delegation than they had for any \nother recent group of American visitors.\n  No one in our group, of course, was surprised to learn that Ted \nStevens had flown risky missions and, for that bravery, earned the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. Ted still has the cockiness, adventuresome \nspirit and attitude that distinguish most pilots. And he has the love \nof country that permeates those who fought in World War II. We see both \nqualities every day in the Senate.\n  For example, 2 years ago, when we were considering how to maneuver \nthrough five Senate committees legislation based on a National \nAcademies report that would help America keeps its brainpower \nadvantage, Ted was both unconcerned about committee prerogatives and \nimpatient about getting the job done. ``Let's form a select \ncommittee,'' he said many times. ``You be the chairman of it.'' He said \nthis even though he was then the most senior Republican in the Senate \nand I was nearly the most junior. The Senate never formed that select \ncommittee, but Ted made sure the legislation passed because he thought \nit was important for our country.\n  I was Legislative Assistant to Senator Howard Baker in 1968 when Ted \nwas appointed to the Senate. He hasn't changed much in all that time, \neven though he is now the longest serving Republican Senator. In his \nfirst year, he was pushing amendments that would help Alaska Natives \nmaintain their fishing rights. This year, he is still busy working on \nlegislation creating additional rights for Alaska Natives. And in the \n39 years between, he has snagged every dollar that comes within 50 feet \nfor his Alaskan constituents--and some dollars that were farther away \nthan that.\n  Ted Stevens is, I would say, above all, an institutionalist in the \nUnited States Senate. In other words, he sees a unique role in our \ndemocracy for the Senate, and he is one of a handful here who is \ndetermined to respect that role and make it work.\n  I suppose Ted will have opposition when he runs for reelection in \n2008. But, if he does, I wouldn't want to be that person. Last week, \nwalking side by side with him to vote, I took the escalator when we got \nto the Capitol and Ted literally ran up the stairs, two at a time.\n  It would be hard to identify a ``More Valuable Player'' in the U.S. \nSenate than Ted Stevens.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to honor a colleague and a \ngood friend, Senator Ted Stevens, for becoming the longest serving \nRepublican Member of the Senate. I am honored to serve in the Senate \nwith this great Republican.\n  Ted Stevens' career in public service began long before he became a \nU.S. Senator. He served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during WWII, \npracticed law in Alaska, worked in the Eisenhower administration, and \nserved in the Alaska House of Representatives where he eventually \nbecame majority leader. He became U.S. Senator in 1968 and has served \nthe State of Alaska in the Senate for over 39 years. His longstanding \npublic service career truly demonstrates his devotion to this country.\n  Just like his famous Hulk tie, Ted has a bullish tenacity that has \nmade him one of the most effective Members in the Senate. He is a \nstalwart representative for his State of Alaska. Representing a State \nover 4,000 miles from the Nation's Capital, Senator Stevens has \nsacrificed time with his six children and wife to serve in the Senate. \nComing from a large family myself, I appreciate the strength and \ncommitment his family has displayed over the years.\n  During my trips to Alaska, I always leave impressed by the \nspectacular landscape and Ted Stevens' hard work in his State. His work \nhas helped many Alaskan towns receive clean running water and has \nenabled many children to receive a quality education. His persistence \nin the Senate also has provided Alaska with oil pipelines, which have \nbrought tremendous revenue to Alaska and provided our Nation with a \nsafe, domestic energy source.\n  Ted Stevens' work as a Senator has also gone beyond the borders of \nAlaska. During his 35-year tenure on the Appropriations Committee, he \nhas tirelessly persevered to keep America ready and prepared. He has \nensured our troops have the good equipment, training, and pay they \ndeserve. His efforts\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\nhave also ensured funds for military research on some of our Nation's \nmost pressing diseases.\n  I thank Senator Ted Stevens for his leadership and contributions to \npublic service for the people of Alaska and all Americans. I honor him \nnot only for his length of service but more importantly, his quality of \nservice. I wish him and his loved ones the best of health for many \nyears to come, and I congratulate him on his outstanding achievement.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to offer my \nheartfelt congratulations to Senator Ted Stevens on becoming the \nlongest serving Republican in Senate history. While this is a milestone \nto celebrate, the true cause for celebration is not Ted Stevens' \ndecades of service to his party or to this Chamber but his lifetime of \nservice to our Nation.\n  It is a record of service that began long before Ted Stevens came to \nthe Senate nearly four decades ago, long before his contributions in \nthe Alaska Legislature in the earliest days of statehood, long before \nhe helped establish our 49th State at the Department of the Interior \nduring President Eisenhower's administration. At just 19 years of age, \nwith his country under attack and freedom in jeopardy around the world, \nTed Stevens joined the Army Air Corps in 1943, flying support missions \nfor the legendary Flying Tigers. That courage to take the risks and \nthat willingness to step forward to meet the challenges are the \nfoundation of his character and of his service.\n  I have been privileged to work alongside this Senator on the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. On every issue we confront, Ted Stevens \ndemonstrates great knowledge and a total commitment to protecting our \nNation and our people.\n  Alaska and Maine are separated by a great many miles, but our two \nStates have much in common, including spectacular scenery, and rugged, \nself-reliant people. Our States also share a connection to the sea that \nis central to our history and our future. From the Magnuson-Stevens \nFisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to his work to better \nprotect marine mammals, Ted Stevens demonstrates again and again a deep \ncommitment to the hard-working people who sustain countless coastal \ncommunities and an abiding respect for the natural resources that bless \nus all.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to honor an esteemed colleague \nwith whom I have had the privilege of serving in this body for the past \n9 years.\n  As many others have already observed, Senator Stevens is an \ninstitution in Alaska, the Senate, and in the United States. Our \nPresident pro tempore, already the longest serving Republican in the \nSenate, served our Nation heroically in World War II and worked \npreviously in the Justice and Interior Departments. In the latter \nposition, Senator Stevens was an instrumental part of bringing \nstatehood to Alaska--the State of Alaska literally is partly his \ncreation.\n  Senator Stevens and I share concerns about issues important to \nAmerica but particular to the Pacific Northwest. Our States, with vast \nFederal land holdings, play a key role in energy resource exploration \nand development crucial to building viable and plentiful domestic \nenergy supplies. We share views on ensuring local and State governments \nand communities have primacy in handling matters of direct impact on \nthem. Both Idaho and Alaska are home to thriving indigenous \npopulations, and we both work to ensure that they have their voices \nheard in Congress.\n  Idaho and Alaska have other similar Pacific Northwest resource and \nenvironmental issues. Senator Stevens shares my care for and attention \nto these issues. He is an advocate for work to restore salmon fisheries \nand rural community development. I have had the pleasure to work with \nhim on promoting the Pacific Northwest Salmon Recovery Fund and \ndrinking water infrastructure needs for rural Alaska. He is a tireless \ndefender of the interests of Alaskans and one of the greatest tourism \npromotion resources for the State.\n  I have always appreciated Senator Stevens' strong voice and steady \nleadership in the Senate. He has demonstrated an unwavering commitment \nto our military and against terrorism. He understands the enemies we \nface here and abroad and has spent many decades standing strong for his \nconvictions, relentlessly pursuing funding for a strong military to \ndefend our country and our heritage of liberty and freedom.\n  I admire Senator Stevens' strong history of bipartisanship \nhighlighted by his long friendship with the senior Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Inouye. Their working and interpersonal relationship stands as a \ntestament to what can be accomplished when we set party bickering aside \nand focus on our jobs to which we were elected--helping America remain \nthe envy of the world.\n  We share an alma mater, and I am pleased to call him a colleague in \nthe Senate. I am proud to honor the Senior Senator from Alaska, in his \n39th year of public service as a Senator. Congratulations, and thank \nyou for your service.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Senator Ted Stevens of \nAlaska for becoming the longest serving Republican Member in the \nhistory of the U.S. Senate. Senator Stevens is a true leader in the \nSenate. Whether he is making sure our soldiers have the best equipment \nin the field of battle or developing dynamic legislation to transform \nour Nation's communications laws, Senator Stevens has always been a man \nof action.\n  Service to the United States and to his home State of Alaska has been \nSenator Stevens' lifelong mission. To put his dedication to our country \nin perspective, Senator Stevens has been a public servant for longer \nthan I have been alive. At no stage of his career has he ever shied \naway from confronting the challenging issues of the day. In 1943, at \nthe age of 19, he left college to answer the call of his country. \nFlying transport planes over the Himalayas in support of the Flying \nTigers of the 14th Air Force, First Lieutenant Stevens proved himself \nas a leader. In recognition for his service and bravery, he was awarded \nseveral medals, including two Distinguished Flying Crosses.\n  Following the war, Ted Stevens returned to college where he received \ndegrees from UCLA and Harvard Law School. In 1953, he was appointed \nU.S. attorney for Fairbanks. Three years later, he moved to Washington, \nDC, to serve in the Department of the Interior for President \nEisenhower. In 1964, Ted Stevens was elected to the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives, and during his second term in office, he became the \nmajority leader. In 1968, he was appointed to fill Senator Bartlett's \nseat in the U.S. Senate. In 1972, he was elected to serve a full term \nin that seat, and, as we know, the rest is history.\n  During the last 39 years, Senator Stevens has done more for the \npeople of Alaska and the United States than most could fathom. Always \nwilling to address challenging issues in a bipartisan fashion, Senator \nStevens stands by his principles and does what he thinks is right \nregardless of which side of the aisle agrees with him. He led the \ncharge for Alaska's statehood and has made remarkable contributions to \nthe health and safety of the United States. As a testament to their \nbelief in Ted Stevens' leadership, the people of Alaska have elected, \nand reelected, Senator Stevens--never by less than 67 percent of the \nvote in any election.\n  When I came to Washington in 1994, it did not take me long to learn \nwho Ted Stevens was and to admire him as a leader. When I joined the \nSenate 7 years ago, my admiration for Senator Stevens grew. Who \ncouldn't admire a man who dons a Hulk tie when he prepares for large \nlegislative battles? On a serious note, since 2001, Senator Stevens and \nI have worked closely on a number of important issues. For example, in \n2005 when Senator Stevens became chairman of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, he recognized the need to address how to \nmaintain U.S. competitiveness in today's global economy. I was honored \nthat he selected me to chair the Subcommittee on Technology, \nInnovation, and Competitiveness. Through the work of this subcommittee, \nSenator Stevens, myself, and others developed bipartisan legislation to \nmaintain and improve our country's innovation in the 21st century. This \nlegislation, the America COMPETES Act, recently passed the\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nSenate by an overwhelming vote of 88 to 8. Senator Stevens' leadership \non competitiveness legislation serves as a good reminder of how he has \naddressed important issues in a forward-thinking manner throughout his \nsix decades of public service.\n  Addressing the Nation's competitiveness is just one example of \nSenator Stevens' innovative thinking. When he became chairman of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Stevens \nrecognized that our communications laws were grossly outdated. Through \na series of hearings, listening sessions, and a desire for bipartisan \ncooperation, Senator Stevens developed a bill that would have \nencouraged competition in the communications market and fostered an \nenvironment conducive to future innovation. Although this bill did not \nbecome law, I am proud to have worked with Senator Stevens on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I greatly admire Senator Stevens. He sets an example, for both \nRepublicans and Democrats, of a successful Senator. He is a leader, a \nman of his word, and someone whom you know you can count on with \nnothing more than a handshake. I look forward to working with Senator \nStevens for many years to come and would like to congratulate him for a \nlifetime of accomplishments.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be a part of this \ncelebration of Senator Ted Stevens's service in the Senate. For those \nof us who know him, it is more than taking a moment to congratulate him \nas he becomes the longest serving Republican Senator in the history of \nthe Senate. It is an opportunity to acknowledge all he has done to \nstand up for the State of Alaska. It is also a chance to take note of \nthe example he provides of leadership and the way he has always put the \nneeds of the people of Alaska at the very top of his work agenda in the \nSenate. That is why, in 2000, Ted was named the Alaskan of the Century.\n  Ted is a remarkable guy, and I don't think any Senator is more tied \nto the day-to-day life of the States we represent and the hearts of the \npeople back home than he is. There are a lot of reasons for that, not \nthe least of which is the certainty Alaskans have that the needs of \ntheir State are in good hands because Ted Stevens is championing their \ncause.\n  Ted is one of our great environmentalists and it is a philosophy he \nputs into practice every day in thought, word, and deed. Whenever I \nthink of him, I think of all he has done and continues to do to protect \nand preserve the natural beauty of Alaska. It is a wonderful State that \nI have been privileged to visit at Ted's invitation. I have always said \nthat God saved some of his best handiwork for Wyoming. Having seen \nAlaska, I think he did a good job there too.\n  If you ask me and those who have come to know him through the years, \nwe will tell you that Ted is a man of action. He says what he means and \nhe means what he says. He works hard for the things he believes in, and \nin the end, I don't think anyone is better at getting results. That is \nbecause Ted knows it is a lot more important to get things done than to \nget them said. You won't find him content to just give speeches. After \nall is said, and said with great force, Ted puts his time and effort \nwhere his mouth is as he rolls up his sleeves and gets to work.\n  Ted not only knows and loves the terrain of Alaska, he loves showing \nit off too. That is why he puts so much of himself into promoting the \nKenai Tournament. This great Alaskan tournament gives all who take part \na chance to enjoy the fantastic fishing of Alaska, but it is also a \ngreat fundraiser that helps provide the funds that are needed to \nrestore and improve the habitat of the salmon in Alaska.\n  Here in the Senate, Ted has also worked quietly on many bills that \nwere drafted to preserve wild salmon. Whether it is protecting his home \nState on the floor or promoting it here and back home, Ted Stevens is \nthe voice of Alaska.\n  Another thing Wyoming and Alaska share is our rural environment. Ted \nunderstands the unique needs of rural life better than any Senator I \nknow, and he has been a tireless worker on transportation and \ncommunication issues. He worked hard to preserve universal service so \npeople in both our States would have phone service at a reasonable \nrate. That effort meant a great deal not only to the people of our \nStates but to those who live in other rural areas across the United \nStates as well.\n  As I have come to know Ted, I have developed a great appreciation for \nhis ability to pick up on the nuances and details of the issues we take \nup on the Senate floor. He is a fast study, and he is not afraid of any \nissue, no matter how complicated and complex it is.\n  Another thing we all think of whenever we think of Ted is that \ndistinctive voice of his. His voice has the same power that his words \nbring to the debate, and it is that unique way of speaking of his that \ngets everyone's attention and usually their agreement too.\n  Through his years in the Senate, Ted has compiled an incredible \nrecord for the people of his State. He has won the hearts of Alaskans, \nand on election day, people from all over the State make it a point to \nvote for him. He is not just their Senator, he is also a bit of a \nsuperhero, too.\n  Speaking of superheroes, which are near and dear to Ted's heart, in \nthe comics, whenever Dr. Banner faces a difficult challenge that \nrequires superpowers, he turns into the Incredible Hulk. On the Senate \nfloor, if the Incredible Hulk faced a challenge that required \nsuperpowers of persuasion and reason, he would probably turn into Ted \nStevens.\n  Congratulations, Ted. We are proud of the record you have established \nin the Senate. Thank you for your leadership, the unique strengths and \nabilities you bring to our work, and most of all, thank you for the \ngift of your friendship.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President. I am very pleased to help recognize \nSenator Ted Stevens as the longest-serving Republican in the history of \nthe U.S. Senate. Senator Stevens has represented the Last Frontier for \nnearly 40 years, during which he has become one of the most respected \nlawmakers and gentlemen in Congress. For a large majority of his time \nin Congress, Senator Stevens served with my predecessor, the late \nSenator Strom Thurmond, the Senate's previous longest-serving \nRepublican. Now that the record is broken, I am certain Senator \nThurmond would be pleased to know his good friend, Ted Stevens, will \ncarry on the great tradition of service to our Nation. I am honored to \nserve alongside Senator Stevens and congratulate him on this momentous \noccasion.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish today to congratulate Senator \nTed Stevens on becoming the longest serving Republican Senator in U.S. \nhistory. Senator Stevens has served in the Senate for over 38 years, \nand this milestone is a lasting tribute to his outstanding record for \nthe people of Alaska and for the people of America. On a personal note, \nI have always enjoyed working with Senator Stevens, and it has been a \ntrue privilege to collaborate with him on some of the most important \nissues facing our great Nation--including energy, healthcare, and \nnational defense.\n  Senator Stevens' service to the United States didn't begin when he \nstepped inside this Chamber; rather, his service began decades \nearlier--during some of the most harrowing days of World War II.\n  Senator Stevens was part of the ``greatest generation'' who fought \nand won that global struggle for freedom--flying a C-47 in the China \nBurma India theater. Incredibly, over 1,000 of Senator Stevens' fellow \nairmen died ``flying the hump'' and elsewhere in the Chinese Burma \nIndia theater--a sobering reminder of the high price of freedom. For \nhis heroic efforts, Senator Stevens later received two Distinguished \nFlying Crosses and two Air Medals, as well as the Yuan Hai medal \nawarded by the Republic of China.\n  After the war, Senator Stevens completed his education at UCLA and \nHarvard Law School and then moved to Alaska, which was then a U.S. \nterritory. In the city of Fairbanks, Senator Stevens practiced law for \nseveral years, until he came to Washington, DC, to serve in the \nEisenhower administration and also to lobby for Alaska's admittance \ninto the Union--a mission that succeeded in 1959.\n  When Senator Stevens returned to Alaska, he ran for--and won--a seat \nin the Alaska House of Representatives\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nand later became house majority leader. Then, in December 1968, \nGovernor Walter J. Hickel appointed him to fill a vacancy in the U.S. \nSenate. In 1970, the voters of Alaska ratified that choice by electing \nSenator Stevens to finish that term in a special election and then \nreelecting him six more times, always by overwhelming margins.\n  Senator Stevens' achievements are legendary in this Chamber--\nincluding, but not limited to, chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and President pro \ntempore of the U.S. Senate--putting him third in line for the \nPresidency from January 2003 to January 2007. For his many decades of \nservice, Senator Stevens has received and accepted numerous honors--\nincluding having the Anchorage International Airport named after him. \nOur entire country has been enriched and improved by his hard work, \ndedication, and leadership.\n  I say this not as a distant observer but as an up-close witness to \nhis achievements. Back in 1993, when I first arrived in the U.S. \nSenate, I was one of only seven female Senators, and if the Senate was \na men's club, then the Appropriations Committee was its inner sanctum. \nThere was not a single woman on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, but that is where I wanted to serve.\n  I explained to Senator Stevens--who was then the ranking member of \nthe committee--that Texas has more Army soldiers than any other State, \nmore Air Force air men and women stationed in Texas than any other \nState, and our defense industry builds everything from fighter aircraft \nto Army trucks to artillery systems to sophisticated electronics \nequipment for the Pentagon. Therefore, it was absolutely essential that \na Senator from Texas serve on that committee. After some careful \nthought, Senator Stevens agreed and welcomed me to the committee. Since \nthat time, he has been a valuable mentor to me--not to mention a \npassionate advocate for Alaska and America.\n  And when I say passion, I really do mean passion. Senator Stevens has \nbeen known to show dramatic performances on the Senate floor, keeping \nwandering eyes focused on the urgent issues that need to be addressed. \nOne day, during a markup in the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, who chaired the committee at the time, grew very \nanimated and laid down the law. When a frustrated senior Senator told \nSenator Stevens that ``there was no reason to lose your temper,'' \nSenator Stevens glared back and responded, ``I never lose my temper. I \nalways know exactly where I left it.''\n  But if Senator Stevens has a temper, he also has a compassionate \nheart. I will never forget when a group of protestors gathered outside \nof the Appropriations Committee conference to demand increased funding \nfor breast cancer research.\n  One particularly agitated advocate got in Senator Stevens' face and \nsaid, ``If men were dying of breast cancer, you wouldn't think twice \nabout increasing the funding.'' Needless to say, those words made quite \nan impact on Senator Stevens but probably not what this advocate \nanticipated.\n  When Senator Stevens walked back into the conference, he repeated the \ncharge and then looked around at his mostly male colleagues. He knew \nthat at least six of them suffered from prostate cancer. He also \nnoticed that the bill they were considering didn't fund prostate cancer \nresearch. But thanks to the excellent suggestion of the woman in the \nhallway, he was going to advocate breast cancer research and prostate \ncancer research. Senator Stevens was determined to become a leader on \nthese issues, and over time, that is certainly what he has become.\n  For all of these reasons, and many more, it has been a true honor to \nserve with Senator Stevens. I congratulate him once again on becoming \nthe longest serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. I look forward \nto serving with him for years to come.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Senate colleagues of Senator Ted Stevens \nare grateful that a remarkable U.S. Senate historical landmark provides \nus an opportunity to honor one of the greatest Senators in history as \nhe continues to supply vigorous and significant leadership for our \ncountry.\n  We recognize, today, that Ted Stevens has served longer than any \nother Republican Party Senator, and that record for longevity of \nservice will continue to mount with each new day of Senate history.\n  I would like to believe that the early schooling of Ted Stevens at \nPublic School No. 84 in Indianapolis was a strong foundation for his \nlater success. I enjoyed School No. 84 for 2 years, a few years after \nTed had progressed.\n  Our lives came together again in 1976 when Ted chaired the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee and I was the Indiana Republican \ncandidate against a three-term incumbent.\n  Under Ted's leadership, Jack Danforth, John Heinz, Jack Schmitt, \nMalcolm Wallop, Sam Hayakawa, John Chafee, Orrin Hatch, and I were \nelected: a class of eight freshmen Republican Senators. The overall \nSenate count after the 1976 election was 61 Democrats, 38 Republicans, \nand Independent Senator Harry Byrd, thus highlighting Ted's recruitment \nachievement.\n  But times changed, and Howard Baker became majority leader after the \nRepublican majority was established in the 1980 election. When Howard \nretired 4 years later, five Republicans sought the majority leader \nposition in an election procedure requiring the candidate with the \nlowest vote to retire after each ballot. Senators Jim McClure, Pete \nDomenici, and I retired in that order before Bob Dole, another Senate \nlion, defeated Ted Stevens in a close vote.\n  All of us rejoiced when the GOP won a Senate majority again and \nSenator Stevens became President pro tempore of the Senate. In this \nrole, he became even more vigorous in boosting the Senate's \ninstitutional role and in underlying the responsibilities of each \nSenator.\n  Throughout his unfailing attention to overall Senate duties, Ted has \nbeen a Senator for Alaska on every day of every year. His legislative \nachievements that have boosted Alaska are legendary and continue during \neach appropriations cycle.\n  Alaskans recognized Senator Stevens as the most prominent Alaskan of \nthe 20th century in a poll taken in his State.\n  He also led Alaskan and U.S. Senate attention to the interests Alaska \nand the United States have in the Pacific Ocean and in prominent \nPacific rim countries such as China, Japan, and Russia.\n  I have been privileged to attend Aspen Institute conferences with Ted \nand to participate in legislative meetings with Chinese delegates that \nhe has organized in Washington.\n  He has long been an advocate for health and physical fitness. This \nencourages his friends to observe that he has the opportunity to serve \nwith us for many years to come.\n  I thank my good friend, Senator Ted Stevens, for his personal \nthoughtfulness and for so many great experiences, together, during his \nrecordbreaking tenure in the Senate. I look forward to many new \nopportunities to be with him and to work with him for the benefit of \nour country.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to honor a distinguished colleague, \nSenator Ted Stevens, who is celebrating a major milestone--today \nbecoming the longest serving Republican in Senate history.\n  Appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1968 and elected to finish out the \nterm 2 years later, Stevens has since been reelected to the Senate six \ntimes, never receiving less than 67 percent of the vote in any \nelection.\n  During his 38 years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Stevens has been \nChairman of four full committees and two select committees, assistant \nRepublican whip, and the President Pro Tempore Emeritus.\n  As one of the most effective Senators, Senator Stevens has been an \nardent supporter of our national defense, serving as either chairman or \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee since 1980. A \nchampion of our Armed Forces, he has ensured that our servicemembers \nhave the equipment, training, and pay necessary to be prepared to take \non those who threaten our national security.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Stevens on reaching this \nhistoric milestone today. I am honored to call Senator Ted Stevens my \ncolleague but prouder to call him my friend.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a man who has\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\ndedicated almost 40 years of his life to the service of his \nconstituency. Senator Ted Stevens was appointed to represent Alaska in \nthe Senate in 1968 and has done so in a way that the citizens of his \nState have reelected him six times since. Senator Stevens is currently \nthe longest-serving Senator in the history of our party and a steadfast \nrepresentative for Alaskan conservative values.\n  As a young man Senator Stevens served his country honorably during \nWorld War II. A member of the Flying Tigers of the Army Air Corps' 14th \nAir Force, he is also twice a recipient of the Distinguished Flying \nCross for his heroism in aerial combat. Senator Stevens is in excellent \ncompany as the first recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross was \nCaptain Charles A. Lindbergh, who also set a few records in his own \ntime.\n  I am especially thankful for the work Senator Stevens has done to \nhelp aid the people of Louisiana. Through his position as Chairman in \nthe last Congress and currently Vice-Chairman of the Senate Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee he has worked tirelessly on \nimportant legislation to our State. Especially noteworthy are the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization \nAct, which included provisions dedicated to the aid of the fishing \nindustry in Louisiana following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and his \nessential support of legislation to get Louisiana its fair share of \nOuter Continental Shelf oil and gas revenues.\n  It has been an extraordinary experience to work with as accomplished \na legislator as Senator Stevens in my time in the Senate. I thank him \nfor his service to the citizens of this great country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my long-time \ngreat friend, advisor, and colleague, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, \nwho just became the longest serving Republican Senator in the 218 year \nhistory of the United States Senate.\n  I have worked with Senator Stevens on a wide array of matters, but \nnone more closely than national security and defense issues. Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye exemplify that extraordinary group of \nveterans, largely of World War II distinction and experience, that led \nthe Senate I joined 28 years ago. They found the time to teach the new \nSenators, inspiring them to gain the experience to someday take their \nplaces of responsibility in the Senate. I owe a great deal of gratitude \nto that generation, and particularly to Ted.\n  He has loyally served the men and women of the Armed Forces \nthroughout his long Senate career, particularly through his leadership \npositions on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  My good friend has compiled a remarkable record on national security, \nranging from complex issues of global strategy all the way down to the \nvery basic pay and quality of life issues for the men and women in \nuniform and their families. His own distinguished record in World War \nII as an aviator provides special insights into military matters.\n  Military matters, however, are not the only field in which the senior \nSenator from Alaska has invested his time and passion. Senator Stevens \nhas also fought hard to find ways to meet America's energy needs, \noffering the extraordinary resources of his own State to meet these \ndemands. I think back time and time again when Senator Stevens has \ntaken to the Senate floor urging his colleagues to fully address \nAmerica's demand for energy. Dressed in his trademark ``Hulk'' tie, he \nwas a sight to behold and quite a force to reckon with. If only \nCongress had listened to Mr. Stevens a decade or two ago, not just \nlimited to Alaska issues, but towards a broad world view on energy, \nAmerica might not be so dependent on foreign oil today.\n  Senator Stevens truly loves Alaska. I remember one codel trip in \nparticular. A few years back, Senator Stevens had escorted a small \ngroup of Senators, making stops along the way, up to Prudhoe Bay, one \nof the closest points to the Arctic. Senator Symms, our former \ncolleague from Idaho, and I decided we had enough learning for the day. \nSo, unwisely, we chose to play hookie and dashed from the group for an \nimpromptu plunge in the frigid waters of Prudhoe Bay while the other \nSenators looked on in disbelief. We were quite a sight as we crawled \nashore frozen to the bone.\n  Despite this experience, I am proud to say that Senator Stevens \nhasn't held my rowdiness against me, as he has invited me back to \nAlaska over the years.\n  Ted Stevens is not only a great champion for Alaska, American energy, \nand our Nation's armed forces, but he is also a champion of the Senate. \nOne of the most lasting legacies he has had on this special body, and \none of the legacies he has imparted on me, is his remarkable record of \nwork with new senators from both sides of the aisle. Throughout many \nyears, Senator Stevens has voluntarily stepped forward to counsel new \ncolleagues about the history and intricacies of the legislative process \nin the Senate.\n  I am particularly indebted to him for helping me. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, it is my honor and privilege to today congratulate my good \nfriend, Senator Ted Stevens, on becoming the longest serving Republican \nin the Senate. Carry on, dear friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S7000-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7000-S7001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LYNN CLANCY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I recognize and honor my friend Lynn \nClancy, who retired in January after 20 years of service as my State \ndirector. He is a friend to me, and he is a friend to North Dakota.\n  Over two decades as my State director, Lynn touched the lives of \nthousands of North Dakotans. He handled countless casework requests and \nhundreds of speeches and appearances on my behalf. I could not have had \na better ambassador.\n  Twenty years in itself is a lifetime of public service, but the 20 \nyears that Lynn spent with me was really the culmination of a much \nlonger career in service to the public. This is a man who genuinely \nlives on the tenant that it is best to do good to your fellow man. He \ndevoted his life to helping other people.\n  Not many know this, but when Lynn joined my staff after my 1986 \nelection, he was working as the right-hand man to the Catholic bishop \nof North Dakota, overseeing operations in the diocese. And that was \nafter a long career serving North Dakota's farmers. So he came to work \nfor me with an already long history of public service.\n  That public service began after Lynn graduated with an education \ndegree from the State college in his hometown of Valley City. His \ndegree in hand, Lynn left North Dakota for Turkey and England to teach \nhigh school on U.S. military bases.\n  After returning home to North Dakota, he went to work for the North \nDakota Farmers Union, first as its education director and then \nassistant secretary-treasurer. About that time, he was elected to the \nNorth Dakota legislature as a representative from his hometown of \nValley City.\n  Lynn later received an appointment as North Dakota's deputy \ncommissioner of agriculture, before finally going on to work for the \ndiocese. And that is where I found him.\n  Part of what drives Lynn is his affinity for the land, and his \naffinity for those people who are the stewards of the land. In North \nDakota, those stewards are our farmers and our good friends, the first \nAmericans.\n  Lynn shares a special bond with North Dakota's Native Americans. \nLeaders of the American Indian community liken Lynn's special qualities \nto that of a tribal elder. Over the years, he worked tirelessly to \nensure that our tribes had equal access to all parts of our Federal and \nState government. His goal was always to make sure Native Americans \nwere equal before the law.\n  In the 1990s Lynn was instrumental to the success of the Walking \nShield Housing Project, which helped alleviate a housing crisis on the \nreservations of Spirit Lake, Fort Berthold, Standing Rock, and Turtle \nMountain.\n  When he told me about his plans for retirement, Lynn said one of his \ngreatest joys has been working closely with Native Americans, learning \nabout their culture and experiencing their hospitality. So while it is \ntrue that Lynn is a naturally gentle and soft-spoken man, it is also \ntrue that North Dakota's Native Americans may not have a fiercer \nadvocate than Lynn Clancy.\n  Lynn's devotion to the family farmer started with his own experiences \non the\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nfarm where he lived and worked as a young man. Over the years, from his \ntime with the Farmers Union to his leadership in the State agriculture \ndepartment, Lynn became the ``go to'' person in North Dakota for any \nfarm-related concern. Whether it was helping one farmer cut through the \nbureaucratic red tape, or helping organize a massive farm rally, Lynn \nshowed patience, persistence, and skill.\n  Farmers and Native Americans shared that special place in Lynn's \nheart with one more thing--Marketplace for Entrepreneurs. Never were \nLynn's passion, creativity, and dedication more evident than with \nMarketplace.\n  Today, Marketplace is North Dakota's signature initiative to develop \nthe State's economy--the largest and longest running business \ndevelopment effort in North Dakota. But in 1988, it had much humbler \norigins. North Dakota farmers were suffering through a searing drought. \nThe auction barns were buzzing while the grain silos went silent. \nNothing was in as short a supply in North Dakota as hope.\n  Lynn gave our farmers hope. Lynn was the force behind making \nMarketplace possible year after year, creating an opportunity for \nfarmers and others from around the State to gather and think of new \nways to update their operations to reach new markets--and ultimately \nstay in business and stay on the land. Lynn's vision and determination \nwere vital to the eventual recovery of many farmers and to making \nMarketplace the enormous success that it is today. That first \nMarketplace drew about 800 people. Today, thanks to Lynn, we draw more \nthan 10,000 people. It is a tremendous success.\n  Hearing all this may lead you to ask how a man could devote so much \nof his life to service. The answer is that Lynn has faith. It is \ncentral to his life. He serves as an ordained Catholic deacon in the \nBismarck parish. In March, he was appointed to the Rural Life Committee \nof the North Dakota Conference of Churches. And even in retirement, \nLynn and his wife, Janice, are working long hours as volunteers.\n  In both his public life and his personal friendships, Lynn's \nfellowship, devotion, and loyalty set examples for us all. Whenever I \nneeded him, he was there. Whenever North Dakota needed him, he was \nthere. He lives his life in service, making other people's lives \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S7001-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WRITING CHALLENGE 2007\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Do the Write Thing Challenge, or DtWT, \nis a national program designed to give middle school students an \nopportunity to examine both the causes and the effects of youth \nviolence. In this program, students work together through classroom \ndiscussion and writing to evaluate what preventative measures should be \ntaken with an emphasis on personal responsibility. Since the program's \nfounding in 1994, more than 350,000 students have participated within \n28 different jurisdictions, including Detroit.\n  In 2006, more than 40,000 students submitted their essays, poems, \nplays, or songs to be considered in the DtWT writing contest. These \nstudents wrote about how violence impacts their lives and what they \ncould do to prevent its reoccurrence. Students are also asked to make a \npersonal commitment to carry out their ideas in their daily lives.\n  Each year, a DtWT committee made up of business, community, and \ngovernment leaders from each participating jurisdiction reviews the \nwriting samples and selects two national finalists, one boy and one \ngirl from their area. I am pleased to recognize this year's national \nfinalists from Detroit, Marcelle Walker and Brandi Baldwin-Gat, for \ntheir outstanding work and dedication to the prevention of youth \nviolence.\n  Marcelle and Brandi have written very passionate literary pieces \nabout how both gang violence and domestic violence have affected their \nlives and have influenced them to think practically about what could \nand should be done. They have conveyed a deep understanding of youth \nviolence, and I am impressed by the maturity they have shown in their \nwork and congratulate them on being selected as national finalists.\n  In July, Marcelle and Brandi will join the other DtWT national \nfinalists in Washington, DC, for National Recognition Week. They will \nattend a recognition ceremony and have their work permanently placed in \nthe Library of Congress. Also, they will have the opportunity to share \ntheir thoughts on youth violence with Members of Congress and other \npolicymakers.\n  I know my colleagues join me in celebrating the work of all of the \nDtWT participants from around the country. I would also like to thank \nthe DtWT organizers who make a commitment to facilitating open \ndiscussions about youth violence. Their work is an essential means to \nthe development of local solutions to the youth violence problem in our \nnation.\n  With the tragedy of Virginia Tech fresh in our minds, I believe it is \nimportant we recognize the efforts of DtWT participants and organizers \nto help prevent such acts of violence. It is also important that we, as \nMembers of Congress, support their efforts through our actions. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting legislation that would help \nprevent youth violence by increasing police patrol on our streets, by \nincreasing resources for school and community violence prevention \nprograms, and by making it more difficult for children and criminals to \nacquire dangerous firearms.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the New \nJerusalem Full Gospel Baptist Church on its Founders Day. As the \nlargest church in Genesee County, the NJFGBC has contributed over 43 \nyears of committed service to the southeastern Michigan community.\n  In 1965, the New Jerusalem Full Gospel Baptist Church was founded as \nthe Rose Hill Baptist Mission by a small group of Genesee County \ncitizens at the home of Rev. L.W. Owens in Flint, MI. Seven days later, \nthe mission was renamed New Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church. The \nchurch grew steadily, and in 1968 a new and larger edifice was acquired \nto better accommodate the growing membership. While the congregation \nhas undergone many changes and expansions throughout the years, it \nremained enthusiastically devoted to its activities and its service to \nthe City of Flint. By the early 1990s membership had grown to more than \n2,100, and the church was renamed the New Jerusalem Full Gospel Baptist \nChurch.\n  In 1969, the Reverend Odis A. Floyd was unanimously elected pastor of \nthe NJFGBC. As the grandson of the founder, Reverend Owens, Reverend \nFloyd has proven to be a charismatic leader of this passionate church \ncommunity. In his many years of faithful service to the church, he has \noverseen numerous outreach programs, including Operation Blessing. This \nvital program is designed to provide food and clothing to those in need \nin the Flint community. Reverend Floyd also manages the New Jerusalem \nIntervention Ministry Team, which provides counseling and social work \nservices to the less fortunate. Under Reverend Floyd's capable \nleadership, the New Jerusalem Full Gospel Baptist Church has become a \npowerful force for change in the Flint community. With over 30 years of \ndedicated leadership, Reverend Floyd has shown steadfast resolve and \ndetermination in his role as pastor of the New Jerusalem Full Gospel \nBaptist Church.\n  During its 43 years of existence, the New Jerusalem Full Gospel \nBaptist Church has made many important contributions to its community \nand has a rich tradition of serving Flint area residents, which is \nevidenced by programs such as Operation Blessing and the Intervention \nMinistry Team. I know my colleagues join me in commending the work of \nThe New Jerusalem Full Gospel Baptist Church and Reverend Floyd for \ntheir many years of excellent work in the Flint community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S7001-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7001-S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING SMALL BUSINESS ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, tomorrow at the Smithsonian National \nMuseum of American History, Elsie the Cow will be present to celebrate \nthe 150th anniversary of Borden Cheese.\n  Borden Cheese started in 1857, when Gail Borden began selling his \npatented condensed milk that allowed milk to last much longer than the \n3 days it would currently hold in its natural state. This condensed \nmilk was used in large ration amounts by the Union Army during the \nCivil War. Gail Borden's modernization of dairy practices in the \n``Dairyman's Ten Commandments'' created a model for modern health \ndepartment regulations.\n  Elsie the Cow entered the picture for Borden almost 90 years ago. Not \nonly has she represented the face of Borden, but she also toured the \nNation to support purchasing U.S. war bonds during World War II. Her \nsupport sold $10 million in war bonds.\n  Today, Borden is a member of Missouri-based Dairy Farmers of America, \na 22,000-member farm cooperative. I am pleased to honor Borden and \nElsie on their important anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S7002-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S7002-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/04/senate-section/article/S7002-5", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on May 25, 2007, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2206.

INCREASE IN FEDERAL JUDGESHIPS IN DISTRICTS WITH \n                   LARGE NUMBERS OF CRIMINAL IMMIGRATION CASES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Based on the recommendations made by the \n     2007 Judicial Conference and the statistical data provided by \n     the 2006 Federal Court Management Statistics (issued by the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts), the \n     Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal courts along the southwest border of the United \n     States have a greater percentage of their criminal caseload \n     affected by immigration cases than other Federal courts.\n       (2) The percentage of criminal immigration cases in most \n     southwest border district courts totals more than 49 percent \n     of the total criminal caseloads of those districts.\n       (3) The current number of judges authorized for those \n     courts is inadequate to handle the current caseload.\n       (4) Such an increase in the caseload of criminal \n     immigration filings requires a corresponding increase in the \n     number of Federal judgeships.\n       (5) The 2007 Judicial Conference recommended the addition \n     of judgeships to meet this growing burden.\n       (6) The Congress should authorize the additional district \n     court judges necessary to carry out the 2007 recommendations \n     of the Judicial Conference for district courts in which the \n     criminal immigration filings represented more than 49 percent \n     of all criminal filings for the 12-month period ending \n     September 30, 2006.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase \n     the number of Federal judgeships, in accordance with the \n     recommendations of the 2007 Judicial Conference, in district \n     courts that have an extraordinarily high criminal immigration \n     caseload.\n       (c) Additional District Court Judgeships.--\n       (1) Permanent judgeships.--\n       (A) In general.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate--\n       (i) 4 additional district judges for the district of \n     Arizona;\n       (ii) 1 additional district judge for the district of New \n     Mexico;\n       (iii) 2 additional district judges for the southern \n     district of Texas; and\n       (iv) 1 additional district judge for the western district \n     of Texas.\n       (B) Conforming amendments.--In order that the table \n     contained in section 133(a) of title 28, United States Code, \n     reflect the number of additional judges authorized under \n     paragraph (1), such table is amended--\n       (i) by striking the item relating to Arizona and inserting \n     the following:\n\n``Arizona.........................................................16'';\n\n       (ii) by striking the item relating New Mexico and inserting \n     the following:\n\n``New Mexico...................................................7''; and\n\n       (iii) by striking the item relating to Texas and inserting \n     the following:\n\n``Texas\n  Northern.......................................................... 12\n  Southern.......................................................... 21\n  Eastern...........................................................  7\n  Western.........................................................14''.\n\n       (2) Temporary judgeships.--\n       (A) In general.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate--\n       (i) 1 additional district judge for the district of \n     Arizona; and\n       (ii) 1 additional district judge for the district of New \n     Mexico.\n       (B) Vacancy.--For each of the judicial districts named in \n     this paragraph, the first vacancy arising on the district \n     court 10 years or more after a judge is first confirmed to \n     fill the temporary district judgeship created in that \n     district by this paragraph shall not be filled.\n\n  SA 1258.
