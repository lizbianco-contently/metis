Mr. President, $4 gasoline is the subject before the \nSenate. It has been the subject before the Senate since the week before \nlast. I am very encouraged that yesterday the majority leader indicated \nwe might be able to move from talking to acting; in other words, to \nbegin to offer amendments, debate on those amendments, and come to a \nresult which would help lower gasoline prices.\n  Each week, for the last several weeks, I have been reading to the \nSenate e-mails and letters I have received from Tennesseans who have \nbeen hurt by the high price of gasoline.\n  For example, Jason from Friendsville, TN, which is a Quaker town near \nwhere I live, is a firefighter with the Blount County Fire Department. \nHe says that currently five of their stations have only one person in \nthem. They rely on volunteers for the rest of their support, but since \ngasoline is so high, response from volunteers has been very small, and \nthey have to allow other jurisdictions to respond. He is not sure how \nhe is going to be able to keep driving across town to help other people \nwhen he can barely help himself.\n  Gina from Elizabethton is a single mother who is spending about $65 \neach week to drive to and from work. She can barely afford groceries \nbecause everything is so expensive. She says they have been living on \nnoodles to get by. She is very concerned that Congress and the \nPresident are doing a lot of talking but not doing anything about the \nproblem, and she says, ``This country is in such a mess.''\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\n  William of Riceville is on disability and his wife is unable to work \ndue to health problems. Rising gas prices have made them choose between \ndriving to the doctor or paying for their medicine.\n  Tina from Nashville is a single mother struggling to support her \ndaughter. They can't even afford to go out to the movies on the \nweekend, she says, because gas and food prices have risen so much. She \nsays that right now she is spending about $200 each month on gas and \nprices keep going up, but her paycheck isn't going up at all.\n  Judy from Joelton is a 61-year-old grandmother struggling to support \nher daughter and granddaughter who live with her. The gas to take her \ngranddaughter to kindergarten is costing $115 each month, and they are \nstruggling to keep her in school. Judy says she is scared for her \nfamily. She has never seen it this difficult to get by.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, \nthese letters and e-mails from constituents in Tennessee be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, the Senate \ncould have, since the week before last, been bringing up amendments \nfrom the Democratic side and the Republican side with proposals for \ndealing with $4 gasoline. Hopefully, the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader are coming to a conclusion today which will permit us \nto start doing that. We don't expect every amendment we offer to be \nadopted, but we do represent millions of people who want us to try to \nsolve the problem.\n  We have before this Senate a very specific proposal for bringing down \nthe price of gasoline. It is based upon the law of supply and demand: \nfinding more and using less. Now, on this side of the aisle, we usually \ninstinctively talk about finding more; that is, offshore drilling and \noil shale, but it is also important to emphasize that part of our plan \nis using less.\n  The United States of America uses 25 percent of all the oil in the \nworld. The fastest way for us to bring down the price of $4 gasoline, \nif it depends upon finding more--supply--and using less--demand--is to \nuse less. What is the most promising way to reduce, by a large amount, \nthe amount of oil we use? Give Big Oil some competition. We believe it \nis plug-in electric cars and trucks. There are a great many Democrats \nwho believe the same thing. That is part of our plan. That is what we \nwould like to have had on this floor for the last 10 days to discuss.\n  The bottom line is this: major auto companies--Ford, General Motors, \nNissan, Toyota--have told us that in 2010, they will begin selling to \nus cars and trucks that can be plugged into our wall sockets at home \nand filled for 60 cents or so instead of filled with gasoline for $80 \nor so.\n  Now, most of these cars and trucks will be hybrids; in other words, \nthey will have a gasoline engine and they will have an electric engine. \nBecause there are new, more powerful batteries, these cars will be able \nto go, in effect, about 100 miles per gallon. These are not being \nproduced by the Government; these are being produced by the car people, \nso they are coming.\n  In addition to that, we have plenty of electricity. We see a lot on \ntelevision from Mr. Boone Pickens, who has a plan, and it would require \nbuilding a lot of new, large wind turbines for electricity, which might \nbe a good plan. Our plan doesn't require building anything for \nelectricity because we already have it. About half our electricity at \nnight is idle. We are not using it for anything. We are asleep. Our \nlights are off. Computers are down. We are not using a lot of our \nelectricity, so we can plug in our cars at night--the electricity would \nbe cheap--run our cars on electricity instead of oil, and here would be \nthe result: We would be trading, car by car, foreign oil for unused \nelectric capacity.\n  Ninety-eight percent of our transportation is oil. Two percent of our \nelectricity is oil. Half our electricity at night is not being used. So \nwe could begin, year by year, gradually converting cars and trucks to \nelectricity, instead of gasoline made from oil. If we converted the \nwhole fleet of cars and light trucks, that would take many years and \nprobably we would never convert them all, but if we did, we would get \nrid of 10 million of the 13 million barrels of imported oil we have \ntoday. Or, if we converted half the fleet--which is a realistic \nassumption over a number of years--we would reduce by 40 percent our \nimported oil and cut by 25 percent our total oil consumption.\n\n  So plug-in cars, which the car companies are making and which we \nwould like to create the environment to support, are coming, and we \nhave the electricity. In other words, the cars are coming, we have the \nelectricity; all we need is the cord, and that is the most promising \nway to reduce oil.\n  I see the Senator from Texas is here. The use less part is something \nthat both sides of the aisle probably can agree on, although I don't \nknow why we haven't been fashioning a program over the last 10 days to \ndo that. We could have been debating whether to have tax credits, \nwhether to have advanced battery research, but we haven't. Where we get \nstuck is over whether we need more supply.\n  Our formula is pretty simple: Offshore drilling, oil shale, and plug-\nin cars and trucks. I say to the Senator from Texas, it seems that \nwhenever we get to the question of needing more American energy, that \nis where we have a difference of opinion with the other side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree, Mr. President, with the Senator from Tennessee. \nThe way I have heard it expressed, it certainly explains my point of \nview, and I think the facts, as they are, are that we need all of the \nabove. We need to use less, we need to conserve, and we need to find \nmore energy.\n  I ask the Senator from Tennessee: To me, it seems as though the \nproblem sort of boils down to how do we generate more electricity and \nthen how do we come up with ways to power our vehicles and fly \nairplanes. As the Senator points out, 98 percent, I believe he said, of \nthe energy used for transportation is oil-based at present. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee has come up with a very commonsense approach--forward-\nlooking--to try to figure out a way, as the car industry has, to do \nmore using of electricity and to reduce our dependency on oil.\n  It would be helpful to look back at how we got where we are today, \nnot necessarily to point the finger of blame but to point to the fact \nthat it is not likely to get better in the future.\n  I ask the Senator from Tennessee, isn't it true that growing \neconomies, such as China and India, are demanding more and more access \nto energy which has fueled their economic growth and, in his view, is \nit likely that is going to reduce anytime soon or just get worse? In \nother words, is this something that is going to go away--a temporary \nproblem--or is this something that is going to become more and more of \na problem as time goes on?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think the Senator is exactly right. In the \nnewspapers today and yesterday was the story of how in India they are \nintroducing a new car which will be sold for $2,500. Now, there are \nmore than a billion people in India. They have a middle class that is \nbigger than the whole population of the United States of America. When \nsuddenly tens of millions of people in India begin to drive cars that \nare powered by gasoline, what happens to the demand for oil in that \ncountry? The demand goes up, and if the supply doesn't go up, too, the \nprice goes up.\n  We have the same thing in China. There is a story in the Washington \nPost today, which is part of a series, about how the Chinese, actually, \nfor status purposes, like driving Hummers. They like big cars. Here we \nAmericans are going to small cars and the Chinese are going to big cars \nand there are a lot of them as well. We know the demand for oil and \ngasoline is going up around the world, and we are in the world market. \nSo for the foreseeable future, as we move to a different kind of \neconomy--a different kind of energy picture--we are going to need at \nleast as much oil as we have today.\n  I say to the Senator, I think the question is: Are we going to be \nsending $600 billion or $700 billion overseas to buy it, or are we \ngoing to be paying ourselves to use it during the next 10, 20, 30 years \nwhile we are moving to a different type of energy environment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know there are some who have suggested \nwe ought to demand that Saudi Arabia\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\nand OPEC actually open the spigot wider, but it seems to me the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is exactly right. The problem is our dependency on \nimported oil from the Middle East and other countries around the world, \nwhen we have oil reserves right here in America that can be developed \nbut that Congress has, in fact, placed out of bounds. About 85 percent \nof the oil here at home could be produced, if Congress would simply \nallow it, by lifting the ban or the moratoria on development of that \noil in the Outer Continental Shelf and the submerged lands along our \ncoastline, and that could help us. I think Senator Domenici has talked \nabout it as a bridge to a clean energy future, where we have more cars \nthat run on battery electricity and we wean ourselves from our \ndependency--not only on foreign oil but on oil, period, because with \nthe growing demand globally, the price pressure on that oil is going to \nget nothing but worse, rather than better.\n  I say to the Senator from Tennessee, I know there has been a lot of \ncommotion on the floor over the last few weeks about whether we stay on \nthis issue or whether we move off it to talk about other issues. I know \nthis side of the aisle has insisted that high energy prices and high \ngasoline prices is the most pressing domestic issue facing our country \ntoday. We have been pretty clear that we are not going to leave, and we \nare not going to move off this issue to something else and leave this \nunresolved.\n  I ask the Senator from Tennessee: Is that an approach he agrees with, \nand does he agree that this is the single most pressing issue facing \nour country from a domestic standpoint in our economy today?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Not only do I agree with the Senator from Texas, but \nso does Jason from Friendsville, TN, and Gina from Elizabethton and \nWilliam from Riceville and Tina from Nashville. Tennesseans want us \nfocused on $4 gasoline. I think the Senator is being generous when he \nsays our position is that the Senate should stay on $4 gasoline until \nwe are finished.\n  Our position is we wish to get on it. We have been talking about it. \nWe have a right to talk, but until the majority leader creates an \nenvironment so we can begin to offer amendments we can then vote on and \ncome to a result on, we cannot act as a Senate. To his credit, \nyesterday he made such a proposal. I understand he is talking about it \nwith the Republican leader. But we could have been doing this ever \nsince a week ago Friday.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas, sometimes I hear people say, well, \nit won't do much good to drill offshore. The debate will probably be \nbetween some senators who will say let's do a little more drilling \nwhere we already allow ourselves to drill, in the 15 percent, and those \nof us who will say let's give States the option to drill 50 miles \noffshore in the 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf, where we \ncan't drill today. By most conservative estimates, that will create \nover time about a million barrels of oil a day. Some say that is not \nvery much in the whole world, but I think of it this way: Every million \nbarrels of oil we produce here at $130 a barrel is 1 million times $130 \nwe are not sending over there to somebody else. If the third largest \nproducer, the United States, adds 1 million barrels a day to its \nsupply, that is a significant addition on the supply side. So it seems \nto me that our contribution, in terms of offshore drilling, both would \nreduce our dependence upon foreign oil, keeping money in this country, \nand make a contribution to the supply side, which helps bring down the \nprice in the world.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee said earlier if \nwe were all to make the decision in 2010 to move to hybrid plug-in \nvehicles, it would take some time to replace the internal combustion \ncars in this country. Some said if we were to open up ANWR, the 2000-\nacre plot of land in a 19 million-acre frozen tundra in Alaska, or if \nwe were to open up the Outer Continental Shelf, it would take years \nbefore the oil would flow into the pipeline.\n  I ask the Senator, if Congress were to send a message today that we \nwere going to allow the development of as much as 3 million additional \nbarrels of American oil a day, whether it is from the oil shale out \nWest, or from ANWR, or from the Outer Continental Shelf, what in your \nview would be the message to the commodities traders who trade oil as a \nglobal commodity, and who buy and sell futures contracts for the \ndelivery of oil? In your opinion, would that have a rather immediate \nimpact on the price of oil and, thus, the price of gasoline?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The answer is yes. I appreciate the Senator's question \nvery much. His figure of about 3 million barrels a day is realistic. He \nmentioned ANWR, the area in Alaska, which is actually the most readily \navailable to us. The history on that is going back to 1980, when \nPresident Carter agreed that 17 million or so acres would be put in the \nArctic Refuge and off limits to any sort of drilling, but that 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion could be drilled. When they were finished drilling, they would \ngo into the refuge. So that has been in place for a long time. There is \na pipeline there. Also, one well is there. So that oil would be coming \nquickly. There is infrastructure around many of the areas where we \nwould do offshore drilling in the United States. But the answer is yes \nto the Senator's question. If the United States added 3 million barrels \nto our production, that would be more than a third of an increase in \nthe production capacity of the third largest producer in the world. \nWhat if we heard that Saudi Arabia was going to increase production by \na third? The effect on buyers and sellers of oil would be immediate. \nMartin Feldstein, a former chairman of President Reagan's Council of \nEconomic Advisers, pointed out that today's price of oil depends upon \nthe expected supply and demand of oil. So if we elect, as the U.S. \nGovernment, to say we are going to significantly increase our supply by \na third, and we are going to reduce our use of oil by about a third, \nover time, from the day we announced that new energy policy, I believe \nit begins to stabilize and drive down the price of oil.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona here. The issue often comes up about \nwhat role speculation has in all of this. Of course, that is what \nbuyers and sellers of oil do. They are guessing: Will the price go up \nor go down?\n  My view always has been that the way you deal with speculation is \nincrease the supply or reduce the demand, because the expected future \nprice, supply, and future demand affects today's price.\n  The Senator from Arizona is an expert on taxation and financial \nmatters. I wonder what his view is on the effect of speculation on \ntoday's oil prices.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will answer that question, but I will \ndecline to take the position as an expert on financial matters. I will \nturn to a paper with which I don't always agree and yet it is one of \nthe leading newspapers in the country. The New York Times editorialized \non this issue yesterday. Therefore, I will perhaps answer by quoting \nabout four sentences from this July 28, New York Times editorial, \ncalled ``Gas Price Follies.'' The bottom line is they agree with the \nSenator from Tennessee:\n\n       Yet all evidence suggests that speculation has little to do \n     with the rising price of crude. From rice to iron, commodity \n     prices are all rising, even without much financial \n     speculation, due to a variety of factors, including a weak \n     dollar and growing demand from China and India.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       A report by government agencies--including the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the \n     Treasury and Energy Departments--found that speculative \n     trades in oil contracts had little to no effect on the rise \n     in prices over the last five years.\n\n  They concluded with this:\n\n       Oil futures are financial contracts for future delivery of \n     oil. Their price has been responding to the same factors: \n     growing world demand in the face of stagnant supply and \n     the expectation that this dynamic will continue.\n\n  So it is precisely the point the Senator from Tennessee was making. \nThese buyers, investors on the market, look to see whether demand is \ngoing to be greater or less than supply. If it is going to be greater, \nthe price is obviously going to go up. That is the bet they place when \nthey buy futures contracts.\n  The best single thing we can do to respond to this and drive the \nprice down is found on the chart of the Senator from Tennessee: find \nmore and use less. The Times makes that point, by the\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nway. If we can reduce consumption, that will reduce demand, but, far \nand away, the biggest answer is to find American energy sources to \nsolve the American energy crisis. We have a huge volume of both natural \ngas and crude oil right here in the United States, primarily off our \nshores, which is why both the Senator from Texas, the Senator from \nTennessee, and I, and most of my colleagues here support more offshore \ndrilling to expand the production of American energy to meet this \ncrisis.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If supply and demand is the major way to deal with \nspeculation, I believe the Republican legislation, the Gas Price \nReduction Act, has in it a couple of legislative suggestions for how we \nmight appropriately deal with speculation, without interfering with \nsupply and demand. The Senator from Texas helped to author that piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator knows we tried to find a consensus or common \nground we could hopefully agree upon and asked some of our friends on \nthe other side to join us and, rather than talking about the issue, \nactually try to solve the problem. So we did include, as part of the \n``find more, use less'' formulation a title on speculation, where we \nsay there needs to be certainly transparency so we can see what is \ngoing on; and to the extent the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nneeds more cops on the beat, more resources to do their job, then we \nneed to supply those analysts, investigators, and resources to be able \nto make sure abuses don't occur.\n  I remember when the Senator from Arizona was talking about this. \nWarren Buffett has been quoted recently as saying that speculation is \nnot the problem. He agrees with the New York Times. He says it is a \nmatter of supply and demand. T. Boone Pickens, my constituent, who has \nmade quite a splash with his energy plans, said if all you are going to \ndo is focus on speculation, that is a waste of time.\n  So we tried to come up with a commonsense approach to this and one \nthat could develop a critical mass of bipartisan support. Until now, \nthe majority leader, who controls the floor in the Senate, has decided \nnot to allow us that opportunity. Yesterday--I agree with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee--it looked as though there was a little speck of light \nin the darkness; a little hope was there that the majority leader would \nperhaps modify his position.\n  I hope we don't leave here this week without doing something \nmeaningful to bring down the price of gasoline. We are certainly \nwilling to listen to the ideas our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have. I suspect that if they have the opportunity to vote, a \nnumber of them would agree with us. Maybe they would have ideas we \nwould agree with, in an effort to build a bipartisan solution. We have \nto do something and, frankly, Congress has been part of the problem. We \nneed to be part of the solution.\n  Mr. KYL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Would it be fair to characterize the Republican approach to \nthis as, in effect, all of the above, and that we recognize there is a \nrole to beef up the agency that deals with speculation and make sure \nthey can do their job, and to provide as much new production as \npossible offshore or oil shale--anywhere we believe we can find that \nproduction--and that we also appreciate the fact that there is another \nside to this, not just transportation, which is energy production, \nelectricity production. We are going to see our electricity costs go up \nand, clearly, nuclear power is a key factor in that, as well as, \npotentially, coal liquification or gasification. As part of all of \nthese--the ``use less'' part, which is to try to eventually convert at \nleast our automobiles to battery-powered vehicles--obviously, it would \nbe more difficult to do that with jet planes and our shipping right \nnow. But we could begin that process.\n  So the Republican view is literally all of the above--to have a \nbalanced approach that recognizes there is no one single thing but that \noffshore drilling would be the best, most immediate way to increase our \nproduction. Would that be a fair characterization?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona. That is a fair \ncharacterization. Unless we include new American sources of energy, our \nelectric prices are going up, gasoline prices are going up, and our \njobs are going overseas. We need both--to find more and use less--and \nwe need to do it now. The $4 gasoline price we are suffering from today \nis the first recognition that in addition to losing less we have to use \nmore new American energy. For us, that includes offshore drilling, oil \nshale, as well as plug-in cars and trucks.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I ask the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nArizona one question. We passed a massive housing bill, a $158 billion \neconomic stimulus package, because we are all concerned about the \neconomy. Let's assume we are successful in dealing with those problems. \nDo you see the rising costs of gasoline and oil and energy as a big--or \nmaybe even a bigger--threat ultimately to the economy, and that it \nmight have the very direct effect of putting us into a bona fide \nrecession?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may respond briefly, there was an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal, I believe, yesterday. In any event, \nthe point of the article was that while we may not have technically \nbeen in a recession, the definition of which is two quarters of \nnegative economic growth consecutively, the reality is that because of \ninflation, primarily fueled by high fuel costs, which reflects itself \nin everything from higher food prices to higher transportation costs, \nwhich find their way into the products we buy--because of that \ninflationary pressure, the reality is that for most Americans, we are \nfeeling the same effects as if we were in a recession, and at the heart \nof this is the energy problem.\n  If we could solve the energy problem in a balanced way, from \nelectricity production, through nuclear power, and offshore drilling, \nand reducing our demand, that would affect our future economic health \nand every American family in this country.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We should work across party lines to find more \nAmerican energy, use less, and that would bring down prices.\n  I thank the Senators from Arizona and Texas who yielded.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     To: Alexander, Senator (Alexander)\n     Subject: Gas Prices\n       Hello My Name is Jason from Friendsville, TN. I am a \n     Firefighter with the Blount County Fire Department. If you \n     dont know we only have 1 man at 5 of our stations we have 7 \n     stations and the rest of the time we depend on volunteers to \n     respond to our emergency and help us, and for the full timers \n     that is a great chunk of our yearly income is running calls \n     on our day off. Because of gas prices our response to some of \n     the emergencies has been very small we have been calling on \n     other departments for help and that ties up their resources \n     should they have an emergency in their jurisdiction. I know \n     they say supply and demand but it is almost like a monopoly \n     they can charge whatever and we have to pay. Someone has to \n     go help put the fire out how much profit do you need to make \n     to live comfortably. I am not sure but just because you say \n     oil is up is no reason for you to raise prices to keep your \n     income the same while ours greatly decreases. I heard our \n     president say we have to stop our dependency on oil and then \n     ! he gets on a jet a jumbo jet with some guide planes and \n     flies all over the place to accomplish nothing but say they \n     have us over a barrel and it is our fault, and then gets on \n     that same jet and flies home to Texas for a day or two to \n     help relieve the stress. I am not saying he has done a \n     horrible job I just think he is failing us greatly in this \n     regard. The gas prices are killng a family of 5 who lives off \n     of a fireman's income and a wife's who does medical billing I \n     am not sure how long I can drive across town to help someone \n     when I can't help myself. The emergency would have to be in \n     my back yard if this keeps up.\n                                  ____\n\n     Subject: How Gas Prices Are Affecting Me\n       Dear Mr. Alexander, I will be happy to share my story . . . \n     I'm a single mother of 1 child. I don't have a car payment . \n     . . it's paid off. I drive a Honda Passport . . . small SUV. \n     I live in Elizabethton and drive to Johnson City (25 miles \n     one way) Monday thru Friday to work. It takes $65 a week now \n     for my gas and that is only to and from work. (That's $260 a \n     month) I don't have any credit card debt, or outstanding \n     debt. I pay for my home and utilities. I am taking from my \n     grocery money, that I have budgeted, to make up for the gas. \n     AND I am buying my groceries now at the General Dollar Store. \n     I can't afford meat . . . so we are living on Ramen noodles \n     and the bare necessities. I bet nobody in Congress/Senate is \n     having to do that! I am so disgusted with the economy\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\n     right now. I have always voted Republican . . . I don't know \n     if I can vote that way anymore. I can't vote for Obama . . . \n     I would have voted for Hillary, because at least when she was \n     in the White House with Bill the first time . . . the economy \n     was great! But now there is no one to vote for. I wish the \n     nation would make a clean sweep and put everybody out of \n     office because it's the ones that are in there now that have \n     gotten us into this mess.\n       And another thing . . . if we sell or trade anything to \n     those nuts over across the sea that are selling oil for $128 \n     a barrel . . . then anything that we sell them should be the \n     same price! I don't care if it's just one paperclip . . . it \n     should be the same price.\n       This is ridiculous! I also think that because this country \n     is in such a mess, NOBODY should be able to spend more than \n     10-12 years in office as a senator or congressman. That needs \n     to change.\n                                                             Gina,\n     Elizabethton, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n     Subject: Gas Prices\n       Senator Alexander my family lives on a fixed income i am on \n     disability and my wife is unable to work due to her health \n     yet she has been turned down for her disability she is \n     practically bed riden. these high gas prices affect the way \n     we live dramatically we have to decide wether we buy gas to \n     go to the doctor and then not be able to buy the medicine or \n     wether we get to buy something to eat. this not right people \n     should not have to live this way. i have 2 children also so \n     you can imagine the delema this causes when the kids need \n     something and you have to either tell them no because we have \n     to have gas to go to the doctor or the store or medicine, i \n     dont know how you think people on social security are \n     supposed to make ends meet when the ends keep moving further \n     apart. it is not right maybe you senators and congressmen in \n     washington should come down to reality in my world and try to \n     live on less than 2000.00 dollars a month my truck has not \n     been near half a tank in so long it would probably quit \n     running. thank you for your time. my name is William.\n       i would be surprised to hear from you.

Because I have to work, I have had to give up \n     things such as prescription medications that I need monthly \n     (no insurance coverage as of June 30th) and grocery items. My \n     daughter and I cannot afford the luxury of leaving the house \n     on most weekends, and if we do, it is only for necessary \n     items. We cannot afford a simple outing such as a movie or a \n     day trip. My vehicle was repossessed in December 2007 because \n     I had not worked since January 2007 and I simply cannot \n     afford to buy the gas to get to work. It is cyclical. I have \n     to work to pay the bills, but cannot afford to get to work.\n       I have noticed that items at the grocery store have risen \n     as well due to gas prices, so there are many things I simply \n     cannot buy anymore. My daughter has had to sacrifice time \n     with her friends because I have to save every extra penny to \n     make sure I can get to my new job that may not work out \n     because it is costing, at this moment, more than $200 a month \n     in gas. When gas prices increase lately, it is usually .10 a \n     gallon. My income has not increased so every month I get \n     further into a black hole that I may not get out of and could \n     possibly lose my home.\n       If there is not some type of relief soon, there won't be \n     anything left to provide for my daughter.\n                                                             Tina,\n     Nashville, TN\n                                  ____\n\n     Subject: Impact of Gas Prices\n       Dear Senator Alexander, I am a 61-year-old grandmother \n     struggling to support my mildly disabled daughter and a five-\n     year-old granddaughter who live with me in Joelton, TN.

Mr. President, I came to speak about a \npersonal tragedy in the lives of a Florida family. But I wish to say at \nthe outset, here we go with all this talk about it is a certain way or \nthe highway to solve this energy problem. As I said on the floor of the \nSenate a few days ago, if we had the political will where we could take \na balanced approach of looking not only at now and drilling what is \navailable, but look to the future for alternatives and renewables so \nthat we wean ourselves from this dependence on specifically foreign \noil, but also on our dependence for decades in the future on oil as the \nstaple of our energy, realizing that if we continue to do that, we are \njust going to be digging a hole for ourselves maintaining dependence on \noil as the No. 1 source of energy.\n  Don't we have enough evidence now that when you have to depend on \nupwards of 70 percent of foreign oil that is not a good economic \nposture as well as a defense posture for national security for this \ncountry?\n  Don't we have enough evidence now that the United States has only 3 \npercent of the world's oil reserves, and yet we consume 25 percent of \nthe world's oil production? And is that not enough to get it through \nour skulls that the way of the future for this country is to cut that \ndependence on oil and go to alternative sources?\n  We are confronting on that side of the aisle, that is very cozy with \nbig oil--they want to have it all their way and say, ``drill here, \ndrill now,'' a simple slogan when, in fact, it is a lot more \ncomplicated today. Yet we cannot get agreement to do what all of us \ndeep down understand is the commonsense thing to do, and that is bring \na comprehensive measure in which we start doing a number of things at \nonce, including pouring the money into research and development and \nfinancial incentives, such as tax incentives, to develop new sources, \nalternative fuels. That is the way to go. Yet we hear this high-blown \nrhetoric about ``drill here, drill now.''\n  It is with a heavy heart that I have to continue to say what I just \nsaid because all we are is wound around the axle in the Senate since we \ncannot get anything passed unless we have 60 votes. And if we cannot \nget the two sides to get along, we have what we have, which is \ngridlock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7583-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7583-S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SAMUEL SNOW\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I \ncome here to speak about an American, who was discriminated against and \nwho lived a life of trying to overcome that discrimination and was not \ntreated fairly by his Government, who unexpectedly died on Sunday. This \nis Samuel Snow from Leesburg, FL. I want to tell this story because I \nwant people to be outraged, as this Senator is, at the way he was \ntreated by the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo articles: one from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer from November of \n2007, as well as the St. Petersburg Times from July 28, 2008, after my \ncomments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, back in 1944, 27 African-\nAmerican soldiers were convicted of rioting and lynching an Italian \nprisoner of war at Fort Walton, WA. Among those convicted was Sam Snow.\n  Following his conviction, he was imprisoned for almost a year, forced \nto forfeit his pay, and then when he was released from prison, he was \ndischarged with a dishonorable discharge. Until recently, there was no \nhope of him receiving any kind of future health or retirement benefits \nfrom his admirable service during World War II.\n  Sunday, Sam Snow passed away, not in his home of Leesburg, FL, but in \nSeattle, WA, because he had gone there, traveling across the country, \nfor a ceremony that the U.S. Army was doing to apologize and award Sam \nSnow with an honorable discharge because for more than 64 years, Sam \nSnow had endured this injustice--imprisoned, ordered to forfeit his \npay, dishonorably discharged--and it was all\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nwrong. The U.S. Army never got around to changing things until an \ninvestigative reporter in Seattle suddenly uncovered this in a book he \nwrote a few years ago.\n  So the Army, last Saturday, was presenting Sam Snow with his \nhonorable discharge. But he got to feeling bad. His son had to go and \naccept the honorable discharge for him. His son brought it back to him \nwhere he was feeling ill. He clutched it in his hands, and a few hours \nlater he died.\n  After that dishonorable discharge 64 years ago, he returned to his \nhometown of Leesburg, FL, with a dishonorable discharge. He took a job \nas a janitor. He took on odd jobs. He even was a neighborhood handyman. \nLast year, when the Army overturned his and those other surviving \nveterans' convictions, they decided they were going to give him his \nbackpay they had taken away from him when he was imprisoned for almost \na year. Mr. President, do you know how much that was? It was $725, 1944 \ndollars.\n  When a bunch of us heard about it, we petitioned the Department of \nthe Army.\n  I have come to this floor many times to quote President Lincoln, and \nI say it again for it is our obligation ``to care for him who shall \nhave borne the battle--and for his widow, and his orphan.''\n  In May, the Armed Services Committee unanimously reported out the \nFiscal Year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act which contains a \nprovision to enable the service Secretaries to adjust forfeited pay for \nall servicemembers who suffer an injustice, such as Mr. Snow, which is \nlater overturned and corrected.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I acknowledge Mr. Snow will not receive \nan interest-adjusted payment for his injustice. I am hopeful, however, \nthat this body will soon take up the Defense authorization bill so Mr. \nSnow's family and others like them receive justice when there once was \nnone.\n  Today I will ask the Secretary of the Army Pete Geren to use this \nauthority to ensure that Mr. Snow's surviving wife Margaret and son Ray \nreceive all benefits that are due to them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish I could tell the story. \nI will do it later on and complete the story.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Nov. 3, 2007]\n\n                 He Stood Tall After Army Dealt a Blow\n\n                        (By Robert L. Jamieson)\n\n       He's 83 years old and has a slight frame, shy of 5-foot-5.\n       The weight he carried for 63 years, after being railroaded \n     by the Army for a Seattle crime he always said he didn't \n     commit, would have destroyed a lesser man. But that's not the \n     way of Sam Snow, whose story offers a road map for how to \n     move on after a crushing blow.\n       Snow was a footnote to last week's news--the Army paved the \n     way to overturn convictions of 28 black soldiers linked to a \n     race riot and hanging of an Italian war prisoner at Fort \n     Lawton in August 1944.\n       Snow was brought up on rioting charges even though he \n     wasn't involved in the fracas.\n       After several months in lock-up, he was dishonorably \n     discharged, which disqualified him from the GI Bill--and a \n     chance at college.\n       He was just 19 at the time, and Seattle was the only big \n     city Snow, from a small, Southern town, had visited. After \n     his ouster from the Army, Snow was hurt and ashamed, derailed \n     from the path of his own father, who served during World War \n     I.\n       He returned to his segregated hometown of Leesburg, Fla., \n     poverty staring him in the face.\n       But this is what Snow did next:\n       He got work as a janitor, rising at 4 a.m. every day.\n       He took on odd jobs working in orange groves or with \n     livestock under a fiery sun.\n       In his spare time he became the neighborhood handyman and \n     never turned down a request.\n       He married his sweetheart, Margaret, and they had two sons \n     and a daughter.\n       He buried that daughter, just 17, after she lost her fight \n     with lupus. He buried his mother after an illness--and his \n     brother as well.\n       He took in his sister's son, who was mentally challenged \n     and nurtured his potential.\n       He put his own sons through college on a blue-collar \n     salary, and they went on to become teachers.\n       He built a home in Leesburg--and built his brother one in \n     the lot behind.\n       He became a pillar of his African Methodist Episcopalian \n     church, rising to become a lay president for the local \n     district and galvanizing people to get humanitarian aid to \n     the Third World.\n       As Snow went from teenager to father to grandfather, there \n     was one thing he never did: Bad-mouth the Army.\n       He did the opposite, actually, encouraging his \n     grandchildren to sign up, Ray Snow Jr., a grandson, told me \n     with a chuckle.\n       ``Yes, I felt I had been served an injustice,'' Sam Snow \n     said when we caught up this week. ``But I decided I wasn't \n     going to hold a grievance against nobody.''\n       He followed a life map of his own: ``Stay patient. Stay \n     humble. Don't be boastful. Take care of your family. And God \n     will make a way.''\n       He always told people God would find a way to shed truth on \n     what happened long ago during his brief time in Seattle, \n     where he was on a stopover before heading to war.\n       During the court-martial, he and the other soldiers had \n     defense lawyers who weren't given enough time to interview \n     them.\n       The prosecution, meanwhile, botched the identification of \n     some men and held key documents the defense should have seen.\n       These--and other injustices in the case--would have been \n     lost to history had Jack Hamann, a Seattle journalist, not \n     written a powerful book, ``On American Soil,'' that moved \n     Uncle Sam to take another look.\n       ``Wouldn't have made it without Jack,'' Snow told me. ``He \n     believed.''\n       As did another man--Howard Noyd of Bellevue.\n       Noyd, now 92, was one of just two defense lawyers who \n     represented the original pool of more than 40 soldiers.\n       ``We weren't given enough time even to interview all of the \n     black defendants and do justice on their behalf,'' Noyd told \n     me this week.\n       ``We were not able to get the inspector general's report. \n     The government was out to get the black troops punished in \n     order to satisfy the Italian government.''\n       Last week, the Army said that military prosecutors had used \n     questionable tactics that undermined a fair trial.\n       In addition, Hamann says in his book, the Italian POW was \n     likely lynched by a prejudiced white military police officer.\n       For Snow, whose life was shaped by two places--Seattle, \n     where fate struck in a bad way, and Leesburg, where he found \n     his way--a gross injustice has been made right.\n       He never planned to stop living even after being so \n     wronged. He always believed a beautiful life was right there \n     for the making. Amen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, July 28, 2008]\n\n                      Burden Lifted, WWII Vet Dies\n\n                            (By John Barry)\n\n       Samuel Snow got his father to help burn his dishonorable \n     discharge papers. Snow kept the secret from everyone in \n     Leesburg--even his own children. For six decades no one knew \n     that in 1944 he was convicted in the largest Army courts-\n     martial of World War II. He worked anonymously as a church \n     janitor. ``No one wants to be a failure,'' he said.\n       The Army formally apologized Saturday for the life of \n     invisibility it had inflicted on Samuel Snow for 64 years.\n       It came just in time. The 83-year-old former buck private \n     fell ill the night before Saturday's ceremony in Seattle. He \n     died hours after his son placed his freshly issued honorable \n     discharge in his hands.\n       Snow was 19 when he was convicted. He had been in a Seattle \n     Army camp called Fort Walton, due to be shipped out to New \n     Guinea. A riot had erupted in the camp between black soldiers \n     and a group of Italian prisoners of war. The next morning an \n     Italian POW was found lynched. Forty-three black soldiers \n     were prosecuted. Three were convicted of first-degree murder. \n     Twenty-five, including Snow, were convicted of rioting.\n       It turned out they had been railroaded. A confidential Army \n     investigation called the case a sham, lacking any physical \n     evidence. A general's report speculated that an MP could have \n     done the lynching.\n       That report lay buried at the National Archives until 2002, \n     when a Seattle TV reporter named Jack Hamann found it and \n     used it to write a book, On American Soil. When Hamann's book \n     was published in 2005, Samuel Snow's secret was out.\n       Snow's youngest son, Ray, said the book answered questions \n     that had always nagged him. His father was the hardest-\n     working man Ray had ever known. He worked ``can't-see to \n     can't-see,'' Ray said, meaning Dad left for work in the dark \n     and came home in the dark. But he worked only small, odd \n     jobs.\n       Dad was living a lie. He had gone into the Army hoping to \n     be a mechanic. He had hoped to go to school on the GI Bill of \n     Rights. He had wanted more than janitorial work. But he \n     couldn't risk an employer checking into his background. He \n     couldn't even tell his wife or his kids.\n       Snow was one of only two known surviving soldiers from the \n     64-year-old courts-martial. The other soldier, Roy L. \n     Montgomery, is in poor health in Chicago. He did not attend \n     the ceremonies.\n       Snow fell ill and was hospitalized in Seattle after a \n     Friday dinner with his family, said Hamann and others who had \n     helped with the case. Son Ray accepted the honorable \n     discharge papers for him the next day. ``My father never held \n     any animosity,'' Ray told the audience. ``He said, `Son, God \n     has been good to me. If I hold this in my heart, then I can't \n     walk in forgiveness.' ''\n       Snow's family was en route home on Monday. A funeral is \n     tentatively planned for Saturday in Leesburg.\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\n       Arrangements are pending for the only thing Snow had wanted \n     from the Army besides an apology: a military sendoff, \n     including an honor guard with spit-shined shoes, a three-\n     volley gun salute, taps on the bugle, folded Stars and \n     Stripes solemnly presented to his wife, Margaret.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7585-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7585-S7588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the two different \nenergy packages we are debating in the Senate this week because there \nare two. There is not just the one that the Senator from Tennessee, the \nSenator from Texas, and the Senator from Arizona were talking about \nearlier. There are two, and I think we need to focus on both.\n  First, with regard to the effort to lift the moratorium on offshore \ndrilling, let me make one correction on the record.\n  It is being repeatedly said by our Republican friends that 85 percent \nof the Outer Continental Shelf is off-limits to drilling or off-limits \nto any kind of leasing. That is not true. The reality is very \ndifferent. The reality is what this chart demonstrates; that is, that \n67 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf today is available for \nleasing.\n  The reason they say it is only 15 percent is because they do not \ncount Alaska, but Alaska is part of the United States. The area around \nAlaska has an Outer Continental Shelf, just like the rest of the \ncountry has an Outer Continental Shelf.\n  It is clear when we look at it that there is a lot of potential in \nthe Outer Continent Shelf around Alaska. In fact, the Department of the \nInterior has two lease sales scheduled for next year in the Outer \nContinental Shelf in Alaska. The Department of the Interior has 16 \nlease sales scheduled in the next 4 years in the Outer Continental \nShelf. This month, in August, they have a lease sale in the Gulf of \nMexico. There is a whole series of lease sales coming up, both in \nAlaska and in the Gulf of Mexico, in areas that are available for \nleasing.\n  So the constant refrain that we hear that 85 percent of the Outer \nContinental Shelf is not available for leasing is just not true, and I \nwanted to correct the record in that regard. If anybody wants to \ndispute that, I urge them to come to the floor and tell me I am wrong. \nBut I am not wrong. These are figures from the Minerals Management \nService. They are the ones in charge of the leasing, and they confirmed \nthese figures.\n  Now let me talk about the other energy-related package which is \nbefore us today. Tomorrow the majority leader has announced that we are \ngoing to vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to \nwhat is called the enhanced tax extenders package. I think the better \ntitle for this would be the energy production and conservation tax \npackage. But let me describe what is in this legislation.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation, and I strongly believe \nwe need to proceed to it, then pass it, and send it back to the House.\n  With regard to energy, the package includes tax incentives that are \nessential to this country if we are going to decrease our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  It promotes renewable alternatives to foreign oil. Among these \nprovisions is the production tax credit. The production tax credit is \navailable for people who put in wind farms.\n  We have all seen T. Boone Pickens' advertisements on television. He \nis talking about the production tax credit. He was before our Energy \nCommittee 3 weeks ago, and he has testified that he favors extending \nthe production tax credit. That is what is in this legislation.\n  It also contains a key 8-year extension of the solar energy and fuel \ncell investment tax credit. This gives companies the certainty they \nneed to make additional capital investments in U.S. solar facilities \nwhile enabling businesses to adopt technologies that can significantly \nbenefit our environment.\n  It includes a long-term extension of the residential energy efficient \nproperty credit through 2016. It allows the cap for that to go from \n$2,000 up to $4,000.\n  It authorizes $2 billion in new clean renewable energy bonds to \nfinance facilities that generate electricity from renewable sources.\n  In the more immediate term, it establishes a new credit for plug-in \nelectric-drive vehicles. I have heard a lot of discussion by our \nRepublican colleagues about how much they favor electric plug-in hybrid \nvehicles. This legislation actually will do something to promote the \ndevelopment of those vehicles. It is a new credit starting at $3,000 \nand increasing for each kilowatt hour of additional battery capacity.\n  It incentivizes commercial vehicle owners, particularly trucks, to \ninvest in idling-reduction units, such as auxiliary-power units and \nadvanced insulation so as to reduce their demand for more fuel.\n  It extends credits for energy-efficient improvements in existing \nhomes and in commercial buildings.\n  In addition to all these energy-related tax provisions, which I think \nare extremely important for us to enact--and let me say, essentially \nall of the existing provisions I am talking about that we are trying to \nextend are scheduled to expire at the end of this year, at the end of \nDecember. We need to extend them so people can make investments this \nfall knowing there is still going to be that tax provision in law come \nnext year.\n  But in addition to these energy production and conservation \nprovisions, American businesses generally have a great deal at stake in \nthis legislation. The legislation extends the research and development \ntax credit. This is extremely important to high-technology firms in our \ncountry. It accelerates appreciation for qualified leasehold restaurant \nand retail improvements. This is small business. Small businesses \naround this country need this provision extended.\n  It extends an important international tax provision for businesses \nthat engage in active financing.\n  Individual families have a tremendous amount at stake in this \nlegislation. First of all, this legislation contains the so-called \npatch for the alternative minimum tax. What that means is that there \nare literally millions of Americans who will be able to avoid having to \ncalculate and pay taxes under the alternative minimum tax if we enact \nthis legislation. If we do not, then they have to go ahead and do that. \nSo this is very important.\n  It extends the child tax credit. I have heard candidates for \nPresident talk about how much they favor the child tax credit. Well, \nthis extends the child tax credit and provides a tax credit of up to \n$1,000 per child to help working poor families.\n  It extends the qualified tuition deduction for higher education \nexpenses--people who have children in university or college who want to \nhave those tuition expenses deducted.\n  It enables retirees to continue making tax-free IRA rollovers to \nqualified charitable organizations.\n  Mr. President, there is another provision that has been inserted by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee that I think is very important, \nand that is the provision we call the Secure Rural Schools and Payments \nin Lieu of Taxes legislation. Three-quarters of the Senate voted for \nthis legislation when it came up before.\n  We have schools around this country in rural areas that are laying \noff teachers today because we have not been able to reauthorize the \nSecure Rural Schools Program. This package will provide $3.8 billion to \nsome 2,000 county governments in 49 States to increase support for \nschools and roads and other critical needs.\n  There is a lot in this legislation that is extremely important, so \nthe obvious question is, Well, why can't we just pass it? Who is \nobjecting? Well, when you try to analyze that question, you get to the \nissue of offsets. Everyone says they favor the provisions I just \ndescribed, but they say--particularly on the Republican side--well, we \ndon't agree with the offsets. Let me take a few minutes to describe the \ndifferent--the variety and flavor of the objections we have heard with \nregard to offsets.\n  First of all, let me say that this is not a new piece of legislation \nbefore the Senate. This legislation came up in June of 2007. We were \nnot able to pass it. It came up in December of 2007. We were not able \nto pass it. It came up again in 2008 and passed with a large margin \nbecause, frankly, there were no offsets in that legislation, which was \nthe Republican preference. It came up\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\nwith offsets again in June, on June 10 of this year, and again June 17 \nof this year, and both times it failed. So let me talk about this \noffset issue. I think that is the core of the problem.\n\n  The rhetoric on the Republican side has been varied. Some Senators \nhave said it is wrong to offset temporary extensions of current law \nwith permanent tax increases. Now, obviously, the fact that all of this \nis adding to the deficit--if we don't offset, it all adds to the \ndeficit--doesn't seem to concern people. But somehow or other, there is \nsomething about permanent and temporary that is out of sync and \nobjectionable to some people.\n  As I understand it, the bill that Senator Baucus has now filed and \nthat we are going to vote on tomorrow addresses this concern. It \nsunsets the extender offsets at the end of the budget window and \nthereby makes sure they are not permanent offsets.\n  A second argument on offsets we have heard from some Republican \nMembers is that they will not accept paying for new tax provisions with \noffsets, but they will not agree to pay for extensions of current law \nwith offsets. To me, this is something of a peculiar argument. Offsets \nof existing tax law would be acceptable provided that the offsets were \nin the nature of a nondefense discretionary spending cut. But if you \nare trying to offset with additional revenue, it is not acceptable.\n  I know this is getting obtuse, but frankly it is getting difficult to \nsort through all the rationale that has been put forward for opposing \nthe legislation.\n  A third argument is that some Members say they are opposed to any and \nall offsets. To include offsets, they say, is tantamount to raising \ntaxes on someone in exchange for cutting taxes on someone else, so that \nnothing should be offset.\n  I would hope Members paid attention to the news from yesterday. The \nnews from yesterday was that we are, in fiscal year 2009, going to have \na budget deficit, estimated by this administration--this is not a \nDemocratic estimate, this is the Bush administration saying that the \nnew administration will come into office with a deficit of $482 \nbillion, the highest on record. Our debt will climb by over $800 \nbillion this 1 year to more than $10 trillion when this President \nleaves office. I would think that information would concentrate \npeople's minds on whether we ought to offset some of these tax \nprovisions, and clearly, it seems to me, we should.\n  I think the truth is that the concern on the Republican side about \noffsets is really driven by a different factor, and let me just \ndescribe that because I don't think we have had enough discussion of it \nhere on the floor as yet.\n  There are many on the Republican side who are concerned that if they \nagree to offsets for this package we are voting on tomorrow, this would \nset a dangerous precedent when the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the so-\ncalled Bush tax cuts, are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. So \nthey say: If we agree to offsets here, then someone is going to say we \nought to have offsets there, and clearly that is not going to be a good \nposition to be in. I would just say that offsetting the current package \nwill cost up to $55 billion. In contrast, the Congressional Budget \nOffice says that extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--the Bush tax \ncuts--and adding an AMT patch is going to cost a little over $4 \ntrillion. So we need to focus on the challenges before us, not think \nhypothetically about how a future tax cut may be handled.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues have pointed to other provisions in \nthe legislation that they find objectionable. I know some of them have \nsaid there was a provision in here that allowed trial lawyers to deduct \ncertain expenses. That has been stripped out. Some have said there is a \nprovision to require the Davis-Bacon Act. But the last extenders bill, \nas well as the one before us today, includes no such provision.\n\n  I also wish to reiterate my sincere disappointment with the \nadministration. President Bush has previously committed to the energy \ntax incentives in this bill, which were enacted by the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005. When he visited my home State of New Mexico to sign the \nact, the President praised that bill for recognizing ``that America is \nthe world's leader in technology and that we've got to use technology \nto be the world's leader in energy conservation.'' But while some of us \nin Congress have been working to ensure that America maintains this \nleadership role, the administration has been absent. I must question \nthe sincerity of the President's commitment to energy security when he \nsits by idly and allows these provisions to lapse.\n  It is time for Republicans to stop moving the goal posts. It is time \nto address America's pressing challenges and it is time to acknowledge \nthe dire fiscal budgetary situation in which we find ourselves, and not \nto dig the hole even deeper. It is time to pass the extenders package \nbefore we leave this week.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used his 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I believe \nit is extremely important for us to go ahead and proceed to and pass \nthis tax extender package, and I hope colleagues will support that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President I rise in support of the comments of my \ncolleague from New Mexico, who has done an excellent job, along with \nthe Senator from Montana, in putting this together.\n  We have heard a lot of talk on the floor about drilling. That has \ngotten a lot of the heat, but the light is right here with the \nextenders. I say to my colleagues, these tax extenders, which are \nfocused on energy alternatives, are far more important to reducing gas \nprices than drilling. Whether you are for drilling or against it, we \nall know you cannot drill your way out of this problem; that just by \ndrilling, by focusing on drilling, we are telling both Saudi Arabia and \nExxonMobil that they are going to continue to control our destiny for \ndecades to come. And look what that has brought us to now--$4-a-gallon \ngasoline.\n  The only solution is to wean ourselves from oil and, to a lesser \nextent, natural gas and to move to alternatives such as wind and solar \nfor electricity, and battery-powered cars, electric cars, and gas-\npowered cars to deal with automobiles, and other kinds of efficiency-\nenhancing measures. If we ever want to be free of big oil, this is the \nplace to go.\n  So for all the speeches we are hearing from the other side about \ndrilling, which won't bring any more oil for 7 to 10 years--and, of \ncourse, we are for a plan of increasing our domestic production and \ndrilling that is more efficient and quicker, but no amount of drilling \nis going to solve our problem.\n  We know why they want drilling. Big oil wants drilling. Well, I say \nthat the American people don't want ExxonMobil or OPEC or Saudi Arabia \ncontrolling our destiny any longer because that brought us $4-a-gallon \ngasoline. We want alternatives. We want a car that can run by \nelectricity--just as powerful, just as long a ride, just as smooth, if \nnot a smoother ride, than gasoline-driven cars and a heck of a lot \ncheaper. We want our homes powered--heated and cooled--by wind power \nand solar power and biomass and so many of the other alternatives--\ncellulosic ethanol--and this bill takes the first large step to doing \nthat. The tax extender bill will increase focus on solar.\n  Talk to the people who do these alternatives. They say that unless we \nextend the tax cuts, particularly for a longer period of time, they \ncannot make an investment. Germany is way ahead of us in this area, as \nis France, and China is leaping ahead of us in this area, and all \nbecause my colleagues don't want to close some tax loopholes primarily \ndealing with people who put their money overseas and defer their taxes, \nwhich no American should have the right to do.\n  So I say to my colleagues, you want to bring down gasoline prices? \nYou want to bring down the cost of home heating oil? The best thing to \ndo is move this extender package. It is far better than drilling--\nwhatever your view on drilling. Let's see what happens when we vote on \nthese proposals this afternoon and tomorrow. All the talk about $4-a-\ngallon gasoline--less important than defending those who hide their \nmoney overseas and won't pay taxes. That is what the votes are going to \nshow here.\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\n  This bill is a vital bill. This bill has so many good provisions in \nit that will wean us from oil.\n  I say to my colleagues once again, we know we cannot drill our way \nout of the problem. We have twiddled our thumbs for 7 years. It is \nabout time we started giving the tax incentives to alternative energy \nand freeing our country of OPEC, of Saudi Arabia, of ExxonMobil, and of \n$4 gasoline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, again, I express the concern that we as \nRepublicans are labeled as the party that only chooses to drill, drill, \ndrill our way out of high energy prices. Our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are viewed as the party that is saying no to any \ndomestic production, no to providing for more energy independence when \nit comes to what we can do for ourselves, and whose answer is only: \nStop the speculation; the answer is only renewables.\n  I come from a producing State. Alaska has been doing a fine job over \nthe past 30 years, providing oil to the rest of the country and \nproviding it in quantities that truly make a difference. We want to be \nable to continue to provide it. But we recognize that drilling is not \nthe only answer. It is not the only thing that is going to get this \ncountry to a position where we are not going to be held hostage by the \ngeopolitical events in Nigeria, in Venezuela, in Iran.\n  We have to be doing more. The answer is a little bit of everything. \nIt is to find more and use less. When we are talking about finding \nmore, we have to be realistic about where we can find more and it \nshould not be in Saudi Arabia's backyard. It should not be in \nVenezuela. What we can do here we should be doing here.\n  When we say we need to have an energy policy in this country that \nencourages production and encourages investment for production and \ndiscourages consumption, that is what we need to be working toward, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, not just this finger pointing, saying \nall you want to do is drill and us, on this other side, saying all you \nwant to do is nothing. We are not answering the problems our \nconstituents are facing back home right now. We are not delivering to \nthem what they need, which is answers.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the situation in my State. The \nchairman of the Energy Committee, for whom I have such respect, has \nindicated that in the proposal he is advancing he is looking to do more \nwhen it comes to offshore exploration and development in Alaska. As I \nsaid, we are a State that supports production. We support development \nin the northern country. But we also recognize that oftentimes things \nare out of our control when it comes to the ability to produce.\n  I requested from the Department of Interior, the Minerals Management \nOffices, MMS, the summary status of what is happening with the \nlitigation that is blocking us from doing any meaningful production \nwhen it comes to offshore Alaska, Alaska OCS. There is a total of six \nlitigation cases that are filed against MMS affecting the Alaska OCS. I \ncan provide the details, certainly, but I think what I would like to \nhighlight is--whether it is the 5-year leasing program lawsuit that has \nbeen filed by the Center for Biologic Diversity, the Chukchi Sea sale \n193 lawsuit, the Beaufort Sea sale 202 lawsuit; the Shell exploration \nplan lawsuit--Shell's operations have been held up for two seasons now \nbecause the ninth circuit has not moved on a decision there--we have a \nBeaufort and Chukchi Sea seismic survey lawsuit. Other MMS litigation \nis an FOIA lawsuit related to the Chukchi Sea sale, the Fish and \nWildlife Service incidental take regulations, Beaufort Sea as well as \nChukchi Sea notices of intent to sue for violations of endangered \nspecies as they relate to polar bear, fin and humpback whales, and \neiders--my point is we do have opportunities up north. We do have a \nresource that is incredible. We recognize it. Again, we would like the \nability to be producers for the Nation. It is not just the challenges \nwe face dealing with an Arctic environment. So much of what happens \nthat causes delays so that we do not see increased production \ndomestically in this country is due to the litigation.\n  I want to speak a little bit about not necessarily the challenges but \nthe opportunities that we have in the northern environment specifically \nto produce, and the opportunities that are brought to us because of the \ntechnology. Some in this body have suggested that drilling is not the \nway out and drilling indicates we are guilty of an old way of thinking \nabout energy issues. I think it is probably more accurate to say those \nwho oppose the production of conventional oil and gas in this country \nas part of a balanced energy policy that includes renewables and \nincludes conservation are the ones who are guilty of old, outdated \nthinking. It is clear that those who oppose increased domestic \nproduction are utterly resistant to the technological changes that have \noccurred both onshore and offshore in gas production in the past 40 \nyears in this country.\n  Some people say we are mired in the past. I think that is because \nthey refuse to either learn about or to accept the changes in \ntechnology that allow for oil and gas to be produced without harm to \nthe environment, wildlife, or to the land. We recognize there can be \naccidents. We know that firsthand in Alaska. We live daily with that. \nIn fact, I spoke with a fisherman in Cordova--that whole community is \nstill living daily with a terrible accident that happened in our State \nsome 20 years ago. We know an oil barge can hit an oil tanker, as we \nhave seen in Mississippi. But so can pollutants be accidentally \nreleased while companies make photovoltaic cells; or chemicals used to \nmake batteries for hybrid and electric cars can accidentally spill and \nharm the environment. An offshore wind turbine foundation might harm \nfisheries habitats. A windmill on shore might kill birds. Methane gas \nmight explode. An accident can happen. But why not look at the real \nimpacts of modern technology and the real risks that modern technology \ninvolve?\n\n  I will use my example of what is happening up north with oil \nexploration. During the past 31 years, the Prudhoe Bay oil field has \nproduced 15 billion barrels of oil. This is about one-fifth of all the \noil that this country has produced over the last three decades. During \nthat 31-year time period I can tell you the technology has vastly \nimproved. When Prudhoe opened, wells were drilled over the top of the \noil deposits themselves. The wells were about every several hundred \nyards. Today, hundreds of wells can be drilled from a single well pad \nand they do this through the technique of directional drilling. That \nallows the companies to drive wells from one tiny gravel pad that can \nreach oil deposits under the surface up to an area 8 miles in diameter. \nThat leaves more than a 100-square-mile area of habitat undisturbed \nbetween these well pads. These well pads have decreased in size by 88 \npercent during the life of the Prudhoe Bay field.\n  In addition to directional drilling, we have the 3-D and even 4-D \nseismic testing. This pinpoints the location of the wells, technology \nthat doesn't harm any animals in the process.\n  Once the companies find the areas they want to explore, they build \nice roads to move drilling equipment to the site, roads that melt in \nthe spring leaving no trace, no sign of human activities come summer. I \nstood on this floor. I told you how it works. It is like a Zamboni \ngoing across the tundra. In addition, we place mats--they call them \nduramats--on the ground to protect the fragile tundra to make sure the \nwheel tracks are nowhere to be seen when the spring arrives in the \nArctic.\n  The new technology goes on. New detection systems on pipelines can \nsniff out the hydrocarbon molecules and actually shut down a pipeline \nbefore drops of oil can reach the environment. It includes requirements \nthat all equipment when they are stopped--up north in Prudhoe, all \nthose areas there--all equipment, whether it is the truck or the rig, \nwhen they are stopped they actually place what are called diapers, \nabsorbent pads, under the engine to catch any drops of oil before they \ntouch the ground. More oil probably leaks on the driveways here in \nWashington, DC than ever reaches the environment of Alaska's North \nSlope.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I want to sum up very briefly. I am talking about \nonshore, but I can tell you, as it relates\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nto OCS development, we are seeing those same levels of technology. Well \nvalves are dependable. We have not had a well blow out since the Santa \nBarbara accident in 1969. We recognize that our technology allows us to \ndo more than 30 years we could ever have dreamed about. Let's allow us \nto use our ingenuity to produce so we have the resource we need as a \ncountry. Let us use our ingenuity to take this resource and to develop \nthe renewables and the alternatives that are the future of this \ncountry. Let's use our ingenuity to be more creative when it comes to \nconservation and efficiencies. The ingenuity we use with our production \nof oil and gas is something that should not be disputed but should be \nencouraged.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this has been an interesting morning to \nwatch the Senate debate. It reminds me a bit that the strongest muscle \nin the body is the tongue. Debate that I have heard this morning is \nquite extraordinary. We have people come to the floor of the Senate, \nand they say that something like 85 percent of the Outer Continental \nShelf is not open and available for leasing and drilling. That is not \ntrue. Two-thirds is open and available for the Minerals Management \nService to lease.\n  I want to talk a little about where we are with respect to this issue \nof production. I have seen the big old sign that my Republican \ncolleagues have been using. It says: Produce more and use less.\n  We will have a chance again today to decide whether members actually \nwant to produce more. Some people believe the only way you produce \nenergy is drill a hole someplace and search for oil and gas. I support \nthat. But another way to produce energy is to produce homegrown energy \nfrom solar, wind, biomass or geothermal sources--another homegrown \nenergy plan.\n  We have had a chance for at least six separate times to vote to \nextend the tax credits to support renewable forms of energy to produce \nmore energy. Six times we have been stymied. I will talk about that a \nbit in a moment.\n  The first car I got as a very young man was a 1924 Model-T Ford I \nbought for $25 and lovingly restored it for 2 years. I have described \nthis often.\n  I discovered as a young boy that you couldn't date very well in a \n1924 Ford. So I sold my model T. But it was interesting restoring an \nold Model T Ford. I understood that you put gasoline in a 1924 vehicle \nthe same way you put gasoline in a 2008 vehicle. Nothing has \nfundamentally changed. You to go a gas pump someplace, stick a nozzle \nin your tank, start pumping and then pay the price. It is drive and \ndrill approach. It has been that strategy forever. Some of my \ncolleagues come to the floor of the Senate dragging a wagon of the same \nold drive-and-drill policies. Keep driving and drilling, and things \nwill be fine. The problem is the hole gets deeper every single year. \nThey come here once a decade and say: Our strategy is to drill more.\n  I support drilling for oil, but I also think we ought to do a lot \nmore than that. We ought to have a game-changing plan, some sort of a \nmoonshot plan that says: Ten years from now we need to have a different \napproach to energy. John F. Kennedy didn't say: I think we will try to \ngo to the Moon. I would like to send a person to the Moon. I hope we \ncan go to the Moon. He said: By the end of this decade, we will send a \nperson to the Moon. We will have a person walking on the Moon.\n  That is what this debate ought to be about. In the next 10 years, \nhere is the way we are going to change America's energy plan. That \nought to be the debate.\n  There are a lot of things we can and should do together. There are \nfar too few things we are engaging in together on the floor of the \nSenate. We had a energy future speculation bill defeated, or at least \nthe minority that puts up the sign that says produce more and use less \nvoted in unison to stop movement of it. We had a bill on the floor that \nsaid: Let's get rid of excessive speculation in the futures market that \nis driving up prices. We had people who testified before our various \ncommittees who said as much as 30 to 40 percent of the current price of \ngas and oil is due to excess speculation. In 2000, 37 percent of the \noil market was speculators. Now it is 71 percent. It is unbelievable \nhow rampant speculation has become in the oil futures market. But the \noil speculators have a lot of friends here, enough friends so they \ncould stop that kind of legislation that would put the brakes on some \nof this speculation and put some downward pressure on prices. The oil \nspeculators have a lot of friends here.\n  Big oil companies have a lot of friends here. With record profits, \nthe largest oil company, ExxonMobil, spent twice as much money last \nyear buying back their stock as they did in investing in infrastructure \nfor producing more oil. Let me say that again. The biggest oil company \nin the world spent twice as much money buying back its stock as it did \nexploring for more oil. We are paying at the pump enormous prices so \none would hope at least a substantial portion of that money would go \nback into the ground to find more energy resources. But sadly it is \nnot.\n  Again, these Big Oil companies have plenty of friends in this \nChamber. They view their role as a set of human brake pads to stop \nwhatever is going on. They don't support anything. Just make sure you \nstop things.\n  Let me describe one of the things that makes so much sense to me that \nhas been stopped dead in its tracks. It was stopped last year on June \n21, 2007. It was stopped December 7, 2007. It was stopped December 13, \n2007. They stopped it on February 7, 2008. What is it? It is our \nability, as a country, to change the game and say: We want to encourage \nproduction by taking energy from the wind, solar, wave, and other forms \nof renewable energy. We had a vote on all those occasions to provide \ntax credits and stimulus to say: Here is the kind of energy we want to \nproduce in the future. This is a new energy future. On each and every \noccasion, the minority that comes to parade with a big, old sign \ncalling for producing more, on each occasion those who hold up that \nsign today voted against producing more. Isn't that interesting? They \nvoted against producing more.\n  Let me tell you what we did in this country with respect to energy. \nIn 1916, we put in place long-term, permanent, robust tax incentives to \nsay to people: If you want to explore for oil and gas, God bless you \nbecause we need it. We want to provide big incentives for you to do it. \nAlmost a century ago we put in place those tax incentives. That is how \nmuch we wanted to encourage people to find oil and gas. Contrast that \nwith what we did to encourage people to wean ourselves off the need for \nfossil fuels. At least 60 to 65 percent of that oil comes from off our \nshores.\n  In 1992, we put in place a tax credit for renewable energy, a \nproduction tax credit which was short term and not particularly robust. \nWe extended it five times. We let it expire three times. We have had a \nstop-and-start, stutter step approach.\n  Look at this chart. Here is what has happened. This shows you what \nhas happened to wind energy. When the credit expires, the investment \ngoes to zero. Put the credit is extended, the investment goes up. When \nthe credit expires, the investment drops off. It is unbelievable, what \na pathetic, anemic response by a country. So we have a piece of \nlegislation that says: Let's extend the wind energy tax credit. Let's \nextend the tax credit that takes energy from the Sun. Let's produce \nenergy from the wind and the Sun and geothermal and so many other forms \nof renewable energy. The minority side says no. They don't want to do \nthat. On June 21, 2007, we failed to get cloture by one vote. A large \nportion of the minority side said no. The same ones who\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nare holding the sign that says produce more said: We don't want to \nproduce more. On December 7, the same folks who hold the sign said: No, \nwe don't want to produce more. December 13, they still said: No, we are \nnot interested in producing more. February 7 of this year: We still are \nnot interested in producing more.\n\n  But during the last week or so, they show a big, old, oily chart on \nthe Senate floor that says produce more, use less. Well, perhaps we \nwill have a chance to vote once again. Then the question is, Is their \npolicy just drill a hole, which is a yesterday forever strategy, or is \ntheir policy a game-changing policy to join us and say: Let's do \nsomething different for a change.\n  Given the circumstances we have, those who decide it is in their \ninterest to block everything, should rethink that plan. I have said \noften, Mark Twain was once asked to engage a debate. He said: Yes, as \nlong as I can have the negative side. They said: But, Mr. Twain, we \nhaven't even told you the subject. He said: It doesn't matter. The \nsubject doesn't matter. The negative side will take no preparation. So \nit is on the floor of the Senate. Coming out here simply to block \neverything and then hold a sign that says: We support producing more. \nThat takes no preparation. It takes a little bit of gall, I might say, \nbut it certainly takes no preparation.\n  The question is this: Should we do everything? You bet your life. We \nshould drill more, in my judgment, and there is two-thirds of the Outer \nContinental Shelf that is open for leasing and drilling. I support \nthat. We ought to conserve more too. We are prodigious wasters of \nenergy. We ought to have much more energy efficiency for every single \nthing we do. Everything that is turned on from a switch that we flick \non or off should be examined. So produce and conserve, and most \nimportantly have a game-changing plan to say: We want renewables in \nthis country.\n  T. Boone Pickens was in town last week. He was like a big old boat \ncoming through, leaving a big wake in the background of the boat. He \nsaid: You can't drill your way out of this problem. What we need to do \nis wind from Texas to North Dakota, in the area where we have all this \nwind energy potential. We need to develop more solar in the Southwest, \nwhere we have a tremendous capability. We need to produce that way and \ndevelop an interstate grid system for transmitting energy all around \nthe country, just as we did with the interstate highway system.\n  That makes a lot of sense to me. But we can't do that with the \npathetic approach that exists on providing incentives to renewables. As \nI indicated, we put in place permanent, robust incentives for looking \nfor oil and gas in 1916. We have these short-term incentives, and we \ncan't get them passed. Because on occasion after occasion, time after \ntime, the folks who now come and hold a sign that says produce more \nsaid: No, I will not vote to produce more. When it comes to renewable \nenergy, I am going to vote to stop it.\n  We can get oil from the ground. I understand that, but we can also \nproduce biofuels from a whole series of feedstocks. We are using a lot \nof corn. But the bill we have tried to get passed has a significant tax \nincentive for the cost of facilities that produce cellulosic biofuels. \nDoes that make sense? You bet your life it does. That is production for \nAmerica. If you say you are for production, don't hold up a sign. Just \nvote for this legislation. Then you will really be for production. The \nnew credits for qualified plug-in electric drive vehicles, how \nimportant is that? It is unbelievably important for us to convert from \nthe internal combustion engine to an electric drive vehicle and then, \neventually, to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. That is game changing. But \nthe legislation in which this occurred, that is legislation the \nminority that has been holding the signs all morning opposed.\n  All I say is this: You want to do a lot of everything. Let's do a lot \nof everything. Let's advance America's energy future. We go to Saudi \nArabia, Iraq, Venezuela, or Kuwait and say: In order for America's \neconomy to run, we need a large portion of our oil and gas from you, \nyou need to provide that to us. It impacts so many other parts of our \ncountry that we can't possibly control.\n  Should we continue down this road? I don't think so. It is a \ndisappointment to me that it is toward the end of July, and we still \nhave this kind of discussion on the floor of the Senate. We should have \nhad 100 Senators in support of legislation to shut down this \nunbelievable speculation that is going on. I understand oil speculators \nhave a lot of friends here now. They have a lot of friends in this \nChamber, enough to have stopped this oil speculation legislation last \nweek. We ought to have 100 votes for people who say we are going to \nsupport homegrown energy. We are going to support big, aggressive tax \nincentives to produce energy here at home, and that includes wind, \nsolar, geothermal and biomass, and we are going to change the game. Ten \nyears from now, America is going to have a different energy future. \nInstead, we got the ``yesterday forever'' crowd who comes to the \nChamber and slouches around with their hands in their pockets and says: \nWe always liked what we did, and we want to do it some more. Then, 10 \nor 15 years from now, the same crowd will be back saying the same \nthing. They will say no to anything that will change the ground, and \nyes to anything that continues this unbelievable dependence.\n  My hope is we can find a way, perhaps, to join together and decide we \nought to produce more in a smart way. We ought to be much less reliant \non foreign energy, on the need for oil from overseas. We ought to be \nmuch more vigilant on aggressive conservation and energy efficiency \nmeasures. This Congress in particular ought to decide that it is \nfinally, at long last, going to vote to produce energy in a good way. \nThat is, to produce homegrown energy from wind, solar and so many other \nsources of renewable energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator the assistant minority \nleader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, \nwho has come to the floor almost every day to talk about the energy \ncrisis. But if the American people had their choice, all of us would be \ntalking about it every day of the week. It takes anywhere from an hour \nto 2 hours to go from downtown Chicago out to O'Hare. I have made the \ntrip a lot. But recently, the fellow who was driving me said: I have \nnoticed something strange. Even during rush hour, there are fewer cars \nout here. I know a lot of people are on vacation, but something is \nchanging.\n  I have noticed it all over my State, and I think people are noticing \nit all over the country. What is changing is people are looking at \ngasoline that costs $4.50 or $4.30 a gallon and saying: I will drive \nless. I am going to look for a car or truck that is more fuel \nefficient. People are understanding in their daily lives that things \nare changing, not always for the better, because as the price of oil \ngoes up and the price of gasoline goes up, we may make energy-\nconserving decisions, but some of those are forced on us. Some of those \nare painful, painful when we pay for the gasoline each week and painful \nwhen people find their family budgets wrecked by the cost of gasoline.\n  They are not alone. The major airline companies have now announced \ndramatic cutbacks in scheduling and in employees. They can't keep up. \nThe price of jet fuel has gone through the roof. I have met with the \nCEOs of these companies. The stories they tell are very sad. They can't \nafford to fly people anymore. They can't charge enough. They can't make \nenough. They are charging us now for everything in sight, $15, $20, $50 \nfor a second bag they check, trying to keep the airlines afloat. And \nsome of them will fail, I am afraid, unless something dramatic happens.\n  So it is no surprise that on the floor of this Senate we have talked \na lot about this energy issue. There are two distinct points of view, \nand I think they tell the difference between outlook. Senator Dorgan of \nNorth Dakota talked about ``yesterday forever.'' On the Republican \nside, their idea is to drill more oil, keep drilling, keep finding more \noil. Sadly, they have ignored the reality.\n  The reality is this: If you take a look at all the oil reserves in \nthe world, the United States has 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. \nNinety-eight percent, of course, is in countries such as\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nSaudi Arabia, Iraq, and Canada. We have 2 percent of the oil reserves.\n  The oil consumption by the United States? We consume 24 percent of \nthe oil. In other words, we cannot drill our way out of this. We cannot \nfind enough oil here to sustain the American economy. If you are going \nto be honest--and you should be with the American people--if we made a \ndecision tomorrow to start drilling in any specific spot, for instance, \noff the coast of the United States, it takes literally years for that \nto happen, for it to go into production, and to deliver the oil to the \nUnited States. Estimates are 8 to 14 years.\n  So coming to the floor and saying: Drill more, drill now--well, the \nreality is, ``drill now'' means drill in 8 to 14 years. That is going \nto have little impact on current gasoline prices, no matter what we \nthink. That is the reality. The question, obviously, is: Are there \nplaces we should go to drill? Well, of course there are. The United \nStates is in control of its sovereign territory as a nation, and its \noffshore territory as well. The Federal Government owns many public \nlands, and some of those are used for ski resorts and national parks \nand mining.\n  Some are used for oil and gas exploration. We say to the companies: \nIf you would like to drill more oil and gas on our land, the Federal \nland, pay us a lease, pay us a rental, and we will allow you to do so. \nThe oil and gas companies gobble up this territory. In fact, 68 million \nacres of Federal land are currently under lease to oil and gas \ncompanies for that purpose: to drill for oil.\n  What are they doing with those 68 million acres? Well, it turns out a \nlot of them are not being utilized. This is a little map of the Western \npart of the United States I have in the Chamber. The land you see in \nred is Federal land leased to oil and gas companies not in production. \nWhen the Republicans say we have to put more acres out there for them \nto drill, the fact is, they are paying us to lease acres they are not \ntouching. I do not know what the explanation might be, but of those \nonshore, 34.5 million acres have been leased from the Federal \nGovernment and go untouched.\n  It is just not onshore. If we think the mother lode is offshore, as \nshown on this other map, these are acres we have leased in the Gulf of \nMexico, and all those in red are currently untouched--leased, so the \noil and gas companies believe there is oil or gas there but untouched.\n  So to argue there is not enough acreage for us to go searching for \noil, there is some 68 million acres of leased Federal land to oil \ncompanies, and zero of those acres in production onshore and offshore.\n  We recently had a lease to offer 115 million more acres of Federal \nland available to these companies for lease for oil and gas purposes. \nThis was in the last year--since January, I should say, of 2007. Mr. \nPresident, 115 million acres were offered.\n  What does 115 million acres of land that the Federal Government owns \nand will lease to oil and gas companies represent? This is the path, as \nshown on this map, of Interstate 80, which most of us know. It goes \nfrom New Jersey all the way to California. This represents a 67-mile-\nwide swath along I-80. That is the size of the acreage we have offered \nto the oil and gas companies to drill on for oil and gas. Of that, they \nhave accepted 12 million acres they bid on. Another 103 million acres \nhave gone unclaimed by these oil and gas companies. So it is not as if \nthere is not land available. There is--a lot of it--millions and \nmillions of acres made available to these companies. Some they are \npaying for, some they could lease. There is plenty of land for them to \ndrill.\n  So why, then, is the Republican approach that we need to drill more, \nwhen the opportunity is there? There are plenty of acres, and we know \nthat even with drilling, we are going to wait 8 to 14 years to see the \nfirst drop of oil. Well, here is what it is all about.\n  For the last 8 years, the White House has been under the control of a \nPresident and a Vice President with a deep background in the oil \nindustry--both President Bush and Vice President Cheney. And not \ncoincidentally, the oil companies have done very well. The policies of \nthis administration have been very friendly to these oil and gas \ncompanies. They are reporting record profits, which I will get to in a \nmoment.\n  So the last gasp before this crew leaves town is for the Republican \nside of the aisle to give to the big oil groups more leased land, give \nthem more land to stockpile inventory for future purposes. That is what \nthis is all about. It is not about solving the current energy crisis. \nIt is not about bringing down gasoline prices. That is 8 to 14 years \naway, if ever. It is about, frankly, giving big oil exactly what it \nwants.\n  If you think I am making this up, take a look at the full-page ads in \nyour hometown newspapers by the American Petroleum Institute supporting \nthe Republican position. What is the American Petroleum Institute? The \nlargest and smallest oil companies in America. They understand this is \ntheir last grab under this administration and the Republicans want to \ngive them that grab and take that land and try to convince the American \npeople it will make a difference when it comes to our energy policy. \nQuite honestly, we know better.\n  Now, in a short time--maybe a matter of days, maybe this week--the \noil companies are going to be reporting their latest profits. This \nchart will show you what is happening to big oil profits since this \nadministration took office. Starting in 2002 to 2007, you can see a \ndramatic increase in billions of dollars for oil and gas companies in \nAmerica. These just are not large increases for this industry, these \nare the largest reported profits of any business in the history of the \nUnited States of America.\n  The oil companies have done extraordinarily well. Notwithstanding all \nthe other arguments, the fact that the Republicans want to give these \noil and gas companies one last grab at this land is an indication they \nwant the profit margins to continue.\n  But is that what we are all about? Is that why we are here, to make \nsure wealthy, profitable companies make record profits unseen in the \nhistory of the United States, at the expense of families who pay for \nthe gasoline, at the expense of businesses that cannot survive, at the \nexpense of our airlines that are shutting down their planes and \nschedules, at the expense of farmers in my State of Illinois and across \nthe United States? I do not think so.\n\n  Our responsibility has to go further. Our responsibility has to go to \nthe point----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point I want to make is this: We have to look ahead. \nIf President Bush was right when he said America is addicted to oil, \nhow can we break the addiction? We will never be oil free. That is \nludicrous. We will have a dependence on fossil fuels, on oil, for my \nlifetime and well beyond.\n  But if we want to be fair to the next generation, we have to be \npushing for an energy agenda which sees a source of energy homegrown in \nAmerica, so we are independent and do not have to rely on OPEC and \nforeign countries, a source of energy that is kind to the environment, \nso we do not make global warming worse for kids in the future, and a \nsource of energy that is affordable.\n  In order to reach that goal--and America can reach it--you cannot \nlook backward, as the Republicans have by saying: Let's keep doing what \nwe have always done. Let's keep drilling for oil.\n  You need responsible exploration and production of oil, and you need \nanother future agenda: a next-year agenda that says we are going to \nlook to a way to produce energy to keep this economy moving that is \naffordable.\n  We have the bill to do it. It is a bill that has lost on the floor of \nthe Senate. It is the energy tax production credit. It is one that will \nproduce energy. We cannot get enough Republican votes to support it. We \nare going to try again. We are going to keep trying because with this \nbill we are going to expand tax credits for biomass and hydropower, for \nsolar energy, for biodiesel production. We are going to have tax \ncredits for local governments in renewable projects, advanced coal \nelectricity demonstration projects, plug-in electric cars, heavy \nvehicle excise tax for\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\ntruck idling reduction. It goes on and on--a list of ways to conserve \nenergy and look to future uses of energy that are consistent with an \nAmerican economy that will grow and not be too expensive for the \nAmerican people.\n  That is what we have to move to. This afternoon we will give our \nRepublican colleagues a chance to take their signs that say ``produce \nmore'' and turn them into a vote for this tax program that will produce \nmore. I hope they will join us in this effort.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is time this Senate begin to act on \nwhat it is going to do to increase the supply of energy. It is time to \nlay aside politics. It is time to begin to look for real solutions to \nsolve this country's energy problems.\n  What we have heard so far from the other side has nothing to do with \nincreasing the supply of energy. We heard speeches on the Senate floor \nattacking speculation. Speculation works as a normal way of doing \nbusiness on the futures market. What is against the law, which creates \nproblems, is if you have manipulation of the markets. That is where \nsomebody goes in and takes some kind of action on the market that \nsomehow is going to artificially drive up the cost of fuel. It is \nmanipulation. The administration has discovered a company or two that \nis doing that. They have been working on it for some time.\n  This shows the regulation process is working. We heard testimony in \none of the committees on which I serve and we had a discussion on the \nsupply of energy and the manipulation of the markets, and the \nregulators agreed they need to do more. I agree with that. We need to \nmake sure they have the manpower they need to adequately enforce what \nwe already have on the books.\n  I am looking for real solutions and my Republican colleagues, I \nbelieve, are looking for real solutions because we realize how \nimportant it is we become less dependent on foreign oil and not more. \nIt is important for the security of this country, now and 20 to 30 \nyears down the road, that we increase our supply of energy. So we need \nmore energy, and we need to consume less.\n  Increasing taxes, which has been talked about on this floor, is not \nthe answer. We are going to have a tax proposal that will be brought \nup, perhaps, on the floor of the Senate that will temporarily cut taxes \nfor renewable energy--and, by the way, I am a strong supporter of \nrenewable energy--and put in place a permanent tax increase on \nbusiness. That is not the way we should be doing business on the floor \nof the Senate. That does not increase the production of oil.\n  Now, making it more difficult to produce more energy through more \nregulations is certainly not the answer. But we have heard proposal \nafter proposal on the Senate floor claiming they are going to increase \nthe supply of energy by increasing the regulatory environment, making \nit more difficult to go out and produce energy.\n  One of the things, in my view, that would produce more energy is \nutilizing capped wells, we have a lot of capped wells out there. These \nare existing wells that do not have to be drilled. They were shut down \nbecause at one point the economics were such that they could not make a \nprofit with these wells. So they capped them and said: We are going to \nquit wasting our money on that one and go on to new areas where we can \nprovide more oil for this country--oil and gas.\n  Well, the cost of the market is such that now it is feasible to begin \nto open these capped mines. We need to make sure we do not pass a \nregulation in this body that is going to make it more difficult for \nthem to uncap those wells. That is a ready resource of energy.\n  We also heard comment on this floor about the fact that we have all \nthis leased land out here. Leasing land does not equal more oil and \ngas. Many times, when you go onto a parcel of land and lease it, you \nhave no idea whether there is oil or gas underneath there until you \nbegin to put in some test wells and test the area. Just because you \ntalk about all of this land that is available for leasing doesn't mean \nthere is oil and gas on it. Leasing land doesn't mean there is oil and \ngas on there.\n\n  What happens with many of those leases is they may have found they \nare not productive. The leases are let out for 5 years or they may be \nlet out for 8 years or 10 years. Then, if they are not producing, they \nput them back on the market and see if anybody else is interested in \nusing the technology they have to try to discover if there is a source \nof energy under the surface of that land.\n  The important point to make is that just because you have land \navailable doesn't mean there is oil and gas underneath it.\n  So my view is--and I think the view of many Republicans--we need to \nincrease the production of energy, whether it is natural gas or whether \nit is oil shale, in order to bridge the gap to develop technology that \nis going to produce more energy in the future. I happen to feel that \nnuclear power is something we have ignored, and we need to do more in \nthe way of nuclear power to meet the needs of providing adequate energy \nsupply to our businesses and to our homes.\n  Let's talk about the pain at the pump. Throughout this great Nation, \npeople are struggling with high gas prices. I am looking for some \nrenewables to deal with cars. A lot of the renewables happen to deal \nwith wind, solar, happen to deal with geothermal, biofuels. Now, there \nis something that might be able to be used with cars, but most of these \nrenewables we are talking about can't be used in the car world.\n  People are feeling the pain. It is when you pull up to the gas tank \nand put your credit card in there and you fill up the tank, and when \nyou look at the total at the end is when you really begin to hurt. High \ngas prices not only affect our ability to get around but increasingly \nare affecting each facet of our everyday life.\n  Americans are feeling pain at the pump due to high gas prices, and \nincreasingly they feel pain at the kitchen table too. As gas prices go \nup, so do food prices. Food prices go up because it costs a lot to \nproduce those food products that will end up on the table. America's \nfarmers and ranchers\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\nproduce the safest, most affordable food in the world, but rising \nenergy prices have affected almost every level of agriculture. It has \ncaused everything from fertilizer costs to processing costs to \nincrease. The high cost of diesel and other types of energy are forcing \nfood prices up.\n  My home State of Colorado produces some of the best tasting produce \nin the world, including potatoes. In Colorado's San Luis Valley last \nyear, it cost a farmer about $90 an acre for starter fertilizer. This \nyear, the cost is up to almost $300. Imagine that. In 1 year, it has \ngone from $90 an acre to $300 an acre. Suppose you have a farm of 100 \nacres. That is a huge cost, a huge impact on the bottom line. That is \nright, in 1 year those costs have more than tripled.\n  Weld County, another agriculture-producing county in Colorado, is one \nof the Nation's top-producing ag counties. Even in an area that \nproduces as much food as Weld County, people are fighting high food \ncosts.\n  Higher food costs are affecting all Americans, but they are \nespecially damaging to people dealing with food insecurity. Food banks \nare struggling to stretch dollars so they can keep food on their \nshelves. This is food that goes to our most vulnerable populations--\nimpoverished individuals and their families. In Weld County, 32 percent \nof the individuals served by our local food bank are children.\n  Recently, oil hit $145 per barrel, and from the beltway to Middle \nAmerica, $4-a-gallon gas is the frightening norm.\n  In the face of these challenges to the American economy and \nconsumers, we have failed to take the steps necessary to address this \nproblem either in the short term or in the long term.\n  This Congress has been ignoring one of the fundamental rules of \neconomics; that is, supply and demand. Currently, worldwide supply of \nenergy is being outpaced by growing demand. That is not only worldwide \nbut here in this country. I saw on the TV a report which said that it \nis everything we can do to keep up with current demand. So if we were \nto implement any of the policies we are talking about here to increase \nsupply, we would barely be able to keep up with current demand at the \ncurrent levels. This is a huge challenge for Americans, and we \nshouldn't be backing away from that challenge here on the Senate floor.\n  If we take steps to increase supply, prices will go down. The day \nafter President Bush lifted the Presidential moratorium on drilling in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, oil prices fell nearly $7 a barrel. Let me \nsay that again: a drop of almost $7 per barrel in 24 hours because \naction was taken that got us closer to putting additional supply on the \nmarket. This translates eventually into cheaper gas.\n  One of the best ways to drive down fuel prices is by finding more and \nusing less. Embracing renewable energy is an excellent way to increase \nsupply.\n  As a founder and cochair of the Renewable Energy Caucus, I know the \nimportance of using renewable energy, but we are not at a point yet \nwhere renewable energy can meet all of our energy needs. We still need \nfossil fuels.\n  One of the most promising sources of domestic energy is found in the \nWest, much of it in my home State of Colorado. We have lots of natural \ngas available on the western side of our State. We also have oil shale \nwhich is found not only in Colorado but in Utah and Wyoming that will \nyield somewhere between 800 billion to 1.8 trillion barrels of \noil. This is more than the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia and \ncertainly enough to help drive down gas prices and bring us closer to \nenergy independence.\n\n  However, we cannot delay. Some people say it is going to take 10 \nyears to develop this resource. Well, are we going to wait another 10 \nyears before we start developing a resource that is going to take 10 \nyears to develop? We can't continue to delay these kinds of policies; \nwe need to act now so we can begin to give the American people some \nrelief.\n  We aren't taking the steps necessary to utilize the resources we have \nand to cut back on the $700-plus billion we send overseas annually for \nfuel because the Democrats in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives have prevented the Department of the Interior from even \nissuing proposed regulations under which oil shale, for example, could \nbe moved forward.\n  My position is that we need to put the regulations in place so that \nthen the leases can be let. If you expect oil companies to go and begin \nto lease all of the land that is apparently available and that they \nthought was available for lease, if you want them to do that, they have \nto know the rules of the game. They have to know what is going to be \ntheir return on their investment. They have to know what the lease \nrates are going to be. They have to understand the market forces. They \nneed to understand what the remediation is that might be required. They \nneed to understand what environmental laws they have to deal with if \nthey go ahead and happen to put in place a project to extract oil \nshale.\n  By the way, the technology in oil shale has changed significantly. We \nhave moved that basically from a mining operation in Colorado to an in \nsitu process where you leave the rock in the ground, you heat the \nground and extract basically a high-quality jet fuel that needs further \nrefinement with nitrogen sulfur. So that is how far the technology has \ncome. It has gone from a mining operation to where you have in situ \ntechnology where you leave all the heavy, tarry stuff in the ground, \nyou extract a good-quality fuel, and it has a lot of environmental \nadvantages when you use that process.\n  So it is time for us to move forward. It is time for us to quit \nbickering about profits that are made by oil companies. It is time for \nus to stop blaming the President. It is time for us to recognize that \nit is a supply-and-demand issue. We need to supply more, we need to \nencourage less consumption through conservation, and we need to begin \nto move forward on this Senate floor and pass some meaningful \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I also come to the Senate floor to join so \nmany of my colleagues in urging the distinguished majority leader to \nallow a full and open debate and an open amendment process so we can \naddress the single top issue in the hearts and minds of the American \npeople; that is, gasoline prices--energy. We all know it is beyond \ndiscussion, it is beyond debate that this is the concern, this is the \ntop challenge the American people face.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, I hold townhall meetings all around \nthe State on a very regular basis. For months, this issue hasn't been \nthe first question at each and every one of those townhall meetings, it \nhas been the first 10 questions. That is no different from any other \nState in the country. Gasoline prices, energy prices are hitting all of \nour neighbors' pocketbooks. It affects every Louisiana family, every \nAmerican family. So they ask a simple question: Why isn't Congress \nacting? Enough talking, enough political maneuvering. Why don't you \ncome together and act?\n  That is what we should do. That is what we should do right here and \nright now on the floor of the Senate. So I urge the majority leader to \nlift his block of all amendments on the pending energy bill so that we \ncan have that full and open debate, that full and open amendment \nprocess.\n  The last two times this body considered the issue of energy in a \nsignificant way, we had that sort of open debate.\n  In 2007, we were on an energy bill for 3 whole weeks. We took 16 \nrollcall votes on amendments, 22 rollcall votes on the entire bill. The \ntotal number of amendments proposed was 331, and actually 49 of those \nwere agreed to, some by unanimous consent, others through those 16 \nvotes I alluded to. That was when the price at the pump was about $3 a \ngallon, not $4 a gallon as it is now.\n  Before that, we also debated energy in 2005. We had 19 rollcall votes \non amendments over a period of 2 whole weeks. We had 23 rollcall votes \non the bill overall, 235 amendments were proposed, and actually a total \nof 57 were adopted. That is when the price at the pump was $2.26 a \ngallon, not at four bucks as it is now.\n  So now that the price is about $4 a gallon, now that it is the top \nconcern of the American people bar none, why can't we have that open \nprocess and open amendment process as we have in the past? The American \npeople want action.\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\n  I have filed seven amendments specifically, and I wish to outline \nthem briefly.\n  My first amendment, which has been so far barred from coming to the \nfloor, would develop alternative energy offshore in the gulf and other \nplaces where there is the ability offshore to develop new alternative \nenergy, including wind farms.\n  My second amendment would increase domestic production offshore. It \nis a version of my ENOUGH Act and would also have that alternative \nenergy offshore component of it tied into the second amendment.\n  My third amendment would repeal the moratorium on Outer Continental \nShelf production outright and would also have the alternative energy \noffshore piece as a part of that amendment.\n  My fourth amendment would repeal outright the moratorium Congress \npassed several years ago that blocks shale activity in the Western \nStates--exactly the activity my distinguished colleague from Colorado \nwas talking about--as well as the alternative energy offshore piece \nattached to it.\n  My fifth amendment would streamline the permitting process for \nrefinery expansion. Refinery capacity is just as important an issue as \nexploration and production, and we need to do a lot better to increase \nrefinery capacity in this country domestically.\n  My fifth amendment to do that is by streamlining the permitting \nprocess for existing refineries to expand, which is a good place to \nstart.\n  My sixth amendment would also streamline a regulatory process, the \npermitting process for offshore leases, because every person in the \nbusiness I talk to says even when they get access--of course, blocking \naccess is the biggest issue--the Federal permitting process is way too \nlong and cumbersome and uncertain. We need to streamline that in a \nreasonable way.\n  My seventh and final amendment would expand the seaward boundary for \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to match the seaward boundary of \nTexas to the west and Florida to the east. Right now, those two States, \nTexas and Florida, enjoy a seaward boundary of 9 miles from the coast, \nmeaning the first 9 miles of the gulf off of the coast is State waters. \nBut for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, that is only 3 miles. That \nis unfair. We should expand that to 9 miles to match Texas and Florida, \nwhich will have the impact of spurring production in those waters \nbecause the State regulatory process is far less onerous, unreasonable, \nand cumbersome than the Federal process.\n  Mr. President, other Senators have good ideas. I strongly support, \nobviously, my seven amendments. I have worked hard on them. I have \ncosponsors and I have introduced them. There are other good ideas as \nwell.\n  The main point is we need an open process. We need the ability to \ncall up amendments, to debate amendments, and to have votes on these \ngood ideas because the American people want us to act like grown-ups \nand act on this single most important issue they face in their everyday \nlives.\n  Mr. President, what I find frustrates citizens back home more than \nanything is this impression they so often have that what we do here is \nin a different universe from the real world and is divorced from their \neveryday struggles and everyday lives. I am afraid the distinguished \nmajority leader is reinforcing that notion by not allowing these \namendments, these votes, not allowing an open process on the single top \nissue Louisiana families and all American families face.\n  I urge the majority leader to reconsider so we can truly come \ntogether and do the people's business on what is the single top issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for the \nnext 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7593-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7593-S7594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE JOBS, ENERGY, FAMILIES AND DISASTER RELIEF ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the book, ``The Ethics of the \nFathers,'' the sage Rabbi Tarfon taught:\n\n       It is not up to us to finish the work, but neither are we \n     free to avoid it.\n\n  Later this week, the Senate will vote on the Jobs, Energy, Families \nand Disaster Relief Act of 2008. This bill may not finish all the work \nthat we need to do. But this bill does do work that we are not free to \navoid. I urge my colleagues to vote to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed.\n  This legislation is important to our economy, to our energy security, \nand to the wellbeing of America's working families. And it is also \nvital to helping people harmed by natural disasters to get back on \ntheir feet.\n  Some call this an ``extenders'' package. It extends tax incentives \nthat are important to American businesses and families.\n  It includes the deduction for college tuition and the R credit. It \nincludes the deduction for State and local income taxes. And it \nincludes the new markets tax credit which helps spur investment in low-\nincome communities.\n  But S. 3335 is more than just an extenders bill. It also contains \nvital new provisions.\n  It includes tax credits for plug-in vehicles. It includes a long-term \nextension of tax credits for solar power. And it includes a badly \nneeded fix to the highway trust fund, which finances a large portion of \nour Nation's transportation infrastructure. That has to be extended; \notherwise, a lot of jobs will go wanting. A lot of construction jobs \nwill not be there, unless we maintain and continue financing for the \nhighway program.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up this bill and pass it.\n  The vote this week will not be the first time this year that the \nSenate has sought to extend this important tax legislation.\n  In May, the House passed H.R. 6049, the Renewable Energy and Job \nCreation Act of 2008. That bill included a roughly $17 billion energy \ntax package. And it included $37 billion in other tax extenders. The \nbill was offset with responsible tax policies that would have changed \nthe timing of tax on offshore hedge fund managers and multinational \ncorporations.\n  The majority leader tried to take up that bill in June. In fact, he \ntried twice. But some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould not allow us to proceed to the bill.\n  The first attempt to proceed failed, 50 to 44, on June 10. The second \nattempt failed a week later, with a vote of 52 to 44.\n  Some argued that the House bill lacked key items. For example, some \nsaid that it should have included relief from the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  And some objected to provisions that were in the bill. For example, \nsome said that it should not have included Davis-Bacon protections on \nprevailing wages.\n  In response to those and other concerns, I introduced S. 3125, a \nrevised version of the bill that passed the House.\n  S. 3125 included a one-year patch for the alternative minimum tax. It \nwould prevent more than 20 million families from paying a tax that \nCongress never intended them to pay.\n  And in an effort to reach bipartisan compromise, that bill omitted \nthe Davis-Bacon provision.\n  But my friends on the other side still objected to that package. They \nexpressed concern over other items, such as a provision that allows \nattorney contingency fees to be deducted in the year that they are \nincurred, rather than upon disposition of the case.\n  I worked to address the concerns of my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. And last Friday, I introduced another bill S. 3335, the \nJobs, Energy, Families and Disaster Relief Act of 2008. That is the \nbill that I hope the Senate will turn to this week.\n  This legislation includes the core of the previous bill I introduced. \nIt includes a strong energy package. It includes an AMT patch. And it \nincludes the House-passed individual and business tax extenders.\n  S. 3335 also contains several new items. In response to growing \nconcerns over our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, this bill would \nshore up the highway trust fund. Last Wednesday, the House passed a \nstand-alone version of this highway fix by an overwhelming vote of 387 \nto 37.\n  And S. 3335 contains billions in relief for those affected by \ndevastating natural disasters.\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\n  And in response to the other key criticism of S. 3125, the one \nrelated to attorneys' fees, S. 3335 dropped that provision altogether.\n  In short, the bill that we will have a chance to vote on this week is \naimed at helping create jobs, advancing our energy independence, \nhelping working families, and offering relief to those areas that have \nexperienced natural disasters.\n  And by making major modifications to past versions of the bill, it is \naimed at getting broad support.\n  Now, some Senators really want to vote for this because it is the \nright thing to do. But they are told by the leadership: Don't do it. \nThey want to vote for it; they are chafing at the bit to vote for it, \nbut they are told not to do it. Why, I don't know.\n  Now some on the other side have also objected that we should not \nconsider a revenue bill that originated in the Senate.\n  While it is true that the House must originate revenue bills, there \nis precedent for the Senate's acting in advance of the House.\n  For example, the other side did just that in moving the Tax Increase \nPrevention and Reconciliation Act in 2005. The Senate took up its bill, \nS. 2020, on November 16, 2005, nearly a month before the Senate \nreceived the House companion measure.\n  And in the case of the bill before us this week, I think that it is \nimportant for Senators to be able to vote for the improved version of \nthe bill, the bill that includes all the changes that I have been \ndiscussing.\n  And after we get a good vote on this bill, we can move to amend a \nHouse-passed bill with our Senate measure.\n  Congress needs to do more than just extend legislation. Congress \nshould work on new policy, new legislation, and new ideas.\n  We need to take a hard look at our Tax Code. We need to make it \nfairer and simpler. I have begun that process, through a series of \nhearings in the Finance Committee.\n  We need to address the unsustainable growth in health care costs. I \nhave also begun an effort to that end, through a series of hearings on \nhealth care, which accounts for one-sixth of America's economy.\n  And we need to address the vital need for a new energy policy, one \nthat accounts for the changing realities of our environment, our \nnational security, and our economy.\n  For more than a year, I have been working to pass a meaningful \npackage of energy-tax incentives. It is a package with the goal of \nmoving this country toward greater energy independence. And it is a \npackage that would help to prepare our economy for a system that also \naddresses global warming.\n  These are big challenges. And they will not be solved through one \nbill, or one congressional session. But even though we cannot finish \nthe work, we still have an obligation to do what we can.\n  This bill may not finish all the work that we need to do. But this \nbill does do work that we are obligated to do.\n  Let us do that work. Let us invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. \nAnd let us provide this help to America's economy, to America's energy \nsecurity, and to the wellbeing of America's working families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7594-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CROW WATER SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. President Lyndon Johnson once wrote:\n\n       A nation that fails to plan intelligently for the \n     development and protection of its precious waters will be \n     condemned to wither because of its shortsightedness. The hard \n     lessons of history are clear, written on the deserted sands \n     and ruins of once proud civilizations.\n\n  I rise today to talk about a proud Nation from my home State of \nMontana that is planning for the development and protection of its \npriceless water.\n  The nation I am referring to is the Crow Nation, and today, along \nwith Senator Tester, I introduced a bill to ratify the Crow Tribe's \nwater compact.\n  This compact will protect the Crow Tribe's water rights, provide for \nthe development of municipal and agricultural water systems, and create \ngood paying jobs. Everyone has a right to have access to clean, \nreliable water, and Senator Tester and I are here today to help make \nsure that right is upheld.\n  In 1908, the Supreme Court established that when Congress set aside \nland for Native American tribes, it also reserved water rights for the \ntribes to develop their lands for agriculture. The Crow Tribe has \nwaited nearly 100 years to secure the rights to its water. The bill I \nam introducing today will ensure that the Crow people can finally \naccess the water that is rightly theirs while protecting the water \nrights of nontribal water users.\n  This bill that Senator Tester and I are introducing also ensures that \nthe Crow Tribe has the infrastructure it needs to develop its water \nresources. To this end, the bill authorizes funding for a drinking \nwater system that will bring clean water to families across the \nreservation. This project will help protect public health and help \ncreate good paying jobs.\n  The bill also authorizes the rehabilitation of the Crow Tribe's \nirrigation system. The Crows' land is important to their identity, \ntheir history, and their economy. Rehabilitating the Crow Tribe's \nirrigation system will ensure that Crow farmers and ranchers can work \ntheir land for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, the Crow Nation is a proud nation with abundant water \nresources. The bill I have developed with the Crow tribal leadership is \na reflection of the Crow people's good foresight. This legislation will \nprotect the Crow Tribe's water, create good paying jobs, and ensure \nthat the Crow continue to be a proud and prosperous people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7594-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer. I want the distinguished Presiding Officer to know the weather \nin our home State is much nicer today than it is here.\n  I support the Free Flow of Information Act, S. 2035, which the \ndistinguished majority leader has moved to. I hope the minority will \nallow us to consider this important legislation.\n  I thank the majority leader for his willingness to bring this \nlegislation before the Senate. I have worked with him on this matter to \nfind an opportunity for Senate action since the Judiciary Committee \nreported this bill last October. I appreciate the support of the \nmajority leader. He has offered a generous response to the bipartisan \nrequest Senator Specter and I made to him and the Republican leader \nearlier this year to proceed to this bill. In a bipartisan letter, we \nasked if he would proceed to the bill. He has done that. I applaud him \nfor it.\n  Our bill has 20 Senate cosponsors, Members of both parties. I hope \nthe Republican cosponsors will join us in moving to the bill and will \nbring along the seven or eight Republicans we will need to overcome yet \nanother filibuster and make progress.\n  I have also supported and urged the Senate to proceed to the strong \nHouse-passed version of the Free Flow of Information Act, H.R. 2102. \nThat bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 398 to 21--\nso it obviously has overwhelming bipartisan support. The House bill has \nmore than 70 cosponsors--both Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Years ago, my mother and father owned a small daily newspaper in \nWaterbury, VT, the Waterbury Record. As a child, I grew up hearing, at \nthe kitchen table, that a free and vibrant press is essential to a free \nsociety. That has been demonstrated again and again over the last eight \nyears. That is why I cosponsored the Senate version of this bill and I \nhave worked hard to enact a meaningful reporters' shield law this year.\n  That is why I made sure that for the first time ever--for the first \ntime ever--the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a media shield law \nto protect the public's right to know. The Judiciary Committee reported \na bill sponsored by Senators Lugar, Dodd, Specter, Schumer, Graham, and \nmyself with a strong bipartisan 15-to-4 vote.\n  I wish to commend the leadership of Senator Lugar and Senator Dodd in \nconnection with this matter. They began this quest for fairness when it \nseemed an impossibility several years ago. They have worked diligently \nto bring us to where we are today--at the cusp of achieving a Federal \nshield law--if only the Senate gets the support of a handful of \nRepublican Senators to proceed to the bill.\n  All of us--whether Republican, Democratic or Independent--have an \ninterest in enacting a balanced and meaningful shield bill to ensure a \nfree flow of information to the American people. Forty-nine States and \nthe District of Columbia currently have codified or common law \nprotections for confidential source information. But even with these \nState law protections, the press remains the first stop, rather than \nthe stop of last resort, for our Government and private litigants when \nit comes to seeking information. Time and time again--especially during \nthe years when this Congress refused to do real oversight of the \ncurrent administration--when there was waste in Government, when there \nwere serious mistakes in Government, even when Government was breaking \nthe law, we found out about it first and foremost because of the press \nin America.\n\n  Earlier this year, Toni Locy, a professor of journalism at West \nVirginia University, also a former USA TODAY reporter, was held in \ncontempt of court for refusing to divulge her confidential sources. \nThere are scores of other reporters who have been questioned by Federal \nprosecutors about their sources, notes, and reports in recent years. \nThis is a dangerous trend that can have a chilling effect on the press, \nbut even more so, on the public's right to know. If you don't have a \nfree press,\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\nthen you don't have a free society. If you don't have a way for \nAmericans to know what their Government is doing, then we will all \nhurt. To paraphrase Mark Twain, you should support your country all the \ntime but question your government when it deserves it. We need a press \nwilling and able to do that.\n  Enacting the Free Flow of Information Act--which carefully balances \nthe need to protect confidential source information with the need to \nprotect law enforcement and national security interests--would help to \nreverse this troubling trend and benefit all Americans. The bill \ncreates a qualified privilege to protect journalists from being forced \nto reveal their confidential sources. The bill contains exceptions to \nthe privilege for criminal conduct or national security. The \nlegislation also requires that Federal courts weigh the need for the \ninformation with the public's interest in the free flow of information, \nbefore compelling reporters to disclose their confidential sources.\n  Although I strongly support the enactment of a Federal shield law, I \nhave some reservations about possible revisions to the bill we passed \nout of Committee. I am pleased that language has been drafted to \naddress my concerns about making sure that legitimate bloggers and \nfreelance journalists are included in the definition of the persons \ncovered by this bill.\n  However, I hope that any amendments to this legislation will include \nstronger protections for journalists and their sources with regard to \nmatters of national security and classified information. No one would \nquibble with the notion that there are circumstances when the \nGovernment can and should have the right to compel information in order \nto keep us safe. But many newsworthy stories concerning national \nsecurity, such as the exceptional reporting on the CIA's secret prisons \nand the warrantless--and many feel illegal--wiretapping by the National \nSecurity Agency were published with the help of confidential sources, \nto the great benefit of the general public and the accountability that \nordinary Americans deserve from their Government.\n  I fear that proposals from some in this body do not go far enough to \nprotect against Government abuse in this area or to protect the \npublic's interest in the dissemination of newsworthy information.\n  Not all reporters will be as lucky as Bill Gertz of the Washington \nTimes was when a judge recently upheld his claim in a case in a \nCalifornia Federal court. Even with this victory, however, the \nGovernment has responded by broadening its inquiries. To prevent \nfurther intrusions on our fundamental first amendment rights, we need \nsome uniform standards. We need procedures to evaluate claims of \nprivilege and protect the public's right to know. To do that, of \ncourse, the Congress must act.\n  In a much touted speech to the American Enterprise Institute last \nweek, current Attorney General Mukasey, who still opposes a Federal \nshield law, articulated principles that argue for enacting one. \nAttorney General Mukasey endorsed congressional legislative action when \nthere exists a ``serious risk of inconsistent rulings and considerable \nuncertainty.'' He noted that congressional action to provide procedures \nin national security cases is ``well within the historic role and \ncompetence of Congress.'' Although he was proposing action in another \nsetting, the Attorney General's remarks likewise support congressional \naction to standardize and clarify the procedures governing a Federal \nstatutory press shield law. In view of the disparate rulings and \noutcomes that have developed in the courts since the Supreme Court's \nBranzburg decision 36 years ago, it is now time for Congress to \nestablish a framework for the courts to resolve press privilege \nassertions fairly and consistently, and we can do this while preserving \nour national security.\n  When he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of \nthe Federal shield law in 2005, William Safire told us that the essence \nof news gathering is this: If you do not have sources you trust and who \ntrust you, then you don't have a solid story--and the public suffers \nfor it. Well, Bill Safire is exactly right. We simply have no idea how \nmany newsworthy stories have gone unwritten and unreported out of fear \nthat a reporter would be forced to reveal a source or face jail time. \nWe also do not know how many potential whistleblowers, or other \nconfidential sources, have chosen to remain silent out of fear that \njournalists could be compelled to disclose their identity.\n  Just recently, investigative journalism and confidential sources have \nhelped to uncover significant Government failures in Iraq, in New \nOrleans, as well as Government neglect at the Walter Reed Medical \nCenter. We wouldn't have found out how poorly the returning soldiers \nwere being treated--people who have lost limbs or have been paralyzed \nor blinded in the war in Iraq--by the Veterans' Administration and the \nproblems and events at our Government facilities. We would not have \nfound out about that if a confidential source hadn't told a reporter.\n  We have seen just in the past few days news articles about \npoliticization at the Department of Justice. A lot of the spotlight on \nhow politicized this administration's Justice Department has become \ncame out of hearings we held in the Judiciary Committee. But much of \nwhat we found out about what was going on at the Justice Department \ncame out of press reports based on confidential sources.\n\n  We learned from the press that the White House, afraid that they \nmight find out the truth, avoided implementing the Environmental \nProtection Agency's recommendations on global warming by not opening \nthe agency's e-mails. Again, we find out about that from confidential \nsources.\n  As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of making sure \nthat the Government can effectively investigate criminal wrongdoing, \ncombat terrorism, and preserve national security. The Federal shield \nlegislation we are seeking to bring before the Senate strikes a balance \namong these important objectives. The bill addresses the legitimate \nneed for law enforcement to obtain information from reporters to \nprevent a crime or a national security threat.\n  In addition, by providing a qualified and not an absolute privilege \nto withhold the identity of confidential sources, the bill also \nadvances other important law enforcement objectives, such as \nencouraging whistleblowers to disclose fraud, waste, and abuse that \nmight otherwise go unreported.\n  The opposition to this carefully crafted bill by the Department of \nJustice and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI, is \nsimply misplaced. Although 49 States, the District of Columbia, and \nseveral Federal courts have recognized a reporter's privilege either by \nstatute or common law for years, the Department of Justice and ODNI \nhave not cited a single circumstance where the privilege caused any \nharm to national security or to law enforcement. In fact, the \nlegitimate concerns about the need to effectively combat crime and \nprotect national security have been satisfied by the bill and by \namendments to this bill offered in a bipartisan fashion by Senators \nFeinstein, Brownback, and Kyl.\n  A free press in our country is what sets us apart from so many other \nnations in the world. The distinguished Presiding Officer, in his years \nin the House and in the Senate, can certainly point to examples where \nwe have found out things that have been kept hidden from the Congress \nonly because the press uncovered them. Certainly, that has been my \nexperience in my years here in the Senate.\n  I also know that there is a temptation--when any administration has \nmade a serious mistake or is trying to hide wrongdoing by their \nadministration, the first thing they want to do is to make sure nobody \nin the press or the Congress or the public finds out what they have \ndone. For every administration, it is easy to have all of their press \npeople go out and tout the things they want us to know, the things they \nconsider a success. None want us to hear about the embarrassments or \nthe mistakes or, more recently, out-and-out wrongdoing. That is where \nyou need a press willing to go in and uncover Government wrongdoing and \nprotect the sources who help them to do so.\n  Do you think even with all of the hearings I and others have held we \nwould have found out how law enforcement was manipulated and thwarted \nby this administration in the selection and manipulation of U.S. \nattorneys?\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nWe found out about it first and foremost by the press, and then through \nwitness testimony in hearings, and now by the Justice Department's \nInspector General who had the willingness to stand up and point to the \nwrongdoing of this administration. And then there was Abu Ghraib--how \ndid we find out about that? We learned about it in the press, not \nbecause the administration was willing to say: Look at this terrible \nthing we have done.\n  So after months and months of delaying tactics and opposition by the \nBush administration, the time has come to pass a Federal shield law. I \nthank and commend the more than 60 news media and journalism \norganizations including ABC News, the Associated Press, CNN, the \nNational Newspaper Association, the Society of Professional \nJournalists, and the Vermont Press Association, that worked so hard to \nget us to this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of a support letter from the \nMedia Coalition Supporting the Free Flow of Information Act printed in \nthe Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will just leave with this: Let's make \nsure the Congress--especially this Senate--takes steps, as the other \nbody did, to make it easier for the public to know not all the things \nthe Government wants them to know but the times when our Government has \nmade mistakes, the times when our Government has not followed the law, \nthe times when our Government has tried to give disinformation. We are \na stronger nation if we know the truth. We are a weaker nation if our \nlaws allow the truth to be shielded from the American people. I trust \nthe American people. I trust the American people to question our \nGovernment. I trust the American people to be able to handle the \ninformation. I do not trust those who would try to use every barrier to \nkeep that information from the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n      Media Coalition Supporting the Free Flow of Information Act\n\n                                                    July 21, 2008.\n     Hon.

Your leadership \n     in support of this bill has been invaluable in fighting to \n     ensure that the American public has access to news and \n     information about their government and the institutions that \n     affect their daily lives. Protecting confidential sources \n     through federal legislation has broad support on both sides \n     of the aisle, in both chambers of Congress, and from state \n     attorneys general across the nation.\n       The legislation is vitally important to the national \n     interest, an informed citizenry, and a free and vibrant \n     press. As you know last October, S. 2035 was favorably \n     reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a strong \n     15-4 bipartisan vote and is supported by the presumptive \n     Republican and Democrat presidential nominees, Sens. John \n     McCain and Barack Obama. A similar shield bill (H.R. 2102) \n     passed by an overwhelming 398-21 vote.\n       Chairman Leahy, we appreciate your leadership and \n     respectfully request that you do whatever you can to make \n     sure that S. 2035 is approved by the Senate, without any \n     further amendments that would weaken the well-reasoned \n     protections in the bill.\n           Very truly yours,\n       ABC News, ABC Owned Television Stations, Advance \n     Publications, Inc., A.

I rise to talk about the \nsubject that has to do with the energy legislation that has been \npending before the Senate for I think 9\\1/2\\ days. I wish we would have \nhad votes before this time because it is one of the most important, if \nnot the most important, issues confronting the American people. I am \ngoing to speak about one of the amendments the majority has to offer \nwith reference to the Energy bill.\n  First, I wish to say I have no doubt that both sides of the aisle--\nbecause we do know what the public is thinking, so I would think both \nsides do know the public has changed its mind dramatically about \ndrilling for American oil. It wasn't too long ago that you were afraid \nto use the word ``drill.'' You had to use the word ``explore'' because \ndrilling had a bad connotation. But when the American people got around \nto thinking about this idea that if we had more oil available and the \nworld knew it and it was American and we could develop it, they knew \nthat would require drilling. No matter how sophisticated the drilling \nhas become with these giant offshore drilling pads which, if anybody \nhad a chance to see one, such as I have, you would see what we can do \nhundreds of miles underwater, without any degradation of the \nenvironment, and how men can go to work with that equipment and build \nthese giant facilities, where people can sleep while they maintain \nthem.\n  Underground, they can drill 10, 12, even 14 wells, and they all get \npiped into 1 pipe, and there isn't any seepage. When we had the great \nhurricane, they showed pictures of the pipes underground moving with \nthe current but not breaking. That is what is going to happen under the \nground off the coast--producing billions of barrels of oil and \ntrillions of cubic feet of natural gas. It belongs to us. Eighty-five \npercent of our coast is now closed.\n  We can speak about the fact we are already producing and already \nleasing, but 85 percent is not leased. Whatever is being talked about, \nsaying that leases are there and not producing--I don't have enough \ntime today, but I am going to explain why one of the amendments the \nmajority has that talks about producing doesn't produce anything \nbecause it is supposedly one of these amendments that talks about \ndrilling--drill it or lose it. That is already governed by a ``drill it \nor lose it'' condition in every lease. So nobody is out there operating \nwith leases they are not using, because if they do, they lose them. \nThey paid big money to get them so they can go down there and produce \nenergy for us.\n  I rise to speak on the status of the debate on this bill and on an \namendment the majority has put forth under the pretext of increasing \nour energy supply. That is what we have been talking about--increasing \nour energy supply. For the most part, all the amendments we have talked \nabout wanting to offer are increasing our energy supply. The current \nenergy crisis is derived from many factors, but the bill the majority \nleader has called up attempts to deal with only one of them: \nspeculation. There is no question that speculation is not the whole \nproblem. In fact, four of the most prominent leaders we have in matters \neconomic and matters that pertain to securities and matters that \npertain to such things as speculation have indicated the oil and gas \nprices are not driven by that but, rather, by supply and demand.\n  As I have said before, never in my 36 years in the Senate have I seen \na problem so big met with a proposed solution by the majority leader \nthat is so\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\nsmall. Speculation is adding to the severity of our energy crisis, but \nwithout question, an imbalance between supply and demand is at the root \nof the problems we face.\n  The Republican caucus has proposed a number of solutions that measure \nup to the present challenge. Despite this, as we begin the eighth day \nof debate on this bill, we have not had a single substantive vote on \nit. The American people certainly deserve better, and we ought to be \nable to come up with something better. But that is the way the process \nis--7 or 8 days without voting on an amendment. For most of that time, \nthe contention was that we could offer amendments. The truth is we \ncould not because we would have had to withdraw some amendments the \nmajority leader had offered, and certainly he would not have relished \nthat.\n  For the past week, the other side of the aisle has told the American \npeople to believe that Republicans are up to no good, and we are \nobstructing progress. The truth is we merely want to complete the work \nour constituents sent us here to do.\n  We know what Republican amendments seek to do. My legislation was \nintroduced more than 12 weeks ago, and the Republican leader's bill was \nfiled nearly 5 weeks ago. The Republican proposals clearly answer the \nquestion of how to produce more energy here at home while, at the same \ntime, reducing the amount we consume. Our motto has been abundantly \nclear: find more and use less. We will, perhaps, be voting and giving \neverybody in this body an approach to do that. I hope when we make such \nagreement, we will have a clear opportunity to have votes on that kind \nof proposition.\n  What has been less clear, outside of the speculation-only bill now \npending, is what exactly the Democrats are willing to do to reduce the \nenergy prices. Despite stalling progress on a real energy bill, the \nother side has realized they must at least appear to support greater \ndomestic production of energy. So late last week, 14 Democratic \nSenators introduced their own version of the Republican plan to find \nmore and use less.\n\n  Now, finally, the text of that amendment is public. However, we know \nit falls short of its own goals. Gone from it are the windfall profits \ntax, price-gouging, and NOPEC provisions that were soundly discredited \nby energy experts and editorial pages of all ideological stripes. They \nwere part of what was being tendered by the majority. They are gone \nfrom the proposal that 14 Senators from the other side of the aisle \nhave offered.\n  In their place is a bill that would still bring no new energy to \nmarket. It does not open any new areas to exploration--or shall I say \ndrilling? By increasing the fees applied to leases and preproduction \nrequirements, it could actually drive up the cost of energy and \nlengthen the time it takes to get that energy to market. It would delay \nthe development of one of America's most abundant energy reserves and \nincrease our vulnerability to an interruption in oil supply.\n  In short, the majority party's new ``production'' proposal contains \nfar more problems than it does solutions. It will not lower prices at \nthe pump, it will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and it will \nnot help resolve our energy crisis. That is the amendment that has been \ntouted by Senator Bingaman and about 12 or 13 other Senators. Our \ndependence upon foreign oil will in no way be ameliorated, and it will \nnot help resolve our energy crisis.\n  It is worth taking time on the floor to examine the substance of the \nproposal. The amendment is No. 5135, and it claims to address a number \nof so-called supply side issues, including lease duration, lease \nrentals, lease sales, resource estimates, the Roan Plateau, and the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  I would like to take a few moments to address these issues.\n  On the duration of leases, the amendment shortens the amount of \navailable time to complete all the activity leading up to and including \ndrilling for oil and natural gas. This approach would fail to increase \nsupply for several different reasons. It ignores the reason why it \ntakes so much time to get a lease into production in the first place. \nOil companies are not just wasting time, they are mandated to use up \nthat time. It actually adds to the central cause of those delays by \ncreating new bureaucratic requirements for writing ``diligent \ndevelopment plans.'' In other words, all they are doing and all they \nplan to do and all this wonderful work offshore that is out there, no \nthanks to the Congress and the President, because we kept most of it \nclosed--85 percent is still closed--but within that 15 percent you see \nterrific development and tremendous facilities. They are following \nrules. If you had them in a witness room and asked them what rules they \nare following, they would explain to you it takes a long time to go \nfrom the bid day--the day you get that lease--until you can actually \ndrill. They do everything possible to expedite, but some of the reasons \nfor delay they can do nothing about; they follow the rules. There are \nenvironmental rules--sometimes duplicated, but they are there. This \namendment I am speaking of, in an effort to say we are going to get \nmore and squeeze more out of what is there, I imagine these people who \nown it at $1.35 are not interested in squeezing out the oil for \nAmerica. They are interested in lollygagging. They paid money for the \nlease and they have money invested, but they are not in a hurry. So we \nhave to pass a new diligent development plan requirement.\n  There are already as many as 39 permits, documents, and analyses that \nhave to be done in the development of a lease. It is unclear how adding \nthe 40th step will move the process any faster.\n  Next, the amendment seeks to increase rental fees that leaseholders \npay to occupy Federal land. The increased fees that have been proposed \nwould discourage companies from bidding on and subsequently exploring \nleases that contain marginally attractive lands. Increasing the cost of \ndoing business is not the answer. Once you think about it, most \nSenators overwhelmingly will agree that we don't need to add to the \nfees. We don't need to add to the regulatory requirements. We need the \nopposite if we want more production.\n  The leader on the other side has an amendment that also attempts to \nalter the frequency of lease sales. This is appealing in principle, but \nas drafted the amendment merely pretends to speed up a process for \nareas where lease sales are already scheduled to take place or where \nlease sales have already been held without any interest from industry. \nIn effect, this bill is attempting to take credit for something that \nwas going to happen anyway or, worse, has already occurred without \nsuccess.\n  What the amendment does not do is open any new areas to leasing, \nwhich is the fundamental change that is so desperately needed in our \nmanagement of Federal lands. Energy companies should not be forced to \ndrill when and where it is politically convenient; they should be \nallowed to drill where resources are most concentrated and when \nconditions most warrant their development.\n  Something of a pattern is becoming evidence here. And not \nsurprisingly, it carries over to the so-called resource estimate--more \nnew words and new bureaucracy--called for by this amendment. \nPredictably, the inventory contemplated by this amendment is only for \nareas that are already leased or are already open for lease sale.\n  Instead of conducting an estimate of the resources within already \nopen areas and already existing leases, we should authorize a full \ninventory of the Nation's entire resource potential, including areas \nthat have historically been kept off-limits. Only then can Congress \nmake an informed decision. We must fully understand what our past \nenergy policies have kept off-limits and how those resources could be \nused to meet our future needs. Again, the Democratic amendment avoids \nthis very pressing task.\n\n  Another troublesome provision is the amendment's proposed swap of oil \nin the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The sponsors would have 70 million \nbarrels of light sweet crude--that is a specific type of oil that is \nvery expensive and very versatile--they would have that released within \n180 days and not replace it with fuel until as many as 5 years have \ngone. So had the Energy Committee not cancelled a hearing on this very \ntopic last week, we might know if this proposal makes any sense at all. \nI suspect it does not.\n  Having watched the price of oil climb by $20 a barrel from around \n$127 to a\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nhigh of $147--and we are all grateful it has come down a little bit \nafter deliveries of the SPR were suspended--it is highly unlikely that \na short-term release of oil will reduce oil prices over any sort of \ntime horizon.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember the purpose of SPR is to provide oil \nin the event of a supply disruption, not in the event of a price \nincrease. In the event of an emergency, enactment of this provision \nwould reduce our ability to cover import losses from 58 days to 52. \nJust imagine, the American people should know with all the troubles in \nthe Middle East and the straits, with boats loaded with crude oil, many \nsoon to be laden with natural gas, where they can pass--look at the \ndanger that is there. Look at America's future in terms of what might \nhappen there. Look at what might happen accidentally, much less \nintentionally.\n  We only have 58 days of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil in the \nrepository underground that we could use. The American people ought to \nbe grateful--and I think they are--that we did this. We have 58 days to \npump out that oil and use it if we are in one of these problems that \ncould come about from an oil shortage on the world market because of \naccidents, war, conflagration, or the like.\n  The other side would take that and say: Let's take 6 days of that \nreserve and put that oil out for sale and that might lower the price of \noil on the market and thus lower the price of gasoline. Anybody who \nsees that--we will show them the numbers later what that means--will \nknow that is not producing a new source of oil, drilling for it or \nexploring it. It is nothing but a short-term use of our petroleum \nreserves for price reasons when it should never be used for that, and \nit won't work anyway.\n  The amendment has many other shortcomings. The most damaging \nprovision to our energy security deals with the Roan Plateau in \nColorado.\n  The way the language is drafted speaks for itself.\n  On page 26:\n\n       The Secretary shall include in any mineral lease . . . a \n     stipulation prohibiting surface occupancy or surface \n     disturbance for purposes of exploration for or development of \n     oil and natural gas.\n\n  On page 29:\n\n       The Secretary may not permit through a lease or other means \n     any exploration for or development of oil shale resources.\n\n  And then on page 30:\n\n       The Secretary may not at any time issue mineral leases on \n     public land within more than one of the phased development \n     areas.\n\n  These restrictions are somehow fit for inclusion, even after a \nfinding on page 20 which asserts that ``the Roan Plateau Planning Area \nlikely contains significant energy resources.''\n  Why were these provisions included in a title called ``Oil Supply and \nManagement''? A plain reading of this language clearly demonstrates \nthat it is the sponsors' desire to manage that plateau in such a way \nthat its abundant energy resources will never be produced. In short, \nthis is a production amendment which prohibits production.\n  What my colleagues across the aisle don't want you to know is that a \nlease sale including parcels on the Roan Plateau is scheduled for \nAugust 14, a little over 2 weeks from now. If this section were enacted \ninto law, it would likely require the land use plan or the entire area \nto be redone, generally taking 2 to 3 years or more.\n  Let us not forget that the current plan for the Roan Plateau took 9 \nyears to develop and that this provision could require that the process \nbegin again from scratch and will eliminate any revenue from the coming \nAugust 14 lease sale which is already assumed in the budget at $100 \nmillion.\n  For all the shortcomings in this amendment, most revealing are the \nmeasures not included in it. There is no repeal of the restriction on \nregulations for commercial oil shale leasing. The other side has \ndecided to stand by a ban that they imposed last year on that resource. \nThere is no lifting of the congressional moratorium on the development \nof deep sea energy resources, despite the President already taking \naction to do so.\n  There is no mention of our Nation's vast domestic coal reserves which \ncould be used to provide secure, affordable energy for decades to come.\n  And there is no repeal of section 526 which impairs the Defense \nDepartment's efforts to develop resources of alternative domestic fuel.\n  Taken altogether, this amendment and the underlying speculation-only \nbill that is before the Senate suggests that the majority is content to \nmove on without having done anything to address the energy crisis. \nNothing. We were faced with an effort to proceed to another matter this \npast weekend, and the Senate rightly voted to reject it.\n  Yesterday afternoon, we were again faced with another attempt by the \nmajority to change the topic from what we were on to another topic. \nAgain, the Senate rightly defeated that effort. I hope we continue to \ndefeat efforts to move away from the No. 1 domestic issue facing the \nAmerican people.\n  This issue deserves our undivided attention. There is nothing to be \nafraid of. We have ample time to write a good bill that makes real \nprogress and provides real relief at the pump for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will be brief. I know Senator \nGrassley has been waiting as well. I will not speak for very long.\n  I rise to speak about S. 2035, the Free Flow of Information Act, a \nbill that Senator Specter and I have spent a lot of time on, worked on, \nand is cosponsored by many in the House and notably Senators Dodd and \nLugar who had a previous bill, as well as, of course, Senator Leahy who \nled the charge on so many different issues and has been very helpful in \nus moving this legislation forward.\n  I am going to speak tomorrow when we address the bill, but I wanted \nto let my colleagues know of a substitute amendment that Senator \nSpecter, I, and others will offer because it will modify the bill and \nmeet some of the objections.\n  First let me say the bill is very much needed. We have to find the \nright balance between the free flow of information and the ability of \nreporters to get that information from those in Government and, at the \nsame time, not be so far in that direction that we allow people to \neither break the law or harm the security of the United States.\n  This has been much more difficult than it appears to achieve, but we \nare very close. The bill codifies and standardizes existing tests used \nby Federal courts so that journalists, say, in Illinois are not subject \nto different treatment than journalists in California.\n  It certainly allows whistleblowers to be protected when they tell \nsomebody about something untoward. We certainly don't want, if a test \nis being fixed in the FDA because a drug company wants it, to prevent \nsome public servant in the Government from letting a reporter know to \nprevent harm. But at the same time, there is no absolute privilege and \nthere are exceptions in terms of harming national security, acts of \nterrorism, and other matters, such as kidnaping or murder.\n  Again, I will talk about this bill at some length tomorrow. But I do \nwant to go over some of the changes we have made so my colleagues are \naware of them before we vote.\n  As I said, Senator Specter and I have put together a substitute which \nif we adopt the motion to proceed--and I hope we will--we will \nimmediately offer, and that will be the base bill we will discuss. Let \nme talk about the changes made.\n  First, the intelligence community had concern that it would be too \ndifficult to prosecute leaks of classified information. The new bill \nmoves consideration of leaks of classified information from section 2 \nof the bill to section 5, and that removes two major hurdles for \nFederal prosecutors.\n  Under the new law, prosecutors will not have to prove any longer that \nthey have exhausted all options for finding the information or that the \ninformation is essential to their investigation. These hurdles still \nremain in the Department of Justice internal guidelines, but the bill \nis not as strict in that regard.\n  The bill also no longer requires that the person who leaked the \ninformation was authorized to have it.\n  This substitute clarifies that the act will have zero impact on \nintelligence gathering under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nThis bill does not affect FISA.\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\n  Third, the substitute explicitly provides that sensitive Government \ninformation will not be disclosed in open court. There was worry that \nunder a whistleblower law, that might happen. We make it clear that \nsecurity has to come first, but there also has to be balance in the \ntest.\n  Four, the definition of a covered person--and this has been one of \ntwo areas of some controversy--has been narrowed to ensure that it \nprotects only legitimate journalists, first used in the Second Circuit \ncase of von Bulow v. von Bulow to determine who qualifies as a covered \nperson. Someone who blogs occasionally is not going to get the \nprotection here. Of course, someone on a blog who is a regular \njournalist but happens to use the blog as a medium will be protected. \nAnd that is how it ought to be.\n  Five, the substitute creates an expedited appeals process ensuring \nthat litigation regarding whether the protection applies will be \nresolved as quickly as possible. In section 8, we expedite the appeals \nprocess.\n  These are the changes made. They make the bill better. The bill has \nthe support of the journalistic community. It has the support of 41 \nsitting States attorneys general, both Democrats and Republicans. It is \none of those rare bipartisan moments. It has the support of Senator \nObama and Senator McCain and, of course, passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee 15 to 4. A similar bill passed out of the House by 398 to 21 \nand, obviously, it has been endorsed by 100 newspapers. That is easy to \nsay, but in this town both the Washington Post, a more liberal paper, \nand the Washington Times, a more conservative paper, have endorsed it.\n  This bill has taken lots of time and lots of work to achieve a \ncareful balance. This is a rare moment, praise God, a broad consensus, \nand I hope we can move this bill forward tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I will speak at greater length tomorrow when we are \non the bill, but I wanted to let my colleagues know the substitute \nchanges which we will publish in the Record this evening so people will \nhave a chance to look at it.\n  I yield the floor so that my colleague from Iowa can speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                               Tax Policy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 2 days ago, I came to the floor to \ntalk about tax policy and the history of tax policy. I have come to \nfollow up on that speech of 2 days ago to talk about the recent history \nof speeches that were made in past Presidential elections and the tax \npolicy that was associated with those speeches and in another day or \ntwo, come to the floor to speak about the different tax policies \nbetween Senator Obama on the one hand and Senator McCain on the other \nhand.\n  History is very important. Elections have consequences. Policy coming \nout of an election has consequences and eventually affects real people. \nThe impact upon the voter of past elections, what people said in those \nelections, what happened after the election in policy, ought to be \nthings people are taking into consideration for the upcoming \nPresidential election. As to that speech I gave 2 days ago, I want to \ngo back and remind my colleagues of a couple of comments I made at that \nparticular time.\n  At various times during the past 25 years, we have had times when \nDemocrats have controlled both the Presidency and the Congress. There \nhave been times when the Democrats have controlled Congress and we had \na Republican President. And there have been times when we have had both \na Republican President and a Republican Congress. Tax cuts or tax \nincreases have resulted from that. And you find a pretty good pattern \nof when you have both a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President \nthat you have big tax increases, as is the case in 1993--if you \nremember the big tax increase of 1993.\n\n  Then there are periods of time when we have had a Republican \nPresident and a Republican Congress and you can see tax decreases--very \ndeep decreases in taxes. Then you have a period of time in here where \nthere was a little flurry--some tax cuts, some tax increases--when we \nhad a Republican President and a Democratic Congress.\n  So elections do have consequences. Another chart that would show it a \nlittle better and more specifically would be this thermometer chart, \nwhere we have it very clear that when you have times when you have a \nDemocratic President and a Democratic Congress, you have some of the \nbiggest tax increases in history. And that would be this figure. There \nare times we have had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress \nwith some tax increases but a little bit less. There are times we have \nhad a Democratic President and a Republican Congress with slight tax \ndecreases.\n  When you have a Republican President, a Republican Senate, and a \nDemocratic House, you have some tax decreases but not very much. Then \nyou have times when you have a Republican President, a Democratic \nSenate, and a Republican House, and you have tax decreases but not by \nvery much. Then you have times when you have a Republican President and \na Republican Congress and you have deep tax cuts.\n  So what this chart shows--this thermometer--over the last 25 years, \nis that if you have Republican Presidents and Republican Congresses you \nhave deep tax cuts. When you have Democrats controlling both the \nPresidency and the Congress, you have very rapid tax increases. So \nelections do have consequences.\n  I want to go now to a period of time of a specific election and the \ntax consequences that came as a result of that election. But I think \nyou have to realize that the relationship is clear from the past 25 \nyears: the more relative power Democrats have, the higher the \nprobability of a tax increase. So Americans will need to think long and \nhard about campaign promises of tax relief as they consider their \nchoices in this Presidential election. The reason is that history shows \nvery clearly, if Democrats obtain the White House and control of \nCongress, taxes are certain to go up. And not just go up on the wealthy \nbut across the board.\n  Today, I would like to follow up last week's discussion. This week, I \nwant to focus on a campaign season most like this one and take a look \nat how the victors in that campaign used their taxing power once sworn \nin. The period I am thinking about is 16 years ago. Well, in 16 years \nyou can learn a lot from history, and I think people ought to be \nreminded of it.\n  But before I get into details, I would like to say that I hope this \nelection doesn't go the same way that it did 16 years ago because \nPresident Bill Clinton was elected. I want people to be clear that I am \npulling for a Republican colleague, Senator McCain, to defeat another \none of our Senate colleagues, Senator Obama.\n  So let's turn the clock back to this time 16 years ago, and I have \nanother chart. This chart considers the story of Rip Van Winkle, which \nI think is very appropriate during this period of time. You know the \nstory about Rip Van Winkle. He was a person who slept for 20 years. \nHere is the chart showing Rip Van Winkle.\n  If you round up just a little bit, it is almost 20 years since that \n1992 campaign, and you will see from this chart those events from a \nwhile ago might have led to a form of tax hike amnesia.\n  If we go back to the 1992 campaign--and I will show you eventually \nhow this is pretty appropriate to the campaign coming up--in 1992, you \nfind a very charismatic, a very likable, a very articulate young \nGovernor from Arkansas barnstorming across the country. Bill Clinton \nwas 46 years old, facing a 47th birthday in mid-August. He was widely \nacknowledged as the most talented public speaker on the Presidential \nscene since Ronald Reagan.\n  America had been in a recession at that time. Although it was not \nreported until after the election, which is something you might expect \nfrom our liberal media, the American economy had recovered in the \nlatter half of 1992, but it was not officially announced until the day \nafter the 1992 election, when all of a sudden the recession was over, \njust because of the election. But all during that election, reading the \nmedia, you would always be reminded about the recession we were in. But \nmagically, election day 1992, 1 day later, and the recession was over.\n  The charismatic Democratic Presidential candidate promised to focus, \nin his words, ``like a laser beam'' on the economic ills that Americans \nworried about. In a key speech on June 21, 1992,\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\nthis ``different kind of a Democrat'' laid out his economic plan. He \ncalled the plan ``Putting People First.'' I am going to focus in a \nlaser-like way on then-Governor Clinton's tax agenda that he announced \nfor that 1992 campaign.\n  In that speech, candidate Clinton was very critical of the marginal \ntax rate relief that President Reagan had put into effect. To quote \ncandidate Clinton:\n\n       For more than a decade, this country has been rigged in \n     favor of the rich and the special interests.\n\n  And we still hear that today.\n\n       While the very wealthiest Americans get richer, middle-\n     class Americans pay more to their government and get less in \n     return. For 12 years, the driving idea behind American \n     economic policy has been cutting taxes on the richest \n     individuals and corporations and hoping their new wealth \n     would ``trickle down'' to the rest of us.\n  That is a quote from his speech of June 21, 1992.\n  As a relief from this version of the middle-class squeeze, candidate \nClinton proposed middle-income tax relief, and here is what he said:\n\n       Middle class tax fairness. Virtually every industrialized \n     nation recognizes the importance of strong families in its \n     Tax Code. We should too. We will lower the tax burden on \n     middle class Americans by forcing the rich to pay their fair \n     share. Middle class taxpayers will have a choice between a \n     children's tax credit and a significant reduction in income \n     tax rate.\n\n  Now, doesn't all of this sound very familiar to speeches that are \ngoing on this year? I have quoted from a June 21, 1992, speech given by \ncandidate Clinton, but you would think that you are hearing exactly the \nsame thing this year.\n  Now, let's get down to basic facts. The definitions of rich and \nmiddle class are always open. They probably vary from candidate to \ncandidate and everything with intellectual honesty and where you might \nset rich and where you might set middle class. A person who is rich in \nMason City, IA, might be middle class in New York City.\n  An irony I continue to notice around here relates to this point. It \nseems as if the politicians from the highest income, highest cost of \nliving, highest taxed States seem to be the most obsessed with raising \ntaxes on their Presidential candidate's definition of the rich. In this \ncase, I am referring to a single person who makes $125,000, or double \nit for a married couple to $250,000. That seems to be the dividing line \nbetween the rich and other people, according to the 2008 Democratic \nPresidential candidate.\n  Now, is $250,000 a rich family in Manhattan? Is $250,000 a rich \nfamily in San Francisco? Is $250,000 a rich family in Chicago? Is \n$250,000 a rich family in Boston? By the definition of Senators from \nthose areas, I guess I would have to say it is. Do those families in \nthose cities know they are rich and that their Senators think they pay \ntoo little tax?\n  But I digress. In candidate Clinton's economic plan that was \nannounced on June 21, 1992, the rich were--put another way--the top 2 \npercent income earners in the United States. On September 8, 1992, \ncandidate Bill Clinton said:\n\n       The only people who will pay more income taxes are the \n     wealthiest 2 percent, those living in households making more \n     than $200,000 per year.\n\n  By definition, you would think under candidate Clinton's plan that \neverybody below that level of 2 percent, or $200,000, is either middle \nclass or low income. Now, remember what I said that he said--the only \npeople who will pay more income taxes are the wealthiest 2 percent--\nbecause I am going to show you, after being sworn in, how that turned \nout to be a heck of a lot more people than the wealthiest 2 percent.\n  On January 20, 1993, President Clinton was inaugurated. Democrats \nretained their solid majority, 56 to 44, in this body. Although losing \n9 seats in the U.S. House, the Democrats retained a heavy majority of \n258 to 176. Once elected, the Democratic White House and the Democratic \nCongress converted the campaign economic plan, as you would expect them \nto, into a legislative blueprint. A key feature of the program, the \nmiddle-class tax cut, was thrown to the side.\n  On January 14, 2003, at a press conference, President-elect Clinton \nstated:\n\n       From New Hampshire forward, for reasons that absolutely \n     mystify me, the press thought the most important issue in the \n     race was a middle-class tax cut. I never did meet any voter \n     who thought that.\n\n  Now, how do you reconcile the contents of the economic plan and the \nshift in position after the election? Pulitzer Prize winning author Bob \nWoodward--who I think has a great deal of respect among most people of \nthe Senate--wrote a comprehensive book about the first part of the \nClinton administration. It was titled ``The Agenda.'' Mr. Woodward, of \nthe Washington Post, described it this way:\n\n       While Clinton continued to defend his middle-class tax cut \n     publicly, he privately expressed the view to his advisers \n     that it was intellectually dishonest.\n\n  That is Woodward saying that, not Chuck Grassley. The late \njournalist, Michael Kelly, in an article in the New York Times, \nexplained how the newly elected President planned to ``escape'' from \nhis middle-class tax cut campaign promise. Here is what Mr. Kelly \nwrote, in part:\n\n       [T]he President built himself an escape hatch a little less \n     than a month before Election Day. Every time Clinton said \n     ``I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle class,'' he \n     always added the phrase ``to pay for my programs,'' said a \n     chief political adviser to the President, who spoke on \n     condition of anonymity. He never, never, said just, ``I will \n     not raise taxes on the middle class.'' He always said ``I \n     will not raise middle-class taxes to pay for my \n     programs.''\n\n  Madam President, I want to have Mr. Kelly's article printed in the \nRecord. I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 1993]\n\n Political Memo; Re-examining the Fine Print On Clinton's Tax Promises\n\n                           (By Michael Kelly)\n\n       At a time when the public has repeatedly shown its distaste \n     for the maneuvers and machinations of politics, President \n     Clinton's White House is banking on a five-word loophole to \n     save it from voter outrage should Mr. Clinton propose a \n     broad-based energy tax.\n       During the campaign, Mr. Clinton promised tax cuts for the \n     middle class. Now Mr. Clinton and his chief economic advisers \n     are backing away from the tax cut and strongly hinting that \n     an energy tax will hit the middle class the hardest.\n       ``They campaigned on a middle-class tax cut and then four \n     days into a new Administration the chief economic spokesman \n     is talking about a middle-class tax increase,'' said Robert \n     S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal \n     research group. ``That's a flip-flop.''\n       Although Vice President Al Gore and Treasury Secretary \n     Lloyd Bentsen have mentioned the possibility of an energy tax \n     in recent interviews, the President and his advisers insisted \n     today that their economic plan was still under discussion and \n     that no decision had been made.\n       Still some Clinton advisers say they are not worried about \n     public outrage. They say the President built himself an \n     escape hatch a little less than a month before Election Day.\n       ``Every time Clinton said `I'm not going to raise taxes on \n     the middle class,' he always added the phrase ``to pay for my \n     programs,'' said a chief political adviser to the President, \n     who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``He never, never, \n     said just, 'I will not raise taxes on the middle class.' He \n     always said `I will not raise middle-class taxes to pay for \n     my programs.' ''\n       By this logic, the adviser said, Mr. Clinton's legalistic \n     construct was a ``distinction with a difference'' that allows \n     him ``the opportunity he now has'' to raise taxes without \n     incurring voter wrath.\n       But of late that sort of politics-by-loophole has not been \n     playing well.\n       In 1990, President George Bush signed an agreement with \n     Congress that obliged him to break his ``read my lips'' \n     campaign promise of 1988 not to raise taxes. Mr. Bush and his \n     advisers reasoned that voters had never taken his promise \n     seriously in the first place and would forgive its being \n     breached. The voters reacted with far more anger than \n     understanding, and Mr. Bush never regained their trust when \n     the economy turned sour.\n       In recent weeks, the gulf between Washington's view of what \n     constituted acceptable behavior and that of many voters was \n     again demonstrated in the matter of Zoe Baird. Mr. Clinton \n     pressed forward with his choice of Ms. Baird as Attorney \n     General despite the disclosure that she had once hired \n     illegal aliens. Mr. Clinton and his advisers figured \n     voters would forgive Ms. Baird what they considered a \n     small transgression in an otherwise impressive career.\n       The voters, recalling Mr. Clinton's emotional promises to \n     run a Government for the ``people who pay their taxes and \n     play by the rules,'' saw him as trying to give a break to a \n     rich woman who had done neither and forced Ms. Baird's \n     withdrawal. Some See a Liability.\n       Mr. Clinton's aides know full well that Mr. Bush's mistake \n     helped cost him his job. But they still contend that Mr. \n     Clinton is protected by his escape clause. ``People won't get \n     away with saying Clinton promised that\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\n     he was not going to raise taxes and then did,'' the adviser \n     said. ``He had many opportunities to make a `read my lips' \n     statement, and he did not.''\n       Some outside the Clinton camp disagree strongly with that \n     logic, however.\n       Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst who charted \n     the rise of middle-class anger in the late 1980's and spared \n     no criticism of Mr. Bush's broken promises, said: ``At the \n     most recent count, only 800,000 Americans were lawyers, and I \n     don't think the 248 million or so who are not lawyers are \n     going to buy a caveat stuck on in the middle of a passionate \n     plea to the middle-class voters that they should vote for him \n     because he was going to save them. Talk about reading his \n     lips.''\n       Mr. Clinton introduced the escape clause on taxes for the \n     middle class before a national audience in an Oct. 19 \n     Presidential debate in Richmond. ``I will not raise taxes on \n     the middle class to pay for these programs,'' he said. `Very \n     Conscious Decision'\n       Listeners without the benefit of law-school training might \n     have taken that as a pledge to not raise taxes on the middle \n     class. But the President's adviser said Mr. Clinton had \n     purposefully used, and reiterated, the phrase ``for these \n     programs'' to allow himself a way out of what careless voters \n     might have thought they had been promised.\n       ``It was a very conscious decision on his part,'' the \n     adviser said. ``I can tell you this from strategy sessions \n     and debate prep sessions. The idea of a flat-out promise of \n     `I will not raise taxes on the middle class, period,' was \n     rejected by the President. He refused to allow himself to be \n     boxed in that way.''\n       The matter of the escape clause illustrates a larger point \n     about Mr. Clinton that has become increasingly Obvious: It is \n     always wise to read the fine print. The fine print of Mr. \n     Clinton's promise on the tax cut for the middle class was \n     quite different from the broad thrust of his oratory on the \n     subject.\n       For a year, the Democrat campaigned on a platform of \n     economic renewal in which the Federal deficit could be halved \n     in four years rather painlessly by raising taxes on rich \n     people and foreign corporations and by improving the way \n     Government programs are managed.\n       In ``Putting People First,'' Mr. Clinton's often-touted \n     plan for American renewal, the candidate promised: ``We will \n     lower the tax burden on middle-class Americans by asking the \n     very wealthy to pay their fair share. Middle-class taxpayers \n     will have a choice between a children's tax credit or a \n     significant reduction in their income-tax rate.''\n       On July 13, speaking to reporters in New York, Mr. Clinton \n     said flatly, ``I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle \n     class,'' according to reports by The Chicago Tribune and the \n     Reuters news service. On the same day, in an interview shown \n     by Cable News Network, he said, ``I don't think we should \n     raise middle-class individuals' taxes, because their income \n     went down and their tax rates were raised'' in the 1980's.\n       But in the fall campaign, when his words were scrupulously \n     followed by a larger audience, Mr. Clinton took more care. \n     After the Richmond debate, he regularly re-stated the \n     position that his promise to the middle class was only that \n     he would not raise their taxes ``to pay for these programs.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. While the middle-class tax cut was discarded, the \ndefinition of the group subject to a tax increase, ``the rich,'' \nexpanded. According to a distribution analysis by the nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, the taxpayers above $20,000 in income received a \ntax increase. So no longer was it just taxing the top 2 percent richest \npeople in America. That was when you were campaigning for President. \nWhen you get to be President, it is $20,000.\n  It was true that taxpayers above $200,000 go up far more than other \ngroups. But generally taxpayers above $20,000 saw their taxes rise.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of the joint tax distribution analysis of the 1993 tax \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF THE REVENUE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1993 AS\n                                           AGREED TO BY THE CONFEREES\n                                               [103 income Levels]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Present-law        Present-law      Proposed change    Burden change as\n      Expanded income class \\1\\       Federal taxes \\2\\   average tax rate  in tax burden \\4\\  a share of income\n                                           Billions         \\3\\  Percent         Millions           Percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLess than $10,000...................                 $9               10.4            -$1,152              -1.28\n10,000 to 20,000....................                 39               11.9               -993              -0.30\n20,000 to 30,000....................                 72               17.0                 94               0.02\n30,000 to 40,000....................                 86               19.1                949               0.21\n40,000 to 50,000....................                 93               20.9              1,271               0.29\n50,000 to 75,000....................                201               22.3              3,517               0.39\n75,000 to 100,000...................                120               24.6              2,653               0.54\n100,000 to 200,000..................                142               26.6              4,598                .85\n200.000 and over....................                168               30.2             29,663               5.39\n                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total, all taxpayers..........               $930               22.1            S40,800               0.97\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The Income concept used to place tax returns into income categories is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus: [1]\n  tax-exempt interest, [2] employer contributions for health plans and life insurance, .

That comprehensive tax increase went into effect on the \nstrength of Democratic votes only. I was here and I remember that. You \ncould look at it as the consequences of the confidence in the large \nDemocratic majorities in Congress, and a newly elected Democratic \nPresident. Basically, however, there was no check on one political \nparty's agenda. If that agenda is to raise taxes and increase spending, \nthen it is not a surprise.\n  Mr. Kelly's article notes the adverse reaction of a prominent player \nof the leftwing in this town. This is a Mr. Robert S. McIntyre, who was \nvery active in causes that you consider liberal. Quoting from Mr. \nKelly's article, this is what Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens \nfor Tax Justice, a liberal research group, had to say.\n\n       They campaigned on a middle-class tax cut and then four \n     days into a new Administration the chief economic spokesman \n     is talking about a middle-class tax increase. That's a flip-\n     flop.\n\n  That is the end of the quote of Mr. McIntyre, quoting from Mr. \nKelly's article.\n  Most folks are unhappy about flip-flopping politicians. Fishermen may \nlike a flip-flopping fish that they brought into the boat. This photo \nis the best fish I could find to demonstrate that. That is about the \nonly kind of flip-flopper that would be received positively. If a \npolitician flips from a tax cut promise to a tax hike, you can bet most \nfolks will consider that move a flop in more ways than one.\n  All of this happened almost 16 years ago, but it is relevant for this \nyear as we go into a debate on taxes for this campaign. During almost \n14 years since Republicans have held either the White House or the \nCongress or both--and this chart shows, as I pointed out once before, \nCongress and the President have generally reduced the tax burden. That \nis during this period of time, when Republicans controlled both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  It has been a long time, almost 15 years since the American people \nhave seen a large tax increase, going back to the period of time when \nthe Democrats controlled both the Presidency and the Congress.\n  Then I remember right here on the floor, because I was here when he \nsaid it, the then-Finance Committee chairman Pat Moynihan termed the \n1993 tax bill:\n\n       . . . the largest tax increase in the history of public \n     finance in the United States or anywhere else in the world.\n\n  Philosopher George Santayana said words to the effect that history \nrepeats itself, and if you do not learn from history, you are bound to \nrepeat the mistakes of the past. A risk Americans face, if we hand over \nall the reins of power to the Democratic Party, is to repeat the \nhistory of 15 years ago.\n  I am a Republican. I know what polls show. They show right now that \nthe\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\nelectorate trusts Democrats more than Republicans on tax policy. But \nthe 1992 campaign shows that if you listen too much to what is said in \nthe campaign, it doesn't necessarily come out that way in the election. \nSo I raise the question, during the debate of 2008, in the Presidential \ncampaign, are we headed in the same direction? Are we going to hear all \nthe talk about taxing nobody but the rich but end up doing as we did in \n1993, taxing the middle class?\n  Our tax increase amnesia may lead us in that direction. We could find \nourselves then being like Rip van Winkle. We will hear dreamy rhetoric \nabout hope and about change. It will be clothed in a slumber of middle-\nclass tax relief and tax increases on only the rich, as it was in the \ncampaign of 1992. We could awaken from that slumber, our tax increase \namnesia would probably fade, we could wake up to another world record \ntax increase.\n  I know what the folks who put in place that world record tax increase \nwill say. They will defend it by arguing that it cut the deficit. They \nwill argue that by cutting the deficit and moving to a surplus, that \ninterest rates dropped. While it is true the fiscal situation went from \ndeficit in 1992 to surplus in 1999, there were many other factors \ninvolved and a tax increase was not the biggest reason for it.\n  First, supporters of the 1993 bill touted it as a dollar of spending \ncuts matched by a dollar of tax increase. If you were a taxpayer, \nwouldn't you buy that? Pay one more dollar and get a dollar decrease in \nexpenditures? But, you know, it doesn't work out that way. A close look \nat the numbers shows the bill contained $4 of tax increase to every $1 \nof spending cuts.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a summary of the Senate Finance \nCommittee Republican staff analysis dated June 28, 1993, printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             COMPARISON OF TAXES/FEES, SPENDING CUTS AND RATIOS IN FINAL BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL\n                                    [In billions of dollars over five years]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     Democrats      Republicans    In this bill\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTaxes and User Fees:\n    1.

Zero is shown in the chart because interest savings are not counted as a spending cut in figuring\n  the ratio.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have another chart to back up what I say, that the \ntax increase was not responsible for the deficit going down. The chart \nshows the source of deficit reduction from 1990 through the year 2000. \nThe tax increase represented only 13 percent, just 13 percent of the \ndeficit reduction during that period. Other revenue, mainly from \neconomic growth and defense spending cuts, made the deficit decline.\n  Even with the 1993 bill in effect, 2 years later the Congressional \nBudget Office projected President Clinton's budget as producing \nsignificant deficits as far as the eye could see.\n  But several events not related at all to the 1993 tax increase pushed \nthe budget toward surplus until 1999. First, Republicans attained \ncontrol of Congress in 1994 and made a deficit reduction a priority. \nYear after year, Republican Congresses resisted Democratic efforts to \nspend over tight budget caps placed in the Republican budget. Most \noften, President Clinton would extract additional spending in the end \ndeal. Republican resistance, however, to popular Democratic spending \nproposals often had political consequences for Republican Members.\n  Second, revenues, especially capital gains revenues, grew after the \nbipartisan Tax Relief Act of 1997. The centerpiece of that bill was, \nironically, a middle-class tax cut in the form of a $500-per-child tax \ncredit. The child tax credit was a fundamental part of the Republican \nContract With America.\n  Another key component of that bill was a reduction in the top capital \ngains rate from 28 percent down to 20 percent. It is down to 15 percent \nnow, as a result of the 2003 tax bill, but then it went from 28 down to \n20 in 1997.\n  As I said, there was a widely documented significant growth in \ncapital gains revenue after that rate reduction in 1997, as there was \nwith the rate reduction in 2003. Indeed, even the Clinton Treasury \nscored the reduction as a revenue raiser and was more than vindicated.\n  Finally, external factors aside from tax policy led to revenue \ngrowth. Free trade opened more markets to American goods and services. \nThe Internet bubble started to form. It was burst in 2000 with the \ncollapse of the NASDAQ and the business cycle yielded an economic \nexpansion after the 1991 recession ended.\n  Economist J.D. Foster has documented this data. I commend to my \ncolleagues WebMemo dated March 5, 2008, available on the Internet at \nwww.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/wm1835.cfm.\n  At the end of the day, the justification for the tax flip-flop in \n1993 mattered not one whit. Supporters of the 1993 tax hike can offer \nwhatever reason they want for the record tax increase. A flip-flop of \nthat size is, in fact, a flip-flop.\n  What they cannot dispute is their Presidential candidate promised a \nmiddle-class tax cut. Once they had the White House and congressional \ncontrol, the other side abandoned the tax cut promise, raised taxes on \nAmericans--not just above $200,000 a year but from $20,000 up.\n  That is not a tax cut. That is a middle-class tax increase. So, once \nagain, like Rip Van Winkle, taxpayers do not want to wake up to that \ntax increase.\n  As a minimum, as the Presidential campaign unfolds, Americans need to \nkeep this very clear history in mind. We need to probe the candidates \nin 2008 on where they want to go on tax policy so what they say in 2008 \nis done in 2009, not a repeat of what was said in 1992 and what was \ndone in 1993. We need to be careful not to leave escape hatches on \nfavorable sounding tax cut campaign promises.\n  In that vein, I will follow up on this discussion and the prior \ndiscussion with a later speech that concentrates on where each \nPresidential candidate stands this year on tax issues. I will examine \nthese positions in the light of this history I have discussed--of the \nlikelihood of each side, whether they will deliver on campaign tax \npolicy positions.\n  To sum up, we are hearing from a very articulate and attractive \nDemocratic Presidential candidate. On tax issues, as we heard 16 years \nago from the soon-to-be President at that time, Bill Clinton, we are \nhearing a proposal to tax the rich this year to provide tax cuts for \nthe middle class. We are hearing that this year.\n  The Presidential candidate on the Republican side has a different \nmessage. We need to explore that as well. His message, consistent with \na Republican position for almost 30 years, has\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nbeen to continue progrowth, low levels of taxation. In light of history \nI look forward to discussing the two competing visions of tax policy in \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes, to be followed by Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island \nfor 30 minutes, to be followed by Senator Brownback for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. First and foremost, let me thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his courtesy. We have been moving back and forth throughout \nthe last number of days of debate. My presence on the floor allowed him \nto offer the courtesy--and I greatly appreciate it--to speak for 10 \nminutes ahead of him. He would be entitled to be next. I thank him for \nthat.\n  Let me speak to what Senator Grassley has spoken to briefly in saying \nthat the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee has spoken very \nclearly on the critical nature of tax policy to the economy. While that \nis valid, there is a tax at this moment in time that is being charged \nevery consumer in America who buys gasoline at the gas pump. It is the \ntax of nonproduction. It is the tax of public policy that has denied \nour great country its continued ability to produce the necessary supply \nof energy to the phenomenal economy we have.\n  As a result of our failure to continue public policy that allowed \nproduction over the last 20 years, Americans are paying a higher price, \na higher energy tax today at the pump than ever in our history; $4.10, \n$4.15, $4.20 gas is at this moment the No. 1 issue in America, not only \ntaxing the pocketbooks of the average consumer but taxing the average \nfamily in a way that they not only feel less secure today because their \nenergy bill has gone up over 20 percent this year but because we have a \nCongress stalled out at this moment. We have a Senate that is denying \nits responsibility to the American people to pass public policy that \nwill allow us to continue to produce and, hopefully, drive down the \nprice of oil.\n  In the absence of that kind of policy, what has happened in the last \n6 months as energy prices have gone through the roof? American \nconsumers have driven 40 billion less miles. They are voting with their \nfeet at this moment and voting to stay away from the gas pump. As they \nstay away from the gas pump, as they drive less, as they conserve, not \nonly are they changing the economy of our country, they are changing \ntheir lifestyles. I don't think they are very happy about it. In fact, \nthose I talk to back home in Idaho are very angry about it. But they \nare having to do something to avoid the phenomenal tax energy has \nplaced on the American family.\n  What happened in the last 2 weeks? Oil prices, world oil prices have \nbegun to drop. They are dropping not because of increased supply, not \nbecause the Senate has done anything, but because the American consumer \nhas said: We can no longer afford this. They are backing away from the \npump and changing their lifestyle. It is truly an issue of supply and \ndemand. Supply hasn't gone up in the last several months but demand is \ndropping.\n  Not only is demand dropping in our economy, it is dropping in Western \nEurope. It is dropping in Spain and Denmark, where there are \nsignificant recessions or downturns in the economy underway. In China \nand India, which have become the new large consumers of oil, our \neconomy's slowdown is going to situate a slowdown in the Chinese \neconomy, which has become a major supplier of goods to the American \neconomy. That is just around the corner.\n  So are we going to be lulled into a sense of false security if energy \nprices over the course of the next several months drop below $4 a \ngallon and into $3 a gallon? Will the American consumer heave a sigh of \nrelief and say: Crisis over?\n  I hope they don't. Here is why I hope they don't. It is very clear \nfrom this graph. This is a graph from 1890 to 2030 about the overall \nsupply of oil in this country. Starting in about 1950, a very \ninteresting pattern emerged that grew rapidly until today, when we buy \nour oil, 70 percent of it, from some other country; in other words, we \ndon't supply it. We could supply it. We have the oil reserve under the \nground. But for political purposes, we have denied ourselves, our \nmarket, our producers the right to go there and get it. Here is what \nhas happened. The dependency has grown so that we are now nearly 70 \npercent dependent on foreign sources of oil. We are less secure today. \nWe get whipsawed in the world market because oil is priced as a world \ncommodity and now, in the last decade, China and India have entered the \nmarket in ever greater demand.\n  What I want to show next is a bit of a complication but it is true in \nthe oil markets of today. Why do I know about it? I have been in \nCongress 28 years. I have spent a fair amount of time dealing with \nenergy. All during that time, I have argued that if you don't produce, \nsomeday something would happen--it is called a breakpoint--that \nbreakpoint would occur, and American consumers would all of a sudden \nfind a phenomenal ramp-up in the price of energy at the pump, that tax \nI am talking about, that 20 percent hike in the cost of energy that \nAmerican public policy produced for the American consumer in the last \nyear.\n  Here is the chart. The dark area is U.S. production from 1970 to \n2005. That is what we were producing. I shouldn't say just U.S. \nproduction; it was overall world demand production. What is interesting \nabout it, this little green margin at the top was surplus supply. In \nother words, it was available. The market wasn't demanding it, but if \nthe market demanded it, you could turn on a pump, turn a valve on a \nwell somewhere in Saudi Arabia, probably, or maybe Venezuela, and you \nhad spare capacity in the market. But as you will notice, this green \nmargin, this spare capacity margin in world supply began to rapidly \nnarrow starting in about 2000 through 2005. That is when China and \nIndia were entering the market at ever greater capacity because their \neconomies were growing. They were becoming more wealthy, and they were \nusing oil as a part of the energy supply to produce the goods and \nservices they were selling to the world market. During that time, we \nwere not expanding world capacity. So the margin, if you will, the \nbumper wasn't there anymore. Come 2005, we were nearly at a breakpoint. \nBeyond that, here is the rest of the story, and we know it today. There \nis no spare capacity out there. There is no way we can offset increased \ndemand. So consumers in America and all over the world are starting to \ncompete for the substance of oil by higher prices.\n  That is why for the last 2 weeks we have been on the floor talking \nabout the ability to increase supply against ever-growing demand. But \nthe market forces are at work. That demand has slipped off a little \nbit. Why? Because of that high tax at the gas pump. That doesn't mean \nit will go away, not at all. China and India are still consuming at \never-higher rates. They are simply going to grab that which we are not \nusing today in the world market. So when our consumers want to come \nback to the market, when prices drop a little bit, will there be more \noil in the market? There is a strong possibility there may not be, \nunless this Congress recognizes the error of its ways and allows us to \nget into the business of production again.\n\n  We have put off limits all around the United States vast quantities \nof oil that I and the world believe we ought to be producing. Guess \nwhat the American consumer is saying. In the State of Florida, where \nmaybe a year ago or 2 years ago, 70 percent of Floridians would have \nsaid: Don't drill off our shore, I am being told by legitimate polling \ntoday that 70-plus percent of them are saying: Drill, produce. In fact, \nwe believe that by the end of the week or early next week, the American \npeople will see credible polling data that says nearly 80 percent of \nthe American people are saying: You go produce that oil. Why are you \nasking foreign nations to supply it? We have the oil. Why aren't we \ndrilling it?\n  You hear the argument here on the floor: My goodness, it would take \n4, 5, 6 years to bring that oil online. I suggest that it wouldn't take \n4 or 5 or 6 years. We know the oil is there, maybe 2 billion barrels of \noil and literally hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\ngas. Here are the pipelines. Here are refineries. Here is the \ninfrastructure that could take this oil immediately out of what we call \nthe eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Florida, and bring it into \nproduction within 2 to 3 years.\n  What does the marketplace say? What does that buffer out there, that \ngreen line on that other chart say, if, in fact, we were to do that? It \nwould say: My goodness, there is now potentially spare capacity in the \nmarket, and prices begin to drop. No, we can't produce our way out of a \ncrisis, but we can lessen the crisis while the American economy and \ntechnology are taking us to new forms of energy and to new ways to \nsupply transportation.\n  I hope the Senate faces the reality that we have to get this country \nproducing again. If we do, we can say to the American consumer: We will \nlower your tax burden at the gas pump, and we are going to create once \nagain the kind of flexibility the American consumer has in their family \nbudget. You lower the gas price, you lower the tax at the pump. That is \nthe reality of what we are doing. It is a very real tax today. It has \nfrightened the American consumer, and it has put our Nation in a state \nof insecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                  EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise to speak about a matter that \nI very much regret being here to discuss, but events have driven me to \nthis point and, with me, the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Mrs. Boxer, Senator Klobuchar, and others as well.\n  For most of its nearly four-decade history, Americans could look to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency for independent leadership, \ngrounded in science and the rule of law. It was an agency whose clear \nmission was to protect our environment and health.\n  At its very founding, EPA's first Administrator, William Ruckelshaus, \nstated unequivocally:\n\n       EPA is an independent agency. It has no obligation to \n     promote agriculture or commerce; only the critical obligation \n     to protect and enhance the environment.\n\n  During the tenure of Administrator Stephen Johnson, we have seen that \nclear mission darkened by the shadowy handiwork of the Bush White \nHouse, trampling on science, ignoring the facts, flouting the law, \ndefying Congress and the courts, while kneeling before industry \npolluters, and all for rank and venal purposes. Under Administrator \nJohnson, EPA is an agency in distress, in dishonor, and in bad hands.\n  Events last week have shed new light on the extent of the damage done \nto this great agency, but the evidence of Mr. Johnson's dismal record \nhas been growing for many months. The charges are serious and fall in \nthree separate categories: his repeated decisions putting the interests \nof corporate polluters before science and the law, even when it puts at \nrisk our environment and the health of American people; his deliberate \nactions to degrade the procedures and institutional safeguards that \nsustain the agency; and his apparent dishonesty to us in testimony \nbefore Congress.\n  The particulars are these. Count 1: On pollution from ozone, the EPA, \nunder Administrator Johnson, departed from the consistent \nrecommendations of agency scientists, public health officials, and the \nagency's own scientific advisory committees and instead set an ozone \nstandard that favored polluters. The standard he set was inadequate to \nprotect the public, especially children and the elderly, from the \nharmful effects of ozone pollution, from asthma and lung disease.\n  Indeed, it was so inadequate that EPA's own Clean Air Scientific \nAdvisory Committee took the unique step of writing to the Administrator \nto state that they ``do not endorse the new primary ozone standard as \nbeing sufficiently protective of the public health'' and that the EPA's \ndecision ``fail[ed] to satisfy the explicit stipulations of the Clean \nAir Act that you ensure an adequate margin of safety for all \nindividuals, including sensitive populations.''\n  Setting this inadequate ozone standard against the evidence was a \ndereliction of Administrator Johnson's duty to the Agency he leads and \nof EPA's duty to protect the health of the American people.\n  Count 2: On pollution from lead, Administrator Johnson has proposed a \nstandard that fails to sufficiently strengthen the regulation aimed at \nlimiting exposure to lead pollution.\n  Lead has poisoned tens of thousands of children in Rhode Island and \nmany more all over the country. Both an independent scientific review \npanel and EPA's own scientific staff recommended a lead standard of no \ngreater than 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter. Yet Administrator Johnson \nproposed a range of 0.1 up to .05 micrograms--2\\1/2\\ times.\n  Mr. Johnson further diluted even that lax standard by using what \npublic health advocates have labeled ``statistical trickery''--\nstatistical trickery--allowing polluters a longer period of time over \nwhich to average the amount of lead they discharge into the air.\n  Again, by not adequately protecting children from lead, Administrator \nJohnson was derelict in his duty to his Agency.\n  Count 3: On pollution from soot, technically called ``particulate \nmatter,'' Administrator Johnson bowed to pressure from industry and \nfailed to strengthen a decade-old standard limiting particulate matter \npollution from smokestacks.\n  Again, the Agency's own scientific advisory committees had called for \na tougher standard to protect public health. Again, Administrator \nJohnson yielded to polluters. Again, Administrator Johnson failed in \nhis duty to the Agency he leads.\n  Count 4: On vehicle tailpipe emissions, Administrator Johnson denied \na waiver that would have allowed the State of California, my State of \nRhode Island, and many other States to enact strict restrictions on \nglobal warming pollution from automobiles.\n  EPA staff indicated in briefing materials that ``we don't believe \nthere are any good arguments against granting the waiver.'' EPA lawyers \ncautioned the Administrator that all of the arguments against granting \nthe waiver were ``likely to lose in court.'' Yet Administrator Johnson \nissued an unprecedented denial of that waiver.\n  I will separately discuss my grave concerns about the Administrator's \ntestimony on this matter. I believe he has lied to us. But for this \npurpose now, looking only at the substantive outcome, in ignoring the \nlaw, the dictates of science, the recommendations of his regulatory and \nlegal staff, the role of Congress, the wishes of the States, and the \nwelfare of the American people, Administrator Johnson failed again in \nhis duty to the Agency he leads.\n  Count 5: On global warming pollution, in defiance of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, Administrator Johnson has \nfailed to take action after the Court's ruling that EPA has the \nauthority, under the Clean Air Act, to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions that pollute our air and warm our planet.\n  It is now nearly 18 months since the Court's decision, and the EPA \nhas shown no indication it will act before President Bush leaves \noffice. In ignoring a ruling of this Nation's highest Court empowering \nhim to act on a matter important to the public health of Americans, \nAdministrator Johnson again failed in his duty to the Agency he leads.\n  But it was not enough for Administrator Johnson to rule for the \npolluters on pollutant after pollutant.\n  Administrator Johnson has also systematically dismantled \ninstitutional safeguards and processes that protect his Agency's \nintegrity and guide its mission.\n  Jonathan Cannon served at EPA during the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, \nand Clinton administrations. He warns of ``extreme friction within the \nagency and institutional damage . . . demoralizing the legal staff, and \n. . . further separating staff from the political leadership at the \nagency.'' We saw similar sabotage of institutional safeguards in the \nGonzales Department of Justice, and this institutional damage raises \nfour further charges, taking us to count six.\n  On the question of the Agency's legal integrity, under Administrator \nJohnson, the EPA offered legal arguments for its insufficient pollutant \nstandards so shallow they provoked ridicule by the courts that heard \nthem. When EPA tried to defend its weak mercury cap-and-trade system, \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals--which, as we know, is hardly a liberal \nbench--accused the Agency\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nof employing the ``logic of the Queen of Hearts'' in attempting to \nevade the intent of Congress and the clear meaning of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  The same court said EPA's argument under the Clean Air Act allowing \npower companies to avoid upgrading their pollution control technologies \nmade sense only in ``a Humpty Dumpty world.'' In adopting \n``Wonderland'' legal analysis that contravenes the clear will of \nCongress and embarrasses his Agency before the courts, Administrator \nJohnson failed again in his duty to uphold the mission of the Agency he \nleads.\n  Count 7: On the integrity of EPA's scientific advisory boards, \nAdministrator Johnson did not just ignore these boards' \nrecommendations, he willingly allowed those panels to be infiltrated by \nthe very industries they are meant to regulate and control.\n  For example, an employee of ExxonMobil served on the panel to assess \nthe carcinogenicity of ethyl oxide--a chemical manufactured by \nExxonMobil.\n  Another scientist received research support from Dow Agro and served \non that panel, even though ethyl oxide is also manufactured by Dow \nAgro.\n  A scientist whose research was funded by American Cyanamid and CYTEC \nsits on the EPA panel on acrylamide, which is manufactured by American \nCyanamid and marketed by CYTEC. EPA did not see any conflict of \ninterest.\n  But at the beck and call of the American Chemistry Council, an \nindustry lobby group, Administrator Johnson removed Dr. Deborah Rice, a \nprominent toxicologist, from a scientific review board investigating \nchemicals used in common plastic goods.\n  The industry argued that she had a conflict of interest. Incredibly, \nthe conflict of interest was that, at a public hearing in the State of \nMaine, as a representative of the State's Government, Dr. Rice had \nstated her professional opinion regarding the dangers associated with \nthese chemicals. The industry did not like her professional opinion. \nNot only was Dr. Rice removed from the panel, but in a particularly \nOrwellian maneuver, the fact that she had ever been on the panel was \nstricken from the advisory committee's records.\n\n  In packing EPA's scientific panels to please industry polluters, \nAdministrator Johnson is guilty of a particularly chilling dereliction \nof his duty to the Agency he leads.\n  Count 8: A report issued on April 23 by the Union of Concerned \nScientists, entitled ``Interference at the EPA,'' uncovered widespread \npolitical influence in EPA decisions. The report found that 60 percent \nof EPA career scientists surveyed had personally experienced at least \none incident of political interference during the past 5 years--60 \npercent of the career scientists. It is a plague over there.\n  The report documented, among other things, that many EPA scientists \nhave been directed to inappropriately exclude or alter information from \nEPA science documents, or have had their work edited in a manner that \nresulted in changes to their scientific findings.\n  The survey also revealed that EPA scientists have often objected to \nor resigned or removed themselves from EPA projects because of that \npressure to change scientific findings.\n  Allowing this corrosive political influence to persist among the \ncareer scientists at EPA is yet another dereliction of Administrator \nJohnson's duty to the Agency he leads.\n  Count 9: Administrator Johnson has twisted the very administrative \nprocedures of the Environmental Protection Agency to allow the White \nHouse Office of Management and Budget secret influence over Agency \ndecisionmaking.\n  For example, the IRIS process for determining the toxicity of \nchemicals that all of us are exposed to allows OMB three separate \nchances to exert its dark influence: at the beginning, in the middle, \nand again at the end of the Agency's process. In the words of the GAO, \nthis process is ``inconsistent with the principle of sound science that \nrelies on, among other things, transparency.''\n  This is not just a potential concern. The current chair of EPA's \nClean Air Scientific Advisory Panel has testified that the ozone \nstandard was ``[set] . . . by fiat behind closed doors,'' has testified \nthat the entire Agency's scientific process was ``for naught,'' and \ntestified that ``the OMB and the White House set the standard, even \nthough theoretically it was set by the EPA Administrator.'' She \ntestified that as a result, ``willful ignorance triumphed over sound \nscience.'' That is her testimony.\n  In manipulating his Agency's processes to let willful ignorance \ntriumph over sound science, Administrator Johnson has again been \nderelict in his duties to this once proud Agency.\n  The third and final category of charges relates to Johnson's \nrelationship to Congress. In defiance of his charge under the \nConstitution of the United States, Administrator Johnson has personally \nrepeatedly refused to cooperate with Congress in our efforts to conduct \nproper oversight over the executive branch.\n  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has repeatedly \nrequested documents in connection with EPA's denial of the California \nwaiver and its failure to adequately regulate ozone pollution in our \nefforts to determine whether the White House improperly influenced \nthese decisions.\n  Administrator Johnson has rebuffed these proper requests. He has \nrepeatedly declined to appear before the EPW Committee to explain his \nAgency's policies. And when he has appeared, he has resorted to canned, \nstock, evasive answers in response to legitimate questions about \npolitical influence infiltrating his Agency.\n  Just last week, he refused to appear before the Judiciary Committee \non which I also serve for a hearing to look further into his failure to \ncooperate with Congress and provide documents and other information we \nhave sought.\n  In what is perhaps the gravest matter of all, I believe the \nAdministrator deliberately and repeatedly lied to Congress, creating a \nfalse picture of the process that led to EPA's denial of the California \nwaiver, in order to obscure the role of the White House in influencing \nhis decision.\n  Today, Senator Boxer and I have sent a letter to Attorney General \nMukasey--along with Senator Klobuchar--asking him to investigate \nwhether Administrator Johnson gave false and misleading statements, \nwhether he committed perjury, and whether he obstructed Congress's \ninvestigation into the process that led to the denial of the California \nwaiver request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and its attached recitations \nbe printed in the Record as an exhibit to these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There is more. These are not isolated counts but \nsigns of an agency corrupted in every place the shadowy influence of \nthe Bush White House can reach.\n  Administrator Johnson forced the resignation of EPA's Regional \nAdministrator for the Midwest, Mary Gade, who was locked in a struggle \nwith corporate polluter Dow Chemical Company. The circumstances are \nhighly suspicious. Administrator Johnson has replaced Ms. Gade with a \nformer attorney for the automobile industry, whose record on behalf of \nthe environment has been described as ``horrible.''\n  The EPA, under Administrator Johnson, has reduced the reporting \nburdens on industries that release toxic chemicals into our land, sea, \nand air. It has weakened enforcement and monitoring by opening fewer \ncriminal investigations, filing fewer lawsuits, and levying fewer fines \nagainst corporate polluters.\n  It has failed to protect agency employees who pointed out problems or \nreported legal violations or attempted to correct factual \nmisrepresentations made by their superiors and created an atmosphere \nwhere employees fear reprisals.\n  In the face of widespread criticism that his agency is in crisis and \nthat he is a pawn of the White House and its allies in polluting \nindustries, Administrator Johnson's response was to label all those \nconcerned, many of whom are dedicated career employees of his agency, \nas ``yammering critics,'' clearly a man after Spiro Agnew's own heart.\n  The EPA has a vital mission. When this great agency is weakened and \nits work subverted by political interference, there is a great cost to \nthis country. When EPA scientists and career employees become \ndiscouraged as their voices go unheard, there is a great cost to this \ncountry. When the\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\npeople of America lose faith that the Environmental Protection Agency \nactually lives up to its name, there is a great cost to this country. \nWhen those who were chosen to serve this country instead serve \nthemselves, their political allies, and their patrons, there is a great \nand lasting cost to this country. It is a failure of integrity, and \nthat is a failure we can no longer afford.\n  We demand integrity--democracy demands integrity--of our public \nofficials, not just because integrity is an abstract moral good but \nbecause democracy fails without it.\n  Integrity sustains our democracy in such important ways. The first is \nintegrity to the truth. In Government, when the facts are clear enough \nfor responsible people to act, it is a failure of integrity to fail to \nconfront those facts. As the late Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, famously said: ``You are entitled to your own opinion; you \nare not entitled to your own facts.''\n  America has traditionally been characterized by candid and practical \nassessment of the facts, a can-do attitude about responding to those \nfacts, and bold decisionmaking to find our way through those facts. \nPractical, can-do, optimistic, realistic--that is the American way. \nWhen Government doesn't face the truth about the facts, it will almost \ncertainly fail to meet the demands of the moment and fail to serve the \ninterests of our people. That is what is happening at EPA. They simply \nwill not face facts plain to any responsible person.\n  However, facts are stubborn things. They do not yield to ideology or \ninfluence. They do not care about your politics. Unanswered they stand, \ngetting worse, and eventually the piper must be paid. If facts aren't \ncandidly, realistically, and responsibly faced, not only will the \nproblem get worse but the very capacity of the Government to address \nproblems candidly, realistically, and responsibly, that capacity will \nitself degrade when not put to use. So there are ugly, lasting \nconsequences when Government officials fail at their obligation to meet \nthe truth head on.\n  Another integrity is to honesty. As failures of truth have a harsh \ncost in Government, so do failures in honesty. I have sworn in new \nassistant U.S. attorneys. I have sworn in new State assistant attorneys \ngeneral. I have presided at nomination hearings. Every time I have seen \nthe same thing: a little spark of fire, a moral fire sparked when \nsomeone makes a choice to earn less money than they would otherwise, to \nwork a lot harder than they would otherwise, to dare greater challenges \nthan they might otherwise, all in order to serve the larger purpose, to \nserve an ideal, to serve America.\n  This spark of fire inspires young men and women to tackle problems \nthat may seem unmanageable. This spark of fire keeps people at their \ndesks late into the night when others have gone home to their families. \nThis spark of fire brings idealism and principle to decisions and \nilluminates a moral path through the complexities of Government.\n  The value in Government of that spark of fire burning in the hearts \nof a thousand men and women--our real thousand points of light--is \nimmeasurable. EPA is sustained by that spark of fire.\n  But this spark of fire is quenched in the toxic atmosphere of \ndishonesty whose guiding principles are help your friends, please your \npatron, dodge your responsibilities, and fudge the truth. Dishonesty \nand idealisms do not cohabit.\n  The third integrity is competence, a vital integrity. If we are to \naddress the present and looming problems a new administration will have \nto face--a war without end in Iraq, an economy on a sickening slide, a \nbroken health care system, a country divided into two increasingly \nseparate Americas, a public education system that is failing, the \ndangerous weight of an alarming national debt, foreign policies that \nhave unhinged us from responsible world opinion, bickering and \nirresolution on problems such as immigration and global warming--we \nmust see competence as a core integrity. We must demand competence of \nGovernment officials as a bare minimum, a core necessity.\n  Unfortunately, as one discouraged official has complained: ``In the \nBush administration, loyalty is the new competence.''\n  Administrator Stephen Johnson is a failure in all these dimensions. \nFrom everything we have seen, Administrator Johnson has done the \nbidding of the Bush administration and its political allies without \nhesitation or question and in violation of his clear duty. He has tried \nto cover up his dereliction of duty with evasive and discreditable \ntestimony. He has acted without regard for the law or the \ndeterminations of the courts. He has damaged the mission, the morale, \nand the integrity of his great institution--the Environmental \nProtection Agency--and he has betrayed his solemn duty to Americans who \ndepend on him to protect their health, particularly our very youngest \nand our very oldest whose vulnerability is greatest.\n  Administrator Johnson suggests a man who has every intention of \ndriving his agency onto the rocks, of undermining and despoiling it, of \nleaving America's environment and America's people without an honest \nadvocate in their Federal Government. This behavior not only degrades \nhis once great agency, it drives the dagger of dishonesty deep into the \nvery vitals of American democracy. The American people cannot accept \nsuch a person in a position of great responsibility.\n  I am truly sorry it has come to this, but that is why this afternoon \nI called on Administrator Johnson to resign his position. I encourage \nmy colleagues to look closely at these concerns. Look at the reasons. \nLook at what I have prepared. Whatever decision colleagues may come to, \nI hope all understand I come to this decision sincerely and after much \nreview and reflection and with no pleasure.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Environment and Public Works,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2008.\n     Hon. Michael Mukasey,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Mukasey: As members of the Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), we are \n     writing to ask that you open an investigation into whether \n     the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA), Stephen L. Johnson, has made false or misleading \n     statements before the EPW Committee.\n       We do not make this request lightly. However, we believe \n     that there is significant evidence to suggest that Mr. \n     Johnson has provided statements that are inconsistent with \n     sworn testimony and documents provided in connection with an \n     investigation conducted by this Committee. These false, \n     misleading, or intentionally incomplete statements relate to \n     the decision announced by EPA on December 19, 2007, to deny \n     the request by California for a waiver under Section 209 of \n     the Clean Air Act. After Mr. Johnson's testimony, a former \n     senior aide to Mr. Johnson at EPA, Jason Burnett, provided \n     sworn testimony before the EPW Committee on July 22, 2008, \n     that appears to contradict Mr. Johnson's testimony on key \n     factual matters.\n       For example, Mr. Johnson stated under oath before the EPW \n     Committee on January 24, 2008 that he based his denial of the \n     California waiver request on California's failure to meet the \n     ``compelling and extraordinary'' circumstances criterion \n     under Section 209, and that he reached this decision \n     independently. However, Mr. Burnett testified that Mr. \n     Johnson had in fact determined that California met this \n     criterion and the other Clean Air Act criteria necessary for \n     approval of the waiver, and that the Administration's \n     decision to deny the waiver was based on the President's \n     policy preferences, rather than the lack of compelling and \n     extraordinary circumstances.\n       In addition, Mr. Johnson testified before the EPW Committee \n     that the decision to deny that waiver was solely his \n     decision. However, Mr. Burnett testified that Mr. Johnson had \n     a plan to grant the waiver and had concluded that the \n     statutory criteria for granting it were met, until it was \n     ``clearly articulated'' by the White House that the \n     President's ``policy preference'' was to deny the waiver.\n       We also are concerned about Mr. Johnson's testimony that \n     the energy legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the \n     President on December 19, 2007, was not substantively related \n     to his decision announced on the same day to deny the \n     California waiver, which he asserted was based upon his \n     finding that the waiver did not meet the Clean Air Act \n     statutory criteria. Mr. Burnett testified, however, that Mr. \n     Johnson had required extensive analysis of the impact of this \n     energy bill in evaluating whether to grant the waiver, and \n     that it was the President's policy preference that led to the \n     denial of California's waiver request, because granting the \n     waiver or a partial grant of the waiver would have led to two \n     standards, not one, as the President desired. The energy bill \n     established a single standard for vehicle fuel efficiency, as \n     the President desired.\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\n       It appears that Mr. Johnson's account of the California \n     waiver decision is factually inaccurate or misleading. We \n     take the inconsistency between Mr. Johnson's testimony and \n     other evidence very seriously. False testimony by any witness \n     is serious and undermines our ability to fulfill our \n     constitutional duties on behalf of the American people. Our \n     concern is heightened because this decision by the EPA \n     Administrator affects the health and wellbeing of the \n     American people. For these reasons, we have no choice but to \n     refer the matter to you for appropriate investigation and \n     prosecutorial action.\n       We look forward to your prompt response on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       Chairman.\n     Sheldon Whitehouse,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Amy Klobuchar,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\nEPA Administrator Johnson's Testimony Before Congress on the California \n                            Waiver Decision\n\n       Specifically, the concerns we have regarding Administrator \n     Johnson's testimony arise out of conflicts between his \n     testimony before the EPW Committee, and that of Jason \n     Burnett, a former EPA official who worked closely with \n     Administrator Johnson on the California waiver issue.\n       It appears from Mr. Burnett's testimony that Administrator \n     Johnson's testimony was at best misleading and at worst \n     untruthful in many specific ways.\n       Administrator Johnson repeatedly claimed that the decision \n     to deny the California waiver was ``mine and mine alone.'' He \n     said this repeatedly, over and over:\n       I was not directed by anyone, I was not directed by anyone \n     to make the decision. This was solely my decision based upon \n     the law, based upon the facts that were presented to me. It \n     was my decision. (1/24/08 EPW Committee Oversight hearing \n     (``1/24/08 hearing''), unofficial transcript at p. 29).\n       I made the decision. It was my decision and my decision \n     alone. (2/27/08 EPW Committee hearing on EPA FY2009 Budget \n     (``2/27/08 hearing''), unofficial transcript at p. 58)\n       The decision was mine and mine alone. I made the decision. \n     (2/27/08 hearing, unofficial transcript at p. 59).\n       Certainly the California waiver was my decision under the \n     Clean Air Act and mine alone. I made the decision, I made it \n     independently, I carefully considered all the comments and I \n     made that decision. (Id. at p. 30)\n       Mr. Burnett's testimony, however, indicates that these \n     statements were not true in any meaningful sense. First, in \n     point of fact, the decision Administrator Johnson made was to \n     grant a partial waiver:\n       There was an effort that we were engaged in and that I was \n     engaged in to make the case that it would be appropriate to \n     issue at least a partial grant of the waiver. (Testimony of \n     Jason Burnett at EPW Committee hearing, 7/22/08, unofficial \n     transcript at p.31)\n       The Administrator had a plan to partially grant the waiver \n     provided that the Clean Air Act was not enacted [sic] by \n     Congress. (Id. at p. 42).\n       Second, Mr. Burnett's testimony makes clear that this \n     decision to grant the partial waiver was vetted thoroughly \n     within EPA and reflected the Agency's consensus view that at \n     least a partial waiver was appropriate:\n       We did our best to ensure that all policy officials \n     involved in this decision were apprised and informed of the \n     law and EPA's assessment that all three criteria were, that \n     the, clearly the most supportable case under the law is that \n     all three criteria had been met. (Id. at p.43)\n       My advice, my recommendation, as well as the advice and \n     recommendation of all other advisors within EPA that I am \n     aware of was for Administrator Johnson to grant the waiver or \n     at least grant the first few years of the waiver. (Id. at p. \n     21)\n       Third, Mr. Burnett testified that Administrator Johnson's \n     decision to partially grant the waiver was then taken to the \n     White House:\n       But we went forward with our plan, told the White House \n     about our plan to have a partial grant of the waiver. . . . \n     (Id. at p. 32)\n       Fourth, Mr. Burnett was clear that when the White House was \n     informed of the plan, the Administrator was told of the \n     President's ``policy preference'' and reversed his decision \n     to support the partial waiver.\n       But we went forward with our plan, told the White House \n     about our plan to have a partial grant of the waiver, and in \n     response, we were reminded of the President's policy \n     preference. (Id. at p. 32)\n       Mr. Burnett: I believe that we continued throughout the \n     early December to explain the case for a partial grant. I \n     believe that it was early December when the Administrator \n     made his plan known. Of course, that plan ultimately was not \n     followed.\n       Senator Whitehouse: And in between that, the White House \n     response came back that the President desired there to be the \n     single standard?\n       Burnett: yes. (Id. at p. 38)\n       The repeated, false emphasis by the Administrator that the \n     decision to deny the waiver was ``mine and mine alone,'' when \n     in fact the Administration effectively reversed Administrator \n     Johnson's decision to grant the waiver, was part of a larger \n     plan to mislead the EPW Committee about the decision-making \n     process regarding the waiver.\n       A second part of this plan was Administrator Johnson's \n     suggestion that there was staff debate on the California \n     waiver, during which a wide range of options were presented \n     by staff, and after which, based on this debate, the \n     Administrator made the decision to deny the waiver:\n       Again, a great team of people, the lawyers and scientists \n     and policy staff. They presented me with a wide range of \n     options [on the waiver]. Those options ranged from approval \n     to denial. I listened to them carefully, I weighed the \n     information and I made an independent judgment. I concluded \n     that California does not meet the standard under Section 209. \n     (1/24/08 hearing unofficial transcript, at p. 45).\n       Again, as I have stated and will state again, the decision \n     was mine, solely mine. I heard a wide range of comments from \n     inside the agency, outside the agency, I was presented with a \n     range of options. I made the decision. It was my decision and \n     my decision alone (2/27/08 hearing unofficial transcript at \n     p. 58).\n       During the briefing process, I encouraged my staff to take \n     part in an open discussion of issues, and due to their value \n     [sic?] options and opinions, I was able to make a \n     determination. As you know, the Clean Air Act requires the \n     EPA Administrator to determine whether or not the criteria \n     for a waiver have been met. It was only after a thorough \n     review of the arguments and material that I announced my \n     direction to staff to prepare a decision document for my \n     signature. (1/24/08 hearing unofficial transcript at p. 16)\n       Senator Whitehouse: The last time we spoke about this, you \n     said that sometimes the EPA staff gave you a single \n     consolidated recommendation, Mr. Administrator, this is what \n     we think you should do, and sometimes they give you an array \n     of options, Mr. Administrator, we think these are your \n     options. You have testified that in this case, they gave you \n     an array of options, not a single, consolidated opinion, \n     correct?\n       Administrator Johnson: That is what I remember, yes. (2/27/\n     08 hearing unofficial transcript at p. 61)\n       In fact, however, Mr. Burnett was clear that there was \n     staff agreement on the issue, as manifested in the plan \n     agreed to by the Administrator, and presented to the White \n     House, to grant a partial waiver:\n       My advice, my recommendation, as well as the advice and \n     recommendation of all other advisors within EPA that I am \n     aware of was for Administrator Johnson to grant the waiver or \n     at least grant the first few years of the waiver. (7/22/08 \n     hearing, unofficial transcript at p. 21).\n       Mr. Burnett made clear, however, that the Administrator \n     went to the White House armed with a plan to partially grant \n     the waiver but, after being informed of the Bush ``policy \n     preference'' that the waiver not be granted, reversed course \n     and denied the waiver:\n       We went forward with our plan, told the White House about \n     our plan to have a partial grant of the waiver, and in \n     response, we were reminded of the President's policy \n     preference. (7/22/08 hearing unofficial transcript at p. 32)\n       Senator Whitehouse: In the Clean Air Act waiver, after the \n     White House was notified of the proposed decision that you \n     put together, did the White House respond to that notice that \n     you intended to partially grant the waiver?\n       Burnett: The response was clearly articulating that the \n     President had a policy preference for a single standard that \n     would be inconsistent with granting the waiver. (Id.)\n       Burnett: I believe that we continued throughout the early \n     December to explain the case for a partial grant. I believe \n     that it was early December when the Administrator made his \n     plan known. Of course, that plan was ultimately not followed.\n       SW: And in between that, the White House response came back \n     that the President desired there to be the single standard?\n       Burnett: Yes. (Id. at p. 38)\n       Administrator Johnson deliberately and repeatedly left \n     these steps out of his discussion of the process that led to \n     denial of the waiver.\n       Moreover, when questions regarding White House contact were \n     raised, he said things that were not true, if words are given \n     their meanings in common usage.\n       For example, Administrator Johnson testified repeatedly \n     that his contacts with the White House regarding the waiver \n     were limited to ``routine discussions'' that were nothing \n     more than status updates for the White House on the waiver \n     issue and were part of meetings involving multiple issues:\n       Senator Boxer: Did you contact [the White House about the \n     California waiver]?\n       Administrator Johnson: As part of good government, I tell \n     them what is the status of major actions that are before the \n     Agency to give them an update. That is what I do on \n     petitions, on regulations, and----\n       Senator Boxer: Did you discuss this waiver with members of \n     the Administration in the White House, the Vice President's \n     Office, or the OMB? Did you discuss this?\n       Administrator Johnson: I have routine discussions. (EPW 7/\n     26/07 Hearing on Status of California Waiver unofficial \n     transcript at pp. 15-16 )\n       Senator Whitehouse: Was there or was there not contact from \n     the White House regarding the waiver decision?\n       Administrator Johnson: As I said, I have routine contacts \n     with members of the Administration, including the White \n     House.\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\n       Senator Whitehouse: And did that routine contact include \n     contact regarding the waiver decision?\n       Administrator Johnson: Again, I have routine conversation \n     on a wide range of topics that I believe is good government \n     and indeed, it included what our status was on the issue of \n     the California waiver. (2/27/08 EPW hearing unofficial \n     transcript at p. 58)\n       In fact, Mr. Burnett's testimony makes clear that there \n     were specific White House meetings dedicated to the waiver:\n       Senator Whitehouse: Were the meetings . . . related to the \n     California waiver . . . specific to that? Or were they part \n     of a routine schedule that the Administrator had, going to \n     the White House on a regular basis and this would be on the \n     agenda, this particular time? Or were these meetings that \n     were scheduled specifically to address this and not part of a \n     routine, ongoing scheduled meeting process?\n       Mr. Burnett: Both. There were some meetings that were \n     specifically scheduled to talk about the California waiver, \n     and other meetings to talk about a range of issues relating \n     particularly to climate policy, including the response to the \n     Supreme Court and the California waiver.\n       Senator Whitehouse: And were there meetings specific to the \n     California waiver, that you would not characterize as routine \n     that were specifically scheduled for that purpose?\n       Mr. Burnett: Well, there were meetings specifically \n     scheduled for that purpose, as I said.\n       Senator Whitehouse: Not just dropped in as an agenda point \n     on a regularly-scheduled meeting?\n       Mr. Burnett: Yes, meetings that were specific to talk about \n     the California waiver. But I'm not sure if that means they \n     were routine or not. It certainly was the case that this \n     issue of the California waiver received a great deal of \n     attention from a number of people throughout the \n     Administration. (7/22/08 hearing unofficial transcript at p. \n     31.)\n       Mr. Burnett also testified that the waiver decision was a \n     very important matter to EPA and the Administration:\n       It certainly was the case that this issue of the California \n     waiver received a great deal of attention from a number of \n     people throughout the Administration. (Id.)\n       This issue is one of the most important issues that was \n     facing EPA. It received very high level attention, many \n     meetings with the Administrator and many meetings with senior \n     officials at the White House (Id. at p. 43)\n       Thus, the meetings clearly were more than ``routine,'' both \n     in terms of their timing (Webster's II New Riverside \n     University Dictionary, at p. 1022--``A set of customary and \n     often mechanically performed procedures;'' ``prescribed and \n     detailed course of action to be followed regularly'' and \n     substance (``not special,'' ``ordinary'').\n       Moreover, Administrator Johnson's testimony that the \n     meetings were merely to provide the White House with status \n     updates was also directly contradicted by Mr. Burnett, who \n     testified that at least some meetings were held at the White \n     House to present the Administration with EPA's plan to grant \n     a partial waiver.\n       We went forward with our plan, told the White House about \n     our plan to have partial grant of the waiver, and in \n     response, we were reminded of the President's policy \n     preference. (Id. at p. 32)\n       Senator Whitehouse: Would it be accurate to say that in \n     those meetings Administrator Johnson's contribution was \n     limited to an update on the status of the waiver action?\n       Mr. Burnett: There was an effort that we were engaged in \n     and that I was engaged in to make the case that it would be \n     appropriate to issue at least a partial grant of the waiver. \n     (Id. at p. 31)\n       Administrator Johnson was also misleading and not credible \n     regarding the staff process on the waiver decision. He \n     testified that he had been presented a range of options from \n     denial to outright grant, but that he could not remember any \n     of the options beyond the extremes of a full grant or \n     outright denial of the waiver:\n       Senator Whitehouse: What would you list? You said a wide \n     range of options? Can you specify what those options were?\n       Administrator Johnson: As I have said, a range from \n     approving the waiver to denying the waiver.\n       Senator Whitehouse: That is not a range, that is two.\n       Administrator Johnson: Well, there were options in between \n     and--\n       Senator Whitehouse: Such as?\n       Administrator Johnson: I was trying to recall. I don't \n     recall the specific options in between but that certainly is \n     a matter of record.\n       Senator Whitehouse: Do you recall any of the specific \n     options in between?\n       Administrator Johnson: As I said, the options ranged from \n     approval to denial and included other options in between. I \n     don't recall how they were entitled or the specifics.\n       Senator Whitehouse: Without their title, their fundamental \n     nature, do you recall?\n       Administrator Johnson: Again, there was a range of options \n     and I don't recall the specifics of the intermediate ones. \n     (2/27/08 hearing unofficial transcript at p. 63)\n       In fact, however, Mr. Burnett's testimony makes clear that \n     there was a unanimous staff recommendation for a partial \n     waiver so fully developed that he agreed to it and took it to \n     the White House after extensive briefing:\n       My advice, my recommendation, as well as the advice and \n     recommendation of all other advisors within EPA that I am \n     aware of was for Administrator Johnson to grant the waiver or \n     at least grant the first few years of the waiver. (7/22/08 \n     hearing unofficial transcript at p. 21)\n       The Administrator had a plan to partially grant the waiver, \n     provided that the Clean Air Act was not enacted [sic] by \n     Congress. (Id. at p. 42)\n       There was an effort that we were engaged in and that I was \n     engaged in to make the case that it would be appropriate to \n     issue at least a partial grant of the waiver. (Id. at p. 31)\n       I believe that we continued throughout early December to \n     explain the case for a partial grant. I believe that it was \n     early December when the Administrator made his plan known. Of \n     course, that plan ultimately was not followed. (Id. at p. 38)\n       We went forward with our plan, told the White House about \n     our plan to have a partial grant of the waiver, and in \n     response, we were reminded of the President's policy \n     preference. (Id. at p. 32)\n       It is simply unimaginable that Administrator Johnson could \n     forget that a partial waiver plan had been recommended to and \n     developed for him, that it had been adopted as the Agency \n     plan on this critical matter, and that he had presented it to \n     the White House.\n       Administrator Johnson said there was no White House \n     reaction to his update, or that he could not recall any White \n     House response or reaction:\n       Senator Boxer: Did you discuss the California waiver with \n     someone from the President's office, the Vice President's \n     office, OMB?\n       Administrator Johnson: I routinely have conversations with \n     members of the White House.\n       Senator Boxer: The answer is yes, then. What did they say? \n     What was their reaction? How did they feel about the waiver?\n       Administrator Johnson: I don't recall their reaction \n     because I was giving them an update of the status of this \n     action and a lot of other actions before the Agency. (7/26/07 \n     hearing unofficial transcript at 16).\n       Senator Boxer: Is this a fair analysis of what you have \n     told us? That no one ever contacted you to give an opinion on \n     the waiver, or to tell you to slow it up or anything; no one \n     from the President's, Vice-President's, OMB; no one from the \n     DOT. But you did contact them just to fill them in on what \n     was happening, and the waiver was one of the issues, but you \n     don't recall anything that they said. You just briefed them, \n     but they never made any opinion. Yes or no?\n       Administrator Johnson: If you would add ``to the best of my \n     recollection,'' then I would say, ``yes.'' (Id. at p. 17)\n       Given Mr. Burnett's testimony, it is simply unimaginable \n     that Administrator Johnson cannot recall getting a response \n     from the White House suggesting that he reverse his plan to \n     grant a partial waiver:\n       Senator Whitehouse: In the Clean Air Act waiver, after the \n     White House was notified of the proposed decision that you \n     put together, did the White House respond to that notice that \n     you intended to partially grant the waiver?\n       Mr. Burnett: The response was clearly articulating that the \n     President had a policy preference for a single standard that \n     would be inconsistent with granting the waiver. (7/22/08 \n     hearing unofficial transcript at p. 32)\n       Mr. Burnett: . . . the Administrator certainly knew the \n     President's policy preference for a single standard. (Id.).\n       Mr. Burnett: [W]e went forward with our plan, told the \n     White House about our plan to have a partial grant of the \n     waiver, and in response, we were reminded of the President's \n     policy preference. (Id.)\n       Mr. Burnett: I believe that we continued throughout the \n     early December to explain the case for a partial grant. I \n     believe that it was early December when the Administrator \n     made his plan known. Of course, that plan ultimately was not \n     followed.\n       Senator Whitehouse: And in between that, the White House \n     response came back that the President desired there to be the \n     single standard?\n       Mr. Burnett: Yes. (Id. at p. 38)\n       It is unimaginable that the head of a major government \n     agency could take a plan on a vital public issue to the White \n     House, fully vetted and briefed, to make the case for the \n     plan, come back to the agency with a completely different \n     plan as a result of the White House meeting, and then not \n     remember that this event had taken place. It can only be a \n     lie.\n       Administrator Johnson claimed that his decision to deny the \n     waiver was based on criterion two of the waiver test under \n     the Clean Air Act: that is, whether California demonstrated \n     compelling and extraordinary conditions in support of its \n     request:\n       I came to the conclusion that of the criteria that I am \n     required to evaluate, it was the second criteria, that the \n     State does not have compelling, extraordinary conditions. So \n     that is the basis of my decision. (1/24/08 hearing unofficial \n     transcript, p. 22)\n       I made my decision for the California waiver under Section \n     209 of the Clean Air Act. And I found that California does \n     not meet the compelling and extraordinary conditions. (Id. at \n     p. 55)\n       In fact, as noted above, Mr. Burnett's testimony makes \n     clear that Administrator Johnson was prepared to grant a \n     partial waiver, based on the compelling and extraordinary \n     factor and other factors having been met:\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\n       As part of the plan to grant a partial waiver, certainly it \n     was the case that all three criteria in the Clean Air Act \n     would be met, including the criteria that California has \n     compelling and extraordinary circumstances. (7/22/08 hearing \n     unofficial transcript at p. 19)\n       We did our best to ensure that all policy officials \n     involved in this decision were apprised and informed of the \n     law and EPA's assessment that all three criteria were, that \n     the, clearly, the most supportable case under the law is that \n     all three criteria had been met. (Id. at p. 43)\n       Indeed, it was only after President Bush's ``policy \n     preference'' was explained to Administrator Johnson at a \n     White House meeting that he decided to deny the waiver. The \n     rationale that California did not meet was evidently an \n     after-the-fact embellishment designed to cover up the initial \n     plan to grant the waiver, the White House meeting at which \n     President's Bush's ``policy preference'' was explained, and \n     Administrator Johnson's reversal of course, and to create a \n     post hoc legal explanation for the decision.\n       The following summary of Administrator Johnson's testimony \n     by Chairman Boxer was admitted by Johnson to be accurate ``to \n     the best of [his] recollection.''\n       Senator Boxer: So just to wrap this up, and then I will \n     turn to Senator Inhofe. So just to wrap this up, no one ever \n     contacted you. You contacted them, meaning the White House, \n     the Vice President's office, the OMB, the DOT. You contacted \n     them just to give them an update on this issue, but no one \n     ever contacted you and you don't recall anybody in the White \n     House giving you their opinion on the waiver.\n       Administrator Johnson: I don't recall anyone contacting me. \n     I do recall making contacts to others because as I said, I \n     have routine conversations with----\n       Senator Boxer: You keep repeating this. I am just trying to \n     see, and tell me if I am saying this in a fair way and a just \n     way.\n       Mr. Johnson: Okay.\n       Senator Boxer: All right. Nobody ever contacted you from \n     the White House, the Vice President's office, the OMB, or the \n     DOT? You contacted them just to update them and you don't \n     recall anything they said to you about the waiver?\n       Mr. Johnson: To the best of my recollection, again, I have \n     a lot of conversations with members of the White House, a lot \n     of conversations. I said I do recall me making contact \n     because----\n       Senator Boxer: I just said that. So did I say it in a fair \n     way? I will repeat it the last time and then I will stop, \n     because I would like a yes or no. Is this a fair analysis of \n     what you have told us? That no one ever contacted you to give \n     an opinion on the waiver, or to tell you to slow it up or \n     anything; no one from the President's, Vice President's, OMB; \n     no one from the DOT. But you did contact them just to fill \n     them in on what was happening, and the waiver was one of the \n     issues, but you don't recall anything that they said. You \n     just briefed them, but they never made any opinion. Yes or \n     no?\n       Mr. Johnson: If you would add ``to the best of my \n     recollection,'' then I would say ``yes.'' (7/26/07 hearing \n     unofficial transcript at p. 17).\n       Again, in light of the Burnett testimony, Administrator \n     Johnson's failure to recollect the Administration's reaction \n     to his proposal is simply incredible.\n       Finally, it is worth noting President Bush's ``policy \n     preference'' for a single standard does not bear in any way \n     on the existence vel non of compelling and extraordinary \n     conditions, and is known by Administrator Johnson not to be \n     one of the statutory criteria for decision:\n       Administrator Johnson: . . . I tried to make it clear in \n     the letter to Governor Schwarzenegger [announcing denial of \n     the waiver] that the bases of my decision were on the three \n     criteria under Section 209 [of the Clean Air Act] and \n     compelling and extraordinary was the issue that the criteria, \n     that was not met. I pointed out in the letter that that \n     certainly isn't a context of what is the policy of both what \n     is happening as a Nation, and that is the policy, again my \n     words, policy context. But that was not the decision \n     criteria. The decision criteria are very clear in Section 209 \n     on whether or not----\n       Senator Klobuchar: That is fine. When I come back, I will \n     talk about it. But you have said before that this could \n     create a confusing patchwork of State rules.\n       Administrator Johnson: And again, that is not one of the \n     criteria for the decision. (1/24/08 hearing unofficial \n     transcript at p. 36)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to spend a little time talking \nabout the energy topic which has consumed this body and rightfully so. \nIt has certainly consumed the people's checkbooks and pocketbooks. I \nwill then submit a course of action and suggestions, one of which is a \nbill that was recently introduced by a tripartisan coalition--Senator \nSalazar, Senator Lieberman, and myself--requiring that a third of the \nfleet of vehicles the United States produces sold here by 2012 be able \nto operate on flex fuel; that is, a car or a pickup--whatever it is \nthat is being sold--can operate on either ethanol, methanol or gasoline \nor any combination thereto, to remove our addiction to foreign oil. I \nalso wish to talk about the need to produce more energy here at home.\n  I have a couple charts. This one is one people instinctively know \nabout, but I think it is pretty dramatic when you look at it. Our \nconsumption is going up. It has been a bit more level lately. \nProduction. Look at what we have done with production since the mid-\n1980s. It has gone down while our imports have made up the difference. \nWe had this huge crossover in 1994. We are actually importing what we \nshould be producing. We have to change this chart.\n  Boone Pickens was in town last week--one of the famous oilmen in the \nUnited States--and he was saying we are on track to be importing $700 \nbillion worth of oil on an annualized basis. If you think about that \nand the transfer of wealth that is taking place--that $700 billion \ncomes from someplace, and it comes from people's pocketbooks. Then, \ninstead of going into the U.S. economy, it is going overseas and on to \nplaces that often don't agree with us, whether it is into Venezuela or \nother regions of the world. Plus, think about the sheer economic \nactivity. If you take $700 billion worth of economic activity out of \nhere and are not generating further economic activity someplace else \nand are putting it someplace else, it degrades our tax coffers. Yet \nthat $700 billion of economic activity here, if there were just a 20-\npercent tax rate associated with it, we are looking at $140 billion \nworth of taxes back into this country if we had that sort of economic \nrevenue taking place. Imports of petroleum and petroleum products in \nthe billions of dollars, and you can see the increase in the price of \noil, what this is doing. It is skyrocketing from, again, 2004 on \nforward. If that activity were taking place here, those dollars would \nbe back here. Instead of building enormous buildings or new islands or \nincredible facilities in Dubai, we could be building them here.\n  That is why we need to produce more in the United States, and we can \nproduce more in the United States instead of getting it from overseas.\n  It is my hope that later this week, we are going to start voting on \nsome of these resolutions, some of these bills to produce more in the \nUnited States. We cannot continue to consume 25 percent of the world's \noil while producing only 3 percent of it. The world is not going to let \nthat continue to take place.\n  If you set all that aside and say: Well, I don't care, as long as it \ncontinues to take place--if you set all that aside, what is taking \nplace now in the Middle East, of Iran developing nuclear capacity and \nthe threat of that to the region, to a number of countries in that \nregion, particularly Israel--and if there is a response to that, what \nhappens then to oil prices and the availability of oil to the United \nStates if that escalates further? It may get an escalation that happens \nout of our control. Then what happens to the oil supply and the price \nif we continue to be dependent on this much of a dollar amount for \nforeign sources of oil? What would the Venezuelans do? What would \nChavez do if the Iranians are attacked? Do you think they are going to \nsend oil to the United States? What would happen in Russia, where \nRussia has been moving to work more with the Iranians? I think we are \nlooking at a scenario, from a security perspective and from an economic \nperspective, that is wholly untenable for us in the United States and \none we have to deal with now.\n  The way to deal with it is to produce more in the United States and \nto allow drilling to take place here. We must explore new areas. The \nDepartment of Energy, Energy Information Agency reports that 75 billion \nbarrels of oil are off-limits today in the United States. The President \nhas recently lifted the Executive ban on the Outer Continental Shelf, \nand unless Congress lifts its congressional ban, we will not have \naccess to 16 billion barrels of crude oil. Lifting this congressional \nban on offshore drilling would surely send the right signals to the \nmarketplace and many believe it would help lower prices in the near \nterm. It would show the world we are willing to explore for new energy. \nWe should also explore in Alaska for oil shale in the Western United \nStates.\n  I wish to show quickly one other piece of information on biofuels, \nand that is a chart and a statement that\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nwas recently put forward by Merrill Lynch. Biofuels has been in a tough \ndebate recently as there are a number of people accusing it of \ndifferent things. One thing I wish to put on the table for sure is that \nbiofuels has expanded our energy sources and expanded it away from the \nMiddle East and it has expanded it away from foreign imports. That is \nsomething that has taken place. A recent study from Merrill Lynch found \nthat because of the world's use of biofuels, gasoline is $21 per barrel \nless expensive than without these biofuels--$21 a barrel it took off \noil prices. That is 50 cents less per gallon. We must continue to \nresearch and innovate in the world of cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel, \nsoy, possibly from algae.\n  What we have put forward in an amendment on this bill, if we are able \nto get to the Energy bill, is a requirement that half the new cars \nbuilt and that are imported to the United States by 2012 be flex-fuel \nvehicles that can use ethanol, methanol or gasoline or any combination \nof those three. The big three auto manufacturers have said they can \nmeet this goal to allow consumers to choose between gasoline, ethanol, \nmethanol or, in some cases, biodiesel.\n  So imagine you are pulling up to the pump and ethanol this day is \nselling for $1 a gallon less than gasoline is. Perhaps methanol is \nselling for $1.50 a gallon less than gasoline, and you are saying I am \ngoing to put in ethanol today. It is selling for cheaper. Those will \ncontinue to drive down the price of gasoline and will have a security \nbenefit in that. If something happens in the Middle East or a part of \nthe world that is out of our control and oil supplies dry up, we won't \nbe left high and dry; we will have other sources of fuel to be able to \nmove forward with. That is why so many security people are interested \nin this flex-fuel concept and a flex-fuel vehicle.\n\n  I filed this legislation as amendment No. 5249 to the speculation \nbill that is currently on the floor. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Salazar be added as a cosponsor to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, many economists believe energy \nefficiency and conservation are absolutely critical to our efforts to \nreduce our reliance on foreign oil. I agree.\n  We have passed major energy legislation in the past to promote \nresearch and development in the area of hybrid automobile research, \nincluding batteries. We will be holding a hearing tomorrow in the Joint \nEconomic Committee on this issue. Clearly, we need to conserve more. We \nhave two hybrid vehicles in my family, and it has worked well. We need \nto move that technology forward. But it doesn't change the fundamentals \nthat we have to produce more here as well.\n  I want to show a final chart of the oil shale area in the United \nStates. It is currently off limits from drilling. It has the potential \nof 500 billion--or more--barrels in production. This is in Wyoming, \nUtah, and Colorado. Clearly, this is another area we need to open for \ndevelopment.\n  My point is that we are not helpless and we can do more. We have to \ndo it now. Time is of the essence. It is draining people's pocketbooks, \nand it is putting us in an unnecessary security risk.\n  I am hopeful that the leader is going to allow us to put forward \namendments. I hope we can put forward our flex fuel amendment. I hope \nwe can put forward drilling amendments so that we can get production up \nin the United States. That is something we need to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business on S. 3335, the tax extender package, for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, folks across our country feel as if they \nare drowning as wave after wave of bad economic news hits them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation because \nat times like this, when so many people feel they are close to going \nunder, they look to their Government to toss them a life preserver, not \nburden them with a 2-ton cement block of bills to pay and then wish \nthem luck. Congress has shown a willingness to shore up Wall Street. \nThis legislation gives us an opportunity to shore up the folks who are \non Main Street.\n  People across our country want to see the Senate address the issues \nthat are most important to them, and at the top of that list is energy. \nObviously, our country is now at a crossroads. The country can continue \nto keep going on the road we are on, living on high-priced fuel and \nspewing carbon dioxide into the air from fossil fuels that choke the \nplanet, or we can take a different road. With this legislation, we can \nstart down that route.\n  This legislation put the country on a path toward real energy \nindependence. It would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and it \nwould extend tax credits for renewable energy technologies--solar, \ngeothermal, wind, hydroelectricity, geothermal heat pumps, and fuel \ncells. These new energy choices will help stem the devastating effects \nof global warming.\n  On the other hand, the failure to extend existing renewable energy \ncredits sends the wrong signals to renewable energy companies and \ninvestors. It will literally cut off the pipeline of promising \nrenewable energy projects at a time when many of these technologies are \njust getting off the ground.\n  How often is it possible to point to legislation and say that this \nbill will actually lead to a more promising future? In this case, \nbusinesses, workers, consumers, and homeowners all have an opportunity \nto be part of a brighter energy future. Truckers would get an exemption \nfrom the highway excise tax so they could install fuel-saving anti-\nidling equipment. Consumers would get a new tax credit when they buy \nthe plug-in hybrids. There would be a tax break for the bicycle \ncommuters. For the first time, wave, tidal energy, and small wind \nturbines would be eligible for renewable energy tax credits. The bill \nalso extends production tax credits for biodiesel. Consumers and \nbusinesses would be encouraged to live on less energy but in a fashion \nthat does not compromise our economy or our quality of life. There \nwould be tax credits for energy-efficient homes, commercial buildings, \nenergy-efficient appliances, and also recycling equipment.\n  It is my view that the tax provisions of this legislation make sense \nfor taxpayers and they make sense for the environment and our \nbusinesses, and in that sense, we have an opportunity to act for \nAmerica's future. I hope this legislation will pass.\n  I would like to touch quickly on several other parts of the \nlegislation that I think are particularly important, and especially the \ncounty payments legislation.\n  If you live in a big city in this country, you may not know a whole \nlot about this legislation, but the county payments program keeps rural \ncommunities throughout the country--particularly in my home State--\nalive. The legislation includes more than $3.7 billion in funds that \nare desperately needed for rural schools, counties, and communities. \nWithout the safety net funding included in the bill, rural communities \nacross the country will face a future without schools and without vital \nservices such as law enforcement and essential road repair. Pink slips \nhave already been sent out to teachers and county workers, and unless \nthe Congress acts quickly, these devastating losses to the very fabric \nof rural communities would become permanent.\n\n  There are counties in my home State that now literally face \ndissolution. Folks who live there don't know what to expect, but they \nare bracing for the worst. I am just not going to let that happen.\n  This energy tax package contains the last best hope to help these \ncounties, and the Senate should not turn its back on rural America now.\n  Specifically, the package contains a 4-year extension of the Secure \nRural Schools Program that I authored in 2000 and 5 years of full \nfunding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program.\n  This proposal closely mirrors the legislative proposal I put together \nlast year with Senators Baucus, Bingaman, and Majority Leader Reid--a \nproposal that overwhelmingly passed with bipartisan support by a vote \nof 74 to 23. Senator Craig and Senator Domenici also helped with \ncritical efforts to move the legislation forward and to give it strong, \nbipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\n  When folks in rural America are losing their jobs, their homes, and \nthe chance to educate their kids, the Federal Government should not \nbreak its promise to rural communities. When Federal forests were \ncreated in Oregon and around the country, rural communities were \npromised they would get a share of the revenue from those forests. This \nrevenue sharing was intended to make up for the loss of Federal forest \nland from the local tax base. As the benefits from forest management \nchanges with the times, Congress can't walk away from its \nresponsibility to provide funding to the counties for their \ncontribution in creating the Nation's forests. Since that original \neffort, it has been clear that local communities needed some measure of \nsupport.\n  By providing funds through 2011, this bill gets our rural counties \noff the fiscal roller coaster they have been on, particularly during \nthese difficult economic times. It gives them stable funding so they \ncan concentrate on the real work of planning for the future. \nNationally, this would mean $3.7 billion, and in my home State of \nOregon, it would mean hundreds of millions of dollars for schools, \npublic safety, roads, and other essential county services.\n  In the midst of an energy crisis, our schools face big challenges. An \nEnergy Department study reported that schools spend about $8 billion on \nenergy each year, second only to spending on books and computers. The \nsame study estimated that 61 percent of public school districts had \ninsufficient energy budgets. As a result, the schools--especially our \nrural schools--are forced to make difficult decisions about whether \nthey can fully afford to heat or cool their buildings or whether they \nare going to have to cut some essential service, such as the school bus \nservice in rural areas. Reauthorizing the county payments program would \nkeep the lights on in the classrooms and make sure our youngsters have \nthe basics they need in order to be able to learn.\n  The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000 \nhas worked. It has built collaboration between counties, forest product \nfirms, and environmentalists in communities in over 700 counties in 41 \nStates across the Nation. A key part of that collaboration has included \nfunding projects to restore the national forests, and those would \ninclude providing renewable woody biomass that is part of the renewable \nenergy solution this legislation would provide.\n  Finally, on this point, these funds are a critical lifeline to rural \nareas. I point out that rural schools and counties would not be the \nonly ones who suffer if this bill isn't passed. But I want to highlight \nthe county payments legislation tonight particularly.\n  I am going to be going home this weekend for townhall meetings in the \nrural part of my State. I will hear again and again this weekend how, \nwithout this program, without the essential program for rural \ncommunities that, in effect, built on something that started a century \nago, we will see some of those rural communities dissolve before our \neyes. I cannot allow that to happen on my watch.\n  Finally, a quick comment on one other section of the legislation. I \nsee that my friend from Arizona is here, and I want him to know that I \nwill wrap up very briefly.\n  Mr. President, with respect to the tax extenders provisions of this \nlegislation, I can only say that businesses are calling for this. \nTypical taxpayers are calling for it. Teachers are saying they need it. \nOnce again, we have to look at the consequences of not passing an \nimportant domestic initiative. This bill includes help for folks who \nare hurting right now. It includes help with relief to people in the \nMidwest who are still hurting from this year's floods. It helps \nbusinesses by renewing the business research and development tax \ncredit. This is very important because our fast-growing technology \ncompanies say it is critical for their plans to grow and hire new \nstaff. High-tech companies are some of the best employers in my home \nState and around the country, and they offer family-wage jobs that \nAmericans can depend on.\n  Both parties agree that the research and development credit should be \nextended and that it will be--some day. That is what they say, Mr. \nPresident--some day. That doesn't do much good for struggling \nmanufacturers now. They have to plan their investments in order to be \nable to grow. They say that R credits are critical to doing that. By \nholding it up, the Congress is pushing our companies to outsource the \nimportant work. Clearly, no Member of the Senate could want that to \nhappen, but without these credits, we are not having the proper \nincentive to keep jobs in the United States. I want to see high-skill, \nhigh-wage jobs here in our communities. We are the world leaders in \nresearch and development, and it is moments like this that will either \nkeep us in that position or will start us heading down the path of \nbecoming followers.\n  I want to finally express my appreciation to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus, for his fine work on this \nlegislation. I particularly appreciate the many times in which he has \nassisted me with the Secure Rural Schools Program. A host of other \ncolleagues: Leader Reid, Chairman Bingaman, Senator Smith, Senator \nDomenici, among others. I also express my appreciation to Senator \nTester, our new Senator from the State of Montana, who has been a \nchampion of rural schools and this program as well for all of his \nassistance.\n  I urge the support of the critical Baucus legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the question the Senate is facing this \nevening and again tomorrow morning is whether we are going to stay \nfocused on the issue that is of the most importance to the American \npublic, and that is doing something about this incredible energy crisis \nin our country causing us to not just pay higher prices at the pump but \nalso higher prices for almost everything else because of the high cost \nof transportation to transport goods across this country. Our airlines \nare hurting, shipping, trucking, all families, and we have seen \ninflation rise in this country, among other things, and probably \nprimarily because of the fact that we are not producing enough energy--\nenough American energy.\n  Republicans believe we need to stay focused on this issue until we \ndeal with it, and we can deal with it. We can deal with it before this \nbody leaves for the so-called August recess. I know this: It is not \nrecess when we go home and start visiting with our constituents and \nevery one of them is going to ask us: What did you do to drive down the \nprice of gasoline? What did you do to deal with this energy crisis?\n  Earlier today, I quoted from the New York Times in an editorial \nyesterday in which the editors of the Times noted that the problem in \nthe United States is not one of speculation, which is the subject of \nthe bill the Democratic majority has brought forward, but it is a \nproblem of supply and demand. What they say is all speculators or \ninvestors do is take a look into the future and ask a question: Five \nyears from now or 5 months from now, where is demand going to be \ncompared to supply in the world? Right now, everybody can see that the \ndemand is going to far exceed the available supply of energy. As a \nresult, of course, that puts pressure on prices which continue to go \nup.\n  The fact that the President announced he would remove the moratorium \non certain offshore production has had a salutary effect in helping to \nreduce prices a little bit because those futures markets decided that \nmaybe we were serious about doing something about energy production in \nthe future.\n  That is the test. That is the commitment. That is what the Senate has \nbeen focused on this last week and is going to be focusing on again \ntomorrow.\n  My colleagues are talking about legislation that the Senate needs to \npass and, indeed, the last bit of legislation the Senator from Oregon \nwas talking about is a subject which we will deal with. Everybody \nagrees we need to deal with it. My guess is the bill will pass, if not \nunanimously, close to unanimously, if and when we can get a bipartisan \nso-called tax extenders bill to the floor of the Senate. But \nRepublicans are not going to leave what we are doing now to take that \nup and who knows what else.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the issues I wanted to speak about \nbriefly is another bill they want to go to. It is called the media \nshield legislation.\n  Tomorrow morning, we are going to have two votes. The first one will \nsee\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\nwhether we will forget the energy crisis, leave the Energy bill, and \ntake up the media shield legislation. I daresay we will do the same \nthing with that that we have done with the other bills we have \nconsidered in the last couple of days, and that is, we will say no, we \nare going to finish energy first. Then we will have this next tax \nextenders bill. That will be the fourth time that bill will be before \nus. Once again, we will say: Let's finish energy first and then we will \ntake it up.\n  I hope as we speak that Senators Baucus and Grassley, the chairman \nand ranking member, respectively, of the Finance Committee on which I \nsit are talking to each other about the way to put this bipartisan tax \nextenders bill together so we can bring it to the floor and complete \naction on it before the August recess. That is possible to do. The two \nof them work very well together. I think they are very close to \nreaching an agreement on what this program would look like, and if they \ncan reach such an agreement, it will be possible for us, once we have \nconcluded work on energy, to then bring up that bill and get it passed \nbefore we go home. But we are not going to decide we have talked about \nenergy long enough, even though we haven't done anything about it, and \nit is time to move on to other priorities. Our priority is energy. Our \npriority is getting gas prices down.\n  It is not just a matter of filling up at the gas pump. Last week, I \nfilled up and it was $70 and the tank still had a third in it when I \nfilled the tank. That is hard to take. That is not the bottom line. The \nbottom line is what it does to our economy and national security. It \nused to be we produced most of the energy we use. Now we import most of \nthe energy we use and, unfortunately, we are getting it from places \nthat can create real problems for us.\n  If you talk about Iran, for example, all Iran has to do to make more \nmoney on the oil it produces is drive some of its speedboats around the \nStrait of Hormuz and threaten the shipping there. About 40 percent of \nthe oil goes through the Strait of Hormuz, and that unsettles the \nmarket to the extent it drives up the prices. They have it within their \npower to make more money just by creating problems for us.\n\n  Why don't we rely more on the energy resources we have right here in \nthe United States of America? We are the third largest producer of oil \nand gas in the world. We could be producing a lot more American energy \nfor American needs and not have to rely on these other countries which, \nas I say, can create huge headaches for the entire world and drive up \nthe price of energy.\n  We can produce more. What Republicans are saying is, let's open some \nof the areas that have been closed by law to more production, starting \nwith offshore in the deep waters of the gulf, off our coasts. We also \nhave energy that is tied up in Alaska, in the oil shale in the Rocky \nMountain West, and in other places.\n  We have suggested a balanced approach. We need to use less. We need \nto reduce our consumption. We need to rely on so-called renewable \nfuels. We obviously need to do more with nuclear energy. But almost \neverybody agrees that the starting place is more drilling to produce \nmore American oil for the American economy. That is what we want to get \nsome votes on before we turn to other legislation.\n  Let me briefly comment about the first vote we are going to have \ntomorrow because this is new. We have already dealt with the so-called \ntax extender program three times now. Tomorrow morning will be the \nfourth time. We are not going to have any different result than we have \nhad in the past. So I suggest we get on with the bipartisan \nnegotiations to complete our work on that legislation so we can get it \npassed.\n\n\n                              Media Shield\n\n  Something we haven't taken up yet is this so-called media shield \nbill. I am not going to go through all the arguments about it, but \nsimply to point out the history of it and describe what it does and why \nit is so problematic.\n  This basically says that reporters don't have to disclose their \nsources if they don't want to. You can imagine a lot of bad things will \nhappen as a result of that. People break the law for disclosing very \nhighly classified information. The reporter says: I am not going to \ntell you, Mr. FBI Agent, who did that. Yes, I know who did it--it is \nagainst the law--but I am not going to tell you. And this bill would \nprovide the protection for that.\n  The first problem is it doesn't even define media in a way with which \neveryone can agree. We don't know whether a blogger, who is trying to \nput material out on the blogs, is in the media, whether a reporter for \nsome kind of terrorist newsletter is a member of the media or what. \nThey have tried and tried to get a good definition. It is very \ndifficult to do.\n  When the bill was in the Judiciary Committee, on which I sit, it was \nnot a perfect bill. Back then people said: Yes, we need to pass this; \nwe need to not change a comma in it. I think there were 10 or 12 \namendments adopted that day. Clearly, it needed work. Most of those \namendments had strong bipartisan, if not unanimous, support, and we \nagreed at the end of the process that it needed more work. Since then, \nthere have been a lot of meetings held to try to refine the bill.\n  I take my hat off to Senator Arlen Specter who has tried very hard to \nfind a way to resolve some of the problems that have been raised. At \nthe end of the day, the Attorney General of the United States, Attorney \nGeneral Mukasey, the intelligence community, and the White House have \nall raised very serious doubts and problems about the bill.\n  Let me refer to some of the things that have been said about it. The \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, wrote at the end of March this \nyear that ``the Department of Defense is concerned that this bill will \nundermine our ability to protect national security information and \nintelligence sources and methods, and could seriously impede \ninvestigations of unauthorized disclosures.''\n  The problem I just identified. Because of that, of course, President \nBush is expected to veto the bill.\n  Very recently--I think yesterday--the Director of National \nIntelligence, Mike McConnell, published in USA Today an op-ed in which \nhe described some of the problems he has with the bill, one of many \ncommentaries. Here is what he said:\n\n       I have joined the attorney general, the Secretaries of \n     Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, and Treasury, and every \n     senior intelligence community leader in expressing the \n     belief, based on decades of experience, that this bill will \n     gravely damage our ability to protect national security \n     information. Unauthorized disclosure of classified \n     information disrupts our efforts to track terrorists, \n     jeopardizes the lives of intelligence and military personnel \n     and inhibits international cooperation critical to detecting \n     and preventing threats.\n\n  It is not just our intelligence community and Government sources. \nLast week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of \nManufacturers circulated a letter expressing ``deep reservations with \nthe way the current version of the media shield bill, S. 2035, applies \nto the private sector. As drafted, it would have significantly adverse \nramifications on the ability of Americans to legitimately protect \npersonal and proprietary information and we must oppose the bill in its \ncurrent form.''\n\n  It is interesting, despite all of these issues that have been raised \nby a variety of private groups and all of the national defense and \nintelligence community of our Government, there has not been a single \nhearing during the 110th Congress on this legislation, let alone a \nhearing on the general need for the media shield legislation. It is \nobviously not ready for prime time.\n  Let me mention one problem--and I will speak more on this tomorrow--\nto illustrate some of the other problems the bill has, one illustration \nof what additional work needs to be done. This is one that could easily \nbe resolved, and I don't understand why the sponsors of the legislation \nwould not be willing to deal with it.\n  The bill fails to provide an exception to the privilege for \ninformation necessary to investigate a terrorist attack. Let me repeat \nthat. You could not investigate a terrorist attack under the exclusion \nthat is provided in the bill. The committee-reported bill would only \nprovide an exception in section 5 for ``protected information that a \nFederal court has found . . . would assist in preventing an act of \nterrorism,'' or ``other significant and articulable harm to national \nsecurity.''\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\n  I raised this question in a hearing. The exception makes no mention \nof information that would assist in investigating a terrorist attack or \nother significant event. It only talks about preventing. This is the \nkind of thing that could be fixed, and I don't understand why the \nauthors of the bill wouldn't be willing to fix it.\n  Under the form in which it would be brought forward, obviously the \nmajority leader would fill the parliamentary tree, there would be no \nopportunity for amendments, and we would be stuck on a take-it-or-\nleave-it basis with a piece of legislation that is highly flawed, \ntotally criticized by the intelligence community and many in the \nprivate sector, as well.\n  The point, of course, is that the Democratic leader is simply \nthrowing legislation out on the floor with the hope that somehow or \nanother we will be able to divert attention from the subject of energy, \nthe bill we are currently on. We should neither vote for cloture for \nthe media shield bill nor the tax extenders bill nor any other piece of \nlegislation, as I said, until we complete our work on energy. We could \ndo that in a matter of 2 or 3 days. We can clearly do it before we \nleave here in August. But under no circumstances should we leave the \nimportant Energy bill to go off onto a piece of legislation such as \nthis media shield bill.\n  I hope when we have the cloture vote tomorrow, my colleagues will \njoin me in voting no on cloture on this legislation so we can deal with \nthe No. 1 priority of the American people, and that is our energy \ncrisis in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an important issue \nrelated to my responsibilities as chair of the Coast Guard and \nFisheries Subcommittee in the Commerce Committee. I see some of my \ncolleagues on the floor. I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Dorgan be recognized for 10 minutes, Senator Murray \nfor 10 minutes, and Senator Salazar for 10 minutes. Knowing that my \ncolleague, Senator Specter, is expected to show, when he shows up we \nwill fit him in the sequence back and forth, depending on when he shows \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         New Orleans Oil Spill\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, last week over 400,000 gallons of fuel \nspilled into the Mississippi River near New Orleans after a chemical \ntanker collided with a fuel barge and literally split the barge in \nhalf.\n  This is a picture depicting the Coast Guard looking at the two halves \nof this barge that was split in half right in the heart of New Orleans, \ncausing serious damage in the area from diesel and diesel fumes, even \nimpacting the French Quarter.\n  Now, the second chart shows the impact of that spill on downtown and \nthe seriousness of that spill in the region. This major spill has \nclosed the Mississippi River from New Orleans to the river's mouth, \nchoking off one of the Nation's most important major commercial \narteries. Even now, a week later, only a few ships can get through on \nthis 100-mile stretch of the lower Mississippi.\n  As the picture shows from the night of the accident, the mighty \nMississippi was covered with this eerie sheen right in the downtown \narea of New Orleans. Now, a week later, some of the heavy fuel oil has \nturned into tar balls, bouncing and sticking and contaminating this \nwaterway. The spill has slowed down New Orleans' normally thriving \nwaterfront, and the economic impact is already being felt. To put this \ntragedy into perspective, the economic loss from a total shutdown of \nthe port would cost our Nation's economy around $270 million a day.\n  While the Coast Guard has begun to allow limited essential vessel \ntraffic back into this area, at one time point over 800 tugs and barges \nwere impacted by the spill, and many ships are still waiting to return \nto this vital transportation corridor that needs to be reopened. We are \nonly now beginning to understand fully the economic and environmental \nimpacts this spill has caused.\n  Unfortunately, as many of my colleagues know, these sorts of spills \nare becoming all too frequent. Last November, the Cosco Busan cargo \nship spilled 54,000 gallons of highly toxic bunker fuel into San \nFrancisco Bay, costing well over $50 million in cleanup costs.\n  Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused spills totaling nearly 8 million \ngallons, released throughout the Gulf of Mexico region.\n  In December of 2004, the Selendang Ayu broke apart, pouring 350,000 \ngallons of oil into the waters off the Aleutian Islands, killing \ncountless sea birds and marine mammals and sea otters.\n  In 2004, in my home State, the oil tanker, Polar Texas, spilled 1,000 \ngallons of crude oil into the Puget Sound. This spill in the Dalco \nPassage cost millions of dollars to clean up and was a real wake-up \ncall to many of my Washington constituents.\n  As I know the Presiding Officer, Senator Lautenberg, is aware, \nbecause he has been a great champion over strengthening the oil spill \nprevention safety net, the oil tanker, Athos, spilled over a quarter-\nmillion gallons of crude oil into the Delaware River and its \ntributaries in November of 2004.\n  As chair of the Commerce Subcommittee with jurisdiction over oil \nspill issues and the Coast Guard, I want my colleagues to know the \nCommerce Committee has been working hard to try to give the Coast Guard \nthe tools it needs to prevent these spills and to respond quickly and \neffectively when a spill happens. Over the last few years, the \ncommittee has held several hearings and has asked for and received \ninformation from the Coast Guard and Government Accountability Office, \nand worked to help understand and update the Nation's oil spill \nprevention safety net.\n  We worked hard to develop a thoughtful and balanced piece of \nlegislation that would help prevent more of these tragic spills from \nhappening again. Almost exactly 1 year ago, after months of bipartisan \nnegotiations, the Commerce Committee unanimously reported the 2007 \nCoast Guard authorization bill, which contains many of these oil \nprevention provisions. I would like to thank Ranking Member Stevens for \nhis thoughtful improvements and his strong support of these vital \nprovisions, which would update the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\n  Even though we have this bipartisan bill before us that has come out \nof the Commerce Committee, and even though it is critical to our \nnational security and emergency preparedness, it is still being \nsubjected to the same kind of obstructionism from a handful of Senators \nwho don't want to move forward on the legislation, a situation we are \nbecoming all too familiar with on the Senate floor. In this case, the \nbill is being held hostage by one or two Senators who seem interested \nin stopping its progress. They do not seem to care that it has the \nsupport of the Bush administration's Department of Homeland Security, \nwhich stated it ``strongly supports'' this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Department of Homeland Security letter to the chairman, Daniel \nInouye, and the vice chair, Ted Stevens, from Donald Kent, Assistant \nSecretary, Office of Legislative Affairs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Department of Homeland Security,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2008.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Vice Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Stevens: This letter \n     sets forth the Department of Homeland Security's views on S. \n     1892, the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2008.''\n       As noted in the Department's September 20, 2007, views \n     letter, the Department strongly supports S. 1892, as reported \n     by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. As \n     the Senate prepares to take up the measure, the Department \n     urges the Committee to review anew the Department's \n     objections that are set forth in that views letter and \n     prepare amendments that would address the concerns of the \n     Department and the Coast Guard.\n       The Department urges the Committee to seek amendments that \n     would further perfect two of the three key Administration \n     initiatives (i.e., sec. 201 (Vice commandant; vice admirals) \n     and sec. 916 (Protection and fair treatment of seafarers)). \n     Specifically, the Department would strongly support \n     amendments that, with regard to sec. 201, would\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\n     provide for the treatment of incumbents during the period of \n     transition and, with regard to sec. 916, would allow the use \n     of community service moneys to provide necessary support for \n     other seafarers who have been abandoned in the United States.\n       The Department also urges the Committee to reject any \n     future amendment to the Coast Guard Authorization Act that \n     would prescribe the manner in which the Coast Guard executes \n     missions, affects or divests the Service of its adjudicatory \n     functions, prescribes the qualifications of Coast Guard \n     officers, imposes reporting requirements that attribute \n     expenditures to a single mission area, or prescribes \n     acquisition practices harmful to the interests of the \n     Government that would otherwise cause the Administration, the \n     Department, or the Coast Guard to object strongly to the \n     bill. From the viewpoint of the Department and the Coast \n     Guard, the absence of such language reflects positively on \n     the Committee and the institutional role of the Senate. The \n     Department applauds the Committee's past and future efforts \n     to ensure that S. 1892 remains free of such and like \n     language.\n       Both the Department and the Coast Guard appreciate the \n     Committee's willingness to work amicably with all parties to \n     pass a bill that would enhance the organizational efficiency \n     and operational effectiveness of the Coast Guard, yet \n     preserve the Commandant's authorities as Service Chief. The \n     Department is confident that, during further congressional \n     consideration, the Committee, the Department, and the Coast \n     Guard can agree on language to address the Senate's \n     objectives, as well as the Department's and the Coast Guard's \n     concerns.\n       The Department and the Coast Guard deeply appreciate your \n     efforts to resolve those issues that preclude the Senate from \n     taking up and passing the measure. The Department stands \n     ready to assist you in this endeavor.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this report to Congress.\n       I appreciate your interest in the Coast Guard and the \n     Department of Homeland Security, and I look forward to \n     working with you on future homeland security issues. If I may \n     be of further assistance, please contact the Office of \n     Legislative Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Donald H. Kent, Jr.\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                    Office of Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I also want to make sure people \nunderstand the Coast Guard and its commandant, Admiral Thad Allen, have \nbeen working hard to see this legislation passed. In fact, Admiral \nAllen has made the statement: ``The swift enactment of these provisions \nwould significantly improve safety, security, and stewardship in the \nmaritime domain.''\n  But these Senators refuse to meet with the Coast Guard Commandant who \nwants to at least have a chance to explain why he needs this \nlegislation to pass so the Coast Guard can do the critical job of \nsecuring our Nation's waterways.\n  Let me take a moment to describe why this bipartisan legislation is \nso important. First, it would require the Coast Guard to have rules in \nplace for how it needs to respond to any kind of wreckage or salvage \noperation, such as the wreckage in the Mississippi River from the \nincident last week. Because no strict guidelines are in place as to the \namount of time it takes to respond to oil spill wreckage, a barge, such \nas the one in the Mississippi, could be left for many days in the \nmiddle of the river.\n  Another section of the legislation addresses human error. We don't \nknow what caused this spill yet, although we know there was not a \nproperly licensed pilot in the tug pulling the barge, and we do know \nhuman error is the cause of many spills. In fact, the bill requires the \nCoast Guard to take into consideration human error causes of spills and \nhow best to address them.\n  The Coast Guard would also benefit from the fact that NOAA's oil \nspill response program would get up to an additional $15 million per \nyear from the oil spill liability trust fund. This program is currently \non the ground helping with the oil spill in Louisiana, but they are \nlimited in their ability because of severe budget constraints. So \ncertainly having this bill passed would have helped in the response in \nNew Orleans.\n  There are other significant measures that will help in improving our \nNation's oil spill prevention safety net. So I hope my colleagues can \nhelp us get this legislation over the goal line because it is \ncritically important we do so before we leave for the August recess.\n  It provides the Coast Guard with the critical resources and authority \nit needs in other areas as well--to fight terrorists, to capture drug \nrunners, and to defend our homeland security. So isn't it time to help \npush the Coast Guard into the 21st century and begin planning for the \nchallenges of tomorrow, rather than continuing to struggle with the \nchallenges of today? And isn't it time we pass this legislation that \nmight actually help prevent another oil spill from happening again, \nsuch as the one in Louisiana, and to give the Coast Guard the tools it \nneeds?\n  Tomorrow, I will be asking my colleagues for unanimous consent to \npass this legislation. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who believe in strong tools for the Coast Guard will talk to \ntheir colleagues and ask them to stop blocking this legislation so we \ncan get on with preventing another incident such as this one from \nhappening again.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         Beijing Olympic Games\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a week from Friday we will see the start \nof the Olympics, held every 4 years, where people from all over this \nglobe come together and compete on the athletic field. And with the \nstart of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, I wish to talk for a moment \nabout what is happening today in China.\n  I wish to be clear that I have great respect and admiration for the \nChinese people. I have visited their country and enjoyed long \nconversations. I have had an opportunity to stand on the Great Wall of \nChina and understand some of the history of this great country. But no \none should confuse the Chinese people with their unelected Government. \nThe differences I have are with the Government of China regarding human \nrights, the rule of law, and freedom of speech, and they are very \nsignificant.\n  The Government of China was awarded the Games by the International \nOlympic Committee only after it pledged to respect the Olympic Charter \nand to improve its human rights record. The charter of the Olympics \nstates that the goal of the Olympic Games should be to promote ``a \npeaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.''\n  The world had high hopes that China's leaders would ensure that the \nOlympics took place in an atmosphere that advanced freedom and openness \nand reflected genuine progress on human rights. But those hopes have \nbeen sadly dashed. Human rights conditions, unfortunately, have \nworsened in China.\n  Individuals who have publicly spoken out about the Olympics, or who \nhave spoken about abuses in China and Tibet, and have been punished or \nharassed as a result include lawyers, bloggers, journalists, community \nactivists, NGO workers, Tibetans, Muslims, Christians, parents of \nchildren who died in earthquakes. The list goes on and on.\n  Now, every country that has ever hosted an Olympics has had critics, \nboth at home and abroad. China has also had critics of it hosting the \nGames. But instead of being tolerant of dissent, what China has done is \nhit back hard with a combination punch of intimidation and, too often, \nimprisonment.\n  I am the cochairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on \nChina, and we maintain the most complete database of China's political \nprisoners accessible and searchable by the public. We now have 4,400 \nrecords in that prison database, and I wish to discuss three of those \nprisoners today. I call them Olympic prisoners of conscience.\n  The first is Hu Jia. This is a picture of Hu Jia. Hu Jia is a \ncourageous activist jailed last December by the Chinese for comments he \nmade at a European Parliament hearing. He was invited to speak at the \nhearing, were he made some statements that were critical of his country \nhosting the Games. He was then detained and his wife and infant \ndaughter were put under house arrest for several months. In April, Mr. \nHu was sentenced to 3\\1/2\\ years in prison for ``inciting subversion of \nstate power.'' Since then, his young family continues to be harassed \nand is still under surveillance. Hu Jia is quite ill in a Chinese \nprison, where he is being held for simply speaking his mind at a \nEuropean Parliament hearing.\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\n  Here is a photograph of Mr. Yang Chunlin. He is a laid-off worker, an \nunemployed worker in China. He has been repeatedly detained for helping \nfarmers trying to seek compensation for lost land. Last summer, he \norganized a petition titled ``We Want Human Rights, Not the Olympics.'' \nHe was subsequently arrested, and he was charged with inciting \nsubversion of state power.\n  Let me say that again. The charge was ``inciting subversion of state \npower.'' Now in prison, he has reportedly suffered severe beatings, \nwhich have caused damage to his eyesight.\n  Finally, I wish to mention Ye Guozhu. This courageous Chinese citizen \nis pictured in this photo alone, smiling. In 2003, three generations of \nhis family have been evicted from their Beijing home to make way for \nthe Olympics-related construction. In 2004, he applied for permission \nto organize a protest against other alleged forced evictions in Beijing \nin connection with preparations for the Olympics. Mr. Ye was arrested \nand sentenced to 4 years in prison for provoking and making trouble. \nThe charge is ``provoking and making trouble.'' He has reportedly been \ntortured in prison. Having served his sentence, he was finally expected \nto be released from prison this week, but his release has now been \nfurther delayed, allegedly due to the concerns that he might speak to \nthe foreign press during the Olympics.\n  The right to speak freely and the right to challenge the Government \nin China, all of these are enshrined in China's constitution. Yet all \nare being violated in the run up to the Olympic Games.\n  Now, here is list of 807 cases of political prisoners developed by \nthe Congressional-Executive Commission on China, CECC. I have shown the \nphotographs of three Chinese prisoners, prisoners who have been \nsentenced to prison terms because they had a determination to speak \nout. They wanted the ability to criticize their Government. This list \nof 807 cases is part of 4,500 case records contained in our database. \nThis document is published by the Congressional-Executive Commission on \nChina. This particular document has 807 cases of political prisoners, \nall the detailed information on political prisoners known or believed \nto be detained in prison in China. The Commission notes that ``there \nare considerably more cases than these 807 cases. These represent a \nsubset of 4,500 case records contained in the political prisoner \ndatabase created by our commission.''\n\n  That database, if anyone is interested, is accessible and searchable \nby the public at www.cecc.gov.\n  I have just described the CECC political prisoner database, as well \nas three of the prisoners contained in this document, for this reason: \nA week from Friday, President Bush will be attending the opening \nceremony of the Olympic Games. Today, President Bush met with four \nChinese dissidents, including Rebiya Kadeer, Harry Wu and others. I \ncommend the President for that meeting. I know he has an interest in \nthis issue, the issue of liberty and of freedom of speech in China. But \nI hope and I implore the President not to miss the opportunity of while \ngoing to the opening ceremony of the games in China, at the same time \nproviding the CECC list on political prisoners to the Chinese leaders. \nIf the President is going to attend the opening of the Olympics, I \nbelieve there is a responsibility to make the trip genuinely count, and \nnot just to celebrate the Olympics.\n  The Olympics are a wonderful way for people around the world to come \ntogether. All of us support the Olympics. I certainly do. But I believe \nvery strongly that the 807 people in China now in prison, contained in \nthese records must not be forgotten. I believe strongly the leaders of \nthe Chinese Government should continually be confronted with the names \nof these individuals who are imprisoned merely for their belief and \nspeech. The Olympic charter talks about respect and human dignity. The \nChinese Government made representations to the international community \nif it was given the privilege of hosting the Olympics, it would meet \nthe test of that charter. Regrettably, it has not.\n  Again, I commend President Bush for meeting with the four Chinese \ndissidents today at the White House. I think that was an important \nstep. I hope when our President goes to the opening games in China a \nweek from Friday, he will take this prisoner list with him--which we \nwill send to him tomorrow at the White House--and that he will, when he \nmeets with Chinese leaders show them the names of the 807 brave and \ncourageous men and women contained in the list, who believe in the \nright of free speech, who desire freedom for themselves and their \nfamilies, who in most cases are unfairly imprisoned for transgressions \nthat are things we would take for granted in this country where we have \nsuch great freedom.\n  We will be sending this to the President in the hope that he will \ncontinue to raise these names with the Chinese Government. In \nconclusion, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China maintains \nthe most significant publicly accessible database that exists in the \nworld of those who now sit in prisons in China for having the courage \nto speak the truth, for having the courage to do and say the things we \ntake for granted every single day in the United States.\n  My hope is looking at just one of these cases, and knowing there are \nmany more than the 807 in this list, all of us will use the opportunity \nof the Olympcis to say to the Chinese Government: Stop the harassment \nand detention. Stop imprisoning innocent people. Live up to your own \nConstitution's protections for the Chinese people. My hope is our \ncountry, including our President, will continue to raise these subjects \nwith the Chinese leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in the last year, Americans here at home \nhave faced an ever increasing number of challenges--skyrocketing gas \nprices, the mortgage and foreclosure crisis, record job losses, and \ndevastating natural disasters. Families are hurting in this country \ntoday and they need relief right now.\n  I have come to the floor this evening because we will soon be voting \non legislation that will help ease the burden for many of these \nfamilies. We know it is not perfect, but the Jobs, Energy, Families and \nDisaster Relief Act of 2008 will take important steps to create jobs \nand provide disaster relief to flood, tornado, and hurricane victims. \nThat bill includes critical provisions that will help our renewable \nenergy industry continue to thrive and to shore up our Highway Trust \nFund as well. It also includes provisions that are important to my home \nState of Washington, including a measure to extend the sales tax \ndeduction and help our rural schools.\n  I come to the floor this evening to take a few minutes to urge my \ncolleagues tomorrow to support this legislation and help get it into \nthe hands of our taxpayers and our communities that so desperately need \nit. I will begin by explaining how important it is that we extend the \nsales tax deduction.\n  In most States, taxpayers can deduct their State income taxes on \ntheir Federal tax returns. But people who live in my home State of \nWashington historically have not had that option. Back in 2004 I worked \nwith my colleagues from my home State of Washington, Senator Cantwell \nand Congressman Baird, on a measure that temporarily enables taxpayers \nto take an itemized deduction for State and local sales taxes. That \nprovision enabled nearly 1 million people to save an average of $519 to \n$575 each and every year. It has helped many of our middle-class \nfamilies pay for school or cars or other major expenses.\n  The Washington State Office of Revenue Forecast has told us that the \nsales tax deduction has actually created thousands of new jobs in our \nState. But it was a huge blow to the taxpayers in my home State when \nthat sales tax deduction expired in December and then our Republican \ncolleagues decided to block a bill that would have extended it for 2 \nmore years. Tomorrow we will have, finally, another chance. That \nproposal we will vote on would extend this provision to the end of \n2008.\n  At a time when so many of our families are struggling to get by, at a \ntime when we are looking for innovative ways to stimulate the economy, \nit is vital that we approve that measure tomorrow and establish \nfairness in our State tax system and put money back\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\ninto the pockets of our State taxpayers.\n  Another provision in this same bill we will be voting on tomorrow is \nimportant to help communities in my State and others pay for roads and \nschools and basic services. In Washington State and in other big \nWestern States where vast areas of land are owned by the Federal \nGovernment, States currently lose millions of dollars in tax revenue \nthat normally would go to pay for our schools or our local government \nservices. In the past, the Federal Government shared the revenue from \ntimber sales on our Federal lands to help our States make up for that \nlost revenue. But because timber sales have been decreasing since the \nmiddle of the 1990s, Congress passed an act called the Secure Rural \nSchools Act, to ensure that our rural communities and counties would \ncontinue to get the money they need to pay for their schools and their \nroads and provide basic services. That act expired 2 years ago now. \nWhile we funded it for a year on the fiscal year 2007 supplemental, it \nhas not been extended this year, and that means our rural communities \nin my home State and across the West are now struggling to keep their \nschool doors open. Some of our counties, in fact, have already been \nsending out pink slips.\n\n  The bill we will vote on tomorrow will again extend that program to \n2011 and adjust the funding formula to make it more equitable and \nincrease Payments in Lieu of Taxes to these rural communities and \ncounties across the country. This provision is extremely important to \nour rural communities. All of our children deserve an equal opportunity \nto learn, regardless of where they live. That is why the secure rural \nfunding program is so important. I hope our colleagues across the aisle \nwill join us tomorrow to vote for this.\n  I also want to say a few words about the highway trust fund fix, \nwhich is also in the same bill we will be voting on. The condition of \nthe highway trust fund, which helps us pay for all of our highway \nrepair and construction across this country as well as mass transit, \nhas been deteriorating now for years. Skyrocketing gas prices have made \nan already dire situation worse.\n  This year we are going to see the largest recorded decrease in \nhighway miles traveled in the last 17 years. As a result of that, the \nhighway trust fund is now less than a year away from going bankrupt. \nThat is going to leave a lot of critical construction projects in every \none of our States in peril.\n  I, along with Senator Bond, who is the ranking member on my \nTransportation and Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, have been \nsounding the alarm about the problems facing our highway trust fund for \nalmost 2 years now. In January of 2007 we wrote and voiced our concerns \nto Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley on the Finance Committee and \nthey promised to help us fix this problem.\n  The Senate has now tried twice to move a bill through the Senate to \nfix the highway trust fund for this year, for 2009. There is a broad, \nbipartisan consensus for solution. But, unfortunately, our efforts have \nbeen blocked repeatedly by a few Senators.\n  This bill we will vote on tomorrow, if it passes, will provide enough \nmoney, $8 billion, to get us through this coming fiscal year. That \nmeans our construction projects can continue to go forward in every \nsingle State and it will help us keep as many as 380,000 good-paying \njobs to continue critical construction and repair projects that will \nmake our highways and our bridges safer. That proposal that is in that \nbill will not have any revenue effect. It passed the House on July 23 \nby an overwhelming majority and it is vitally important to all of our \ncommunities that this Senate do the same thing.\n  I hope our colleagues join with us tomorrow to invoke cloture and \nmove to this bill, this tax extenders bill, so we can put this \nprovision in place.\n  That same bill also includes a number of other provisions that will \nhelp ease the burden of the faltering economy for our taxpayers. It \nwill extend the tax credits for wind, biomass, geothermal, and other \nrenewable energy providers, and help provide stability for that \ndeveloping industry.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the bill is not perfect. \nUnfortunately, we have had to leave out some worthy items. But it is an \nextremely important bill and we are very close to making this \nlegislation a reality. We need a few Senators to vote with us tomorrow \nmorning.\n  I am worried. I come to the floor to speak tonight because I am \nconcerned that there are some on the other side of the aisle who seem \nto be willing to play politics, rather than help us bring forward this \nbill that will create jobs and support clean energy and provide tax \nrelief for our families. I am here tonight to say this is far too \nimportant an issue with which to play politics. Not only are all of \nthese provisions critically important but they are time sensitive. They \nare time sensitive. At a time when our economy is lagging and so many \nfamilies are struggling, we need to get these programs in place and we \nneed them now.\n  I hope that tomorrow morning when we vote on the cloture to move to \nthis tax extenders bill that our friends on the other side will join \nus, that they will put politics aside and hopefully make American \nfamilies a priority.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to speak \nin support of S. 3335, which is the Jobs, Energy, Families and Disaster \nRelief Act on which this Chamber will have an opportunity to vote \ntomorrow morning. It is a real, honest solution to how we move forward \non a variety of challenges that face the Nation today, including the \nhuge challenge of energy which we know we face. This has been debated \nfor the last several weeks here on the floor of the Senate.\n  It is my sincere hope we will be able to join in a strong bipartisan \nvote in support of this legislation, which was crafted in the Finance \nCommittee under the leadership of Senator Baucus.\n  Through his leadership, this legislation that we will vote on \ntomorrow morning will create the opportunity for us to demonstrate to \nthe American people we can, in fact, find solutions to some of the \nmajor problems that are facing us as a nation today.\n  I want to focus, first of all, on the energy tax extenders that are \nincluded in this legislation. This legislation will help us as we \naddress the energy challenges of the Nation by making sure what we do \nis to open the door to one of the cornerstones of alternative fuels and \nenergy independence that we need for America.\n  It will provide extension of the production tax credit, to the \ninvestment tax credit, for an industry and for markets that need \ncertainty, and that certainty can only be provided by giving the long-\nterm extensions that are created in this legislation.\n  A ``no'' vote on this legislation tomorrow is a disastrous effect to \nan industry that is still in a nascent position, an industry that has a \nhorizon where within a few years we can start making some very dramatic \nimpacts to the energy needs of America.\n  Projections by the experts show that a failure to extend the solar \nand wind tax incentives alone will result in the withdrawal of nearly \n$19 billion in capital investments and the loss of more than 116,000 \njobs in 2009. That is 116,000 jobs in 2009.\n  At this point, we look at the pillars of the American economy, and \nthey are shaky. Last Saturday, it took a Saturday session, but we were \nable, here in the Senate, with a very strong bipartisan vote, to help \nput one of those pillars of the American economy on a pathway where we \nwill be able to strengthen that pillar. That has to do with the housing \ncrisis that America has been facing.\n  Tomorrow morning we have another opportunity to address another one \nof those pillars that is somewhat shaky, in fact, very shaky, and \ncausing a lot of pain to the American consumers and to American \nnational security; that is, the issue of energy which is addressed in \nthe tax extender package that we will be voting on tomorrow morning.\n  When we think about the fact that people are concerned about the \neconomy, they are concerned about their jobs, they are concerned about \nthe pain at the pump, the fact that we have an opportunity to do \nsomething about it tomorrow morning, hopefully, will result in the kind \nof resounding bipartisan vote that we saw on the housing package on \nSaturday in this Chamber.\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\n  All people have to think about is the fact that we need to move \nforward with a new energy future; the fact that if we do not pass this \nenergy legislation, just on the energy piece of this legislation, \n116,000 jobs will be lost in 2009. So a ``no'' vote on this legislation \nis essentially saying no to 116,000 jobs that would be created through \nthe renewable energy world, including through wind energy, which is \nincluded within this legislation.\n  I want to make sure that everybody understands, my colleagues in the \nSenate, and I know that the Presiding Officer, a distinguished member \nof the Energy Committee, very much understands this reality; that is, \nwe are not talking about the theoretical or pie-in-the-sky kind of \nstuff, things that may happen in the year 2050 or in the year 3000.\n  This is a picture of a small farm with small wind microturbines that \nare actually producing enough electricity to be able to power the \nentire farm operation. In many retail shopping centers around the \ncountry, you see these kind of small wind turbines that are creating \nmost of the wind power necessary to power those shopping centers across \nAmerica.\n  Wind power is here in a very real way, as is solar, as is our \nopportunity to harness the power of biofuels. Let me say in my home \nState of Colorado in the brief time that I have been in Washington, DC, \nI have seen what we have been able to do.\n  In 2004, in the State election when I was elected to come to the \nSenate, I was one of the supporters of the renewable portfolio standard \nthat created the vision that we would produce 10 percent of our energy \nfrom renewable energy resources by the year 2015.\n  As a result of the passage of that legislation, and as a result of \nthe work that the Congress did in 2005 with the Energy Policy Act and \nother legislation that we have passed to create incentives for \nrenewable energy, we are making a major difference in my State of \nColorado. Wind power alone today accounts for over 1,000 megawatts of \npower being produced in my small State of Colorado and 1,000 megawatts \nof power is about the equivalent of three coal-fired powerplants. The \nwind industry tells us we are just beginning.\n  For those who have heard and listened to the highly publicized visit \nof T. Boone Pickens to the Congress in the last week, you know what he \nsays about wind and how he is investing in wind because we know we can \nharness the power of the wind. It is not some theoretical committee \npossibility. We are doing it in Colorado, we are doing it on farms and \nranches across the State, and we are even doing it in the cities and in \nthe shopping centers across the State. But it is more than wind. It \nalso is about solar energy.\n  A few years ago there was no solar energy being created in our State. \nYet, today, a few years later, we have a solar powerplant in my native \nSan Luis Valley that is producing about 10 megawatts of power.\n  Our military has been leading in many ways in creating a new energy \nfuture for America. Now Fort Carson has a solar powerplant which is \nproviding a significant amount of power to our men and women in uniform \nat Fort Carson. And at Denver International Airport we are about ready \nto plug in what will be a new solar powerplant.\n  In Colorado and across the Nation we have shown that we can harness \nthe power of the wind, that we can harness the power of the Sun, that \nwe can harness the power of biofuels. Those programs are all what is at \nstake when we vote on the cloture motion on the so-called extender \npackage.\n  What we have done is we said wind energy is important for America, so \nwe are going to have an extension that will allow the wind energy \nindustry to make plans for the future. We have said biofuels and \nhydropower and biomass are important. In this tax extender package we \nhave said that we will provide the tax credits or the tax incentives \nthat are necessary for the next 3 years. We have said that solar has \nhuge potential and we should put in an 8-year tax credit for solar in \nthe United States.\n\n  Again, this is not theoretical work that we are doing, this is real \nwork. Places in Arizona, for example, are looking at the construction \nthrough the Arizona Public Service Company of a 400-megawatt \npowerplant. In my own State we are looking at the possibility of \nexpanding our 10-megawatt powerplant in the San Luis Valley up to 100 \nmegawatts of power.\n  So if we can put these kinds of incentives in place with a 2016 \nhorizon, we are going to make a dramatic difference in terms of how we \nprovide energy to our Nation. So I am hopeful that as we move forward \nwe will be able to have a strong bipartisan vote in support of this \nenergy legislation.\n\n\n                               Oil Shale\n\n  I wanted to address one issue that the other side has come to the \nfloor often and talked about for the last 2 weeks; that is, the issue \nof oil shale. I think as we deal with this energy crisis that we find \nourselves in today we need to be honest and straightforward and \ntruthful with the American people. And that means one of the things we \nought to require of ourselves as public servants is that we ought not \nto be about phantom solutions. We ought not be about propounding \nphantom solutions that we know are not true because for some reason \nthey become politically expedient for someone running for political \noffice.\n  We need to be truthful with the American people. One of those \nphantoms that has been talked about for hours endlessly on the floor of \nthe Senate has to do with the potential of oil shale where I have seen \nmany of my colleagues with their charts coming out of the cloakroom \nacross the aisle, saying there are some 2 trillion barrels of oil that \nare locked up in the oil shale of the Rockies; 80 percent of that on \nthe western slopes of Colorado.\n  So because it is in my State, I have taken it upon myself to know \nabout oil shale, to study the booms and busts that have come with oil \nshale for at least 100 years. I would only say that we are a long ways \nfrom developing oil shale and creating gas or diesel out of oil shale \nor other kinds of fuel that we can actually use in America. The \ntechnology simply is not there.\n  Oil shale is shale. It is oil that is locked up in rock.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have an additional 4 \nminutes to complete my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, oil shale is oil that is trapped in rock. \nIt is different from the tar sands of Canada today where you can \neasily, through the technologies that have been developed, create and \nproduce millions of barrels of oil.\n  It is different than oil sands which exist in other places around the \nworld. Oil shale is shale. It is rock. It is hydrocarbon that is locked \nup in that rock, and 100 years of trying and billions of dollars for \nresearch and development to try to figure out how to take the \nhydrocarbon out of that rock has not gone anywhere. Yet that does not \nmean we should all shut the door to the potential of developing oil \nshale. And someday we may.\n  In fact, I was one of the people who helped put together the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act that created a research and development program, \nwhich is well underway in my State of Colorado, to determine whether we \ncan develop this oil shale in the ground.\n  But we have a number of questions which have not yet been answered. \nSo it is not a panacea for anybody to come over here to the floor of \nthe Senate today and say that oil shale--somehow we are going to wave a \nmagic wand and all of a sudden that is going to deal with the pain at \nthe pump today. It simply is not because we do not yet know how to take \nthe hydrocarbon out of this rock.\n  The oil companies themselves--Chevron Oil--said this not so long ago, \non March 20 of 2008. Chevron, an oil company most people are familiar \nwith, Chevron and what it does, said:\n\n       Chevron believes that a full-scale commercial leasing \n     program should not be made at this time without clear \n     demonstration of commercial technologies.\n\n  That was Chevron in March of this year. Last week, notwithstanding \nwhat the industry is saying about oil shale, the Department of the \nInterior decided that it would move forward and that it would attempt \nto develop the oil shale through a commercial leasing program. Even \nwithin those comments of the Department of the Interior, the BLM said \non July 22, 2008--this is the agency of our Federal Government that is \ngoing to be responsible for developing commercial oil shale:\n\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\n\n       It is not presently known how much surface water will be \n     needed to support future development of an oil shale \n     industry. Depending on a need, there could be a noticeable \n     reduction in local agricultural production and use.\n\n  We do not know whether it is 100,000 acre feet or 200,000 acre feet \nor 1 million acre feet. We simply do not know. Finally, the BLM also \nsaid on that same day:\n\n       The lack of a domestic oil shale industry makes it \n     speculative to project the demand for oil shale leases, the \n     technical capability to develop the resource, and the \n     economics of producing shale oil.\n\n  I conclude by simply saying that as we look at energy solutions for \nthis very difficult challenge America faces today, let's focus on real \nsolutions. Let's not focus on phantom solutions.\n  One of the real solutions we will be voting on tomorrow will be the \nenergy provisions of the tax extender bill that will embrace a new \nenergy frontier with what is the cornerstone of energy independence \nthat says alternative fuels are one of the ways in which we will get to \nthat energy independence.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Jobs, Energy, \nFamilies and Disaster Relief Act of 2008, S. 3335. Earlier versions of \nthis bill failed to overcome minority opposition. But now is the time \nfor the Senate to pass this legislation in an expeditious manner.\n  This narrowly targeted and fair-minded bill contains several \nimportant provisions. Some of these provisions will help promote \neconomic fairness. For example, this bill extends critical tax relief \nfor working families and college students. Moreover, this legislation \nwill help incentivize the development of alternative energies that will \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  In addition, I support this bill because it contains provisions to \nhelp repair our Nation's aging infrastructure, provide relief for \nAmericans suffering from recent natural disasters, and require parity \nfor mental health care treatment with other medical treatment.\n  One of the noteworthy provisions in this legislation relates to an \nissue that is important to constituents in my home State of Virginia--\nnamely the research and development tax credit--referred to as the \n``R'' tax credit. This bill will extend the R tax credit for \nanother year.\n  As most of my colleagues know, Congress originally enacted the \ntemporary R tax credit in 1981. Expenditures for R go to wages paid \nto employees performing qualified research activities, as well as \nsupplies used to conduct this research. Since 1981, U.S.-based research \nand development have had a track record of spurring U.S.-based \ninnovation.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia has helped to lead the innovation \nrevolution. Since the 1980s, small and large businesses across Virginia \nhave thrived. Many of these Virginia businesses engage in fields such \nas information technology, telecommunications, manufacturing, computer \nsoftware, aerospace, and energy. A renewed R tax credit extension \nwill help Virginia's businesses continue to compete effectively around \nthe world and help protect Virginia's economy.\n  As Virginia's research-driven companies have flourished, many \nVirginians have found employment in the R field. These jobs \ntraditionally are stable, high-paying jobs that have helped to \nstrengthen not only Virginia's business sector but also Virginia's \nfamilies and communities.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia is among the top States ranked by number \nof firms engaged in R activity. Virginia's industrial R activity \ntotals over $2 billion per year. And my home State is among the top \nStates contributing to our Nation's R performance.\n  If Congress allows the R tax credit to lapse, the consequences will \nbe large. The lapse of the tax credit could cost the American economy \ntens of millions of dollars per day, as companies delay or cancel R\nrelated activities. Many of our Nation's overseas competitors--\nincluding China and several European nations--offer an R tax credit \nand would gain a big competitive advantage over the United States. \nFailure to renew the R tax credit would allow our foreign competitors \nto attract researchers and facilities at the expense of U.S. research. \nBut most importantly, if Congress does not renew this much-needed tax \ncredit, we will see more Americans lose their jobs at a time when \nhardworking families already are suffering.\n  On three occasions this year, many Senators have thwarted the \nmajority leader's attempts to begin debate on tax extenders \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues this time to allow this tax \nlegislation--including the R tax credit--to move toward final \npassage. Let us work together to keep our R sector competitive and \nlet us support policies that will drive the next generation of American \ninnovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7619-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7619-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7619-S7620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AUTISM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as a Senator, I often meet with \nconstituents about their concerns. I hear a lot of stories about their \nlives. No story is more compelling than that of a parent looking for \nhelp for their sick child. My office receives hundreds of letters and \nphone calls each year from Illinoisans asking Congress to do something \nto help with the burden that autism brings, and we are hearing from \nmore families every year.\n  Two years ago, I heard from one woman whose story reflects the \nexperience of so many families. Ellen wrote to let me know that her \nson's autism was a constant source of worry for her. She loves her son. \nAt the same time, she worries that her son's siblings carry a genetic \ntendency for autism and that their own hopes for marriage and children \nare tainted with concerns about this genetic tendency. She worries that \none day, her other son will have to bear the strain of raising a child \nwho is affected by autism. Ellen writes, ``As much as we love our son, \nwe would give anything to have him be `typical.' He will always require \nsupervision and assistance. He is the great passion of my life and also \na very great burden.''\n  Autism has become the fastest-growing developmental disability in \nAmerica. In the past decade, the State of Illinois has seen a 353 \npercent increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism. \nToday, one out of every 150 children born will eventually be diagnosed \nwith some form of autism. When a family has to hear that their child, \nsibling, or loved one is diagnosed with autism, there are a number of \nquestions that immediately arise. Is there a cure? What caused this? \nWhere do we seek help? How will this affect our family financially?\n  Parents are searching for answers, and through medical and public \nhealth research, we can further our understanding of the challenges \nfamilies are facing. During the 109th Congress, I was a cosponsor of \nthe Combating Autism Act, which the President signed into law in \nDecember 2006. The new law calls on the Federal Government to increase \nresearch into the causes and treatment of autism, and to improve \ntraining and support for individuals with autism and their caretakers. \nThe law will help millions of Americans whose lives are affected by \nautism and will begin to give us answers to outstanding questions \nrelated to an individual's diagnosis. But more importantly, the new law \ndemonstrates the commitment of Congress to delve deeper into this \ncritically important issue for millions of families. Recently, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention launched the Study to \nExplore Early Development--a study primarily focused on the causes of \nautism spectrum disorders related to genetic and environmental factors. \nThis study is the first to comprehensively look for causes of autism \nwith over 2,700 families involved.\n  In addition to looking into the causes of autism, we are working to \nimprove the quality of life for those living with autism today. I am \nproud to cosponsor the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with \nAutism Act. This bill would expand access to treatment, interventions, \nand support services for people with autism. All families living with \nautism do not have the ability to access services like those offered at \nthe Hope School in Illinois. Through committed staff and a community-\nbased treatment approach, the Hope School makes every day a little \nbetter for kids living with autism. This bill would help replicate \nresources like the Hope\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\nSchool in other States to better serve the autism community.\n  And Illinois has gone further to help families in need of financial \nassistance. Because the cost of autism-related services is so \noverwhelming, both the Illinois General Assembly and the Illinois State \nSenate have passed legislation requiring health plans to provide \ncoverage for the diagnosis and treatment of autism. Like many other \nStates throughout the country, Illinois is responding to the voices of \n26,000 children saying their families need help.\n  Last week, the Director of the NIH, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, testified \nbefore the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee. During the hearing, I \nasked him to tell us what the NIH is doing with regard to research on \nautism. He discussed recent findings related to potential genetic \nlinks, which may help target the search for the causes of autism. For \nthe sake of the millions of people living with autism and the families \nand friends who love them, we in Congress have to do our part by \nfunding the NIH so that the research community can proceed quickly to \nunlock the mysteries surrounding this terrible disorder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7620-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RULE XLIV COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus, for including language in H.R. 3221, \nwhich this body passed on July 26, to clarify the ``general public \nuse'' requirement relating to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit \nProgram. That clarification responds to recent Internal Revenue Service \nguidance to State and local housing credit agencies that has cast a \ncloud on existing properties and future development targeted to special \npopulations.\n  Since enactment of the Housing Credit Program in 1986, and prior to \nthe recent IRS activity, the general public use requirement was \nunderstood to prohibit projects from being (1) rented in a manner \ninconsistent with HUD housing policies regarding nondiscrimination, (2) \nrented to members of a social organization or to employees of specific \nemployers, or (3) part of a hospital, nursing home, sanitarium, \nlifecare facility, trailer park, or intermediate care facility for the \nmentally or physically disabled. This understanding has resulted in \nnumerous section 42 housing projects being developed nationwide that \ntarget certain populations, including, for example, veterans, farm \nworkers, first responders, teachers, artists, low-income parents \nattending college, pregnant or parenting teens, and domestic abuse \nvictims.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, the Housing Credit Program has been \nessential to the construction of housing for many low-income \nindividuals, including housing that is specifically targeted toward \nfarm workers. Among our great success stories is the Franklin Vista \ndevelopment in Anthony, NM. Units already in service at Franklin Vista \nare targeted specifically for farm worker housing. The current phase 7, \nnow underway, would create an additional 24 units of farm worker \nhousing.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I also would like to thank the chairman. In my home \nState of Washington, the IRS action has threatened a number of \ninnovative housing developments, involving housing for pregnant women, \nhousing for disabled military veterans, and housing for artists that \nare being used as part of a larger redevelopment strategy to rebuild \nneighborhoods. The IRS action has been particularly problematic for \nState efforts to deal with the critical need increase the supply of \nsafe, decent, and affordable housing for migrant and seasonal farm \nworkers. About 10 years ago, Washington established a Farm Worker \nHousing Program that has led to the creation and preservation of over \n1,065 units of permanent housing for farm workers. The IRS's recent \nposition has not only threatened future development of such housing but \ncould potentially result in the recapture of low-income housing tax \ncredits for such units currently in existence, potentially bringing \nfinancial ruin to the nonprofit housing providers which have developed \nand operate this housing.\n  The language in the bill that this body passed on July 26 on general \npublic use reflects Congress's comfort with the historical application \nof the general public use requirement prior to the IRS's recent \nactivities, and Congress's intent to remove the uncertainty and risk \nthat the IRS's recent activities have created for the section 42 \nprogram.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. My understanding, Mr. Chairman, is that the general \npublic use provision in that bill, as passed, clarifies that housing \ndoes not fail to meet the general public use requirement solely because \noccupancy restrictions or preferences that favor tenants with (1) \nspecial needs; (2) who are members of a specified group under a Federal \nprogram or a State program or policy that supports housing for such a \nspecified group, or (3) who are involved in artistic or literary \nactivities. Is that understanding correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, the Senator is correct. And for this purpose a \nspecial need may relate to the physical facilities of the property, \nsuch as a building that offers day care, the services that are to be \nprovided, or the circumstances of the tenants, such as low-income \nparents attending college.. The basic structure of the low-income \nhousing tax credit is based on the premise that the States have the \nprime responsibility to administer this program, and they have done an \nexcellent job so far. They currently have the responsibility to \ndetermine the housing priorities of the State and to give priority to \ntenant populations with special housing needs. The newly codified \ngeneral public use rule reinforces the latitude of the States to decide \nhow housing credit dollars are allocated.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the chairman for that response and for his \nwork, along with that of the ranking member, on this important issue \nthat would permit housing credit properties to continue to serve \nspecial populations provided that the properties satisfy the \nnondiscriminatory tenant selection criteria and other requirements of \nthe Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program. I also thank the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for his tireless leadership on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7620-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7620-S7621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ACCESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about S. 3046 and H.R. \n6270, the Access, Compassion, Care, and Ethics for Seriously Ill \nPatients Act or ACCESS Act. The intent of this bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation is to expand access to investigational treatment options \nfor patients with serious or life-threatening diseases.\n  A provision of the ACCESS Act provides for three requirements for a \npatient to become eligible for access to investigational treatments \nthat have completed at least phase one of the clinical trials process, \nlabeled as compassionate investigational access, CIA. The second of the \nthree requirements provides that a physician document in writing that a \nseriously ill patient has exhausted all treatment options approved by \nthe Secretary for the condition or disease for which the patient is a \nreasonable candidate. For this particular provision, the intent of the \ncongressional sponsors of the ACCESS Act is that a patient has \nexamined, not necessarily tried, all Food and Drug Administration-\napproved treatment options for which the patient is a reasonable \ncandidate.\n  Accordingly, it is not the intent of the congressional sponsors of \nthe ACCESS Act that a seriously ill patient has tried every combination \nof treatments for which the patient is eligible before the patient is \ngranted compassionate investigational access or expanded access to the \ninvestigational treatment. Moreover, it is not the intent of Congress \nthat the seriously ill patient has exhausted every treatment option for \nwhich the patient is a reasonable candidate where a treatment option is \nknown to have severe negative side effects.\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\n  The ACCESS Act will ensure that a patient with a serious or life-\nthreatening disease has access to the largest scope of treatment \noptions available to the patient and their doctor. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7621-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LAKOTA CODE TALKERS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, during World War II, Lakota, Dakota, and \nNakota soldiers from across the Great Plains served this country with \nhonor and distinction as Code Talkers. These men sent messages in code, \nderived from their native languages, that the enemy was never able to \ndecipher. They saved the lives of countless Americans, were responsible \nfor major military victories, and provided an invaluable service to the \nUnited States, but they were sworn to secrecy about their operations in \norder to protect the code. As a result, their important contributions \nwere not immediately recognized.\n  Only one of these heroes, Clarence Wolf Guts, survives today. Mr. \nWolf Guts spoke Lakota at home, but--like many other Native youth--he \nwas punished for doing so at school. Despite this, he enlisted in the \nArmy at age 18 and served a 3-year tour in the Pacific. Mr. Wolf Guts \nand his fellow Code Talkers are an example of the proud service record \nof Native Americans, who make up a higher percentage of service men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces than any other ethnic group in America. They \nhave served with honor in all of America's wars beginning with the \nRevolutionary War on through our current operations in Iraq.\n  In 2001, the Navajo Code Talkers were awarded Congressional Gold \nMedals for their service. In appreciation of the service of Mr. Wolf \nGuts, his comrades, and all Native American Code Talkers, I have \ncosponsored S. 2681, the Code Talkers Recognition Act of 2008. This \nlegislation would ensure that all Native American Code Talkers which \nhail from at least 17 different tribes are all recognized and honored \nfor their service.\n  In recognition of their service, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and South \nDakota State University plan to construct the Code Talkers Memorial \nPark in Mission, SD. Meant to inspire hope in the community, this park \nwill feature a Memorial Grove of trees found on the home reservation of \neach soldier and will provide recreation and wellness opportunities as \na part of the tribe's ongoing fight against youth suicide.\n  I want to honor and recognize these men for their service and \nsacrifice for this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7621-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DAY OF THE AMERICAN COWBOY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to speak on S. Res. 482, a \nresolution designating July 26, 2008, as ``National Day of the American \nCowboy.''\n  The cowboy is the icon of Wyoming, representing our history and way \nof life. Wyoming's cowboy spirit and western values embodies all \naspects of our lives. Independence, courage, family values, and good \nstewardship of the land are all virtues that every Wyomingite holds \ndear. The people of Wyoming are proud of our cowboys and cowgirls. They \ncarry on our strong traditions and western values.\n  The National Day of the American Cowboy also holds a special place in \nWyoming's heart as we remember our dear friend, Senator Craig Thomas. \nAs many know, this day of recognition initially came about through the \nefforts of Senator Thomas.\n  Senator Thomas was a genuine cowboy. He led by example instead of \nseeking the spotlight. He was a dedicated public servant, a powerful \nleader, and a straight shooter. He was a loyal family man. He was a \nbeloved role model. All who knew Senator Thomas will remember the \nhumble cowboy who was unwavering in his dedication to God, Wyoming, and \nhis country.\n  Senator Mike Enzi and I have continued this effort to honor our \nAmerican cowboys and cowgirls across the country. I am pleased that the \nSenate agreed to the resolution. I look forward to celebrating this \nspecial day with Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7621-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7621-S7623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FBI'S 100-YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the FBI turned 100 years old on June 26, \n2008, and so I want to offer some remarks to mark the occasion. This \nanniversary is the perfect opportunity to look at the FBI's \naccomplishments and failures over the past 100 years and its challenges \nfor the future.\n  During the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, seven U.S. Secret \nService operatives moved to the new Department of Justice Bureau of \nInvestigation to start a new mission. Thus, the FBI was born. The FBI \nhas had countless successes in its first centennial. In particular, the \nBureau developed a talented corps of professional agents and staff who \npioneered new investigative tools that set most of the standards of \nmodern law enforcement.\n  The FBI had early successes with the arrests of Al Capone and \nGangster ``Machine Gun'' Kelly in the 1930s. Bonnie and Clyde were also \npermanently put out of business thanks to some local cops and the FBI. \nThe Bureau later went after the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s and 1950s. It \ntargeted the New York mafia in the 1980s and 1990s, which led to the \ndecline of the Gambino crime family and its infamous leader, John \nGotti.\n  However, the FBI also has had its share of failures. From its own \ncivil rights abuses in unauthorized wiretapping of civil rights \nleaders, to the tragedies at Ruby Ridge and Waco, to the internal \nbetrayal by special agent Robert Hansen, there have been many dark days \nin the history of the Bureau. Still, I am confident that if the FBI is \nwilling to honestly examine its own shortcomings, it can learn the \nlessons necessary to improve and become more effective at keeping \nAmericans safe and free.\n  I celebrate with all FBI employees, active and retired, whose \ndifficult and courageous work keeps the rest of us secure.\n  I also recognize and honor agents who have paid the ultimate price to \nprotect our country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. These \nheroes deserve praise for their hard work and sacrifice.\n  The protection of the United States is the FBI's main mission. The \nFBI is tasked to keep us safe from terrorist attacks, foreign spies, \npublic corruption, infringements on civil rights, organized crime, and \nmajor white-collar and violent crime. To serve its mission, the Bureau \nmaintains a worldwide presence in over 400 cities in the United States \nand 60 countries worldwide.\n  Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the FBI has \nfocused its efforts on antiterrorism. Its intelligence and diligence \nhave protected our Nation from countless threats to our safety. FBI \nemployees have stepped up in these treacherous times, and we count on \nthem every day. They put their lives on the line for our freedom.\n  We know they are fulfilling their mission when nothing happens to \nharm us, when we have another day, week, and year free from a terrorist \nattack and violent crime.\n  Like any anniversary, this is a good opportunity for us to look at \nthe FBI's failures so it can learn and grow from its mistakes. For \nyears, I have been a watchdog of the FBI's propensity to retaliate \nagainst whistleblowers, the Bureau's unwillingness to cooperate with \nother agencies, and its inability to update its technology system. I \nhope on its 100-year anniversary, the FBI will turn a new leaf and \ncorrect these problems to create a better, safer century ahead.\n  Parts of the FBI's internal culture hamper its ability to effectively \nidentify and neutralize threats to national safety. For instance, the \nBureau has what I have called a ``Pac-Man'' mentality, because it tries \nto gobble up whatever it can of other agencies' jurisdiction, evidence, \nand cases. At times, it has acted like a lunch-stealing bully on the \nplayground.\n  Our safety would be much better preserved if the FBI would play nice \nand share jurisdiction and resources with the other agencies. The FBI \nshould concentrate on its primary mission--fighting terrorism--and let \nother agencies take the lead on investigations in which they have \nspecialized expertise. For example, often, drug and bombing cases \nshould be handled by the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, and the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF, respectively.\n  This Pac-Man mentality is evident by the way the FBI demands access \nto\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\nother law enforcement groups' intelligence, informants, evidence, and \nresources, and yet it rarely shares its own information and resources--\neven after 9/11. For instance, in 2006, Houston Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, ICE, agent Joe Webber testified before a House Committee \nthat the FBI purposely delayed a wiretap request in an ICE-headed \nterrorism financing case, simply because it was an ICE-originated case, \nrather than an FBI case.\n  The result of this Pac-Man attitude by the FBI was a missed \nopportunity to hunt down the perpetrators of terrorist financing in \nthat case.\n  The FBI has also engaged in jurisdiction grabbing with the ATF over \nbombing cases and with the DEA over drug cases. Turf wars don't help \nkeep our streets safe, because our limited resources are wasted when \nprograms and investigations are duplicated. Instead of concentrating \nits resources on antiterrorism, the FBI has tried to take over \ninvestigations in which other agencies have jurisdiction and expertise.\n  Similarly, the FBI has not always cooperated with other agencies in \ninformation-sharing efforts. This reluctance to cooperate is epitomized \nin FBI agents' turf wars with ATF agents. The Washington Post reported \nthat FBI agents sold counterfeit cigarettes to ATF agents because the \ntwo agencies were running twin tobacco smuggling stings.\n  At crime scenes, the Washington Post reported, agents from each \nagency threatened to arrest each other over jurisdiction and evidence \nsquabbles. The agencies acted like two dogs fighting over one bone. The \nproblem is that there are plenty of bones out there, and the agencies \ncan each get more if they work together.\n  Another problem area exists in deciding which agency should \ninvestigate domestic bombing incidents. Until recently, the FBI and ATF \nhave been operating under a 1973 memorandum of understanding, which \npredated and did not anticipate the ATF's 2002 move to the Justice \nDepartment from the Treasury. This old agreement failed to take into \naccount the post-9/11 emphasis on searching for terrorism links in \nbombing cases. With a 35-year-old agreement, it doesn't surprise me \nthat there was so much confusion and squabbling between the two \nagencies.\n  I have recently learned that the Attorney General issued a new MOU \nthat will now be the controlling authority between the ATF and FBI in \nbombing cases.\n  I am curious to see this new MOU and sincerely hope the FBI and ATF \nhave come up with a better way to resolve disputes regarding which \nagency takes the lead on domestic bombing cases.\n  Unfortunately, there is reason to be skeptical that this new MOU will \nhave an impact. A 2004 memo from former Attorney General Ashcroft \ndirected the FBI and ATF to combine their bomb databases under the \nATF's direction, because of the ATF's expertise in bombing cases. \nHowever, 4 years after the Attorney General issued that directive, the \nFBI still has not transferred its bomb database to ATF's management.\n  Without the ATF's and FBI's cooperation in this area, agents are more \nlikely to be missing key information. I don't blame the agents on the \nstreet for this problem. The problem is the direct result of \njurisdictional greed and indecision by top bureaucrats at FBI \nHeadquarters. It is imperative that the two agencies work together so \nthat they can keep the country safe.\n  Notwithstanding these issues, there have been instances of effective \ncooperation. In 2007, the ATF and FBI cooperated with other law \nenforcement agencies, and their efforts resulted in the largest \nprosecution of environmental extremists in U.S. history. Ten \necoterrorists were convicted for politically motivated arson that \ncaused $40 million in damage. We need to see more of these types of \nsuccesses, and if the FBI and other agencies can replicate this kind of \ncooperation in the next 100 years, Federal law enforcement will end up \nbetter fighting criminals and terrorists together, rather than fighting \nagainst each other.\n  I have also done oversight of the culture within the FBI which \nencourages retaliation against whistleblowers. There have been too many \ncases of continued retaliation against FBI whistleblowers. Any FBI \nemployee who has the courage to come forward to expose corruption or \nwasted resources in the FBI should be applauded, rather than punished. \nNot only are these courageous individuals safeguarding our tax dollars, \nthey are also diverting resources from waste to use in the fight \nagainst terrorism and crime.\n  Whistleblowers can spur the FBI to correct its problems. For \ninstance, FBI agent Coleen Rowley went public with insights about the \nFBI's conduct in the weeks leading up to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. \nRowley wrote a letter to FBI Director Robert Mueller in May 2002, \noutlining how her Minneapolis field office pushed to search Zacharias \nMoussaoui's home and laptop following French intelligence reports on \nhis connections and activities. But FBI headquarters downplayed the \nneed to get a FISA wiretap and search his home and computer and \nultimately denied the Minneapolis field office's request. This was \nafter the FBI got reports that Moussaoui tried to take flight lessons \nand a Phoenix field agent reported suspicions about Middle Eastern men \nenrolled in flight school.\n  After the attacks, Rowley wrote her concerns in a letter to Director \nMueller about how FBI headquarters ``downplayed, glossed over, and/or \nmischaracterized'' their investigation of Moussaoui. We don't know what \ncould have been prevented if the Minneapolis office had been able to \npursue Moussaoui when it had the chance.\n  What we know is that whistleblowers play an important role in \nimproving our agencies. On its 100-year anniversary, the FBI should \nrecognize that it needs to listen to those courageous agents who alert \nthem to a problem, rather than retaliate against the messenger.\n  There continue to be high-profile cases involving discrimination \nagainst FBI whistleblowers. For instance, just over a month ago, FBI \nagent Bassem Yousseff came forward and testified before Congress about \nstaffing deficiencies in the counterterrorism program of the FBI. \nWithout his testimony, Congress would not have known that the FBI is \nhaving trouble filling those critical positions. Yet, just 2 days after \ntestifying, agent Youseff was accused of violating FBI regulations. The \nFBI dropped its allegations, but I am not willing to drop the subject. \nI sent a letter, along with House Judiciary Committee and subcommittee \nchairmen, demanding the FBI turn over its records to determine what \nhappened. The FBI has not responded. The FBI should have a system that \nencourages concerned agents to come forward and identify problems that \ncan then be solved, rather than swept under the rug. It should not use \nwhistleblowers as ``canaries in coal mines,'' to be sacrificed as soon \nas they alert us to a problem.\n  Another problem the FBI must correct is the different standard of \npunishments it sets for agents versus their supervisors. While a \nsupervisor may get a slap on the wrist for misconduct, an agent may be \nheavily reprimanded. For example, agent Cecilia Woods reported that her \nsupervisor engaged in illicit sexual activities with a paid informant. \nHer courage and honesty in reporting this improper activity were \nrewarded with two investigations into her own conduct, suspensions, and \na transfer.\n  Meanwhile, senior level FBI agents are treated differently for their \nmisconduct. For instance, acting special agent in charge in Baltimore, \nJennifer Smith-Love, was investigated, along with two agents acting \nunder her direction, for conducting an unauthorized search of another \nagent's computer.\n  However, Smith-Love's investigation was classified as a performance \nissue, rather than a misconduct issue. While the investigation was \nstill ongoing, she got a promotion. The disparate treatment of agent \nCecelia Woods and special agent in charge Jennifer Smith-Love \nillustrates how the FBI reprimands its agents much more harshly than it \nreprimands supervisors.\n  This unequal treatment of agents and senior management is unfair and \ncreates an appearance of double standards at the agency. Double \nstandards in discipline devastate morale among the dedicated, \nhardworking FBI agents who are just trying to do their job. The FBI \nshould set more uniform guidelines for punishments for both agents and \nsupervisors.\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\n  Another area the FBI needs to improve is its implementation of \ninformation technology upgrades. For years, the FBI has been charged \nwith the task of bringing its computer systems up to date. However, \ndespite spurts of progress, this effort has been hobbled by \nembarrassment and setback.\n  The FBI had to scrap a $170 million case management system called \nVirtual Case File in 2005. The Virtual Case File system was scrapped \nbecause it failed before it ever got rolling. VCF was poorly designed \nand poorly managed, and to make matters worse, the FBI placed little \ninternal controls on the oversight of the project. To date, the FBI \nstill has not completed a new version of the system, now known as \nSentinel. Information technology needs to be a top priority for the FBI \nif it wants to effectively hunt down and disrupt terrorist cells around \nthe globe. The situation could not be more urgent, and the FBI needs to \nstep up and get the job done, on time and on budget.\n  It is also important to note that the FBI's budget has tripled since \n1999. Last year, Congress appropriated almost $7 billion dollars to the \nBureau. We should not tolerate the FBI's continued mismanagement of \npublic funds on programs that don't work. The American taxpayers can \nnot afford another Virtual Case File.\n  Technological advances are important tools to keep up with dangerous \nterrorists and criminals. As terrorists and criminals use more advanced \ntechnology to evade detection, the FBI needs to stay ahead of them with \nnew technologies to fight them without delays or setbacks. Americans \nare counting on a system that works to help prevent the next terrorist \nattack.\n  Congress plays an important oversight role over the FBI and other \nagencies. I take this role very seriously, as it is crucial to our \nsystem of checks and balances. At this 100-year juncture, I encourage \nthe FBI to step up to the plate to make positive changes in its agency.\n  Congress also has a role to play in the future of the FBI. In the \n107th and 108th Congresses, legislation was introduced to reform the \nFBI to protect whistleblowers and provide true accountability. \nUnfortunately, these reforms were never fully enacted into law. We \nshould revisit these efforts to help the Bureau be the best it can be.\n  I also believe that Congress needs to continue to examine the FBI's \ncounterterrorism mission and look at the calls some have made to split \nthe FBI's law enforcement and domestic intelligence functions along the \nlines of the British MI-5. Now some may see my statement as a call to \ndismantle the FBI, that is not what I am saying. What I do believe is \nthat our constitutional duty to conduct oversight includes a soup-to-\nnuts review of our law enforcement policies, including whether or not \nthose at the FBI are achieving their primary mission. I think there is \nmerit to arguments on both sides and believe we should spend some of \nour time looking into this. To summarize, I thank FBI employees, past \nand present, for their collective past 100 years of service. I also \nchallenge the FBI's management to grab ahold of the reins to build a \nstronger, more accountable, transparent, and effective FBI. I challenge \nthe FBI's leadership to recognize and correct the problems it currently \nhas so the Bureau can be the top notch law enforcement agency it can \nbe.\n  Now is an ideal time for the agency to look back on what it has done \nright and wrong and work to do a lot better in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7623-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7623-S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

I am disabled and living on Social \n     Security ($784 per month). It is not a lot, but I had managed \n     to live within my means for a short while and still have some \n     kind of interaction with my church and family.\n       I will start my story from the time I became disabled and \n     had to leave my employment with the Environmental Protection \n     Agency in June of 1995. I became a full-time camper with my \n     mother. We started out in her 19-foot class C camper and \n     after my disability claim was approved 3 years later we moved \n     ``up'' to a 29-foot fifth-wheel and a very used truck to tow \n     it with. We took care of each other. We spent several summers \n     hosting at Idaho State Parks for a free campsite (no salary) \n     and one winter in Washington at Fort Canby. Most of our \n     winters were spent in southern Texas at a large RV park where \n     it was warm, the rent was reasonable and activities to keep \n     us socially and mentally engaged were plentiful. We made many \n     friends on the road. There are/were many people living life \n     as we were as it was all we/they could afford. Hanging out in \n     the desert, bathing in an irrigation ditch, hauling our \n     drinking water and driving 10 miles to ``dump'' our tank was \n     fun at first. It was a life we could afford as long as the \n     gas prices stayed down. We did not take many ``side-trips.'' \n     I do not know what the folks ``on the road'' will do now.\n       Finally, in 2001, I decided I wanted to have a real home \n     again. A place to plant roots, real ones . . . roses and a \n     vegetable garden as well as have a church family; someplace \n     where I did not have to keep moving every few weeks or \n     months; a real community that stayed put. In November of 2001 \n     while visiting my sister in Spokane, I found a small ``handy-\n     man's nightmare'' in Smelterville, Idaho that I could just \n     afford if I sold the RV and truck. Mom was agreeable. The \n     realtor said ``you really do not want that house!'' I said \n     ``yes, I do!'' It had everything I wanted: a place to sit out \n     front and greet the neighbors, an area for a garden and a \n     clothesline to hang my laundry on; simple things.\n       Our whole world was falling apart at the time of the \n     purchase as it was the week of September 11, 2001. In the \n     silence of no aircraft flying overhead that week we prayed \n     that our country would make it through this difficult and \n     frightening time. We signed the papers, opened the windows \n     and let the house air out for the winter. Mom and I headed \n     south for our final warm, southern winter. I will never \n     forget the sight of the huge American flags flying from the \n     many rigs heading south. Do you know that most of the people \n     living the ``gypsy'' life are very patriotic? Almost all of \n     the men, and many of the women (myself included) are \n     Veterans. I am reminded of the scene in the movie \n     Independence Day where the RV's were all headed across the \n     desert to Area 51.\n       We returned to Idaho in March to two feet of snow on the \n     ground and no heat source in the house. We hired two guys \n     (for $20) who were waiting for the tavern to open to unload \n     the U-haul before the next blizzard caught up with us. It had \n     been chasing us since Denver. We had no furniture, just \n     Rubbermaid tubs of dishes, pots and pans, clothes and craft \n     stuff. (I slept on an air mattress on these tubs for the \n     first year.) We stayed with my sister in Spokane while the \n     weather settled. Fortunately the sun came out the next \n     week so we sat out in the yard at a broken down picnic \n     table in the sun a lot until it warmed up. We shoveled the \n     debris (old carpeting and broken floor tiles) out of the \n     house and a neighbor was kind enough to haul it to the \n     dump. It was a year before we could walk on the floors \n     barefoot. It took me that long with a small belt sander to \n     re-do them.\n       Over the next five years, I patched, painted, re-wired, \n     constructed cabinets, closets and shelves, plumbed and \n     eventually with the help of a USDA loan at 1 percent was able \n     to have a foundation put under the house. I turned the ground \n     in the backyard by hand with a shovel and planted my \n     vegetable garden. I planted flowers. My cousin came up from \n     California with her two foster children and helped me put in \n     a gas fireplace that she had found in an abandoned mobile \n     home, and an old picket fence. We tore out the sidewalk \n     leading to the house and replaced it with stepping stones and \n     an arch with pink roses. I hung my laundry out to dry on my \n     beautiful clothesline. We celebrated my mother's 80th \n     birthday in the backyard in the rain under a tarp. The next \n     day my cousin and I started a real patio cover so we would \n     not get so wet during the next celebration. None of this was \n     fast or easy. I am disabled, remember? I sat in the sun and \n     thanked God for His many blessings.\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\n       Last November, as I installed the new kitchen counter and \n     sink and the house was finally almost perfect, as I \n     celebrated my 64th birthday, I sold my home because I was \n     unable to keep up with the utilities. My mortgage was low \n     (only 4.75 percent), and I had a USDA grant which enabled me \n     to have a new gas furnace. Unfortunately the town is in the \n     process of replacing the sewer system, the water district is \n     upgrading their system and the electricity and gas just keep \n     going up and up and up. I was paying more for utilities than \n     I was for my mortgage and USDA loan. I attended a financial \n     seminar provided by my church to find out how I could make \n     ends meet. What was I not doing that would make the \n     difference of financial stability? I tried finding part-time \n     work but no one would hire me for the few hours I could work \n     without compromising my health. My skills were outdated. I \n     could not obtain approval for school on the Internet. I could \n     only go to school to learn something if I would not be self-\n     employed and the school was so far away. The hours spent \n     would be on their terms, not when my body could work, and \n     would again compromise my health. Selling was my only way out \n     of debt, or I could continue as I was and continue to \n     ``charge'' all my groceries, medicine, gas, etc., and keep \n     the bills paid . . . for a while.\n       The price of gasoline was not too much of a problem as I \n     lived 2 blocks from church, 1 block from the post office and \n     Walmart had just moved into town! I could still walk to most \n     places I needed to go.\n       Now, gasoline is a problem. The only low-income apartment I \n     could find was in Wallace, Idaho, 15 miles from where I had \n     been. [It does not] seem very far, does it? But if everything \n     you do is that far away, there is no public transportation, \n     and the price of gasoline is $4.00+, it is far indeed. I do \n     much of my shopping via the Internet as the drive to the \n     nearest town where fabric, books, electronics, etc. are sold \n     is 50 miles each way. My daughter paid for my Internet \n     service so I would not be so out of touch with the world.\n       I was already committed to directing my granddaughter's \n     school Christmas and Spring musical plays. That meant a trip \n     to Kellogg every day. While I still had some money left from \n     the sale of my home I could absorb this cost. Now the money \n     is gone and I haven't seen my family in 2 weeks. I try to \n     combine my trips to church with shopping for groceries at \n     Walmart. I do not attend many of the functions at church \n     anymore. I used to be at the church almost every day. I may \n     have to stop going to that church completely and go to one \n     here in Wallace. That sounds reasonable, but the church in \n     Smelterville is ALIVE! The churches here are not.\n       I miss my little four room house in Smelterville with its \n     big south-facing windows, playing in the dirt in the yard, \n     the scent of the flowers, the garage with my wood-working \n     tools and the clothesline. My apartment here is clean, \n     maintained, sufficient but dark. It is on the north side of a \n     square red brick building. There is no room for my saws, my \n     bicycle or my kayak. It is too dark even for container \n     plants. The trunk of my car is my storage room. It is like \n     living in a cave, and the building reminds me of a prison. I \n     must have the lights on all the time, but the heat doesn't \n     cost as much as my home did and I do not have to pay for \n     sewer, water and garbage. Now with the price of gas I also \n     miss my family, my church and my friends. I am trying to \n     start a new life here. I really am. But starting all over \n     again this time is harder than all the physical work I did on \n     my home.\n       Yes, we need alternative sources of energy. I have always \n     known that. We need to build smarter. I have always known \n     that. We need community transportation especially in rural \n     areas. If it is at all possible, make some of these \n     alternative sources of energy available to the poorer elders \n     of this country. Do not make them leave their homes because \n     the infrastructure in this country is falling apart. Do not \n     allow any new homes to be built without solar or wind power. \n     The Swedes do not let you build without a composting toilet! \n     I learned a lot living in an RV over the years. I have read \n     many books on alternative housing. I would have built one but \n     it would have cost me much more than my ``tear-it-down!'' \n     house that no one wanted did. We do not have to keep building \n     the way we are. So wasteful. Now I'm running off on a tangent \n     and this letter is too long already!\n       Thank you for listening to this elder travel down a few old \n     trails. I appreciate it.\n       I would be happy to talk with you or your representatives \n     if you have any questions.\n     Merilyn, Wallace.\n                                  ____\n\n       I provide sliding fee scale mental health services for \n     those who do not qualify for assistance or have insurance \n     that covers their services.

Rising energy is \n     problematic both in fossil fuels and electricity for us all. \n     Most of us are independent by nature, but this ongoing crisis \n     will continue to put many of us on assistance lists we wish \n     to avoid. It is also affecting the delivery of basic \n     subsistence services for our schools, hospitals, and public \n     services.\n     Michael.\n                                  ____\n\n       The suggestion to drill in ANWAR and off the coasts is mere \n     rhetoric when you imply it will reduce the rising costs of \n     gasoline at the pump today. From all the information I have \n     found, it would take 10 years to get that oil into \n     production, and then it would supply a mere 6 months of the \n     U.S. needs at our current rate of consumption. Probably less \n     than we would be demanding in 10 years, [I] think? Do you \n     have information that contradicts this? I would be happy to \n     hear it.\n       The multinational oil companies who would be doing the \n     drilling would be selling the oil on the open world market, \n     and we as a country would have no more chance to benefit from \n     this than we now do from the ``foreign'' oil you discourage. \n     They make a profit wherever they drill, they do not save it \n     just for us. We already sell most of our power-producing coal \n     to China today. How many [in] the Congress know that?\n       We cannot drill our way out of this mess.\n       You should first close the investment loopholes that have \n     encouraged the new ``bubble'' of speculation in crude oil \n     (after running away from the housing bubble). It would be \n     great if you could also close other potential ``bubble'' \n     opportunities, like food, and who knows what the investment \n     nuts will think of next? Speculation is well on the way to \n     ruining our economy.\n       You should next enact serious legislation to encourage \n     conservation, and invest in an expansion of proven \n     alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n       You should NOT encourage investment in nuclear power. That, \n     also, will take 20 years to come online, therefore having no \n     effect on our current needs. So far as I can see we have \n     never found a way to dispose safely of the waste. To \n     encourage nuclear building will be a very expensive subsidy \n     for the nuclear industry, but creating even more unpleasant \n     problems for future generations.\n       You should encourage investment, with tax incentives, for \n     technological research and development of truly new energy \n     possibilities. I have no idea what these might turn out to \n     be, but Americans are supposed to be inventive. Let's \n     encourage that old spirit again.\n       If you really want to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, you \n     should pass some kind of subsidy for low income people to buy \n     hybrid or electric cars. (I know, I know . . . sounds like a \n     handout). But it would be the most effective use of tax \n     dollars in a direct way to substantially reduce reliance on \n     oil. Eliminating the subsidy for the oil companies, and \n     spending it on fuel efficient cars right now, would be more \n     logical. (Just think of it as a gift to the struggling \n     automotive industry; if you really want to be patriotic limit \n     the payment to American made cars, if you can find any of \n     those left.)\n       I live out in the country, and I am only one of many here \n     in the rural west who have to have my car to get to town for \n     work, groceries, doctor appointments, etc. We have no public \n     transportation available. At current prices, one trip to town \n     costs me $8.50. Of course I try to limit the number of trips, \n     because I am retired. Ridiculous ideas like a gas tax \n     moratorium are a waste of everyone's time. So are the \n     drumbeats of drilling for more oil in inadequately supplied \n     places which could not possibly or timely relieve the crunch \n     we are in now. If we had a decent oil pool anywhere in the \n     U.S. I could see drilling, but these possibilities you list \n     are inadequate. We need to get away from oil as much as \n     possible, and we need to do it fast. I have lived most of my \n     life in an oil abundant economy, taking it for granted. But I \n     can see the road ahead and it's not pretty.\n       I am guessing my letter will go in the waste pile reserved \n     for those who disagree with you. It would be interesting to \n     hear your thoughts on my suggestions. It is time for real \n     head scratching, thinking, and cooperation, not politics as \n     usual.\n     Jill, Orofino.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo--with pleasure.

Vern and I are on fixed incomes and are working part \n     time jobs to help make the ends meet. Social Security brings \n     a large chunk of the income into our home but it is quickly \n     swallowed up with medical insurance to cover any problems \n     that we might have. With both of us being in the 70s now it \n     is harder to find work opportunities. We both come from large \n     families and so we were unable to go to college for a degree. \n     Both our fathers were blue collar workers who only went \n     through grade school years. This was the norm for their \n     growing up years.\n       With cost of insurances for medical, home and vehicle, we \n     are paying out over $650.00 a month. That is for the least \n     amount we can afford. Social Security gives us a small \n     increase in January and then takes it away with the premiums \n     to cover our Medicare insurance. This is over and above the \n     amount listed above.\n       My husband worked for Frontier Airlines for 26 years and we \n     had put aside what we thought was an adequate amount to help \n     us with the addition of the remaining work years added and \n     without child costs. We also\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\n     had approximately $78,000 in shares in the company through \n     People Express. When my husband was 50 years old, Mr Frank \n     Lorenzo did his usual number on the airline industry and \n     placed Frontier into bankruptcy. Our shares disappeared, our \n     pension was pretty much stolen to put in his pocket and we \n     were left with no real future. We tried for 2 years to \n     survive and save our house in Boise to no avail.\n       Now enter the price increases to drive our vehicles, heat \n     our homes, and feed ourselves. The environmentalist have \n     `done a number' on their fellow countrymen by shutting down \n     the ability to use our own reserves to help the country out. \n     We are more fortunate than a lot of our fellow men but we \n     still are struggling to make ends meet and see the need to \n     cut back even more to survive.\n       Our oldest granddaughter is getting married in August in \n     San Diego. We had plans to go down there for that. That will \n     probably not happen unless we go further into debt to \n     purchase either fuel for our vehicle or an airline ticket \n     which will also need fuel to get to Salt Lake City and back. \n     We are greatly disturbed by the rich, lining their pockets at \n     the expense of those who thought that we could retire and \n     survive. Heaven help those who still have families to provide \n     for.\n       Let us open up our rich reserves, put the U.S. back into \n     being a country that provides for its countrymen, with work \n     in the oil fields, and a God-fearing, loving-your-fellow-man \n     country. Greed, pride, and selfish people are dictating what \n     we do in the Senate, the House, and those who pander to those \n     who call the shots by `buying' them off to take care of \n     themselves.\n     Vern & Martha.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7625-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING DEL TINSLEY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

As the \ndirector of the Wyoming Office of USDA Rural Development, Del's \nenthusiasm for agriculture has become a lifelong career dedicated to \nWyoming's farmers and ranchers.\n  Del's boyhood summers on the ranch soon developed into a successful \ntenure selling advertising for the Wyoming Stockman-Farmer. In 1990, \nDel went to work building the newly established Wyoming Livestock \nRoundup from a little known publication to the must-have newspaper for \nevery major implement dealer and livestock auction in the State.\n  As director of the Rural Development office of the USDA, Del has \nsuccessfully encouraged renewable energy development and business \ndiversification within Wyoming's agricultural industry.\n  Over the years, Del has been a voice of wisdom for Wyoming's farming \nand ranching communities.\n  I am pleased to honor Mr. Del Tinsley on the Senate floor today. Del \nis a true steward of the land.

LOUIS ROADIES SOCCER TEAM\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I congratulate the St. Louis \nRoadies soccer team on their recent participation in the Homeless USA \nSoccer Cup. The Roadies were the first team ever from St. Louis to \nparticipate in this special event, which was held last month here in \nWashington, DC. I had the privilege and honor to meet personally the \nentire team and their coaches from Peter and Paul Community Services in \nmy office here on Capitol Hill before their competition. While the team \ndid not capture the title, I am proud of their performance and \nrepresentation of the St. Louis community and my home State of \nMissouri. However, I am even prouder of their personal perseverance and \ncommitment to self-improvement after experiencing the terrible plight \nof homelessness.\n  According to the organizers of the Homeless World Cup, about 77 \npercent of participants in the 48-team tournament go on to better their \nlives through employment, housing, education and/or drug and alcohol \ntreatment. The founders of the event believe that it provides an \nopportunity for these men to express actively themselves through \norganized competition to build character and positive individuality. \nBased on their performance, I agree.\n  The six-man team from St. Louis was made up of men who were recently \nhomeless. Unfortunately, many others suffer from the plight of \nhomelessness. It is frankly a national tragedy that we can and must \nend. Nevertheless, the spirit of the Roadies and others who \nparticipated in the Homeless Soccer USA Cup gives us significant hope \nthat we can end homelessness.\n  All six men and their coaches deserve high praise. I personally \ncongratulate the six players, Oscar Grandberry, Daniel Blue, Doug \nCarter, Labon Smith, Marcus Davis, and Vince Steiniger; and the \ncoaches, assistant coach Dena Emmanuelle, coach David Flomo, and coach \nKeith Deisner.\n  Let me highlight one of the players named Oscar Grandberry who played \ngoalie for the Roadies. His play earned him a spot on the U.S. national \nhomeless team as an alternate. He is an amazing story of determination. \nOscar is a native Liberian and former child soldier who is now on his \nway to completing a second master's degree from St. Louis University. \nOscar and Team USA will travel to Melbourne, Australia, later this year \nto compete in the sixth annual Homeless World Cup and I wish them my \nbest.\n  The Roadies placed third in the beginners' bracket of the USA Cup and \nearned the Cup's Fair Play Award. This award is annually granted to the \nteam ``showing the best in human spirit and embodying what the \ntournament is all about.'' As an addition to the already exceptional \nsporting culture of St. Louis and the State of Missouri, the Roadies \nare an inspiration to, and an excellent representation of, the great \npeople of St. Louis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7625-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF ALBANY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the city of Albany, located in \nAlameda County, CA.\n  The city of Albany, formerly known as Ocean View, was incorporated as \nOcean View in September 1908. In 1909, voters changed the name of the \ncity to Albany in honor of the birthplace of the city's first mayor, \nFrank Roberts. This year, we celebrate its centennial anniversary. \nWell-recognized for its prominent landmark, Albany Hill, the city of \nAlbany has charmed residents and visitors alike for decades.\n  Situated on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay in northern \nAlameda County, Albany's waterfront has undergone significant changes \nover the last 100 years. From the renovation of the Albany Bulb to the \ncity's involvement in Eastshore State Park, the city of Albany has \ntaken dramatic steps to promote a greener, more sustainable city. These \nefforts were rewarded in 2008 when Albany was named one of California's \ngreenest cities.\n  Solano Avenue, the principal shopping street in Albany, traverses the \ncity from east to west, while San Pablo Avenue, its other major \ncommercial street, runs north to south. These two streets account for \nthe majority of commerce in the city. Solano Avenue is also host to the \nannual Solano Stroll, which is held on the second Sunday of every \nSeptember. This event began in 1974 and has since been designated by \nthe Library of Congress as a National Local Legacy. Another local \nlandmark to be found in Albany is Golden Gate Fields, the only horse \nracing track in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n  I congratulate the city of Albany on this special occasion of its \n100th birthday and salute its wonderful community spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7625-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7625-S7626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CITY OF KINGSBURG'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 100th anniversary of the city of Kingsburg, a family-\noriented community located in California's San Joaquin Valley.\n  The story about the city of Kingsburg, like many other communities \nthroughout the San Joaquin Valley, can be traced to its fertile soils, \nMediterranean climate, and industrious population. In the early 1870s, \nthe lure of a better and more stable life prompted two Swedish natives \nto settle in a Central Pacific Railroad town called Kings River Switch. \nIn 1874, the site for the present-day town site was\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\ndrawn up and the name was changed to Kingsbury. Two years later, the \nname was changed to Kingsburgh to reflect the Swedish heritage of many \nof the town's residents. In 1894, the city's name took on its current \nspelling, Kingsburg. On May 19, 1908, the city of Kingsburg officially \nbecame an incorporated city in Fresno County.\n  The city of Kingsburg has grown from a sleepy railroad town, at its \nfounding, to a vibrant community of nearly 10,000 that rests in the \nmiddle of one of the most dynamic regions of California. Kingsburg is \nwhere Olympic legend Rafer Johnson and his brother, Pro Football Hall \nof Famer, Jimmy Johnson, spent their formative years and honed their \nathletic skills. Today the city of Kingsburg proudly embraces it \nSwedish heritage and its status as the ``Swedish Village.'' The city's \nlandscape features distinctive Swedish architecture and brightly \npainted Dala horses, traditional wooden statuettes of horses and a \nnational symbol of Sweden.\n  If its first century is any indication, it is clear that the city of \nKingsburg will continue to grow and reach new heights in the years to \ncome. The story of the city's first one hundred years is a testament to \nthe value of community. As the residents of Kingsburg gather to \ncelebrate this auspicious occasion, I congratulate them on their \ncentennial anniversary and wish them continued good fortune and \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7626-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the University of California, Davis.\n  U.C. Davis began as a public land-grant university in 1905 when \nCalifornia Governor George Pardee signed into law an act establishing a \nuniversity farm school for the University of California. One year after \nthe act was signed, the small town of Davisville, today known as Davis, \nwas selected as the site for the University Farm. The campus was \nestablished largely due to the vision of Peter J. Shields, then-\nsecretary of the California State Agriculture Society, who was \ndissatisfied by the fact California students were choosing to attend \nout-of-state universities due to the lack of programs offered by the \nUniversity of California.\n  The official opening of the University Farm was in January 1909 with \na student body of 18 students from the University of California, \nBerkeley on a 778-acre campus. The campus opened with 16 regular \ninstructors from U.C. Berkeley's College of Agriculture and 12 \nnonresident instructors. In 1922, the University Farm was renamed the \nNorthern Branch of the College of Agriculture and expanded to 3,000 \nacres in 1951 to support its rapidly growing student body.\n  In 1959, the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture was \ndeclared by the Regents of the University of California as the seventh \ngeneral campus in the University of California system. Since its \ninception as a U.C. campus, Davis has become one of the most renowned \nacademic universities in the Nation. In 1996, Davis joined the \nprestigious Association of American Universities, which represents the \ntop 62 research universities in North America. It has also been ranked \nby U.S. News and World Report as the 42nd best university in the United \nStates and the 11th best public university in the Nation. In addition, \nWashington Monthly ranked U.C. Davis 8th among all U.S. universities \nbased on its contributions to society.\n  U.C. Davis offers its students 100 academic majors and 86 graduate \nprograms within its 4 colleges and 5 professional schools. It currently \nranks 14th in the Nation in total research expenditures, 2nd in \nagricultural research, 12th in life sciences, and 13th in biological \nsciences. Davis' impressive faculty include 21 members of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, 13 members of the American Academy of Arts and \nSciences, 7 members of the National Academy of Engineering, 5 members \nof the Institute of Medicine, 3 members of the Royal Society, 2 members \nof the American Academy of Arts and Letters, 2 Pulitzer Prize winners, \nand 2 MacArthur fellows. U.C. Davis alumni account for 1 in every 276 \nCalifornians, many of whom have gone on to become leaders in their \nfields of expertise.\n  Today U.C.

Mr. President, I wish today to honor the bravery \nof two fallen Washington State firefighters--Dan Packer and Andrew \nPalmer.\n  They lost their lives this weekend battling the dangerous wildfires \nburning in northern California.\n  Dan Packer fought fires for decades. He was chief of East Pierce Fire \nand Rescue in the Bonney Lake area and a former president of the \nAssociation of Washington Fire Chiefs.\n  This weekend, he was supervising the firefighting efforts in \nCalifornia as a member of an interagency emergency management team when \nhis position was overrun by a wildfire following an ``unexpected shift \nin the wind.''\n  Andrew Palmer, from Port Townsend, was just 18 years old and on his \nfirst day of working the northern California fire line. He tragically \nlost his life when he was struck by a falling tree. He has been \ndescribed as ``extremely energetic'' and ``dedicated to his job.''\n  Both of these men clearly illustrate the courage that firefighters \nacross this country exemplify every time they go to work . . . starting \non day one.\n  An unknown firefighter once said, ``What you call a hero, I just call \ndoing my job.''\n  So today I ask that all Washingtonians, all Californians, and all \nAmericans pause to think about these two men, their families, and the \nultimate sacrifice they made just ``doing their jobs'' to protect their \nCalifornian neighbors.\n  They represent the best America has to offer: courage and selfless \naction. Their service will not soon be forgotten.\n  In fact, the deaths of these two brave Washingtonians unequivocally \nreaffirms the need to continue to work to protect and prepare these \nbrave Americans for the danger they face every day.\n  Since 1910, more than 900 wildland firefighters have lost their lives \nin the line of duty. And unless we take action that number will \ncontinue to grow every summer we send these brave individuals in to \nbattle wildfires.\n  We must demand firefighter safety and training programs receive the \nfunding they need.\n  We must track this training to ensure that every firefighter is \nequipped with the tools he or she needs to make it home safely every \ntime. It is our responsibility and obligation--to Dan Packer, to Andrew \nPalmer, and to all firefighters across this country. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7626-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING CHERMACK MACHINE, INC.\n\n Mr. KOHL.

A bill to award grants for the establishment of \ndemonstration programs to enable States to develop volunteer health \ncare programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the importance of ensuring \nthe people of our Nation have access to health care and what the Senate \ncan do today to help the neediest people get the kind of care they need \nand are entitled to.\n  There are currently 61 million Americans who are either uninsured or \nunderinsured. These people, many of whom are working and have families \nto care for, may have limited access to the kind of routine health care \nand nonemergency services so many of us take for granted.\n  Fortunately, at the present time, there is a large, vital network of \nhealth care providers in this country who are doing their best to \naddress this need and provide care to this underserved population. We \ndon't talk about this network much, as the Federal Government does not \npay for it.\n  It is made up of volunteers, hundreds of thousands of health care \nproviders, working across America, in almost every community, \nvolunteering their expertise and donating their time to help those in \nneed. These people are physicians, dentists, nurses, optometrists and \nchiropractors, to name a few of the professions that are represented in \nthis group. Hospitals and outpatient surgical centers are also \ncontributing to the effort.\n  Caring for our neighbor has always been a basic value for us as \nAmericans. My mother always told me that the service we provide to \nothers is the rent we pay for the space we take up on God's green \nearth. The people who are participating in this network of care have \ntaken that philosophy to heart and we are all the beneficiaries of \ntheir efforts. They are making a difference in more lives than we will \never know.\n  We have all heard the saying that charity begins at home, and while \nit is an important part of any effort to address a need in our towns \nand cities, I am not suggesting that it is the final answer to correct \nthe social injustices that exist in the world. We all realize that too \nmany Americans lack health insurance, and that health care reform is a \ntop priority for Congress. America needs health care reform, and I have \na\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\nplan to put that into action in my 10 Steps bill.\n\n  As we work on health care reform and all it entails, we can also do \nsomething to help provide some support and encouragement to the \nvolunteer effort I have just described. Government has a role to play \nand it is to facilitate the care that is provided to those who need it \nso badly by those who are willing to freely offer it to them.\n  As with so many things, there is a catch, and that is why I am \nintroducing my Volunteer Health Care Act of 2008. My bill will remove a \nlegal barrier that currently prevents physicians and health care \nprofessionals from volunteering their services to individuals who \neither can't afford or can't access even the most basic of care. There \nis an overwhelming need for medical volunteers to work with the poor in \nthe United States, but medical liability concerns discourage many \ndoctors from providing voluntary services. This bill will help provide \naccess for the disadvantaged and provide them with the care they so \ndesperately need. In return, it will help to alleviate the concerns of \nhealth care providers who want to share their talents with the people \nof their community and give something back to make their part of the \nworld a better place to live.\n  This legislation addresses the situation in a way that is fair to the \npatient. It provides an avenue to recover damages if, by chance, some \nharm is done. It makes use of a formula that has been tried before and \nbeen proven to be effective.\n  I have said before that States are the laboratories for the Federal \nGovernment. We know the positive effects that this program can provide \nbecause a few States have been using it for more than 10 years. Since \nthe State of Florida started such a program 16 years ago, more than \n20,000 health care volunteers have provided more than $1 billion worth \nof charity care at free clinics, community health and migrant worker \nclinics, and with other indigent clinics to provide health care that \nwould otherwise not be available. This program calls for minimal \nexpense, but it has the potential for a huge return. Eight other States \nhave enacted this program and have had excellent results. But that is \nonly 8 other States. The legislation that I am proposing today \nencourages the remaining 41 States to consider it.\n  Some people would say that the Federal Government has already made \nprovisions for volunteer care with the federal Volunteer Protection Act \nof 1997. This act raises the standard of care from simple negligence to \ngross negligence. This law has two drawbacks however. It makes it more \ndifficult for an injured party to prove substandard care and it leaves \nvolunteer providers responsible for paying the cost of their defense.\n  The bill that I am introducing, the Volunteer Health Care Program Act \nof 2008, would provide grants to States that would accept medical \nliability for volunteer medical providers. These programs would protect \nproviders from liability claims, while also ensuring that injured \npatients could recover damages. This bill addresses both drawbacks of \nthe current Federal volunteer law, it does so at a minimal cost to \nFederal and state governments, and it has a proven record of working. \nThe passage of this bill will take us one step closer to ensuring \naccess to quality health care for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to provide grants to States \n     to--\n       (1) promote access to quality health and dental care for \n     the medically underserved and uninsured through the \n     commitment of volunteers; and\n       (2) encourage and enable healthcare providers to provide \n     health services to eligible individuals by providing \n     sovereign immunity protection for the provision of \n     uncompensated services.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to increase the availability of domestically \nmanufactured passenger cars for intercity passenger rail service, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nhelp us replace and rehab our aging passenger rail equipment and revive \nthe passenger rail rolling stock manufacturing industry in the United \nStates.\n  We are currently witnessing fundamental changes to our economy and \nour national transportation system driven by the rising price of oil. \nHigh gas prices have caused hardship for millions of American families \nand are having a deeply negative impact on the Nation's economy. The \naviation industry has been nearly crippled by the rising price of jet \nfuel and has announced it will be cutting over 30,000 jobs, mothballing \nalmost 1,000 aircraft and leaving 100 communities across the country \nwithout any commercial air service.\n  As these trends continue, the demand for an efficient, cost-effective \nand reliable alternative travel mode increases. Aviation downsizing and \nthe high cost of driving have propelled passenger rail ridership and \nrevenue to record breaking levels, especially in Illinois. Ridership on \nthe Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg routes jumped 41.4 percent in \nfiscal 2007, compared to fiscal 2006. Ridership on all Illinois state-\nsubsidized routes added an additional 181,000 passengers during the \nfirst \\2/3\\ of fiscal year 2008, bringing the State's ridership to \n670,000 for the year. Across the country, Amtrak's ridership has grown \nby 12 percent and continues to rise.\n  These numbers suggest we are experiencing a passenger rail \nrenaissance. However, this upward trend will only continue to a point. \nUnless we act--and act soon--we may not be able to capitalize on this \nmoment in time and finally make passenger train travel a mainstay of \nAmerican life, much like elsewhere in the industrialized world.\n  My bill addresses the most immediate obstacle to making this a \nreality--the lack of passenger rail train cars and equipment. Amtrak's \nexisting fleet of rail cars is old and in desperate need of repair. \nAmtrak estimates it will only be able to have an additional five \ntrains--all of which are 30 years old or older--rehabbed and ready for \nservice this holiday season.\n  We need to re-fleet the aging, broken-down rolling stock that our \npassenger rail system has been barely getting by with. This bill \nprovides a menu of financing options to bring our existing fleet into a \nstate of good repair and build the next generation of trainsets here at \nhome.\n  Domestic railcar giants like the Pullman and Budd Companies provided \na strong manufacturing base for over 100 years, providing rail cars \nthat are still on the tracks today. But those companies have long since \nclosed their doors and have left the business of making passenger rail \ncars due to years of underinvestment in the United States and increased \ninvestment by European countries.\n  The Train CARS Act provides funding that will allow us to immediately \nengage manufacturers currently making trainsets overseas and encourage \nthem to bring their modern design and manufacturing expertise to the \nU.S. and open rail car manufacturing facilities here to meet our \ngrowing demand. Second, the bill provides a tax incentive for private, \ndomestic businesses to reenter the passenger rail equipment business \nand rebuild facilities and train cars here in the U.S.\n  We also need to recognize the critical role that States play in \nboosting rail ridership numbers. Illinois has recognized the need to \nincrease intercity rail service and doubled its funding from $12 \nmillion to $24 million annually. This funding has allowed for greater \nfrequencies along Illinois' corridor routes, but we have hit a wall--\nthere are no trainsets to add capacity to handle the growing ridership.\n  My bill will reward those States that are able to raise revenue for \nroutes by matching, dollar-for-dollar, their contributions for \nadditional rolling stock. These are investments well spent. Amtrak is \n18 percent more efficient than commercial airlines on a passenger-mile \nbasis, according to the Department of Energy. Passenger rail engines \nuse electrical propulsion and diesel fuel combinations which are less \nsusceptible to swings in crude prices than jet fuel. With each dollar \nspent on intercity rail, we take cars off our roads and lessen \ncongestion on our highways, while at the same time increasing economic \nactivity along rail routes.\n  Lastly, we need to deal with fundamental changes in our \ntransportation system that are on the horizon. We need a twenty-first \ncentury rail system that makes flying short distances a thing of the \npast. To make this possible we will have to explore building a high-\nspeed rail network rooted in major metropolitan areas like Chicago. \nElectrifying these trains and giving the tracks a dedicated right-of-\nway will allow us to achieve speeds of 200 mph, without ever burning a \ndrop of oil. This bill includes a provision to explore what types of \ninvestment we will need to make that a reality.\n  As we get closer to the debate of the next surface transportation \nbill, we stand at a crossroads of a new era for rail service in the \nUnited States. Communities are increasingly vocal about their demands \nfor cheaper, cleaner transportation options, and intercity rail service \nis an integral component of meeting those needs. We need to take this \nopportunity and revive a dormant passenger rail industry that once \noffered high-paying jobs to thousands of workers and could easily do so \nagain. Waking this sleeping giant will allow us to lay the ground work \nfor a transportation system that will be the backbone of the 21st \ncentury economy; one that is fast, efficient, and oil independent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize and improve the SBIR and STTR \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the SBIR/STTR \nReauthorization Act of 2008. This bill reauthorizes the Small Business \nInnovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs for \n14 years each and makes several improvements to the programs that will \nallow them to work better for small business, while continuing to make \nan important contribution to our country's innovation economy.\n  When the SBIR program was originally conceived in the late 1970s and \nearly 80s, it was in response to serious concerns that the United \nStates was falling behind its competitors in the global economy because \nof a failure to innovate. At that time, as remains the case today, the \nlion's share of our federal research and development budget was going \nto large businesses and to universities that, while doing important \nwork, simply were not doing the type of high-risk, high-reward research \nthat drives innovation and keeps us on the technological cutting edge. \nIt was found that small businesses were fastest and most effective not \nonly at generating new technologies but at doing so in cost-effective \nways; however, they were receiving a disproportionately low share of \nFederal R dollars, as also remains the case today. The SBIR program, \ntherefore, was designed in 1982 to harness the innovative capacity of \nAmerica's small businesses to meet the needs of our federal agencies \nand to help grow small, high-tech firms that, in turn, grow local \neconomies all across the Nation. The STTR program was originally \ncreated as a pilot program in 1992 to stimulate partnerships between \nsmall businesses and non-profit research institutions, such as \nuniversities.\n  Today, our country once again stands at a turning point, and \ncompetition from all across the globe, from Europe to Far East Asia, \nmakes it more important than ever that we continue to innovate and to \npush the boundaries in sectors across the whole range of the spectrum, \nfrom defense technologies to energy efficiency to biotechnology. This \nbill ensures that small businesses can be confident that the SBIR and \nSTTR programs will be there for them years down the line and that these \nhighly successful programs can continue to help our federal agencies \nmeet their needs and help maintain our role as a world leader in \ninnovations. In order to provide more small businesses with access to \nthe SBIR and STTR programs, the bill increases the allocation for the \nSBIR program and doubles the allocation for the STTR program. This will \nallow for more technologies to be developed through these programs, \ntechnologies such as a machine that uses lasers and computer cameras to \nsort and inspect bullets at a much finer level than the human eye can \nmanage, developed through an SBIR grant by a small business in \nMichigan, a therapeutic drug to treat chronic inflammatory disease, \ndeveloped by a Montana SBIR recipient, and a nerve gas protection \nsystem, developed by an SBIR company in Massachusetts. This is not to \nmention the tangible benefit that these additional dollars for the SBIR \nand STTR programs will have in the way of business growth, job \ncreation, and economic development, since, according to the National \nAcademy of Sciences, more than one in ten SBIR award recipients start \ntheir company simply because of their having received an award.\n  Our committee has a long history of working together in a bipartisan \nway to pass legislation, and I am pleased to have worked closely with \nmy ranking member, Senator Snowe, on this bill. I am also pleased that \nwe have been able to incorporate provisions to address the priorities \nof a number of other Senators on the committee, including language from \nSenator Lieberman to address the National Academies' concerns about the \nlack of data and evaluation at NIH and to encourage innovation at NIH \nto accelerate the development of treatments and cures, language from \nSenator Landrieu regarding the FAST program to increase the \nparticipation of rural small businesses by making the matching \nrequirement from rural states more affordable, a provision from Senator \nColeman that creates a pilot program to encourage innovative small \nbusinesses to provide opportunities to college students studying \nscience, technology, engineering, and math, and a provision from \nSenator Cardin to clarify that small businesses with Cooperative \nResearch and Development Agreement, CRADA, with Federal labs can still \nparticipate in the SBIR program.\n  I want to thank all those involved for their hard work on this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill when it comes \nbefore the full Senate.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today with Senator Kerry to \nintroduce the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2008. This measure is \ntruly bipartisan in scope, and is the product of 9 months of \nnegotiation. I am pleased that we have come to an agreement on a \npackage that will further strengthen these programs--making them even \nmore beneficial to small businesses.\n  This bill would reauthorize the crucial Small Business Innovation \nResearch, SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, \nprograms--which were last reauthorized in 2000. The SBIR and STTR \nprograms award Federal research and development funds to small \nbusinesses to encourage them to innovate and commercialize new \ntechnologies, products, and services. These programs provide more than \n$2 billion in Federal research and development funding each year to \nsmall businesses, and the benefit to my State of Maine cannot be \noverstated. According to the most recent data, in fiscal year 2005, \nMaine's technology-based small businesses received more than $4.5 \nmillion in SBIR total awards. We simply cannot and must not allow these \nprograms to expire at the end of this coming September.\n  The legislation before us today which would provide key improvements \nto the SBIR and STTR programs are based on a comprehensive SBA \nReauthorization bill that I introduced last Congress when I served as \nchair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \nThis Congress, our committee has held two roundtables, with Federal \nagency heads and key interested stakeholders, in developing this \nmeasure. Specifically, our bill would increase the size of Phase I \nprogram awards from $100,000 to $150,000, and Phase II awards from \n$750,000 to $1 million. It would also tie future award increases to \ninflation. These pivotal reforms represent a well-spring of \nindispensable technological-fuel to the small business engines that \ndrive our Nation's innovation.\n\n  Since the SBIR program was created, small hi-tech firms have \nsubmitted more than 250,000 proposals, resulting in more than 60,000 \nawards worth approximately $19 billion. By doubling the percentage of \nFederal research and development dollars that the STTR program receives \neach year, and increasing the SBIR percentage by 1 percent over 10 \nyears, we will infuse another $1 billion into the small business \neconomy. At a time when our national economy is flagging due to \nskyrocketing energy prices and a correcting housing market, the SBIR \nprogram is more essential then ever, if we are to capitalize on the \ngroundbreaking capacities of Nation's pioneering small businesses.\n  While innovation in areas such as genomics, biotechnology, and \nnanotechnology present new opportunities, converting these ideas into \nmarketable products involves substantial funding challenges. Many small \nbusinesses simply cannot afford the exorbitant cost of developing and \nbringing a product into the marketplace. In order to confront this \nchallenge, our legislation offers a compromise solution to the venture \ncapital or ``VC'' issue that has recently divided members of this \ncommittee and the SBIR community.\n  This bill would allow limited involvement by majority-owned venture \ncapital firms in the SBIR program which could receive only a maximum 18 \npercent of SBIR funding at the National Institutes of Health and 8 \npercent at all other qualifying agencies. These percentages correspond \nto the most recent Government Accountability Office data regarding VC \ninvestment in the SBIR program. Additionally, we leave in place well-\nestablished SBA rules designed to limit participation in the SBIR \nprogram to small businesses.\n  Other key provisions in this vital legislation include the \nreauthorization and enhancement of my SBIR Defense\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\nCommercialization Pilot Program. Senator Kerry and I created this \nprogram in 108th Congress to encourage the award of contracts to SBIR \nfirms. The bill also includes a provision to reauthorize and increase \nfunding to the Federal and State Partnership, FAST, program which would \nallow each state--including Maine--to receive funding in the form of a \ngrant to make available an array of services in support of the SBIR \nprogram.\n  Now, more than ever, we in Congress must do everything within our \npower to help small businesses drive the recovery of our economy. It is \nimperative that we reauthorize the SBIR and STTR programs, particularly \nbefore the program terminates at the end of this fiscal year--fewer \nthan 2 months away. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to pass this vital measure in the full Senate, \nand then negotiating with the House Small Business Committee, so that \nthe President can sign this package into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7638-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 629--HONORING THE LIFE OF, AND EXPRESSING THE \n     CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE ON THE PASSING OF, BRONISLAW GEREMEK\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Biden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a resolution honoring \nthe life of Bronislaw Geremek and expressing the condolences of the \nSenate on his death. I am pleased that Senator Biden has agreed to \ncosponsor this important resolution.\n  Minister Geremek was a freedom fighter and a former Foreign Minister \nof Poland. He began his fight for freedom at age seven when he escaped \nthe Warsaw Ghetto and successfully hid from the Nazis through the end \nof World War II.\n  Minister Geremek went on to become a professor of history and \nreceived honorary degrees from such prestigious institutions as the \nSorbonne and Columbia University. In the 1970s, he joined the Gdansk \nworkers' protest movement in Soviet-controlled Poland. With unwavering \nconviction, he became a leader of the independent trade union \n``Solidarity'' and helped usher in a new era that led to the fall of \nthe Soviet Union. His efforts gave hope to many across Eastern Europe \nand around the world struggling against tyranny and oppression. While \nhe guided his nation towards democracy in Eastern Europe, the \npolitical, social, and economic ramifications of his efforts were felt \nacross the world.\n  On July 13, 2008, this statesman who helped vanquish communism in \nEurope unexpectedly passed away.

JOHNSON, THAT THE ADMINISTRATOR SHOULD \n  RESIGN HIS POSITION IMMEDIATELY, AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \n  SHOULD OPEN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE VERACITY OF HIS CONGRESSIONAL \n   TESTIMONY REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA WAIVER DECISION AND PURSUE ANY \n     PROSECUTORIAL ACTION THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES TO BE WARRANTED\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. \nKlobuchar, and Mr. Sanders) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 631\n\n       Whereas, for most of its nearly 4-decade history, people of \n     the United States could look to the Environmental Protection \n     Agency for independent leadership, grounded in science and \n     the rule of law, with a sole mission to protect our health \n     and our environment;\n       Whereas, since Stephen L. Johnson was sworn in as \n     Administrator, the Environmental Protection Agency has failed \n     to carry out its mission, and has issued decision after \n     decision that fails to adequately protect public health and \n     the environment;\n       Whereas, on the issue of pollution from ozone, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency under Administrator Johnson \n     rejected the recommendations of agency scientists, public \n     health officials, and the agency's own scientific advisory \n     committees, and instead established an ozone standard that \n     fails to protect the public, especially children and the \n     elderly, from the harmful effects of ozone pollution, such as \n     lung disease and asthma;\n       Whereas, on the issue of pollution from soot, known as \n     ``particulate matter'', Administrator Johnson bowed to \n     pressure from industry and failed to strengthen an outdated \n     standard limiting the annual average levels of soot \n     pollution, despite calls from the agency's own scientific \n     advisory committees and health and medical experts to \n     strengthen that standard to protect public health;\n       Whereas, on the issue of pollution from lead, Administrator \n     Johnson failed to heed the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     own scientists and proposed a standard that would leave \n     children in harm's way;\n       Whereas, on the issue of the Toxic Release Inventory, the \n     Agency's decision to weaken the community right-to-know rules \n     for toxic chemicals used and released in communities across \n     the country will quadruple the quantity of toxic pollutants \n     that companies can release before the companies are required \n     to provide to the public detailed information about the \n     releases;\n       Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency went forward \n     with those changes to the Toxic Release Inventory despite \n     objections from 23 State agencies and attorneys general, and \n     despite concerns raised by the Agency's own science advisory \n     board;\n       Whereas, on the issue of the toxin perchlorate, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a rule revoking \n     the requirement for testing of tap water for perchlorate, a \n     contaminant that has been found in the drinking water of \n     millions of people in 35 States, and which interferes with \n     the thyroid and is especially risky to pregnant women and \n     newborns, and as a result, people in the United States will \n     lack up-to-date information on whether their tap water is \n     contaminated with that toxin;\n       Whereas, on the issue of vehicle tailpipe emissions, \n     Administrator Johnson denied a waiver that would have allowed \n     California and up to 18 other States to enact strict \n     restrictions on global warming pollution from automobiles, \n     despite the reportedly unanimous recommendations of his \n     professional staff in favor of granting the waiver at least \n     in part, and finding that denying it would very likely be \n     successfully challenged in court;\n       Whereas, on the issue of global warming pollution, in \n     defiance of the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. \n     E.P.A. (549 U.S. 497), Administrator Johnson has failed to \n     take action after the Court's ruling that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency has the authority, under the Clean Air Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), to regulate greenhouse gas \n     emissions that pollute our air, instead bowing to pressures \n     from the Bush White House to punt the issue to the next \n     administration;\n       Whereas, under Administrator Johnson, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency has offered legal arguments for its \n     insufficient standards that have provoked ridicule by the \n     courts, which, for example, have accused the agency of \n     employing the ``logic of the Queen of Hearts'' and living in \n     ``a Humpty-Dumpty'' world in attempting to evade the intent \n     of Congress and the clear meaning of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);\n       Whereas, Administrator Johnson has allowed the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's scientific advisory panels \n     to be infiltrated by the very industries they are meant to \n     regulate and control, while at the same time removing from \n     those panels without justification qualified scientists who \n     opposed industry positions;\n       Whereas a report issued on April 23, 2008, by the Union of \n     Concerned Scientists, entitled ``Interference at the EPA'', \n     uncovered widespread political influence in the Environmental \n     Protection Agency decisions, noting, for example, that 60 \n     percent of the Environmental Protection Agency career \n     scientists surveyed had personally experienced at least 1 \n     incident of political interference during the past 5 years;\n       Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency under \n     Administrator Johnson has altered administrative procedures \n     of the agency to allow the White House Office of Management \n     and Budget and Pentagon secret influence over agency \n     decisionmaking, such as through the Integrated Risk \n     Information System process, an action which the Government \n     Accountability Office has found to be ``inconsistent with the \n     principle of sound science that relies on, among other \n     things, transparency'';\n       Whereas Administrator Johnson's response to widespread \n     criticism that his agency is in crisis, and that he allows \n     White House political operatives and polluting industries to \n     dictate his decisions rather than the law and science, has \n     been to label those who have raised those concerns, many of \n     whom are dedicated career employees of his agency, as \n     ``yammering critics'';\n       Whereas, in defiance of his charge under the Constitution \n     of the United States, Administrator Johnson has personally \n     and repeatedly refused to cooperate with Congress in its \n     efforts to conduct regular oversight of the Executive branch, \n     refusing to produce documents as part of legitimate oversight \n     investigations, refusing to appear before committees of \n     Congress, and, when he has appeared, refusing to answer \n     questions in a forthright manner;\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\n       Whereas there is strong evidence to believe that \n     Administrator Johnson, at a minimum, provided misleading and \n     intentionally incomplete statements to congressional \n     committees regarding the California waiver issue and, at \n     worst, has given false testimony before those committees;\n       Whereas, for example, Administrator Johnson on numerous \n     occasions testified before the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works of the Senate that he based his denial of the \n     California waiver request on California's failure to meet the \n     ``compelling and extraordinary'' circumstances criterion \n     under section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7543(b)), and that he reached this decision independently;\n       Whereas, testimony by a former senior Environmental \n     Protection Agency official, Jason Burnett, reveals that in \n     fact Administrator Johnson had determined that California met \n     the requirements for a waiver under that Act and had \n     communicated his plan to partially grant the waiver to the \n     Administration in a meeting at the White House, only to \n     reverse course and deny the waiver after White House \n     officials ``clearly articulated'' President Bush's ``policy \n     preference'' for a single regulatory system, even though the \n     Clean Air Act clearly contemplates a dual system in cases in \n     which the statutory criteria for the waiver are met;\n       Whereas Mr. Burnett's testimony was that Administrator \n     Johnson was prepared to grant the California waiver until it \n     was ``clearly articulated'' to him that the President \n     preferred a different approach;\n       Whereas Administrator Johnson's sworn testimony before the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate \n     appears to have been designed to mislead Congress and the \n     people of the United States regarding the extent to which the \n     White House intervened in the decision to deny the California \n     waiver, despite the conclusion of career staff at the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and evidently of the \n     Administrator himself, that the statutory criteria for \n     granting the waiver under the Clean Air Act had been met; and\n       Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency is an agency in \n     crisis and is in need of leadership dedicated to tackling the \n     enormous public health and environmental issues faced by our \n     country and our planet, in an independent manner that \n     comports with science and the law and is immune from \n     political interference: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Senate has lost confidence in the Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency, Stephen L. Johnson;\n       (2) Administrator Johnson should resign his position \n     immediately; and\n       (3) the Department of Justice should open an investigation \n     into the veracity of his congressional testimony regarding \n     the California waiver decision and to pursue any \n     prosecutorial action the Department determines to be \n     warranted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/29/senate-section/article/S7640-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 96--COMMEMORATING IRENA SENDLER, A WOMAN \n  WHOSE BRAVERY SAVED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS DURING THE HOLOCAUST AND \n       REMEMBERING HER LEGACY OF COURAGE, SELFLESSNESS, AND HOPE.\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mr. Obama (for himself and Mr. Specter)) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on the\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\nFree Flow of Information Act, which is the reporters' privilege \nlegislation. At the outset, I thank the cosponsors, Senators Schumer, \nLugar, Dodd, and Graham. I especially thank Senator Lugar for his \ncontribution to this legislation, because he was the first to take a \nstand for this issue some time ago.\n  This legislation is very important to maintain the flow of \ninformation to the American people from the newspapers and radio and \ntelevision stations. It is necessary because we have seen in recent \ntimes a flurry of subpoenas being issued to reporters to disclose their \nconfidential sources. A reporter's source of information depends upon \ntheir being able to fulfill a commitment of confidentiality. It is \nunnecessary to recite the long history of the investigative reporting \nwhich has provided so much good to the American people or, for that \nmatter, the people of the world. We have had reporters ferret out \ncorruption in government, misfeasance, and wrongdoing. Senators turn \nthe first part of every day to the newspapers to see what is occurring \nin the world. Frequently in the mix of the news, there are \ninvestigative reports which tell Senators more than even our staffs \nknow. I believe Thomas Jefferson put it best in the founding days of \nthe Republic, when he said that if he had to choose newspapers without \ngovernment or government without newspapers, he would choose newspapers \nwithout government.\n  This legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee by the \ndecisive vote of 15 to 4. A version passed the House of Representatives \nby an overwhelming margin of 398 to 21. It is worth noting that both of \nthe presumptive candidates for President are supportive of this \nlegislation. Senator Obama is a cosponsor, and Senator McCain has \npublicly confirmed that he would vote for this legislation. A group of \nsome 40 sitting State attorneys general, including both Democrats and \nRepublicans, have written in support of this legislation. More than 100 \nnewspapers from all parts of the country have endorsed this \nlegislation, including the Washington Post, the Washington Times, the \nNew York Times, and the Philadelphia Inquirer. I will make a part of \nthe Record a full list of those newspapers and public media operations \nin support of this legislation.\n  There have been some 72 subpoenas issued since 2006. The chilling \neffect has been overwhelming, in part because of the issuance of \nsubpoenas and contempt citations. For example, the case of Judith \nMiller of the New York Times has received extensive publicity. She was \njailed for around 85 days for failing to disclose the source of \ninformation she had in the case involving the outing of CIA agent \nValerie Plame. It has always been a mystery to me why Judith Miller was \nheld in contempt, when it was known that Deputy Secretary of State \nArmitage was the source of the information. But a special prosecutor \nsubpoenaed numerous witnesses and conducted a very high profile \npublicity investigation. Ultimately, Judith Miller spent 85 days in \njail under very unpleasant circumstances. I can personally attest to \nthe conditions because Michael O'Neal, my chief counsel when I chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I visited her in the Virginia prison where \nshe was detained. The legislation which we are proposing is necessary \nto maintain the flow of information.\n  I think it is vital to emphasize that this legislation benefits the \nAmerican people, allowing them access to the news and information that \nresults from investigative reporting. Investigative reporting has done \nso much for the public welfare in disclosing fraud, corruption, \nmisfeasance, and wrongdoing at all levels of the Government, as well as \nat all levels of private, corporate, and public life.\n  This issue and the vote which is imminent pose a problem for this \nSenator because of the practice which has evolved to preclude \namendments from being offered. We are only facing tomorrow the motion \nfor cloture on the motion to proceed. I do think we ought to proceed to \nthis bill. It is my hope that the majority leader will not act to \npreclude other Senators from offering amendments. This is a subject I \nhave addressed at considerable length on the global warming bill. I \nhave talked about it on the FAA bill. I have discussed it with the oil \nspeculators bill. It is a matter of great concern as to what has \nhappened to the operation of the Senate.\n\n  When I came to this world's greatest deliberative body some 28 years \nago, the tradition of the Senate had been maintained that any Senator \ncould offer virtually any amendment on any bill at any time. That was \nthe great unique quality of the Senate and the ability of any Senator \nto offer an amendment to call public attention to an important issue, \nto have the floor of the Senate to publicize the issue and to move for \nthe enactment of legislation. But what has happened, surprisingly only \nin the last 15 years--and it has happened by majority leaders of both \nparties--is that a procedure has been adopted on what is called filling \nthe tree. That is an arcane expression, known only inside the Beltway. \nBut let me explain it.\n  When a bill is on the agenda, it is the prerogative of the majority \nleader to call for action of the Senate. Then the majority leader, \nunder Senate practice and custom, has the right of first recognition. \nSo that the rule that the first Senator to ask for recognition gets the \nrecognition is true, unless the majority leader has sought recognition. \nOn cases of a tie, it is the majority leader. As a matter of practice, \nnobody challenges the majority leader's right to first recognition. So \nafter the bill is before the Senate, the majority leader then offers an \namendment. Then he offers another amendment. Without going into all of \nthe details, a procedure is adopted where no other Senator can offer an \namendment.\n  What has happened on global warming, for example, where I came to the \nfloor and outlined four amendments which I intended to offer on a very \nimportant bill, I was precluded from offering them, because the Senate \nmajority leader had taken action to put this procedure in effect on so-\ncalled filling the tree. The FAA bill came up, which had funding for a \nnew satellite system for air safety. I had amendments to offer, very \nimportant for my State, on overflights from the Philadelphia \nInternational Airport and for scheduling issues, where the airport was \noverscheduled, leading to long delays; people, myself included, sitting \non the tarmac waiting to take off.\n  The tearing that I undertake is a result, for those who see me wiping \nmy eyes, not for any sorrow about what I am doing but a consequence of \nhaving Hodgkin's. It makes a fellow pale and thin. Tough but tolerable, \nas I put it, and I have been able to stay on the job. But if anybody is \nwatching on C-SPAN 2, which is highly doubtful, they may wonder why I \nam tearing. I am not crying. I am tearing because of the impact of all \nof the chemicals from the treatment of Hodgkin's.\n  At any rate, I was commenting about the Philadelphia airport. This \naffects the State of New Jersey. The Presiding Officer is a Senator \nfrom the State of New Jersey. You sit on the tarmac at the Philadelphia \nairport for a long time because they are overbooked. It is like a \nrestaurant that has 100 seats and they put in 150 patrons. Well, you \ncan't get your table on a reservation. You have a flight leaving at 7 \na.m. You wait until many other planes have left. Or when you land, the \nairport is overbooked, and it is not a very pleasant sensation to \ncircle the city of Philadelphia for a long period of time in the fog \nand in the rain, wondering how good those air controllers are. They are \npretty good, but it is something you wonder about in any event.\n  We weren't able to offer amendments on the FAA bill. We haven't been \nable to offer amendments on the oil speculators bill. The headlines in \nthe newspapers over the weekend were: Republicans block oil speculators \nbill. They recited the Senators from the Philadelphia region, and they \nnoted that the distinguished Senator who is presiding now, Senator \nMenendez, voted in favor of advancing the bill, as did Senator \nLautenberg, as did Senator Casey, as did Senator Carper, as did Senator \nBiden. Only Arlen Specter voted not to advance the bill. You don't get \nthe picture in a short story. You don't get the picture in the \nrecitation of the vote that I voted against cloture because neither I \nnor any other Senator had the opportunity to offer amendments. So that \nif we get to that point, I am conflicted as to what to do. But I don't \nthink we will face that tomorrow with the motion to proceed. I am \nhopeful we will pass that by a very substantial majority.\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\n  There have been opponents who have come to the floor to debate this \nbill. It is important to note that as a result of the hearings which \nwere held when I was chairman, Senator Kyl stated there have been no \nhearings on this bill in the 110th Congress. Well, when I chaired the \nJudiciary Committee in the 109th Congress in 2005 and 2006, we had \nthree hearings on the subject and went into the issue in some detail. \nSenator Kyl said the Government could not get information to \ninvestigate an act of terrorism. That is not so. The bill states \nspecifically that it is reasonably likely to stop, prevent, or mitigate \nany, or identify the perpetrator of an act of international terrorism \nor domestic terrorism, there will be no shield.\n  Those who have raised objections to the bill have been taken into \naccount. The bill has been substantially improved.\n  For example, the bill now explicitly states that sensitive \ngovernmental information will not be disclosed in open court. The \nprovisions have always been subjected to the Classified Information \nProtection Act. It had always been available to prosecutors. But when \nthe concern was raised, we put in the specific provision that a \n``Federal court may receive and consider submissions from the parties \nin camera or under seal, and where the court determines appropriate, ex \nparte'' in order to protect sensitive information.\n  The bill further provides that the definition of a covered person has \nbeen narrowed to ensure it protects only legitimate journalists. The \ndefinition of the Second Circuit has been adopted. That definition has \nworked very well. It requires that the individual have the intent to \ndistribute the information to the public and that he or she had such \nintent at the time that he or she gathered the information.\n  The provision also provides that even if terrorists pose as \njournalists, they do not qualify for the act's protections. The \nmodifications create an expedited appeals process, ensuring that \nlitigation regarding whether the privilege applies will be quickly \nresolved.\n  This is motivated by the case involving USA Today reporter, Tony \nLoci, who was held in contempt of court and fined $5,000 a day. The \njudge entered an order that her employer or friends and relatives could \nnot pay it. Fortunately for Tony Loci, that case was settled so the \ncontempt citation did not stand.\n  Numerous journalists across the country have seen what happened to \nTony Loci and Judith Miller. It has had a very chilling effect on their \nactivities. People who might give sensitive information under the \npromises of confidentiality are reluctant to share that information.\n  Also, under the revisions, prosecutors will not have to prove they \nhave exhausted all other options for finding the information or the \ninformation is essential to their investigation.\n  So what we have, in essence, is very important legislation. It is \nvery important to the functioning of the democracy that there be a free \npress to report to the American people what has happened, especially on \ninvestigative reporting. You cannot have a free press if a reporter \ncannot obtain information from a confidential source, promise \nconfidentiality, and then deliver. And you cannot have a free press if \npeople such as Tony Loci and Judith Miller are subjected to contempt \ncitations--large fines with Tony Loci, actual imprisonment with Judith \nMiller of some 85 days.\n  So this bill is long past due. I am glad to see it brought to the \nfloor. I am hopeful the majority leader will not pursue a course of \nfilling the tree to preclude amendments. I am hopeful we can return to \nthe day when the Senate regains its luster as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, which means that any 1 of the other 99 Senators can \noffer amendments, and that it is not just the one Senator, the senior \nSenator from Nevada, who has the position of majority leader, who can, \nin effect, dictate what happens in the Senate.\n  Yesterday, we had a heated exchange on the floor. When we finished \nvoting on the cloture motion, the majority leader refused to allow a \nquorum call to be taken off. If anyone may be watching on C-SPAN, a \nquorum call is when there is the absence of a quorum. There are \nfrequent quorum calls when no one seeks recognition. But it is a \nrelatively infrequent occurrence that there is quorum. A quorum means \n51 or more Senators. Right now, we are 50 Senators short of a quorum. \nMost of the time, you only have a few Senators on the floor who may be \nspeaking--three or four. When there are votes, there are many Senators \non the floor.\n  But it is a relatively rare occurrence that a quorum is present. So \nif someone suggests there is an absence of a quorum, there is a quorum \ncall. And a quorum call cannot be taken off except by unanimous consent \nor to have a live quorum or to have a motion for the attendance of \nabsent Senators.\n  But, invariably, when there is a quorum call and someone asks \nunanimous consent--or virtually invariably--it is granted unless \nsomebody wants to hold up an action on something that is pending. But I \nhave not seen, in my tenure in the Senate, a denial of an application \nto eliminate the quorum call so speeches can be made.\n  I and other Senators were waiting for more than an hour. And in \nconjunction with what the majority leader has done on filling the tree \nin denying 99 other Senators--mostly minority Senators--the right to \noffer amendments and refusing to allow the quorum to be lifted, I used \nthe word ``tyrannical,'' and I stand by that.\n  This body is a great body and has earned great prestige worldwide and \nI think has earned the stature of the world's greatest deliberative \nbody because of the ability of Senators to offer amendments and the \nability of Senators to speak. To be on this floor in a quorum call and \nto be denied an opportunity to speak is not quite a denial of my first-\namendment rights. I can go to the Radio and TV Gallery and call a news \nconference or walk out and talk to reporters or go on the steps. But \nhaving been elected to the Senate, and having a commission to serve \nhere, when no one is on the floor speaking, and there is no reason why \nI ought to be denied an opportunity to speak except for the \ntechnicality of a quorum call, I take umbrage at it. It is just one \nindication of how we have to go back to the--well, you might call them \nthe old days. Maybe they were good old days, where the Senate \nfunctioned with every Senator being able to offer amendments.\n  A critical part of the functioning of our Government, I suggest, is \nthe ability of the free press to function and reporters to get \nconfidential information, to be able to promise confidentiality and to \nbe able to deliver without being fearful of being held in contempt of \ncourt and being put in jail.\n  Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of a substitute be printed in the Record, which \ncontains the modifications referred to in the course of my oral \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Free Flow of Information Act \n     of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COVERED PERSONS.\n\n       (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--In any proceeding \n     or in connection with any issue arising under Federal law, a \n     Federal entity may not compel a covered person to comply with \n     a subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process \n     seeking to compel the production of protected information, \n     unless a Federal court in the jurisdiction in which the \n     subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process has \n     been or would be issued determines, by a preponderance of the \n     evidence, after providing notice and an opportunity to be \n     heard to such covered person--\n       (1) that the party seeking to compel production of such \n     protected information has exhausted all reasonably known \n     alternative sources of the protected information; and\n       (2) that--\n       (A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution--\n       (i) there are reasonable grounds to believe, based on \n     information obtained from a source other than the covered \n     person, that a crime has occurred;\n       (ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe, based on \n     information obtained from a source other than the covered \n     person, that the protected information sought is essential to \n     the investigation or prosecution or to the defense against \n     the prosecution; and\n       (iii) nondisclosure of the information would be contrary to \n     the public interest, taking into account both the interest in \n     compelling disclosure (including the extent of any harm to \n     national security) and the public interest in gathering and \n     disseminating the information or news conveyed and \n     maintaining the free flow of information; or\n       (B) in a matter other than a criminal investigation or \n     prosecution--\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\n       (i) based on information obtained from a source other than \n     the covered person, the protected information sought is \n     essential to the resolution of the matter; and\n       (ii) the interest in disclosure clearly outweighs the \n     public interest in gathering and disseminating the \n     information or news conveyed and maintaining the free flow of \n     information.\n       (b) Limitations on Demand for Protected Information.--A \n     subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process \n     seeking protected information that is compelled under \n     subsection (a) shall, to the extent possible be narrowly \n     tailored in purpose, subject matter, and period of time \n     covered so as to avoid compelling production of peripheral, \n     nonessential, or speculative information.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXCEPTION RELATING TO EYEWITNESS OBSERVATION OR \n                   CRIMINAL OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT BY THE COVERED \n                   PERSON.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2 shall not apply to any protected \n     information obtained as the result of the eyewitness \n     observations by a covered person of alleged criminal conduct \n     or the commission of alleged criminal or tortious conduct by \n     the covered person, including any physical evidence or visual \n     or audio recording of the observed conduct.\n       (b) Exceptions.--\n       (1) In general.--This section shall not apply, and section \n     2 shall apply, if the alleged criminal or tortious conduct is \n     the act of communicating information to a covered person.\n       (2) Classified information.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), \n     this section shall not apply, and section 5 shall apply, if \n     the alleged criminal or tortious conduct is an unauthorized \n     release of properly classified information.\n\n     SEC. 4.

EXCEPTION TO PREVENT HARM TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY.\n\n       Section 2 shall not apply to any protected information, and \n     a Federal court shall compel the disclosure of such protected \n     information, if the court--\n       (1) finds that the protected information--\n       (A) would assist in stopping or preventing significant and \n     articulable harm to national security; or\n       (B) relates to an unauthorized release of properly \n     classified information that has caused or will cause \n     significant and articulable harm to the national security; \n     and\n       (2) takes into account the balancing of the harm described \n     in paragraph (1) against the public interest in gathering and \n     disseminating the information or news conveyed.\n\n     SEC. 6. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE \n                   PROVIDERS.\n\n       (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--If any document \n     or other information from the account of a person who is \n     known to be, or reasonably likely to be, a covered person is \n     sought from a communications service provider, sections 2 \n     through 5 shall apply in the same manner that such sections \n     apply to any document or information sought from a covered \n     person.\n       (b) Notice and Opportunity Provided to Covered Persons.--A \n     Federal court may compel the disclosure of a document or \n     other information described in subsection (a) only after the \n     covered person from whose account such document or other \n     information is sought has been given--\n       (1) notice of the subpoena, court order, or other \n     compulsory legal process for such document or other \n     information from the communications service provider not \n     later than the time at which such subpoena, court order, or \n     other compulsory legal process is issued to the \n     communications service provider; and\n       (2) an opportunity to be heard by the court.\n       (c) Exception to Notice Requirement.--Upon motion by a \n     Federal entity, notice and opportunity to be heard under \n     subsection (b) may be delayed for not more than 45 days if \n     the court determines that there is substantial basis for \n     believing that such notice would pose a substantial threat to \n     the integrity of a criminal or national security \n     investigation or intelligence gathering, or that exigent \n     circumstances exist. This period may be extended by the court \n     for an additional period of not more than 45 days each time \n     the court makes such a determination.\n\n     SEC. 7. SOURCES AND WORK PRODUCT PRODUCED WITHOUT PROMISE OR \n                   AGREEMENT OF CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall supersede, dilute, or preempt any \n     law or court decision regarding a subpoena, court order, or \n     other compulsory legal process relating to disclosure by a \n     covered person or communications service provider of--\n       (1) information identifying a source who provided \n     information without a promise or agreement of confidentiality \n     made by the covered person; or\n       (2) records or other information, or contents of a \n     communication obtained without a promise or agreement that \n     such records, other information, or contents of a \n     communication would be confidential.\n\n     SEC. 8.
