Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 574, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 574, a bill to \n     express the sense of Congress on Iraq.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to speak again on the \nmishandling of the debate over the Iraq war resolutions. This debate \nhas ramifications which will damage the institution of the Senate and \nlower the morale of our troops.\n  Here is the truth the American people need to know: Republicans in \nthe Senate have not prevented any debate over the war in Iraq. We are \ndebating the war again today. We have debated the war in the past. And \nwe will continue to debate the war in the future. What we have \nprevented is the majority leader dictating to the minority exactly \nwhich resolutions we will vote on. My friends on the other side of the \naisle have misled the American people about this debate.\n  Our Republican leader, my colleague and close friend from Kentucky, \nhas tried to negotiate for more--I repeat--more debate on additional \nresolutions expressing a broad range of viewpoints. This is the U.S. \nSenate. The majority cannot tell the minority we are going to have one \nvote--take it or leave it.\n  And let me be clear: I am not running from a vote on any of these \nresolutions. I don't know one of my Republican colleagues who is afraid \nto cast a vote on any of the proposed resolutions relating to Iraq. I \nhave said repeatedly and I will say it here again today: Nonbinding \nresolutions that question military strategy are not in the best \ninterests of our Nation. They are not in the best interests of the \nSenate. They don't have the effect of law. They only affect our \nsoldiers by sending them mixed signals. But if we must go down that \npath, let's vote. However, the majority leader cannot dictate the terms \nof the vote. If he could, this would be the House of Representatives. \nBut it is not. This is the U.S. Senate. This is a body with rules that \nencourage opposing viewpoints, not stifling debate by the majority \nleader hand-selecting one resolution and forcing the other 99 of us to \nvote on it.\n\n  But here we are. Americans are watching this discussion right now. \nAnd it is not just a debate about Senate floor procedures; this is \nabout how we as Senators should conduct debate when we have troops in \nharm's way. Many Americans oppose our efforts in Iraq. That is their \nright. I respect their convictions. Yet they are misguided, because I \nbelieve the cost of failure in Iraq is too high to leave now. I do not \nwant to have to send American soldiers back to Iraq in a few years to \ndeal with an even tougher situation. I do not want to leave a breeding \nground of terror. But I understand there are many Americans who want \nthis war to end, regardless of the consequences of leaving soon. And no \ndoubt there are some in this body and in the House of Representatives \nwho share that same view.\n  We as a Congress can end this war, but we cannot end it by nonbinding \nresolutions such as the one that passed the House of Representatives \nthis week that the majority leader now wants us to be forced to vote on \nin the Senate. We can end this war through the appropriations process \nby cutting off funds for this war. This is why I am so frustrated by \nthis debate. This is why I am frustrated by many of my friends and \ncolleagues in this great body.\n  Many want to vote on a nonbinding resolution that opposes our \nstrategy in Iraq to show their constituents they oppose the war, yet \nnot make the tougher decision through the appropriations process. I \nknow many of my colleagues who want to vote on this misguided House \nresolution will not--I repeat--not vote to cut off the funding for this \nwar. They just want to have it both ways: they want to support a \nnonbinding measure opposing the war but not actually to stop the war by \nexercising their constitutional right to cut off its funding.\n  We should not vote to cut off the funding of this war. And that is \nthe basic theme of the Gregg resolution on which the majority leader \nwill not allow us to vote. The majority leader will not allow this vote \nbecause he knows it will pass the Senate overwhelmingly. This does not \nmake sense to me or many of my colleagues, and I do not think it makes \nsense to many Americans who have actually followed this debate closely.\n  That is why I will vote again today against moving to the misguided \nHouse-passed resolution without the commitment that we Republicans be \nallowed to offer our own resolution of our own choosing. Our \nresolution, the Gregg resolution, gives support to our troops. Unlike \nthe resolution before us today, it does not send contradictory signals \nto the troops by telling them that on one hand we oppose their mission \nbut on the other hand we support them as soldiers. That is not the \nmessage we need to be sending to our troops at this critical time.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I will vote today to bring up a \nresolution for debate that would disapprove of the President's policy \nof escalation in Iraq.\n  Last November, the American people sent a clear message to their \nrepresentatives in Washington. With their votes, the American people \nsaid they wanted a change in direction with regard to the war in Iraq. \nUnfortunately, the White House--and its defenders in the Senate--has \nignored that will and fought to keep this day from happening for as \nlong as they could.\n  We may fail to get the required number of votes to debate this very \nsimple resolution. And even if we do get enough votes, I realize that \nthis resolution may not force a single change to this country's policy \nin Iraq. I realize that it may not bring the Shiites and Sunnis closer \nto peace, nor will it bring a single soldier home from this war.\n  But for the first time in the 4 years of this long, hard war, \nDemocrats and Republicans can join together to express the will of the \npeople who sent us here.\n  That is why today's vote must be only the beginning, and not the end, \nof a long-overdue debate on how we plan to exit Iraq and refocus our \nefforts on the wider war against terror. If more stalemate and inaction \nfollow this resolution, it truly will be a meaningless gesture. It is \nnow the responsibility of every Member of this body to put forth a plan \nthat offers the best path to peace among the Iraqis so that our brave \nsoldiers can finally come home.\n  Recently, I introduced the Iraq De-Escalation Act of 2007. This plan \nwould not only place a cap on the number of troops in Iraq and stop the \nescalation, it would more importantly begin a phased redeployment of \nU.S. forces with the goal of removing of all U.S. combat forces from \nIraq by March 31, 2008--consistent with the expectations of the \nbipartisan Iraq Study Group that the President has so assiduously \nignored.\n  The redeployment of troops to the United States, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere in the region would begin no later than May 1 of this year, \ntoward the end of the timeframe I first proposed in a speech more than \n2 months ago. In a civil war where no military solution exists, this \nredeployment remains our best leverage to pressure the Iraqi Government \nto achieve the political settlement between its warring factions that \ncan slow the bloodshed and promote stability.\n  My plan allows for a limited number of U.S. troops to remain as basic \nforce protection, to engage in counterterrorism, and to continue the \ntraining of Iraqi security forces.\n  And if the Iraqis are successful in meeting the 13 benchmarks for \nprogress laid out by the Bush administration itself, this plan also \nallows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment, provided \nCongress agrees that the benchmarks have actually been met and that the \nsuspension is in the national security interest of the United States.\n  The U.S. military has performed valiantly and brilliantly in Iraq. \nOur troops have done all that we have asked them to do and more. But no \namount of American soldiers can solve the political differences at the \nheart of somebody else's civil war, nor settle the grievances in the \nhearts of the combatants.\n  It is my firm belief that the responsible course of action for the \nUnited States, for Iraq, and for our troops is to oppose this reckless \nescalation and to pursue a new policy. This policy that I have laid out \nis consistent with what I have advocated for well over a year, with \nmany of the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and \nwith what the American people demanded in the November election.\n  When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and \nassurances, for waiting and patience, is over. Too\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\nmany lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent for us \nto trust the President on another tried and failed policy opposed by \ngenerals and experts, Democrats and Republicans, Americans and many of \nthe Iraqis themselves.\n  It is time for us to fundamentally change our policy.\n  It is time to give Iraqis their country back.\n  And it is time to refocus America's efforts on the challenges we face \nat home and the wider struggle against terror yet to be won.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this vote on cloture to cut off debate \ninvolves a conflict between two important principles: (1) obtain \nfairness for the Senate Republican minority on having our resolutions \nand amendments debated and voted upon, and (2) debating and voting on \nthe approval or rejection of the President's plan to add 21,500 troops \nto the U.S. force in Iraq.\n  At the outset, it must be emphasized that there is unanimity that no \npreceptive action be taken by Congress to exercise our ``power of the \npurse'' to cut off funds that would in any way endanger our troops.\n  In response to the majority leader's use of the Senate rule to ``fill \nthe tree,'' which precludes any Republican alternative resolutions, I \nvoted against cloture to cut off debate on the Levin amendment on \nFebruary 5. The procedure to ``fill the tree'' is contrary to the basic \nSenate practice of allowing Senators to offer amendments or alternative \nresolutions, unlike the House of Representatives, which customarily \nprecludes such latitude.\n  On February 14, I introduced an amendment to rule XXII to stop the \n``filling of the tree,'' citing vociferous objections by Senators Reid, \nDurbin and Dodd to similar Republican action in the 109th Congress when \nRepublicans held a majority.\n  Although it is very important for the minority to exercise its rights \nto stop abusive majority practices, it is my judgment that this must \nyield to the dominant principle of debating and voting on the future of \nU.S. policy in Iraq. Let's move on. We Republicans can exercise our \nrights of retaliation in the immediate future on other majority action \nto reign in such majority abuse.\n  In my view, it is most important that the Senate speak out on Iraq. \nIf we continue to debate whether there should be a debate while the \nHouse of Representatives acts, the Senate will become irrelevant. To \nparaphrase the Roman adage: ``The Senate should not fiddle while Iraq \nBurns.''\n  The American people have a right to know the Senate's judgment on \nthis most important issue of the day, and our constituents have a right \nto know and evaluate the judgment of each Senator.\n  Accordingly, I am voting for cloture to end the debate so we can move \nahead.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, this past week the President of the United \nStates warned of the ``disastrous consequences'' and ``chaos'' which \ncould occur in Iraq if we fail in that country. Once again the \nPresident's statements demonstrate how out of touch he is on this \nissue.\n  Iraq already is in a state of chaos. The American people know it and \nthe Iraqi people know it, most painfully. Unfortunately, we already are \ndealing with the ``disastrous consequences'' of 4 years of this \nadministration's failed policy in Iraq.\n  This chaos became inevitable the day the President invaded Iraq \nwithout a viable plan for winning the peace. And this chaos has been \nfurther compounded by 4 years of consistent failure by this \nadministration.\n  The President's plan to surge forces into Iraq is no different from \nprevious surges, including Operation Together Forward, which only \nresulted in more violence. Despite all of our military strength, the \nUnited States cannot through force alone instill Iraqis with democratic \nvalues or end the sectarian civil war in that country.\n  We have before us this afternoon a very direct, succinct nonbinding \nresolution. The language is unequivocal in expressing opposition to the \nPresident's surge. I am strongly opposed to the ``surge'' and will \ntherefore vote in a favor of this straightforward, simple resolution \nexpressing that opposition.\n  Surely our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can vote on a \nsimple resolution stating whether they support the President's surge.\n  This is a vote on whether you support the President's Iraq war \npolicy, without caveat or qualifier. And if this Chamber is ever \nallowed to get to a vote on this measure, a majority of this body will \nvote aye and therefore be publicly on record against the President's \nproposed policy to put even more of our soldiers in harm's way in \nIraq's civil war.\n  If Congress had wanted to express its opinion on this important \nissue, this vote should have been among the first steps taken back in \nJanuary, immediately after the President announced his intention to \nescalate our military involvement in Iraq.\n  Nearly 5 weeks have passed since that announcement. In those 5 weeks \nwe have heard from experts across the political spectrum explain why \nthe surge won't work and explain that there is no military solution to \nthe conflict in Iraq.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives sent a message to the \nPresident and to the American people with their vote on this resolution \nopposing the surge. And yet the President has unwaveringly declared \nthat he will stay the course. It's full speed ahead in the words of \nVice-President Cheney.\n  We all know that and up-or-down vote on this resolution is not \nenough. Yes, I oppose the President's proposed surge. But I oppose much \nmore than that--I oppose the President's overall strategy in Iraq.\n  So let's be realistic and understand that our pronouncing ourselves \non the measure before us today will do nothing to force the President \nto change course in Iraq.\n  It will do nothing to get our troops out of harms way.\n  It will do nothing to improve the lives of Iraqi civilians.\n  American combat brigades are being asked to carry out a mission that \nis unachievable; namely, to bring an end to Iraq's civil war through \nmilitary force.\n  Only a political solution can salvage Iraq.\n  Regrettably, we are in the fourth year of this conflict, and for some \nreason, this administration is still failing our troops. The \nPresident's proposed surge tactic will send thousands of American G.I.s \ninto a battle with inadequate protection and training and on a mission \nwhich they will be unable to achieve.\n  Last month, Senator Kennedy and I sent a letter to Defense Secretary \nGates demanding that he address reported shortfalls among two combat \nbrigades being deployed as part of the President's proposed surge \nwithout the most up-to-date armored vehicles, vehicles that have been \ndesigned to withstand explosions and provide significantly better \nprotection for our troops.\n  Just this week, media accounts of a classified Defense Department \ninspector general's report cited significant problems in outfitting our \nforces with a variety of vehicle armor to protect troops from IEDS.\n  How much more of this can we allow to stand? How many more of these \nreports should we tolerate until we say enough is enough?\n  The only way to reverse course in Iraq is to demonstrate to the \nPresident that it's no longer business as usual--that this Congress \nwill not continue to support funding for the President's failed \nstrategy, which is needlessly harming our troops and weakening our \nnational security.\n  It is essential that we find a better use for the funds being \nallocated for the President's surge. We need to redirect U.S. funds to \nimmediately begin to redeploy combat forces within and out of Iraq, to \nfocus on counterterrorism and training of Iraqis, to put pressure on \nall of Iraq's leaders--not just the Maliki government--to seek and \nreach necessary and painful political compromises, and to ensure the \nsecurity and political rights of all Iraqis.\n  We must also acknowledge how broken our own military is as a result \nof the Iraq war and redirect a portion of the funds proposed for Iraq \nto restore our own military's readiness.\n  It is time that this Congress moves beyond debating non-binding \nresolutions about the surge. It is time for the Congress to debate how \nmuch longer and under what circumstances we are prepared to support \nfunding for a continued U.S. presence in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\n  That is the debate the American people want to hear, that is the \ndebate our courageous and dedicated troops deserve.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, yesterday, an overwhelming, bipartisan \nmajority in the other body--reflecting the clear will of the American \npeople--voted to oppose President Bush's decision to escalate the U.S. \ntroop presence in Iraq. That vote was preceded by 4 full days of debate \non the resolution. But here in the Senate, the Republican minority \nrefuses to allow us even to bring a resolution to the floor for debate.\n  My office has been flooded with phone calls and e-mails from Iowans. \nThe overwhelming majority of them are upset with the President's \nescalation plan. But they are also upset that the Senate is being \nobstructed. They simply cannot believe that Republican Senators are \nblocking debate on the No. 1 issue before our Nation, the No. 1 concern \non the minds of the American people.\n  In a nutshell, callers are saying that Republican Senators have a \nright to support President Bush's war in Iraq. Republican Senators have \na right to embrace his escalation of that war. But they do not have a \nright to block legitimate debate in the Senate on whether that \nescalation is wise or appropriate. They do not have a right to silence \nthe voices of tens of millions of Americans--an overwhelming majority--\nwho have had enough of the quagmire in Iraq.\n  People in Iowa--and, I suspect, across the country--are saying that \nthe election last November was a referendum on President Bush's war. \nVoters spoke loudly and clearly: They want our troops out of the civil \nwar in Iraq.\n  The American people thought that their elected leaders in Washington \nheard this message. But they realize, now, that the Republicans simply \ndon't care about the results of the election. They are determined to \nescalate the war. They are determined to prevent consideration of any \nresolution expressing disapproval of that escalation.\n  As a coequal branch of Government, Congress has a duty to debate this \nescalation. Out of respect for all our soldiers and Marines in Iraq--to \nkeep faith with them--we as Senators have a duty to ask: Does their \nCommander-in-Chief have a credible plan in Iraq that is worthy of their \nsacrifice? Is the President's plan to escalate in Iraq in the best \ninterest of the United States? Will the additional troops be sent into \ncombat with proper equipment?\n\n  Unfortunately, the answer to those questions--after nearly 4 years of \nincompetence, bungling, and disastrously bad judgment by this \nadministration--is a resounding ``no.''\n  Frankly, the President's plan to escalate is not just deeply \ndisappointing, it is deeply disturbing. I am disturbed because Mr. Bush \nrefuses to learn, and he refuses to listen. The Joint Chiefs of Staff \nunanimously opposed this escalation, as did our generals on the ground \nin Iraq. The Iraq Study Group warned that there cannot be a military \nsolution to the sectarian chaos in Iraq, and said we should begin to \nbring our troops home. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is on record \nas opposing an increase in American troops. Most importantly, the \nAmerican people said loudly and clearly on November 7 that they want \nour soldiers out of the civil war in Iraq.\n  But Mr. Bush refuses to listen to reason. Instead, he seems to listen \nonly to his gut--the same gut that got us into this misguided, \nmisbegotten war in the first place.\n  The President asserts that this latest escalation in Iraq is ``a new \nway forward.'' But what he has proposed is not new, and it is not a way \nforward. It is the same old ``stay the course'' policy--and it will \ndrag us deeper into the Iraqi quagmire.\n  The President has previously ordered three troop surges in Iraq, in \n2004, 2005, and 2006. Just last June, he unveiled ``Operation Forward \nTogether'' to surge troops in Baghdad and secure the capital city. This \noperation was supposed to be led primarily by Iraqis, with U.S. troops \nin support. But the Iraqi forces never showed up.\n  Again and again, we have set goals for the Iraqi leaders. But there \nhave been no deadlines, no accountability, no consequences. And, \npredictably, we have seen no positive results. The Iraqi leaders have \nreneged on their promises to rein in the militias. They have refused to \ncompromise. And they have pursued their sectarian agendas with a \nvengeance.\n  So let's not kid ourselves. The President's latest Iraq plan is just \na repackaging of his old, failed Iraq plans.\n  I am especially concerned about the impact of this escalation on our \ntroops and their families, and on the U.S. military overall. Army \nbrigades are supposed to be in combat for 1 year, and then have 2 years \nback home to retrain and reequip. But they have only been allowed an \naverage of 1 year to regroup. And some brigades are now on their third \ndeployment in Iraq.\n  One reason why the Joint Chiefs opposed this latest escalation is \nbecause of the deep strain on our combat forces. In December, the Army \nchief of staff bluntly warned Congress that the current pace of combat \ndeployment threatens to quote-unquote ``break'' the Army. Meanwhile, we \nlack resources to meet any other contingency, such as a challenge from \nIran or a flare-up on the Korean Peninsula.\n  Some supporters of the President's escalation claim that by debating \nthe President's conduct of the war in Iraq and the merits of his \nescalation plan, we are somehow not supporting the troops.\n  I strongly disagree. I have complete confidence in our men and women \nin uniform in Iraq. They have brilliantly completed the tasks they were \nsent to Iraq to accomplish, and they did so despite a series of \ndisastrous decisions by their civilian leaders in Washington.\n  But as a veteran myself, I am angry at the way these brave men and \nwomen have been misused and mistreated.\n  The President rushed them into combat without proper equipment, and \nin insufficient numbers. He has insisted on ``staying the course'' with \na failed policy for nearly 4 miserable years. He has sent many troops \nback to Iraq for a third and even fourth rotation, with insufficient \ntime to retrain and regroup. Now he insists on sending another 21,500 \ntroops into the middle of a sectarian civil war in Baghdad and \nelsewhere without properly armored Humvees and other essential \nequipment.\n  Yet despite all of these acts of mismanagement and misfeasance--\ndirectly jeopardizing the lives and welfare of our soldiers and \nMarines--the President's supporters have the gall to say that anyone \nwho opposes this latest escalation somehow ``doesn't support the \ntroops.''\n  This would be laughable if it weren't so tragic and deadly. The \nSenate has a duty to debate the proposed troop escalation. We have a \nduty to speak up when we believe the President's policy is wrong, and \nis likely to waste lives. We also have a duty to speak up for the \noverwhelming majority of Americans, who oppose this latest escalation, \nand who consider the entire war to be a tragic mistake.\n  At this point, the single best way to support the troops is to tell \nPresident Bush: Four years of bungling, bad judgment, and \nbullheadedness are enough. We have complete and total confidence in our \ntroops. But we have no confidence in your leadership.\n  During debate in the other body this week, Republicans repeatedly \ncharged that criticism of the President's escalation serves to \n``embolden the enemy.'' And what exactly are these people saying? That \nSenators are supposed to stand silent like potted plants as this \nadministration sinks us even deeper into the Iraqi quagmire?\n  Our enemies have indeed been emboldened. They were emboldened when \nthis administration allowed Bin Laden to escape capture at Tora Bora. \nThey were emboldened when this administration took its eye off the \nterrorists in Afghanistan, and diverted our military and intelligence \nassets to a reckless invasion of Iraq. They were emboldened when \nPresident Bush taunted the insurgents in Iraq to ``bring it on,'' and \nthey successfully did just that. They were emboldened when the \nPresident pledged to get Bin Laden ``dead or alive,'' and failed to do \nso. They were emboldened when the greatest army in the world was \nallowed to get bogged down in a civil war in Iraq and on January 10, \nwhen another 21,500 troops were ordered to deploy to Ground Zero in \nthat civil war.\n\n  Let's be clear: Our enemies have been emboldened by Mr. Bush's \nrepeated, catastrophic mistakes, not by anyone's criticism of those \nmistakes.\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n  The only true way forward in Iraq is to set a timetable for \nredeployment of U.S. forces. Only this will give the Iraqi leaders the \nincentive to resolve their differences and take responsibility for \ntheir own future.\n  As GEN George Casey, our commander in Iraq, told the Senate Armed \nServices Committee: ``Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of \noccupation, contributes to the dependency of Iraqi security forces on \nthe coalition, [and] extends the amount of time that it will take for \nIraqi security forces to become self-reliant.''\n  Mr. Bush has it exactly backward. He has said that as the Iraqis \nstand up, we will stand down. The truth is that the Iraqis will only \nstand up when it is clear that the U.S. troops are leaving.\n  By redeploying our troops to strategic locations elsewhere in the \nMiddle East, we will be able to refocus our efforts to destroy the \nterrorists who attacked us on September 11, 2001, and who continue to \nthreaten us. Redeployment would free up U.S. forces to combat the \nresurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Other troops would be \navailable to help respond to terrorist threats not just in Iraq, but \nalso in Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\n  The proposed troop escalation in Iraq is not a way forward; it is a \nway deeper into a tragic quagmire. This is not in our national \ninterest. It is not in the interest of the long-suffering Iraqi people. \nAnd it is certainly not in the interest of our troops, who will be in \nthe crossfire of a vicious civil war.\n  The conflict in Iraq cannot be solved militarily. It can only be \nsolved through political compromise and reconciliation in Baghdad, and \nthrough aggressive diplomatic engagement with Iraq's neighbors and \nacross the Middle East.\n  It's time for a truly new course in Iraq. And, to that end, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture, and to allow the Senate to debate this \nimportant resolution.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nin opposition be allocated as follows: Senator Hutchison, 5 minutes; \nSenator Lindsey Graham, 10 minutes; Senator Stevens, 10 minutes; \nSenator Craig, 3 minutes; and Senator Gregg, 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nthree speakers in support of cloture be Senator Ben Nelson, then \nSenator Warner, and then myself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, this has been called a very \nunusual occasion for us to come to the floor on a Saturday to vote on a \nresolution or to vote on any matter, but this is a very special \noccasion today because we need to vote up or down on this resolution.\n  I want to make it clear that while it is unusual, I believe it is, in \nfact, necessary. But I want to make it clear also that I support and \nprefer the Warner-Nelson-Collins resolution, which sets forth \nbenchmarks and conditions for staying and requirements for the Iraqi \nGovernment and the Iraqi Prime Minister to meet in connection with \nthat. But this resolution, while it may be more simplistic, still \nexpresses support for the troops, a very strong statement of support \nfor the troops and what they do, funding for the troops, and continuing \nto support their needs. It also states an opposition to the surge plan.\n  The Warner-Nelson-Collins resolution, which I prefer, makes it very \nclear that the opposition to the surge plan is sending our troops into \nBaghdad to put them in harm's way between the Sunnis and the Shias and \nthe sectarian violence that has been described as being far worse than \na civil war. We do not believe that is the appropriate plan. We have \nasked in that resolution that the President reconsider, consider all \nalternatives and other plans that might not put our troops into harm's \nway in the middle of a civil disobedience and a civil conflagration, as \nwe have seen it. I thank Senators Warner and Collins for their support \nand the cosponsors of this other resolution that I have referred to.\n\n  Today, it is pretty clear there has been much debate about the \ndebate. My friend from Kentucky indicated he is frustrated. We are all \nfrustrated. We are frustrated because it is time to end the charade and \nmove forward to the consideration of the resolution so the Senate can \nbe on record with Senators voting for or against the surge plan.\n  The American people can see what is happening. They know some want to \nprevent a vote at all costs. There have been Members complaining about \nthe vote cast a little over a week ago, cast against moving forward. \nThen they said in the Senate, it is time to have a vote after having \nvoted against having a vote.\n  It is time to move beyond the debate about the debate and move toward \nthe consideration of this resolution. It is time for the Senators to be \non record with the question: Are you for deploying thousands of troops \nto the crossroads of civil war in Iraq or do you oppose that plan?\n  This is the second opportunity the Senate has had to allow an up-or-\ndown vote on a resolution on the Iraq surge. Let the Senate debate and \nvote on this resolution. We owe it to the American people. We owe it to \nthe American people because of the importance of this resolution making \nclear that we do not support, or that we do support, putting our troops \nin harm's way in the middle of a civil war or a war that is simply \nbetween Shias and Sunnis, Shias and Shias, and other civil groups \nwithin the community. We do not have to understand the 1,400 years of \nthis battle to know it is inappropriate to put our troops into the \nmiddle where it is impossible to identify the enemy. We put our troops \ninto a situation where they are going to go door to door, hopefully \nwith some support from the Iraqi troops, hopefully with some support \nfrom Prime Minister Maliki, hopefully with some support from the Iraqi \nGovernment.\n  In any event, the surge which the President said is going forward \nwill put our troops in that condition and that situation. I, for one, \ndo not believe that is an appropriate use of our troops. I believe \ntoday is the opportunity for the Senate to be able to say no, by saying \nyes to moving forward on this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I make a unanimous-consent request that \non the Democratic side, after Senator Levin speaks, the next Senator to \nspeak will be Senator Feinstein.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I reserve the right to object. I ask \nunanimous consent after Senator Graham speaks on our side that I be \nrecognized in the proper order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I believe I am recognized for 10 \nminutes, is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, this is billed as an unusual Saturday \nsession where the Senate is working on Saturday. I argue we are not \nworking, we are having a political, theatrical debate that does more \nharm than good. There are a lot of people working on Saturday; not us. \nWe are trying to jockey for political positioning among ourselves and \nfor 2008. Yet there are people working in Baghdad and Iraq, trying to \nsecure our future against the most violent extremists on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  To my good friend Senator Nelson, if you think we are in the middle \nof a civil war, cut off funding. If you believe half of what you are \nsaying in these resolutions, then have the courage of your convictions \nto stop this war by cutting off funding. But, no, no one wants to do \nthat because they do not know how that will play out at home. Everybody \nis trying to hedge their bets a little bit, bashing this new effort to \nsecure victory, wanting to be seen in history, I guess, or for the next \nelection, that this was not my idea, this was Bush's fault. Bush is not \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\nIraq; 21,500 brave young men and women are going to Iraq behind a \ngeneral who believes he can win.\n  This is a low point in my time in the Senate.\n  Senator Reid said a few weeks ago, Republicans can't run and hide \nfrom this debate. Well, I am here. I am not running and hiding from any \nidea any Senator has. I am not running and hiding from Senator Warner's \nresolution. I look forward to voting against it and talking about how \nill-conceived it is. All I am asking for is a chance for the Senate to \nplay its role in our democracy and not become the House. All I am \nasking of my fellow colleagues who are certain they are right and want \nto send a message to our President is they give the courtesy to the \nothers, such as myself, who believe they are dead wrong. And let's have \na vote that reflects where the Senate is and not become the House.\n  What is the Senate? In the Senate you have to get 60 votes to move an \nidea forward. Do you want to abandon that because of the political \nmoment? I don't. Do you want to abandon your colleagues who have a \ndifferent view of what we should do? I don't. I have been there on an \nemotional issue called immigration. There was an effort to shut down \ndebate. I, along with Senator John McCain and several other Senators \nwho were very much for a comprehensive immigration reform, told critics \nwithin our caucus, we will not leave you behind.\n\n  I am extremely disappointed in our colleagues who want to shut off \ndebate, not understanding whether people such as myself and Senator \nGregg will be left behind. I am not afraid of your ideas. I respect the \ndifferences we have. I am extremely disappointed you will throw us \nover. That is not what the Senate is about. The Senate is about a \ndebate on a full range of ideas that shows a difference from the House.\n  Here is the crux of the matter: The reason we are here on a Saturday \nplaying stupid political games while people are over in Iraq trying to \nwin this war is because our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare afraid to take a vote on cutting off funding. I believe what \nhappened in the House in a nonbinding fashion is the worst possible \nsituation for this Congress, but it is a precursor to a movement toward \nbleeding this war dry in terms of funds and cutting off funding. If I \nam wrong, then let's have a vote on cutting off funding.\n  The reason we are not going to have a vote on the Judd Gregg \nresolution, which is a legitimate position, is because 70-plus Senators \nwill vote for it. The overwhelming majority of this Senate understands \nthat cutting off funding at this crucial time in the war on terror in \nIraq is ill-advised, but they don't want to be on the record. The \nreason they don't want to be on the record is because the radical left \nwill eat Democrat 2008 hopefuls' lunch. They will create a fight on \nthat side of monumental proportions between the radical left and the \nbloggers of the left who want to get out yesterday. That is why we are \nhaving a truncated debate.\n  If Members do believe we are in the middle of a civil war, take the \nfloor and get people out of the middle of the civil war.\n  This is the politics of abandonment. This is abandoning the role the \nSenate has played for generations, to make our country stronger, not \nweaker. This is abandoning colleagues with contrary ideas who are going \nto be cut off. Unfortunately, these nonbinding resolutions abandon \nthose who are going to the fight voluntarily.\n  This is a very sad Saturday for the Senate, on the heels of a \ndisaster in the House where a majority, a bare majority of the House, \nwants to send a political message at a time of war that does not keep \none person from being shot at.\n  I don't know where this thing is going to go. I don't know how it is \ngoing to end, but I can promise this: As long as I am in the Senate, I \nam going to take this Senate and make sure the Senate acts like the \nSenate. I came to the Senate for a reason. I want to be part of great \ndebates. The way this process will be structured is Members will get \ncut out. Judd Gregg will get cut out because of the politics of the \nmoment. The 60-vote rule will have meaning in this debate as long as I \nam here. I hope my colleagues will understand whatever differences we \nhave, no matter how sincere they are, please don't throw us over.\n  At this moment in time, I will read another resolution of sorts. This \nis from General Petraeus. He is addressing the coalition forces:\n\n       To the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Civilians of \n     Multi-National Force--Iraq:\n       We serve in Iraq at a critical time. The war here will soon \n     enter its fifth year. A decisive moment approaches. Shoulder-\n     to-shoulder with our Iraqi comrades, we will conduct a \n     pivotal campaign to improve security for the Iraqi people. \n     The stakes could not be higher.\n       Our task is crucial. Security is essential for Iraq to \n     build its future. Only with security can the Iraqi government \n     come to grips with the tough issues it confronts and develop \n     the capacity to serve its citizens. The hopes of the Iraqi \n     people and the coalition countries are with us.\n       The enemies of Iraq will shrink at no act, however \n     barbaric. They will do all they can to shake the confidence \n     of the people and to convince the world that this effort is \n     doomed. We must not underestimate them.\n       Together with our Iraqi partners, we must defeat those who \n     oppose the new Iraq. We cannot allow mass murderers to hold \n     the initiative. We must strike them relentlessly. We and our \n     Iraqi partners must set the terms of the struggle, not our \n     enemies. And together we must prevail.\n       The way ahead will not be easy. There will be difficult \n     times in the months to come. But hard is not hopeless, and we \n     must remain steadfast in our effort to help improve security \n     for the Iraqi people. I am confident that each of you will \n     fight with skill and courage, and that you will remain loyal \n     to your comrades-in-arms and to the values our nations hold \n     so dear.\n       In the end, Iraqis will decide the outcome of this \n     struggle. Our task is to help them gain the time they need to \n     save their country. To do that, many of us will live and \n     fight alongside them. Together, we will face down the \n     terrorists, insurgents, and criminals who slaughter the \n     innocent. Success will require discipline, fortitude, and \n     initiative--qualities that you have in abundance.\n\n  Do we have those qualities in Congress?\n\n       I appreciate your sacrifices and those of your families. \n     Now, more than ever, your commitment to service and your \n     skill can make the difference between victory and defeat in a \n     very tough mission.\n       It is an honor to soldier again with the members of the \n     Multi-National Force--Iraq. I know that wherever you serve in \n     this undertaking you will give your all. In turn, I pledge my \n     commitment to our mission and every effort to achieve success \n     as we help the Iraqis chart a course to a brighter future.\n       Godspeed to each of you and to our Iraqi comrades in this \n     crucial endeavor.\n\n  I end with this thought: If Members believe this is a lost cause and \nvictory cannot be achieved, that our people are in the middle of a \nmess, a civil war, and not one person should get injured or killed \nbecause we have made huge mistakes that cannot be turned around, then \ncut off funding. Have a vote on something that matters. This political \ntheater empowers our enemy, disheartens our own troops, is not worthy \nof the Senate time, and it has never been done in history for a reason.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Feinstein \nspeaks in support of the motion for cloture, the next person in support \nof that motion be Senator Schumer of New York for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I have been privileged to be a Member of \nthe Senate now in my 29th year. Never have I stood in the Senate and in \nany way impugned the integrity of any Senator to speak as she or he \nbelieves from their own heart about what is right. I have never tried \nto challenge the patriotism of any Senator as they express their views.\n  I say to my colleagues, I entered this debate simply because I feel \nthe Senate of the United States of America, an institute revered \nthroughout the world, should have the right to go forward and debate \nthis critical issue before America today, before the whole world.\n  Over a week ago, I voted against cloture to support the rights of all \ncolleagues to be heard. That issue has been back and forth between our \ntwo leaders now for some weeks. We have come to the point in time when \nwe must move forward. The only vehicle for those who wish to have this \ninstitution move forward and fulfill its goal is to move, today, to \nvote for cloture. I shall cast that vote, not with a heavy heart but \nwith a heart that I think I am doing right for the integrity of this \ninstitution.\n  I have joined with my good friend Senator Ben Nelson, Senator \nCollins,\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\nand the other cosponsors, Senator Hagel, Senator Snowe, Senator \nColeman, Senator Voinovich, and Senator Smith, all of whom, once again, \nsigned onto this amendment, referred to as the Warner-Nelson-Collins \namendment.\n  We do so because we only wish to express a measure of disagreement on \none basic point--an important one--with our President. The United \nStates Congress is an independent branch of our Government. We are, as \nwe often say, a coequal branch of our Government. We have the right to \nrespectfully disagree. And we do so in our language. We support the \nPresident on the diplomatic aspects of his plan. We support the \nPresident on the economic aspects of his plan announced on the 10th of \nJanuary.\n  We only disagree with one portion of it: Madam President, do you need \n21,500 additional men and women of the Armed Forces in this conflict--\nindeed, it is more than that, as was testified before the Armed \nServices Committee the other day--to go into the streets and the alleys \nof Baghdad and to face an enemy which is largely today fighting a \nsectarian war?\n  This country gave an enormous sacrifice of life and limb to give Iraq \nits sovereignty. It is the duty of the Iraqi Armed Forces to take on \nthe sectarian fighting. The American GI does not know the language, \ndoes not know the historic background of over 1,400 years of dispute \nbetween the Sunni and Shia. And we have trained over 300,000 Iraqi \nforces. Why not give those forces the responsibility to take on this \nfight?\n  Our resolution in no way has anything to do with the cutoff of funds. \nSenators stand up and castigate our resolution and claim it will cutoff \nfunding. It will not cutoff funding to our troops. It supports the \nPresident. It supports the present level of all the troops throughout \nIraq. It simply says: Mr. President, are there not alternatives other \nthan using the American GI to put down this sectarian violence?\n  Madam President, I do hope, as we pursue this, we respect one another \nand our rights in this institution because I feel ever so strongly that \nour resolution supports the President economically, supports the \nPresident diplomatically, states that the President is correct, and \nclearly states that we cannot let this battle be lost and let the Iraqi \nGovernment collapse. We do not wish to see the people of Iraq denied \nthe sovereignty that our blood, sweat, and toil have given them. We \nstand by the President on that. We simply say: Mr. President, this \nparticular battle in Baghdad is best fought by the Iraqis. I regret to \nsay that a New York Times article--and I asked this in open testimony \nbefore the Armed Services Committee a day or so ago to the Chief of \nStaff of the Army and to the Commandant of the Marine Corps--the \naccuracy of this report, that in the most recent battle there were \n2,500 Americans and 200 Iraqi security forces. That is contrary to what \nthe President said. He said the Iraqis will take the point in this \nbattle. The President also said the Iraqis will bear the burden in this \nbattle, and we would be there in support. This is not support. We are \nfighting that battle.\n  Again, this morning, I watched a report, presented by a U.S. general \nfrom Iraq, who stated that progress is being made in the battle in \nIraq. Time and time again--he referred to the American forces making \nprogress. He referred only to the United States forces fighting that \nbattle, with no reference to the Iraqi forces. That is my point. That \nis why I steadfastly take this floor and respectfully disagree with the \nPresident. I will vote for the Gregg amendment. As a matter of fact, \nthe Gregg amendment is in the Warner amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I believe I am to be recognized for 5 \nminutes, but I have an additional 5 minutes which Senator Stevens has \nyielded to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, first, my respect for the Senator from Virginia is \nimmense. I have always admired what he does, and I wish we were voting \non his resolution. I think it should be up for debate and up for a \nvote. He is a significant force in this institution for many things \nwhich are right. I may have some disagreements with him over time, but \nI certainly have never questioned anything. I hope no one would. No one \nshould question anybody on anything around here on what our purposes \nare. Our purposes are the same: to make our country a better and safer \nplace and to make sure we assure a good future for our children.\n  Let me set the table as to where we are in this debate, however, \nbecause one of the essences of this institution has always been it has \nbeen a forum where if you have a different idea or a different thought \non an issue of substance, you usually get to air it, and you most often \nget to vote on it. That, of course, is what our Founding Fathers \nstructured this institution for.\n  Ironically, it was George Washington--not ironically but \nappropriately--it was George Washington who immediately ascertained the \nsignificance of the Senate's role when he said the Senate is the saucer \ninto which the hot coffee is poured. It is the spot where ideas of the \nday get an airing to make sure they survive the light of day.\n\n  Over time, we have developed an institutional understanding in the \nSenate that unless 60 percent--a majority of the Senate--agrees on an \nissue of major importance, that issue does not move forward. And \nequally importantly, we have developed an attitude in the Senate that \nif there is more than one legitimate view on an issue of significance--\nand this is, obviously, an issue of dramatic significance--there will \nbe different views brought to the floor in the form of amendments or \nresolutions, and they will be debated and they will be voted on.\n  So what I suggested was an amendment which was not, I felt, all that \ncontroversial. In fact, I thought it was in the mainstream of American \nthought and certainly, hopefully, in the mainstream of the Senate \npositions. The resolution which I suggested--and I will read it again--\nsimply states:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not take \n     any action that will endanger United States military forces \n     in the field, including the elimination or reduction of funds \n     for troops in the field, as such action with respect to \n     funding would undermine their safety or harm their \n     effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions.\n\n  This should not be controversial. This should be a statement which we \nas a Congress are willing to make, that when we send a soldier onto the \nstreets of Baghdad or anywhere else where that soldier may incur or be \nin the way of harm, that soldier will have the support of the American \npeople and the Congress--with the financing, with the equipment, with \nthe logistics they need to do their job well. And it should be a \ndefinitive, uncontroversial, un-\ncontroverted statement.\n  Yet in offering this resolution, the Democratic leadership has said \nthey will not entertain it. They will not allow us to vote on it. In \nfact, they have taken this whole process to a whole new level of trying \nto manage the activities of the floor of the Senate in a way that the \nSenate has never been managed in its historical past or should be \nmanaged in the context of what the purposes of the Senate are.\n  The Democratic leader has essentially said we will vote on his \namendment--his amendment--and his amendment alone. And, by the way, his \namendment has changed three times now. There have been major, \nsubstantive changes to his amendment three times. And each time he has \nsaid or the leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle has said: \nThat is the amendment we are going to vote on, that is the one that is \nlocked in stone. It shall not be changed. You shall vote on it as a \nSenate. You shall not be allowed to amend it. You shall not be allowed \nto put up resolutions that in any other way address the issue.\n  Well, the first proposal they came out with was not good enough to \nget enough votes to get to 40 probably, so they changed it. Then they \nsaid: This amendment shall be the amendment you will vote on. This \namendment shall not be changed. This amendment shall not be amended on \nthe floor of the Senate. There shall not be an amendment\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\nthat I have proposed or that the Republican membership wants to propose \nto go up and be debated and voted on also. Then that amendment, it \nturned out, was not good enough. That happened to be the Warner \namendment.\n  Then the House passed an amendment, and they decided to take the \nHouse amendment and say: Now this amendment shall be the amendment \nwhich is frozen in stone and which cannot be contravened, cannot be \namended, and it shall not have any other amendment offered by the \nminority, by the Republican side of the aisle that the Republican side \nof the aisle wishes to propose.\n  There was one caveat to that, the Senate Democratic leader said: I \nwill be willing to choose an amendment for the Republican side of the \naisle to propose. I, as Democratic leader, shall choose the Republican \namendment that is brought to the floor to be debated.\n  Well, obviously that, on the face of it, does not pass the test of \nfairness or even the test of how the Senate should run, even under a \nconfined system as this is. The actual way we should proceed in this \nmanner, in this situation, is that there should be at least four \namendments on the floor because there are four major ideas floating \naround here.\n  There is the idea that came over from the House. There is Senator \nWarner's proposal. There is Senator McCain's proposal. Then there is my \nproposal. Every one of these is substantive, thoughtful, I believe. \nMaybe I am assuming too much for mine. But for everybody else's, there \nare substantive, thoughtful ideas that should be debated on the floor \nof the Senate, and they should each be allowed a vote.\n  But the Democratic leadership has said no, there shall be no vote on \nanything other than their new proposal--which is now the House \nproposal, their third machination of what they are going to do--and \nanother proposal which they will choose from the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  Well, that clearly fails on all levels. Substantively it fails the \nrules of the Senate as they have traditionally been used. And as a \nmatter of fairness, it fails the issue of being fair to people who have \na legitimate viewpoint. More importantly, it fails the American people \nand the troops who are in the field because it does not allow us as a \nSenate to effectively debate and vote on proposals which would address \nthe various issues raised by the situation in Iraq.\n  So we on our side are saying we shall assert our rights. There are, \nafter all, at least 40 Members of the Republican Party--and I suspect \nquite a few more--who believe that we, as Members of the Republican \nparty, as Members of the minority, have a right to offer an amendment \nof our choosing, and that it should be voted on, especially since we \nare debating nonbinding amendments.\n  Equally important, I think it is probably appropriate to analyze: Why \nwould the Democratic leadership not want to vote on the resolution I \njust outlined? Why would they not want to do something such as that? \nWhy would they not want a vote on a resolution which states \nunequivocally that when we send our soldiers--our men and women--into \nharm's way, we are going to give them the support they need to do the \nmission they are assigned to do and to remain safe?\n  I suspect it is because that amendment which I have propounded, that \nproposal, that resolution would actually get significantly more than a \nsupermajority in this body, significantly more than any other of the \nthree items that have been discussed--the McCain proposal, the Warner \nproposal, or the House proposal--and that they would perceive that as \nan embarrassment on their side, which I believe shows this is not about \nthe substance of the issue of how you address the war in Iraq, this is \nabout the politics of how the amendment brought to the floor is \nperceived in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the other \npanoply of national press groups that are basically trying to claim a \nvictory over not our efforts in Iraq but over the President.\n  The fact that they would not allow us to bring forward an amendment \nwhich they know will receive a supermajority and more votes than their \namendment--and which is so forthright in its statement of what it does, \nand which is so appropriate to the issue of what we are doing in Iraq, \nwhich is that we should be supporting our troops who have been sent \ninto harm's way--is a reflection of the politicalness of this process, \nnot the substance of the process. It is regrettable.\n  We will continue to insist that this amendment, which is reasonable, \nbe voted on. We should not allow the frustration--and I recognize there \nis a tremendous amount of frustration about the war in Iraq. I have a \nlot of frustration about the war in Iraq. Everybody does around here. \nYou could not but have that about what is happening there. But we \nshould not allow that frustration to be taken out on our troops in the \nfield. There will be endless claims that the House language that has \ncome over to us----\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, would this come out of the opposition's \ntime?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We have several on our side. I yield 1 more minute to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may resume.\n  Mr. GREGG. The House language is totally inconsistent on the issue of \nwhether it supports the troops. It says on the one hand that it does, \nand it says on the other hand that it doesn't support their mission. \nYou can't do both of those things together.\n  I will submit for the Record an editorial from the Wall Street \nJournal which reflects that fact. I appreciate the courtesy from the \nSenator from Idaho in granting me another minute. It truly is San \nFrancisco sophistry, the language in the House resolution. In my \nopinion, it cannot be claimed to be consistent. The only consistent \nstatement of support for the troops is the language of my amendment. \nThat is why I believe it should be voted on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the editorial to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 15, 2007]\n\n                       Awaiting the Dishonor Roll\n\n       Congress has rarely been distinguished by its moral \n     courage. But even grading on a curve, we can only describe \n     this week's House debate on a vote of no-confidence in the \n     mission in Iraq as one of the most shameful moments in the \n     institution's history.\n       On present course, the Members will vote on Friday to \n     approve a resolution that does nothing to remove American \n     troops from harm's way in Iraq but that will do substantial \n     damage to their morale and that of their Iraqi allies while \n     emboldening the enemy. The only real question is how many \n     Republicans will also participate in this disgrace in the \n     mistaken belief that their votes will put some distance \n     between themselves and the war most of them voted to \n     authorize in 2002.\n       The motion at issue is plainly dishonest, in that \n     exquisitely Congressional way of trying to have it both ways. \n     The resolution purports to ``support'' the troops even as it \n     disapproves of their mission. It praises their ``bravery,'' \n     while opposing the additional forces that both President Bush \n     and General David Petreaus, the new commanding general in \n     Iraq, say are vital to accomplishing that mission. And it \n     claims to want to ``protect'' the troops even as its \n     practical impact will be to encourage Iraqi insurgents to \n     believe that every roadside bomb brings them closer to their \n     goal.\n       As for how ``the troops'' themselves feel, we refer readers \n     to Richard Engel's recent story on NBC News quoting \n     Specialist Tyler Johnson in Iraq: ``People are dying here. \n     You know what I'm saying . . . You may [say] `oh we support \n     the troops.' So you're not supporting what they do. What \n     they's (sic) here to sweat for, what we bleed for and we die \n     for.'' Added another soldier: ``If they don't think we're \n     doing a good job, everything we've done here is all in \n     vain.'' In other words, the troops themselves realize that \n     the first part of the resolution is empty posturing, while \n     the second is deeply immoral.\n       All the more so because if Congress feels so strongly about \n     the troops, it arguably has the power to start removing them \n     from harm's way by voting to cut off the funds they need to \n     operate in Iraq. But that would make Congress responsible for \n     what followed--whether those consequences are Americans \n     killed in retreat, or ethnic cleansing in Baghdad, or the \n     toppling of the elected Maliki government by radical Shiite \n     or military forces. The one result Congress fears above all \n     is being accountable.\n       We aren't prone to quoting the young John Kerry, but this \n     week's vote reminds us of the\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\n     comment the antiwar veteran told another cut-and-run Congress \n     in the early 1970s: ``How do you ask a man to be the last man \n     to die for a mistake?'' The difference this time is that \n     Speaker Nancy Pelosi and John Murtha expect men and women to \n     keep dying for something they say is a mistake but also don't \n     have the political courage to help end.\n       Instead, they'll pass this ``non-binding resolution,'' to \n     be followed soon by attempts at micromanagement that would \n     make the war all but impossible to prosecute--and once again \n     without taking responsibility. Mr. Murtha is already \n     broadcasting his strategy, which the new Politico Web site \n     described yesterday as ``a slow-bleed strategy designed to \n     gradually limit the administration's options.''\n       In concert with antiwar groups, the story reported, Mr. \n     Murtha's ``goal is crafted to circumvent the biggest \n     political vulnerability of the antiwar movement--the \n     accusation that it is willing to abandon troops in the \n     field.'' So instead of cutting off funds, Mr. Murtha will \n     ``slow-bleed'' the troops with ``readiness'' restrictions or \n     limits on National Guard forces that will make them all but \n     impossible to deploy. These will be attached to \n     appropriations bills that will also purport to ``support the \n     troops.''\n       ``There's a D-Day coming in here, and it's going to start \n     with the supplemental and finish with the '08 [defense] \n     budget,'' Congressman Neil Abercrombie (D., Hawaii) told the \n     Web site. He must mean D-Day as in Dunkirk.\n       All of this is something that House Republicans should keep \n     in mind as they consider whether to follow this retreat. The \n     GOP leadership has been stalwart, even eloquent, this week in \n     opposing the resolution. But some Republicans figure they can \n     use this vote to distance themselves from Mr. Bush and the \n     war while not doing any real harm. They should understand \n     that the Democratic willingness to follow the Murtha ``slow-\n     bleed'' strategy will depend in part on how many Republicans \n     follow them in this vote. The Democrats are themselves \n     divided on how to proceed, and they want a big GOP vote to \n     give them political cover. However ``non-binding,'' this is a \n     vote that Republican partisans will long remember.\n       History is likely to remember the roll as well. A newly \n     confirmed commander is about to lead 20,000 American soldiers \n     on a dangerous and difficult mission to secure Baghdad, \n     risking their lives for their country. And the message their \n     elected Representatives will send them off to battle with is \n     a vote declaring their inevitable defeat.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we have been bogged down in Iraq for \nnearly 4 years, which is longer than the Korean conflict or our \ninvolvement in World War II. The war has cost more than 3,100 American \nlives, seven times that many wounded, and about $400 billion. We \ndesperately need to change course. Shifting responsibility to the Iraqi \npolitical leaders to reach a political settlement is the only hope of \nending the violence. That is why the Iraq Study Group urged less U.S. \nmilitary involvement as they concluded:\n\n       An open-ended commitment of American forces would not \n     provide the Iraqi government the incentive that it needs to \n     take the political actions that give Iraq the best chance of \n     quelling sectarian violence. In the absence of such an \n     incentive, the Iraqi government might continue to delay \n     taking those difficult actions.\n\n  But instead of putting pressure on Iraqi leaders to settle their \npolitical differences as the only hope of a successful outcome in Iraq, \nthe President would get us in deeper militarily. The Iraqis didn't ask \nfor more U.S. troops to occupy their neighborhoods in Baghdad. Indeed, \nthey suggested we move out of Baghdad. The idea for this so-called \nsurge of American troops in Baghdad was ours. It may be called a surge, \nbut I believe it is a plunge, a plunge into a sectarian caldron, a \nplunge into the unknown and perhaps the unknowable.\n  Supporters of the surge argue that a Senate resolution disagreeing \nwith the President's plan ``emboldens the enemy,'' but that is an \nextraordinarily naive view of the enemy. What emboldens the sectarian \nfighters is the inability of the Iraqi leaders to make political \ncompromises so essential to finally reining in the Sunni insurgents and \nthe Shia militias. The enemy cares little what Congress says. It is \nemboldened by what the Iraqi leaders don't do. The enemy isn't \nemboldened by congressional debate. It is emboldened by the open-ended \noccupation of a Muslim country by western troops. The enemy is \nemboldened by the current course which has seen a million Iraqis leave \nthe country and become refugees, with thousands more leaving daily. The \nenemy is emboldened by years of blunders and bravado, false \nassumptions, wishful thinking, and ignorance of the history of the land \nbeing occupied. The enemy is emboldened by an administration which says \nit is changing course, which acknowledges that a political settlement \nby Iraqi leaders is essential to ending the violence but then plunges \nus more deeply militarily into a sectarian witch's brew.\n  The only hope of ending the violence and succeeding against the \nenemies of an Iraqi nation is if the leaders of that nation work out \ntheir political differences and unite against forces that would destroy \nany chance of nationhood. That takes political will. That takes \npressure from us. Sending more U.S. troops takes the pressure off. It \nsends the false message that we can save the Iraqis from themselves. \nSending more troops does what our CENTCOM commander, John Abizaid, \nwarned about when he said:\n\n       It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do the work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  Does speaking out against the surge undermine our troops? The \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Peter Pace, firmly answered \nthat argument just last week when he said the following:\n\n       There's no doubt in my mind that the dialogue here in \n     Washington strengthens our democracy--period . . . From the \n     standpoint of our troops, I believe that they understand how \n     our legislature works and that they understand that there's \n     going to be this kind of debate.\n\n  Just last week, Secretary Gates answered the charge that our debate \nhurts troop morale when he said these words:\n\n       I think that our troops do understand that everybody \n     involved in this debate is looking to do the right thing for \n     our country and for our troops, and that everybody is looking \n     for the best way to avoid an outcome that leaves Iraq in \n     chaos. And I think they're sophisticated enough to understand \n     that that's what the debate's really about. I think they \n     understand that that debate's being carried on by patriotic \n     people who care about them and who care about their mission.\n\n  We owe our troops everything: equipment, training, adequate rest, \nsupport of them and their family. We also owe them our honest \nassessment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could be yielded 30 additional seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The majority of the American people believe that a deeper \nmilitary involvement in Iraq won't make success more likely. I believe \na majority of Senators feel the same way. I hope the majority will be \nallowed to so vote. If we believe plunging into Baghdad neighborhoods \nwith more American troops will not increase chances of success, we are \ndutybound to say so, and a minority of Senators should not thwart that \nexpression. We owe that to the troops. We owe that to their families, \nand we owe that to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, under a unanimous consent request, I have \nasked for 5 minutes. I will use one of those and yield the remaining 4 \nto the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a statement by the \nAmerican Legion, the largest veterans organization in this country. I \nwill only quote its last paragraph:\n\n       The American Legion and the American people find this to be \n     a totally unacceptable approach and we will do everything \n     within our power to ensure that our troops are not used as \n     political pawns by a Congress that lacks the will to win.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Legion: Congress Sent Wrong Message Today\n\n       Washington, Feb. 16/PRNewswire-USNewswire/--The leader of \n     the nation's largest wartime veterans' organization provided \n     the following statement in response to the House vote \n     disapproving the President's decision to deploy more than \n     20,000 additional combat troops to the Iraqi theater.\n       ``Congress may consider its vote today on H. Con. Res. 63 \n     to be nonbinding, but veterans of previous wars and those in \n     the field of combat right now consider Congress's action to \n     be a betrayal of trust and the first step toward surrender to \n     the terrorists who caused this war in the first place.\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n       ``We must never forget the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when \n     two U.S. commercial aircraft were used to kill nearly 3,000 \n     innocent people in an unprovoked attack against our nation's \n     sovereignty. We must never forget those brave Americans who \n     downed their plane in Pennsylvania, saving the lives of many \n     in the Capitol. We must never forget the attack on the \n     Pentagon, or on the USS Cole, or our embassies, or our Marine \n     barracks in Beirut. The list goes on and on.\n       ``Even the Clinton administration tried to kill Osama bin \n     Laden by lobbing missiles at him. This war didn't just start \n     with the invasion of Iraq. It's been going on for decades. \n     It's been going on in Republican and Democrat administrations \n     and Congresses.\n       ``It isn't about partisan politics. It's about America. \n     It's about all of us, and especially those who are at this \n     moment risking their lives on the field of battle.\n       ``Americans are not the enemy here. The terrorists and all \n     of those governments that support them are the enemy. We must \n     never forget that. And, equally important, we must never \n     forget the primary lesson learned in Vietnam: you cannot \n     separate the war from the warrior.\n       ``Congress can talk all it wants to about how it supports \n     the troops. But its actions set the table. The message they \n     sent today to the frontline is that America is preparing to \n     cut and run. We essentially told our fighting men and women \n     that `we have taken step one in the plan to cut \n     reinforcements, to cut armaments, and to withdraw any support \n     you need to complete your mission.'\n       ``The Speaker characterized it succinctly when she said, \n     ``(t)his legislation will signal a change in direction that \n     will end the fighting and bring our troops home.'\n       ``What she failed to add was `. . . in defeat, and without \n     completing the mission they were trained to complete and \n     ready to win if only America had not given up before they \n     did.'\n       ``The American Legion and the American people find this to \n     be totally unacceptable and we will do everything within our \n     power to ensure that our troops are not used as political \n     pawns by a Congress that lacks the will to win.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, the first reason to vote no on this \nmotion to proceed is that we have no ability to amend or an alternative \nthat would be allowed by the majority to reflect a different point of \nview. When I hear people on the other side say don't let the minority \nthwart the efforts of the majority, what the majority is saying is we \nonly want one resolution, our resolution. Whatever happened to \namendments? Whatever happened to the ability to have alternative \nresolutions?\n  This is the tenth time in this very short period that this Congress \nhas been in session that cloture has been used to stifle minority \nrights. It is unprecedented in this body. I hope we will go to a time \nwhen the Senate will be able to work together in a bipartisan way, \nagree and disagree civilly, have the ability to exercise minority \nrights, and then have a majority vote. We don't have to have only one \nprocedure that allows for one view but does not allow for alternatives \nand amendments. That is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate.\n  The second reason to vote no on this motion is the resolution itself. \nThe resolution says we support the troops who are there now and the \ntroops who were there in the past but not those who will come in the \nfuture. Presumably the majority is saying that we will not support \nfuture troops because they don't support the President's plan. But \ntroops who are rotating in to replace troops leaving would also not be \nsupported. Since when do we select which members of the armed services \nwe will support and which ones we will not in the middle of a mission? \nIt is untenable on its face. We should never allow this flawed \nresolution to go forward without any alternative and without any \namendments.\n  The third reason we should use every procedural avenue to derail this \nresolution is, we are undercutting the Commander in Chief and the \ntroops who are on the mission right now. This is a rare departure for \nthe Senate to undercut a mission of our military while troops are in \nharm's way performing the mission with a nonbinding resolution. The \npurpose of doing this can only be to undercut the Commander in Chief to \nthe rest of the world because it will not stop the mission itself.\n  As was said earlier today, there is not a Member of the Senate who \ndoesn't believe this is a risky proposition. It is. We are all worried \nabout it. I have talked to General Petraeus about it, as have many of \nmy colleagues. How, General Petraeus, do you see this working? He is \nthe commander and he is the one who is putting this proposal together \nto fight a type of war we have never had to fight before, with an enemy \nthat is willing to kill themselves in order to kill Americans and \ninnocent Iraqis.\n  We have had to adjust; there is no doubt about it. I don't think \nanybody is saying that we believe we are in a good situation in Iraq. \nBut the idea that we would pass a nonbinding resolution which undercuts \nour troops who are valiantly performing the mission is something I \ncannot remember that we have ever done.\n  I will quote from the Senate Armed Services hearing when Senator \nLieberman asked General Petraeus if such a resolution, a nonbinding \nresolution condemning the strategy, would give the enemy encouragement, \nsome clear expression that the American people were divided. General \nPetraeus answered: ``That is correct, sir.''\n  Yes, the American people are divided. It is a very different matter \nfor the Senate to pass a resolution with no alternative that says we \nsupport the troops who are there now and the ones who served in the \npast but not those who will be coming after the resolution is passed. \nIt is unthinkable.\n  I hope we will come to our senses. I hope we will be able to talk \nfreely, to debate but not to pass a resolution that says to the world, \nto our enemies, as well as our allies, we do not have faith in those \nwho would go to perform a mission going forward, faith in the military \nwho created this plan.\n  I hope the Senate doesn't pass this. I hope we will have an agreement \nthat will allow alternatives, as we have always done since I have been \nin the Senate, and many years before me. I hope our leaders will be \nable to sit down and craft a resolution that opens the process so that \neveryone will have a voice, not just a few in the majority. Maybe it is \n51. Maybe it is 52. Maybe it is 53. But we should have 41 Senators \nstanding up for an alternative resolution that would allow other people \nto have the ability to vote for the support of our troops, whether they \nare there now, whether they were there in the past, or whether they \nwill be there in the future. That is the difference between this \nresolution the majority is trying to get passed without any alternative \nor any amendment, and what we would put forward, which is to say: We \nwill support all the troops today or tomorrow, and we will win this \nwar, for there is no substitute for victory, if our children are going \nto live in freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 3 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we have seen 4 years of obfuscation on \nIraq from the White House and from previous leadership in this Senate. \nThose days are over this afternoon. Every Senator is going to have to \nstep to the plate and say where he or she stands. The other side has \ntried to design resolutions where they can duck, they can avoid, and \nthey don't tell their constituencies how they feel. Those days are \nover.\n  That is why this cloture vote is a crucial vote, not just for the \nmoment or the week but for the history of America because today's vote \nis not on other aspects of what is going on in Iraq or Iran but simply \nthis: Are you for or against the escalation? Plain and simple.\n  There should be a simple vote, not as an end to this debate but as a \nbeginning of this debate. The minority is tying itself into pretzels so \nthere will not be a vote. They are torn between their President's \npolicy and the wishes of their constituents. But vote they must. If \nthey avoid the vote this afternoon, their constituents will know \nexactly what they are doing.\n  On the policy, the President's escalation is misguided, to put it \nkindly. There is no change in strategy. We are policing a civil war in \nIraq--something no one talked about 2 years ago, something no one \nbargained for. Our brave\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nyoung men and women, whom we so support, are standing in the crossfire \nbetween Shiites and Sunnis. This is not a fight against terrorism; this \nis a civil war, and there have been, unfortunately, thousands of them \nthroughout history. American troops should not be in the middle of that \nwar.\n  The President doesn't change the policy; he simply adds more troops \nto continue this misguided policy. That is why the majority of this \nSenate, and the overwhelming majority of the American people, are so \nopposed to this escalation, and we will vote on it this afternoon. But \nmake no mistake about it, this is just the first step. It is just the \nfirst step. This is a process. Some of my friends and colleagues wish--\nand maybe we do, too--that there could be a silver bullet, one \nresolution that could either end the escalation or even end the war. \nBut there is not. The way our Constitution is structured, this \nGovernment, you need two-thirds to overcome a certain Presidential \nveto, when we do our next resolution with teeth.\n  So our job here, which this resolution begins, is to ratchet up the \npressure on the President, on those who are still on his side in terms \nof this policy until they change. We will be relentless. There will be \nresolution after resolution, amendment after amendment, all forcing \nthis body to do what it has not done in the previous 3 years--debate \nand discuss Iraq. And we believe that as that debate continues and as \nthis process unfolds, just like in the days of Vietnam, the pressure \nwill mount and the President will find he has no strategy. He will have \nto change his strategy, and the vast majority of our troops will be \ntaken out of harm's way and come home.\n  So, Madam President, today is the beginning of a historic period, \nwhere for the first time in a while Congress debates foreign policy in \nIraq and Congress tries to do something about foreign policy in Iraq.\n  To the brave men and women who are defending us today, whom we so \nsupport, thank you for your service, thank you for protecting us. We \nwill continue to live by what the Constitution has asked us to do, \nwhich is to debate the issues and come up with what is best for our \nsoldiers, for America, and for the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, do I have 5 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, the Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today, the Senate has an opportunity--and \na responsibility--to begin to end the escalation of the war in Iraq and \nto start us toward a new strategy for leaving Iraq without leaving \nchaos behind.\n  Our responsibility is to debate and vote on the resolution passed by \nthe House of Representatives that says that Congress disapproves of the \nPresident's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional American combat \ntroops to Iraq.\n  The question before us today is whether a miniority of Senators will \neven allow the debate to start. That is what we are about to vote on.\n  To my colleagues who are thinking about trying to block debate, let \nme say this: Iraq dominates our national life. It is on the minds of \ntens of millions of Americans. It shapes the lives of hundreds of \nthousands of our men and woman in uniform and their families.\n  That the Senate would not even debate, much less vote on, the single \nmost urgent issue of our time, would be a total failure of our \nresponsibility.\n  We have a duty to debate and vote on the President's plan. We have a \nduty to debate and vote on our overall strategy in Iraq. We have to \ndemonstrate the courage of our convictions.\n  Last month, Secretary of State Rice presented the President's plan \nfor Iraq to the Foreign Relations Committee. Its main feature is to \nsend more American troops into Baghdad, in the middle of a sectarian \ncivil war.\n  The reaction on the committee, from Republicans and Democrats alike, \nranged from skepticism to profound skepticism to outright opposition. \nAnd that pretty much reflects the reaction across the country.\n  Every Senator should be given a chance to vote whether he or she \napproves or disagrees with the President's plan to send more troops \ninto the middle of a civil war.\n  The debate I hope that we will have is as important as the vote.\n  I predict the American people will hear very few of our colleagues \nstand up and support the President's plan to send more troops into the \nmiddle of a civil war. Listen to those voices.\n  Some minimize the significance of a nonbinding resolution. If it is \nso meaningless, why did the White House and the President's political \nsupporters mobilize so much energy against it? Why is a minority of \nSenators trying to prevent the Senate from talking about it?\n  Opposing the surge is only a first step. We need a radical change in \ncourse in Iraq.\n  If the President won't act, Congress must.\n  But Congress must act responsibly. We must resist the temptation to \npush for changes that sound good but produce bad results.\n  The best next step is to revisit the authorization Congress granted \nthe President in 2002 to use force in Iraq.\n  We gave the President that power to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction and, if necessary, to depose Saddam Hussein.\n  The WMD were not there. Saddam Hussein is no longer there. The 2002 \nauthorization is no longer relevant to the situation in Iraq.\n  Legislation I'm working on would repeal that authorization and \nreplace it with a much narrower mission statement for our troops in \nIraq.\n  Congress should make clear what the mission of our troops is: to \nresponsibly draw down, while continuing to combat terrorists, train \nIraqis and respond to emergencies.\n  We should make equally clear what their mission is not: to stay in \nIraq indefinitely and get mired in a savage civil war.\n  Coupled with the Biden-Gelb plan that offers the possibility of a \npolitical settlement in Iraq, I believe this is the most effective way \nto start bringing our troops home without leaving a mess behind.\n  But for today, my message is simple: the American people want us to \ndebate Iraq, the most important issue of our day. They expect it. They \ndemand it.\n  If we try to hide behind procedure and delaying tactics, the American \npeople will hold us accountable.\n  They get it. The question is: do we?\n  Madam President, again, today we have the opportunity to do something \nwe have not done on the floor of the U.S. Senate in the last 4 years; \nthat is, to actually debate Iraq. This is the first opportunity we are \ngoing to have to do that. I know a number of people say: This is not \nbinding, so why are we doing it? If it doesn't matter, why is there \nsuch an effort to keep us from talking about it, an effort to continue \nto fight us in being able to do this?\n  Madam President, I say to my colleagues that if we fail to invoke \ncloture here, we are not permitted to debate this issue, and I don't \nknow what it says to the American people about what we are all about. I \ndon't know whether anybody has noticed, but the American public is \nseized with this issue. It is the issue. It is the issue everybody is \ndiscussing at the kitchen table. It is the issue every man, woman, \nhusband, wife, mother, and father with someone in the National Guard or \nin the U.S. military is talking about. It is the issue. The Senate is \nbeing silenced on it, even being prevented from debating whether we can \ntalk about making a simple statement that: Mr. President, you are \nwrong; don't escalate this war.\n  The truth is, our voices, quite frankly, are as important as our \nvotes. The President will find, if we have a full-blown debate on the \nfloor of the Senate, there are precious few people on this floor who \nthink he is handling this war correctly. Instead of escalating the war, \nwe should be drawing down our forces. I predict the American people \nhear, as I said, very few of our colleagues talking about what a good \nidea this is, what the President has in mind. So to echo the comments \nmade by my colleague from New York, if, in fact, we are precluded from \neven debating the issue of whether we oppose the President's escalation \nof the war, surely you are going to see more coming to the floor.\n  I have been working with the Senator from Massachusetts and others on \na\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\npiece of legislation that would literally rescind the President's \nauthority--the authority we gave him to go to war in the first place--\nand redefine the mission very narrowly.\n  Look, there is going to be a lot of discussion, whether we debate \ntoday or not, on Iraq. There is going to be a lot of discussion about \nwhat to do next. It will range from cutting off funding, to capping \ntroops, to a number of other proposals. The truth is, we are being \npresented with a false choice up to now. We are either told we have to \nstay the course and escalate the war or the other choice is to bring \nour troops home and hope for the best.\n  The truth is that none of this will matter. We are going to have to \nbring everybody home if they don't get a political solution in Iraq. \nThere is only one: a federal system. Listen to what their Constitution \nsays. Even the National Intelligence Estimate, the estimate of all of \nthe intelligence agencies, says--and I am paraphrasing it--that the \nSunnis have to accept regionalism and the Kurds and Shias have to give \nthe Sunnis a bigger piece of the action in order for them to do that.\n  I point out to everybody, when civil wars begin in other countries, \nthere are only a few things that stop them: One side wins and there is \ncarnage; two, an occupying force stays there indefinitely; or, three, \nyou end up in a situation where they have a federal state.\n  The President should get about the business of pursuing not a \nmilitary solution here but a political solution. He should be calling \nan international conference, getting all of the parties in a room, as \nwe did in Dayton, convincing our allies and the region that the only \noutcome that has any possibility of surviving is the federal state, as \ntheir Constitution calls for.\n  I conclude by saying that the American people expect--quite frankly, \nI think they demand--that we start to intelligently debate this subject \nrather than doing it by way of talk shows and Sunday appearances on TV. \nWe should be debating on this floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, over 3,000 Americans are dead--dead, \ndead--and over 23,000 Americans are wounded as a result of the war in \nIraq. Our military leaders say that our Armed Forces are stretched \nalmost to the breaking point. We have spent almost $400 billion, and \nthe number continues to go up, up, up. But the United States Senate is \nmired incredibly in a debate about the ability even to have a debate \nabout our Nation's future course in Iraq. Surely, no one in this Senate \ncan be so fearful of debate on a nonbinding resolution concerning the \nPresident's plan to send some 40,000 additional troops to Iraq that \nthey fail to hear the voices of over 70 percent of the American people \nout there who now oppose our involvement in this war. But apparently \nsome in the Senate are afraid of such a debate.\n  Some of my colleagues have indicated that they will vote against the \nmotion to proceed to debate on this straightforward resolution, which \nexpresses disagreement with the President's plan. While our brave \nfighting men and women put their lives on the line in Iraq, this Senate \nstands paralyzed--paralyzed, paralyzed, I say. The United States \nSenate--the greatest deliberative body in the whole world--is probably \nthe only place in this wonderful land of America where this debate is \nnot--is not--taking place.\n  How can some express unwavering support for the troops if they quake \nin the face of a debate about their safety? Our troops are stretched \nthin. They are weary after deployment and redeployment. Post-traumatic \nstress disorder and mental problems--yes--are rife in the troops. Lost \nlimbs and physical mutilation have scarred many of these young people \nfor life. Scores of families weep--yes, they weep--every night for \ntheir lost loved ones. And yet many in this Senate claim to support the \ntroops, while those same many steadfastly refuse to debate an ill-\nadvised escalation--yes, an ill-advised escalation--of this war which \nalmost nobody but nobody supports.\n  Can one claim support for the troops while acquiescing in a policy \nthat only sinks our forces deeper into a civil war? Can any of us look \nin the mirror while we stonewall the concerns of the American people \nand engage in some political fandango to prevent discussion of our \nengagement in Iraq?\n  Madam President, if it will help to bring our soldiers home, I will \nwork every Saturday for the rest of this Congress. I will stand here, \nright here on this floor, of this Senate every day, 24 hours every day \nif it would mean one less family without a son or a daughter. Hear me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, what happens to the time \nI am allocated under those circumstances?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for the Senator will be \nreserved. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Nothing, I say to my friend. I would not see anything \nhappen to the Senator's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, this is the most important issue facing \nAmerica, the land of the free and the home of the brave, and I stand \nwith my colleagues today to say enough, enough stalling, enough \nobfuscation. It is time for the people of America--yes, you people out \nthere in the mountains, the valleys, and across the rivers, across the \nmountain ranges, yes, the great Rockies--you people, it is time for you \nto know where every Senator stands on this war.\n  I will cast my vote with pride this afternoon, Madam President, in \nfavor of proceeding to this debate, and I hope that every one of my \ncolleagues joins me.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, with great respect for my friend from \nWest Virginia, the reason we are here is because the new majority \nrefuses to debate. They refuse to allow us to take up the amendments \nthat should be considered during this debate.\n  We have before us now a proposal drafted by the Rules Committee of \nthe House, presented to the House without debate and brought to us \nwithout debate, and we are told we are to be limited on the number of \namendments that will be considered to this measure.\n  It is an important subject to be debated, but why Saturday? This is \nthe start of the President's Day recess that was announced 6 weeks ago. \nIn order to try to embarrass the Members of this side--21 of us up for \nreelection--the leadership decided to have this debate today on a \nnonbinding resolution, which wouldn't accomplish anything, wouldn't \nbring any troops home, wouldn't announce our support for the troops, \njust to see whether we come back to vote.\n  The real problem is how do we get together in a Senate that has a \nmajority of one? Do we do it on the basis that every time something \ncomes from the House we are to be told no amendments will be in order? \nWe can't debate this question of whether we support the troops? We \ncan't support any other amendment to this resolution? We are to take \nthe matter that came from the House without debate from the Rules \nCommittee? It was not changed all the way through the House.\n  How many Senators on that side want to be a rubberstamp for the \nHouse? That is what you are starting. This is the third bill to come \nbefore us with the idea of no minority amendments are going to be \nconsidered unless the leadership on that side decides they should be \nconsidered.\n\n  Again, I tell you, Madam President, this is a defining moment of the \nSenate. This is a debating society. We should not be limited on the \nnumber of amendments that are considered, any more than we are limited \non the CR.\n  When I became chairman of the Appropriations Committee in 2001, there \nwere 11 bills pending that had not been passed by the former majority. \nWe brought them before the Senate in an omnibus bill, and every single \nbill was considered, one by one.\n  What did we do this time? We had one resolution which came over from \nthe House, and we passed it without any amendments. That is a formula \nfor the death of the Senate. There are people in this country who think \nwe should have a unicameral legislature.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I share the Senator's opinion because I would like to \ndebate him on some of these subjects but not\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\non a nonbinding resolution. Let's bring up a resolution that supports \nthe troops.\n  I directly contradict my good friend from West Virginia. The American \npeople support our troops in the field----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. ----and do not want us challenging them and trying to \nfind some way to deviate money from their support or deny them the \nsupport they deserve. I would love to stand here and talk for hours and \nhours with my friend about how to support the troops. You don't do it \nby asking them to disobey the President of the United States. You don't \ndo it by urging the Senate and the House not to support the President \nof the United States. You do it by trying to get together and working \non a bipartisan basis to solve our problems.\n  None of us like war. I said the other day I hate war. I have been \ninvolved in the consideration of too many wars in my life, but clearly \nthose people wearing our uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan need to know \nwe support them 100 percent, and we don't stand here and talk about how \nwe should find ways so they would not get their support, so we force \nthe President of the United States to bring them home.\n  We will bring them home with the new commander there and the new plan \nwe are going to put into effect, a plan that requires a surge for the \nsafety of the people there, to move in the country to carry out the \nplan.\n  I support the President, and I urge the Senate to do the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how long may I be recognized for? Two \nminutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, we all deeply respect \nSenator Byrd, but we are on a tight timeframe. I don't know how many \nminutes are left on that side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes remain for the previous \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was to be recognized at 1:25 p.m., and it is now \n1:27 p.m.; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order was delayed by \nintervening orders.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is some time at least remaining on the other \nside. I leave it up to my good friend, the majority whip, to sort that \nout.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thought we had 3 minutes remaining; is \nthat correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute has been consumed. There \nis 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since Senator Kennedy has asked for 1 minute, I will \nyield the 1 minute I requested to the Senator from West Virginia so \neach of the remaining two will speak--Senator Kennedy for 1 minute and \nSenator Byrd for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank our distinguished friend from \nIllinois. And I thank my longtime friend from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy.\n  I only rise to say that I have a binding resolution to bring our \ntroops home. I hope to see the day when we may vote on my resolution to \nbring American troops home--home, home.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All of us remember the elections. All of us remember \nPresident Bush saying: I am going to take my time and find a new \ndirection.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All of us remember he said: Do not rush me. I want to \ntalk to the generals. I want to talk to political leaders. I want to \ntalk to people all over this country and all over the world to find out \na new policy.\n  Then he comes out with this policy. And what is it? It is a military \npolicy to escalate in Iraq.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is the issue before the U.S. Senate. Many of us do \nnot believe that this President is right on it. The Baker-Hamilton \ncommission did not agree with that policy. General Abizaid did not \nagree with that policy before the Armed Services Committee. And the \nAmerican people don't.\n  We on this side are interested in protecting American servicemen from \nthe crossfire of a civil war. Some on the other side are more \ninterested in protecting the President from a rebuke for his policy of \nescalation in Iraq.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, 5 weeks ago, President Bush stood \nbefore the American people and acknowledged--acknowledged--the lack of \nprogress in Iraq. He outlined a new military strategy that was devised \nafter consultation with military commanders, national security leaders, \nand Members of Congress from both parties. He told us he had committed \nmore than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq to clear and secure the city \nof Baghdad and to protect its population.\n  As we meet today, the first of five waves of soldiers are carrying \nout this plan on the streets and in the alleys of Baghdad; the second \nis preparing to leave. These reinforcements have already given us \nreasons for hope. Soon after the President's announcement, U.S. Iraqi \nforces began to route key elements of the Mahdi army, the militia's \nleader fled his stronghold, and this week U.S. Iraqi forces have \nconducted sweeps through once violent Sunni neighborhoods with little \nresistance.\n  It is too early to say whether the surge will achieve its objective, \nbut General Petraeus and President Bush ask us to give the plan a \nchance to work, to support our troops in the field and those on their \nway. Until now, we have done that. Today--today--we are being asked to \ndo something entirely different.\n  The majority party in the Senate wants to vote on a resolution that \ncondemns the President's plan and which disagrees with General Petraeus \nwho said before he left for Iraq that additional troops are an \nessential part of achieving our goal. They are doing this 3 weeks after \nvoting, without dissent, to send General Petraeus on this mission. And \nthey are doing it in the form of a nonbinding resolution that will have \nno practical effect on the conduct of the war.\n  Americans have a right to demand why the Senate has not yet taken a \nclear stand on what most of us believe to be our last best chance at \nsuccess. So let us be clear at the outset of this debate about what is \ngoing on today and about what Republicans are fighting for today.\n  Republicans are fighting for the right of the American people to know \nwhere we stand. If you support the war, say so. If you don't, say so. \nBut you cannot say you are registering a vote in favor of our troops \nunless you pledge to support them with the funds they need to carry out \ntheir mission. Yet this is precisely--precisely--what the Democratic \nmajority would have us do today.\n  They demand Republicans cast a vote in favor of a nonsensical \nproposition that says we disapprove of the President's plan to deploy \nmore troops to Iraq, but we support the members of the Armed Forces who \nare serving there. A vote in support of the troops that is silent on \nthe question of funds is an attempt to have it both ways. So \nRepublicans are asking for an honest and open debate, and we are being \nblocked at every turn.\n  The majority party in the House has a stronger hand in determining \nwhat comes up for a vote. So yesterday they forced a vote on the same \nstay-the-course resolution that Democrats are now trying to put before \nthe Senate. Democrats have been clear about the strategy behind this \nresolution. They describe it as a slow bleed, a way of tying the hands \nof the Commander in Chief. The House said yesterday that it supports \nthe troops. Yet its leadership is preparing to deny the reinforcements \nthat those troops will need in the weeks and months ahead.\n  The Senate was created to block that kind of dealing, and today it \nstops at the doors of this Chamber. Even opponents of the war denounce \nthe tactics of the Democratic leadership.\n  In an editorial today, the New York Times, amazingly enough, called \nyesterday's House vote a ``clever maneuver to dress up a reduction in \ntroop\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nstrength as a `support the troops' measure.'' Adding, ``It takes no \ncourage or creativity,'' said the New York Times, ``for a politician to \nexpress continuing support for the troops and opposition to a vastly \nunpopular and unpromising military escalation.''\n  The Washington Post was rightly appalled in an editorial this morning \nby the slow-bleed strategy, calling it ``a crude hamstringing of the \nmilitary commanders and their ability to deploy troops.'' The Post \nexposed the details of Mr. Murtha's plan to add language to a war-\nfunding bill that would strangle the President's ability to get \nreinforcements to soldiers in the field all under the guise of having \nthem better prepared.\n  ``Why,'' the Post asks, ``doesn't Mr. Murtha strip the money out of \nthe appropriations bill? Something he is clearly free to do.'' Good \nquestion. And the astonishing answer comes from Mr. Murtha's own lips. \n``What we are saying,'' Congressman Murtha says, ``will be very hard to \nfind fault with.''\n  There is no place for this kind of chicanery at a time of war. Even \nsome of the President's most strident opponents know that. They know \nthe only vote that truly matters is a vote on whether to fund the \ntroops. That is the vote House Republicans were denied yesterday. That \nis the vote Senate Republicans and a growing number of clear-eyed \nobservers on both sides of this issue are demanding today. Let those of \nus who support the President's plan to win in Iraq say so. Let those \nwho oppose it also say so.\n\n  We will not be forced to vote for a resolution that says we support \nthe troops but does not ask us to seal that pledge with a promise to \nhelp them carry out their mission in the only way they can, which is by \nfunding their mission.\n  Madam President, has my time expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me additionally say that Senate \nRepublicans have been trying to have this debate now for several weeks. \nWe expected to have it week before last. We insist, however, on having \nthe debate in the Senate in the way debates are always carried out in \nthe Senate, in a fair and evenhanded way.\n  Our good friends on the other side of the aisle initially supported \nthe Biden proposal, which came out of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nWhen that appeared not to have enough support, they adopted the Warner-\nLevin proposal. When that appeared to be inconvenient, they switched \nagain and now support, I guess, what best can be called the Pelosi-Reid \nproposal, which they are attempting to get before the Senate today.\n  All along the way, for the last few weeks, Senate Republicans have \nbeen consistent in asking for a fair debate, and a fair debate \nincludes, at the very least, one alternative supported by a majority of \nSenate Republicans. The one alternative we settled on was Senator \nGregg's proposal to guarantee that we support funding for the troops. \nThis fundamental unfairness and unwillingness to allow the Senate to \nvote on arguably the most significant issue confronting the troop \nsurge, which is whether it is going to be funded, is the reason this \nstalemate has occurred.\n  I am optimistic, and I certainly hope that Senate Republicans will \ncontinue to insist on fair treatment in debating what is clearly, \nunambiguously, the most important issue confronting the country today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we all know it is rare for the Senate to \nhold a Saturday vote, but the issue before us is too important to wait. \nThere are challenges facing America today, but there is no greater \nchallenge facing America today than finding a new direction in Iraq.\n  Every Senator in this Chamber has a responsibility and an obligation \nto say whether they support or oppose the President's plan to escalate \nthe war. Yesterday the House of Representatives acted, 246 to 180, no \nescalation. Now it is the turn of this body, the Senate, to give advice \nto the President that he is wrong in sending tens of thousands more \nAmerican soldiers to a civil war in far away Iraq.\n  In a few moments, a vote will occur on a straightforward resolution \nwhich simply states that we support our troops and oppose escalation of \nthe intractable Iraq war. My colleagues on the other side of this \nSenate Chamber, colleagues who blocked an Iraq debate last week, have a \nchoice to make. Do they intend to join the American people in opposing \nmore of the same in Iraq or do they intend to continue to give the \nPresident a green light to escalate the war? Let the debate proceed. \nLet the Senate express its views on the issue of our time.\n  This month, the Iraq war has cost the lives of three American \nsoldiers every day, putting us on pace for the bloodiest February since \nthe war began. It is threatening our Nation's strategic interests and \nrisking our Nation's security. Today, America has lost 3,133 soldiers \nin the streets and highways of a place called Iraq.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mr. REID. We have seen tens of thousands more wounded. The war has \nstrained our military and depleted our Treasury of almost $500 billion.\n  The Iraqis are dying at a rate of 100 a day in a vicious sectarian \ncivil war. Two million Iraqis have left their own country.\n  By every measure, the administration's failures have put us into a \ndeep hole in Iraq. Yet the President's new old plan--escalation, more \nof the same--won't get us out of the hole. It will only dig the hole \ndeeper.\n  Our generals, the Iraq Study Group, and the Iraqis themselves have \ntold us that escalation will only make Iraq worse, intensify our costs, \nand require even greater sacrifices from the American troops, many of \nwhom are being sent to Baghdad today without the proper armor and \nproper equipment and the training they need.\n  On this issue--escalation, more of the same--the Senate must speak. \nThe Senate, on behalf of the American people, must make it clear to the \nCommander in Chief that he no longer has a rubberstamp. We must show \nthe American people that the Senate heard their message last November \n7, and we, as Senators, are fighting for a new direction for the \n134,000 troops already in Iraq and the 48,000 additional troops the \nPresident would send.\n  The Senate owes as much to these soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines. We must proceed with this debate and change the course of a \nwar that has raged going into 5 years now.\n  I know some would like to cloud the debate. I know some would like to \ndelay the debate. I know some would like to have a different debate. I \nknow some would like to have no debate. Most of the Republican minority \nwishes to protect President Bush from an embarrassing vote. They are \ntrying to divert attention from the issue at hand. They would like to \nturn the Senate into a procedural quagmire. They want to hide behind \nweak and misleading arguments about the Senate's rules or a Senator's \nright to offer amendments. These arguments are diversions.\n  Today's vote is about more than procedure. It is an opportunity to \nsend a powerful message: The Senate will no longer sit on the sidelines \nwhile our troops police an ugly civil war in a nation far away. The \nissue before America today is escalation. The issue before the Senate \ntoday is escalation. That is why the Senate's responsibility must be to \nvote on escalation and whether the so-called surge is supported or \nopposed.\n  This is the choice: More war or less war. I applaud the courage of a \nfew hardy Republicans who will vote cloture and allow this vote to \noccur.\n  As I said, most of the Republican minority wish to protect President \nBush from this vote. They intend to vote for what is best for their \npolitical party. But as President John Fitzgerald Kennedy said, \n``Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.''\n  Today in the Senate, Republican party loyalty asks too much. In the \nSenate this Saturday, this February 17, today is the time for Senators \nto vote for openness, for transparency, to show their constituents in \nall 50 States: Do our Senators support or oppose sending 48,000 more \nUnited States soldiers and marines into the darkness of Iraq?\n  During the week we heard speeches about supporting our troops. The \nbest\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\nway to support the troops is to ensure they have a strategy that will \nlet them complete their mission so they can come home. We need a new \ndirection in Iraq. Escalation is not the answer. More of the same is \nnot the answer. The answer is to tell the President: Not more war but \nless war.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote cloture and thus vote to change course \nin this bloody war now raging 7,500 miles from this Senate Chamber and \nour beloved United States Capitol.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, pursuant \nto rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture \nmotion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 574, a bill to express the sense of Congress on \n     Iraq.\n         Ben Nelson, Russell D.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor PFC Arva ``Marie'' \nJohnson, who recently retired from the United States Capitol Police \nforce after more than 32 years of dedicated service.\n  Marie Johnson made history on October 15, 1974, when she became the \nfirst woman to serve as a uniformed officer of the U.S. Capitol Police. \nShe also holds the distinction of being the first African-American \nwoman hired by the USCP to serve in a law enforcement capacity.\n  This could not have been an easy achievement. At the time, the force \ndid not have locker room facilities or even uniforms designed for \nfemale officers. But Johnson brought real commitment to the job and a \npositive attitude that helped her earn respect among her colleagues.\n  When asked about her historic role in paving the way for female and \nblack officers in the U.S. Capitol Police Force, Marie Johnson said ``I \ndidn't mean to do it, it just happened.''\n  I believe Marie Johnson is being modest. In fact, she was a founding \nmember of the United States Capitol Black Police Association, an \norganization that advocates fair hiring practices and performance \nstandards in the Capitol Police Force. The Association seeks to \neliminate the barriers that limited the ability of African Americans to \npursue careers in law enforcement.\n  The Capitol Police Force has a very different face now then it did \nwhen Marie Johnson joined in 1974. Today there are more than 120 black \nfemale officers on the force.\n  Marie Johnson is a pioneer. Her long career is a testament to her \ndetermination and strong work ethic. As a Member of the Senate, I am \nindebted to those who, like Marie Johnson, put their lives on the line \nto protect our security here, in this historic building. I commend \nMarie Johnson on her long and distinguished career. I know my \ncolleagues will join me in wishing her and her family the very best in \nthe years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/17/senate-section/article/S2200-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2200-S2201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, next week, on February 22, while the Senate \nis on recess, my senior colleague and friend Ted Kennedy will celebrate \nhis 75th birthday, all of this in a year in which he has already marked \nan extraordinary milestone--45 years of service to Massachusetts and \nhis country in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Kennedy began his career setting a high standard when it \ncomes to birthdays. It was when he reached the minimum constitutional \nage, 30, that he first came to the Senate--1 of just 16 Senators \nelected at such a tender age from a total of over 1,895 Senators in all \nof American history. By his 70th birthday he was one of just 28 \nSenators to ever cast over 10,000 votes.\n  But what we celebrate along with Ted at 75--Democrats and \nRepublicans, all in awe of a lifetime of achievement--is the way in \nwhich literally every year since he has been marking the passage of \ntime by passing landmark legislation.\n  The Boston Globe put it best, writing not long ago that ``in actual, \nmeasurable impact on the lives of tens of millions of working families, \nthe elderly, and the needy, Ted belongs in the same sentence with \nFranklin Roosevelt.''\n  That sentence is not constructed lightly--it is the measure of a \npublic servant who doesn't know the meaning of the words ``you can't \npass it''--``it can't happen''--``impossible.''\n  It is the measure of a Senator who--on every issue of importance: \nhealth care, war and peace, children, education, civil rights, the \nrights of women--can always be counted on to be in the lead, \nchallenging on the issues, and fighting for the principles which guide \na party and lift up our country.\n  From his maiden speech in the Senate demanding an end to the \nfilibuster of the original Civil Rights Act, there has not been a \nsignificant policy accomplishment in Washington over four decades that \nhasn't borne his fingerprints and benefited from his legislative skill \nand leadership. His is the record of progressive politics in our era. \nOn all the great fights that call us to stand up and be counted, from \nthe minimum wage to Robert Bork and Sam Alito, Ted didn't just hear the \ncall to duty he led the charge.\n  Run down the list--the rights of the disabled a most personal cause \nfor Ted--who for far too long were left in the shadows or left to fend \nfor themselves, Ted Kennedy wrote every landmark piece of legislation \nthat today prohibits discrimination against those with a disability.\n  AIDS--when a whole lot of politicians were afraid to say the word, \nTed passed a bill providing emergency relief to the thirteen cities \nhardest hit by the AIDS epidemic.\n  Guaranteed access to health coverage for 25 million Americans who \nmove from one job to another or have preexisting medical conditions \nwouldn't have happened without Ted Kennedy.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, there wouldn't have been a bilingual education \nin the United States for the 5 million students who today have a \nbrighter future because they are learning English in our schools.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, we wouldn't have lowered the voting age to 18 \nand ended the hypocrisy that 18-year-olds were old enough to die for \ntheir country in Vietnam but not old enough to vote for its leadership \nat home.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, we wouldn't be the world's leader in cancer \nresearch and prevention--as personal and meaningful an issue as there \nis in all the world for Ted Kennedy, not just a father, but a loving \nfather of two cancer survivors.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, we wouldn't have had title XI which opened the \ndoors of competition and opportunity to a generation of women athletes \nall across our country.\n  Ted is such an extraordinary public servant not only because he knows \nwho he is, and sticks to his guns, never bending with the political \ncurrents, but because he has in his life and in his career proven again \nand again that progress doesn't happen by accident, it doesn't happen \nwhen you stick to the text of the latest opinion poll or the whispers \nof the morning focus group; it happens when leaders define and fight \nthe fights that need fighting--when public servants of conscience and \nconviction refuse to take no for an answer. That is why for Ted \nKennedy, the ``cause'' has not just ``endured''--but triumphed, again \nand again.\n  Agree with him or not, and we all know that Ted has never been afraid \nto be a majority of one, Ted is such an extraordinary leader because he \nhas excelled while completing the work in the U.S. Senate that so many \nothers were afraid to begin.\n  And, in being a standard-bearer for an ideal, an ideology, a view of \nthe world, Ted has also become--as Clymer wrote--``not just the leading \nsenator of his time, but one of the greats in its history, wise in the \nworkings of this singular institution, especially its demand to be more \nthan partisan to accomplish much.''\n  His partnerships with his fellow Senators are well-known and oft-\nrecited, testimony to his skill and to his convictions. From Howard \nBaker, Jacob Javits, and Hugh Scott to Arlen Specter, Dan Quayle, Orrin \nHatch, Alan Simpson, and Nancy Kassebaum and John McCain--Ted has never \nhesitated to cross the aisle to accomplish his goals--to further a \ncommon agenda--finding always--that ideologies, however incompatible in \nthe currency of conventional wisdom--can be put aside for a greater \ngood when Senators--however different--work in good faith to make their \ncountry a better place, to improve the lives of their fellow Americans.\n  Ted has always believed you can put aside partisanship--overcome \ndivision--and that faith in the ability to come together has mattered \nmost in some of the most trying and divisive times our Nation has \nendured.\n  I don't just say this; I have lived it. Through the eyes of an \nactivist, there is often a shocking and gaping gap between those in \npolitics who talk the\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\ntalk and those who walk the walk. It has been that way on Iraq; it was \nthat way in the days of Vietnam. But I remember to this day that more \nthan 35 years ago, after I had committed my life to organizing my \nfellow veterans to end the war, too few of our leaders were willing to \nlisten, and even fewer were willing to stand with those Vietnam \nveterans who were standing up against the war. April, 1971--thousands \nupon thousands of veterans gathered on the Mall. The Nixon White House \nspread rumors that the veterans would riot and turn violent. The \nadministration even tried to kick us off The Mall. And on that \ndifficult night, when we didn't know if we were going to jail or we \nwere going to demonstrate as we had come here to do, Ted Kennedy was \namong the brave few Senators who walked down from his office to sit and \ntalk and listen to veterans who describe the realities they had found \nin Vietnam and why that war had to end.\n  He reached out and demonstrated--in his actions as well as his \nwords--that we had a right to tell truths many would have preferred we \nleft unspoken, government had a responsibility to listen.\n  He is listening still--to the voices his conscience tells him must \nnever be ignored.\n  He hears of children who go through their early years without health \ncare and come to school unable to learn. And he has made their care his \ncrusade. And so millions more children see a doctor today because of \nTed Kennedy--and millions more will before he is done.\n  He hears of workers punching a time clock--doing backbreaking work \nover the course of a lifetime. And he has made their economic security \nhis agenda. And so millions of workers have seen wages increased over \npartisan objections, seen pensions protected when others said leave it \nto the market, seen Social Security protected while others said \nprivatize it, and seen a safe workplace and the right to organize put \nback on the Nation's agenda--and these issues will again and again be \nadvanced by Ted Kennedy.\n  That is the drive--the passion--the special commitment we celebrate \ntoday--not a new ideology or a new age vision, but an age old belief \nthat Americans have a responsibility to each other--that America is \nstill in the process of becoming--and that we are privileged to serve \nhere to make that dream real for all Americans.\n  Ted Kennedy is the most prolific legislator in American history, but \nhe is something more. Robert Kennedy once said the most meaningful word \nin all the English language is ``citizen.'' No one has lived out the \nmeaning of that most meaningful word more than his younger brother.\n  For that and so much more that makes this 75th birthday special, we \nhonor our friend, our colleague, and a great citizen, Ted Kennedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/17/senate-section/article/S2201-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2201-S2202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FRANK AND BETHINE CHURCH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, I had the \ngreat privilege of serving with Senator Frank Church of Idaho. Marcelle \nand I were also privileged to spend time with both Frank and his \nwonderful wife Bethine. The two of them were extraordinarily helpful to \nthis 34-year-old Senator from Vermont.\n  Frank Church was a Senator in the very best sense of the word. He \nthought of the Senate as a place where one should, first and foremost, \nstand for our country and make it a better place. Certainly his \nbrilliance, conscience, and patriotism made his service here one that \nbenefited not only the Senate, but the Nation.\n  Last year, the Idaho Statesman published an article that so reflected \nBethine Church that I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord so that those in the Senate who served with Senator Church and \nknew him and Bethine, as well as those who did not have the opportunity \nto know them, can have this glimpse into their lives.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the IdahoStatesman.com, Oct. 13, 2006]\n\n       Bethine Church is the widow of four-term U.S. Sen. Frank \n     Church. Get a narrated tour of her life and times as she \n     describes collected photographs from the couple's public and \n     private lives. See photos of Castro, Brando, Jackie Kennedy \n     and more.\n       In a game room in Boise's East End, the walls really do \n     talk.\n       Bethine Church, the widow of four-term U.S. Sen. Frank \n     Church, has collected photographs from the couple's public \n     and private lives. Every image has a story--of world travel \n     on behalf of the government, of encounters with celebrities, \n     of heads of state and high political drama, of love and loss \n     and family, of home in the Idaho mountains.\n       Frank Church was the most influential Idaho politician \n     ever. He served 24 years in the U.S. Senate, the lone Idaho \n     Democrat to win more than one term. He chaired the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee. In 1976 he was a serious \n     candidate for president, looking briefly like the only man \n     able to deny Jimmy Carter the Democratic nomination. He \n     helped pass the Wilderness Act in 1964. He was an early \n     critic of the Vietnam War, and investigated CIA and FBI \n     abuses, forcing reforms that some now question in the post-9/\n     11 era.\n       I'd seen the pictures over the years, when Church hosted \n     events for Democratic luminaries like Tipper Gore. The walls \n     are chockablock with presidents (FDR, JFK and LBJ), prime \n     ministers (Golda Meir of Israel), kings (Juan Carlos of \n     Spain), dictators (Fidel Castro of Cuba and Deng Xiaoping of \n     China) and celebrities (Jimmy Durante, Marlon Brando, John \n     Wayne). There are family snaps of the Robinson Bar Ranch, the \n     Middle Fork Salmon River and the grand home at 109 W. Idaho \n     St., where Bethine lived when her father, Chase Clark, was \n     governor in the 1940s.\n       But I hadn't heard her inimitable narration. I finally got \n     the chance when my editor asked me to gather string for an \n     obituary on the grandame of Idaho politics. Church, 83, \n     happily gave the E Ticket tour to me and photographer Darin \n     Oswald. No waiting lines, but the ride took four hours.\n       Several days later, she called, saying, ``I'd so like to \n     see what you're up to. Do we really have to wait until I'm \n     dead?'' My editors chewed on that, deciding she was right: \n     There was no good reason to delay. Today, at \n     IdahoStatesman.com, Church brings the pictures to life in an \n     audio-visual presentation designed by Oswald's colleague, \n     Chris Butler. We chose today because at 11:45 a.m., the U.S. \n     Forest Service is holding a renaming ceremony at the Galena \n     Overlook in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area. The \n     viewpoint is one of Idaho's great vistas. From today on, it \n     will honor Bethine and Frank Church, both of whom had the \n     vision to protect the Sawtooths.\n       Driving to Robinson Bar over Galena Summit more than 30 \n     years ago, the Churches looked down on a subdivision. ``This \n     can't happen,'' said Sen. Church. Working with his Republican \n     colleagues, Sen. Len Jordan and Reps. Jim McClure and Orval \n     Hansen, Church got the bill creating the Sawtooth National \n     Recreation Area through Congress in 1972. Had they failed, \n     the Sawtooth valley would be dotted with vacation mansions.\n       Frank Church has been out of office 25 years, dead 22. \n     Bethine contemplated suicide while watching him die of \n     cancer, but he told her she had responsibilities. He was \n     right. She founded the Sawtooth Society, which has led \n     private conservation efforts in the SNRA; her support of Rep. \n     Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, has aided his push to expand SNRA \n     wilderness into the Boulder and White Cloud mountains; she \n     helped create the Frank Church Institute at BSU that supports \n     a scholar and hosts a world-class annual conference.\n       Church took a fall recently that put her in the hospital \n     one night. But she still entertains, negotiating her kitchen \n     in a cane and sitting on a step stool to cook. She lustily \n     talks of a life devoted to making Idaho and the world better.\n       Bethine grew up in Mackay and Idaho Falls, where her lawyer \n     father represented copper mining companies and criminal \n     defendants.\n       From her parents she learned a novel way of speaking, \n     including her mother's strongest curse, ``It just freezes my \n     preserves,'' and her Pop's putdown, ``He's as worthless as \n     teats on a boar.''\n       From there she went to the salons of Washington, D.C., and \n     the far reaches of the globe. But they didn't take the Idaho \n     out of Bethine. After a reception for French President \n     Charles De Gaulle, the Churches gathered at the home of a \n     Senate colleague, Joe Clark, with Adlai Stevenson, the U.N. \n     Ambassador, a former governor and the Democratic presidential \n     nominee in 1952 and 1956.\n       Stevenson's intellectual heft was legend; he was mocked by \n     Richard Nixon as an ``egghead,'' and voters twice chose \n     Dwight Eisenhower. But Bethine showed no reluctance to say \n     what was on her champagne-sparkled mind: She discussed the \n     relative preponderance of outhouses in Idaho and West \n     Virginia. ``I guess I sounded like I sound now,'' she said, \n     laughing. ``I said exactly what came into my head and somehow \n     Frank survived it.''\n       Bethine Church was a true partner to her politician \n     husband, not simply a prop. She has a knack for remembering \n     names, something she learned from her dad. ``Pop taught me \n     that everybody, from the waitress to the people working in \n     the kitchen, is as important as the people sitting on the \n     dais.''\n       She often prompted the senator's memory, and was his most \n     valued confidant. Had Church won his last-minute race for \n     president in 1976 in the wake of Watergate, Bethine would \n     have been an involved First\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\n     Lady. ``If there had been tapes,'' she crowed, ``I would have \n     been on them!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/17/senate-section/article/S2202-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on February 1, I went to the funeral mass \nfor Robert F. Drinan, SJ. Rarely have I been so moved at such at a \nsolemn occasion. This was a joyous celebration of a wonderful man's \nlife.\n  I knew Bob Drinan before he was a Member of Congress and was referred \nto as the ``conscience of the Congress.'' I was a young college student \nwhen he recruited me to go to Boston College Law School. To make it \nbetter, he even offered a scholarship, and as a student with absolutely \nno money, this was most appealing. I finally called Father Drinan and \ntold him I was going to Georgetown Law School because I especially \nwanted to be in Washington. He chuckled and said he was giving me \nabsolution, insofar as it was a Jesuit institution.\n  Throughout the more than 40 years since then, he and I talked often \nand had some of the most wonderful visits. His interests in life, the \nUnited States, the Jesuit mission, and his friends never faded. The \nlast time we saw each other was when I gave a speech in December at the \nGeorgetown Law School, and he came by to hug and greet both Marcelle \nand me.\n  I will not try to repeat all of the wonderful things said about him, \nbut I do ask unanimous consent that a tribute to him by Colman McCarthy \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Father Drinan, Model of Moral Tenacity\n\n                          (By Colman McCarthy)\n\n       If you've ever wondered whether God laughs, think back to \n     1980, when the Rev. Robert Drinan was ordered by Pope John \n     Paul II to get out of politics and leave Congress. The Jesuit \n     priest, who died on Sunday, was finishing his fifth term \n     representing a suburban Boston district that included \n     Cambridge and Brookline. The pope had been hearing from \n     rankled conservative American Catholics--the Pat Buchanan, \n     William F. Buckley Jr., William Bennett wing of the church--\n     that Father Drinan, a purebred Democrat, was a dangerous \n     liberal. His voting record on abortion was seen as too pro-\n     choice.\n       Father Drinan's presence in the House of Representatives \n     had been sanctioned by the previous pope, Paul VI, as well as \n     by the U.S. episcopate, the cardinal of Boston, his own \n     Jesuit superiors and emphatically by the voters in his \n     district.\n       No matter.\n       John Paul, knowing that Jesuits take a vow of loyalty to \n     popes, had his way. And who replaced the dangerously liberal \n     Father Drinan? The more dangerously liberal Barney Frank--as \n     ardent an advocate for abortion rights and as he was for gay \n     rights. If there is a God, the Frank-for-Drinan trade surely \n     had Him laughing at the Vatican's expense.\n       From Congress, Bob Drinan went a few blocks to Georgetown \n     University Law Center.\n       It was a natural transition, from practicing the politics \n     of peace and justice to teaching it. His classes on human \n     rights law, constitutional law and legal ethics were \n     routinely oversubscribed. Though I had met him before his \n     days in Congress, when he served as dean of Boston College \n     Law School, it was at Georgetown Law that our friendship \n     grew. My classes there for the past 20 years have attracted \n     the same kind of students that his did--future public-\n     interest lawyers, poverty lawyers, human-rights lawyers, and, \n     in good years, a future Jack Olender or William Kunstler.\n       After my Tuesday afternoon class, I would often go by Bob \n     Drinan's fourth-floor office to get energized. I saw him as a \n     towering moral giant, a man of faith whose practice of \n     Christianity put him in the company of all my Jesuit heroes--\n     Daniel Berrigan, Horace McKenna, Teilhard de Chardin, John \n     Dear, Francis Xavier, the martyred Jesuits of El Salvador and \n     the priests who taught me in college. In his office, \n     ferociously unkempt and as tight as a monk's cell, our \n     conversation ranged from politics to law to the morning's \n     front pages. He was as knowledgeable about the Torture Victim \n     Protection Act of 1991 as he was about the many allegations \n     of international lawbreaking by the current Bush \n     administration. Bob Drinan had mastered the art of being \n     professionally angry but personally gentle.\n       As a priest, he was a pastor-at-large. He was at the altar \n     at journalist Mary McGrory's funeral Mass. He celebrated the \n     Nuptial Mass at the marriage of Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) \n     and his wife, Lisa. And always, there were plenty of \n     baptisms. As a writer, he produced a steady flow of books on \n     human rights, poverty and social justice. He saved his most \n     fiery writing for the National Catholic Reporter, the \n     progressive weekly to which he contributed a regular column. \n     His final one appeared on Dec. 15, a piece about the 26th \n     anniversary of the martyrdom in El Salvador of Maryknoll \n     Sister Ita Ford.\n       The column began: ``In the 1980s I gave a lecture at Jesuit \n     Regis High School in New York City, where the students are \n     all on scholarship. I spoke about the war being waged by the \n     Reagan administration against the alleged communists of El \n     Salvador.\n       ``In the discussion period, three students took issue with \n     my remarks, making it clear that they and their families \n     agreed with the U.S. policy of assisting the Salvadoran \n     government. The atmosphere was almost hostile until one \n     student stood and related that his aunt, Maryknoll Sister Ita \n     Ford, had been murdered by agents of the government of El \n     Salvador. I have seldom if ever witnessed such an abrupt \n     change in the atmosphere of a meeting.''\n       One of my students at Georgetown Law last semester was also \n     one of Father Drinan's: Chris Neumeyer, a former high school \n     teacher from California. His father, Norris Neumeyer, was in \n     town earlier this month and wanted to meet his hero, Father \n     Drinan. The two lucked out and found the priest in his \n     office. Yesterday, Norris Neumeyer, after learning of the \n     priest's death, e-mailed his son and recalled asking if \n     Father Drinan knew his often-jailed fellow Jesuit Daniel \n     Berrigan and his brother Philip. He did. The difference \n     between himself and the Berrigans, Father Drinan believed, \n     was that they took action outside the system while he took \n     action inside.\n       Papal meddling aside, it was enduring action.\n\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/17/senate-section/article/S2202-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2202-S2203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CLAUDIA BECKER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont is constantly made a better \nplace by some of the extraordinary people who come there and add to the \ntalents of our State.\n  One such person is Claudia Becker. She has restored the Big Picture \nTheater in Waitsfield along with her husband Eugene Jarecki. The \ntheater has become a center for the people of the Mad River Valley, and \nClaudia has shown a sense of conscience in films she has shown at Big \nPicture.\n  Marcelle and I have been privileged to know Claudia for years and her \nhusband Eugene for years before that. Marcelle, as an acting justice of \nthe peace, even performed their marriage. We have enjoyed watching \ntheir home grow in Vermont, as well as the addition of two of the most \nbeautiful children anyone could wish for.\n  Recently, Seven Days in Vermont wrote an article about Claudia and \nwhat she has done with her film festival. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    ``Big'' Deal--Film Fest Founder Claudia Becker Gets the Picture\n\n                           (By Candice White)\n\n       On a recent sunny afternoon, several cars, many with ski \n     racks, pulled into a large dirt parking lot at the corner of \n     Route 100 and Carroll Road in Waitsfield. Children pulled off \n     brightly colored ski hats and unzipped puffy jackets as they \n     led their parents through sturdy wood doors. Above, bold red \n     and black letters inscribed on a round, Art Deco-style clock \n     identified the building as the Big Picture Theater.\n       Inside, the petite proprietor, Claudia Becker, was hustling \n     from one task to another. She swept the wooden floor of the \n     large, windowed cafe-lounge, dusted the player piano, crossed \n     to the carpeted hallway to help an employee count a cash \n     drawer, and answered both the theater phone and the personal \n     cell phone hooked to her corduroys.\n       A young man and his blonde girlfriend--friends visiting \n     from Becker's native Germany--appeared and greeted her. After \n     a quick exchange of words in German, the man walked behind \n     the bar to the kitchen area and began polishing silver, while \n     his girlfriend took over the broom. Becker darted back to the \n     concessions area and, with a warm smile, greeted the line of \n     customers arriving for a 4 p.m. matinee of Charlotte's Web.\n       The past year has been a whirlwind for Becker, 39, in her \n     new role as owner of the Big Picture Theater. When she bought \n     and renovated the former Eclipse Theater last spring, she \n     already had a full plate: two children under the age of 6, a \n     marriage to filmmaker Eugene Jarecki (The Trials of Henry \n     Kissinger, Why We Fight), and an acclaimed film fest. Lately, \n     Becker's velocity has increased as she gears up for the \n     fourth annual Mountaintop Film Festival. The human-rights-\n     based marathon runs at the theater starting this Wednesday, \n     January 10, through Sunday, January 14.\n       The fest presents 10 documentary films and three dramas, \n     all addressing issues of national and international concern, \n     from the toll of the Iraq war to Bombay's child sex trade to \n     civil disobedience during the Vietnam War. It showcases \n     personalities, too. The opening night gala features a \n     reception with filmmaker Henrietta Mantel before the \n     showing of her film on Ralph Nader, An Unreasonable Man. A \n     Q with Nader himself\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\n     via lcam follows. Olympia Dukakis, who stars in the drama \n     Day on Fire, is expected to make an appearance at one of \n     her two film screenings (Thursday and Saturday at 8 p.m.). \n     Filmmakers James Longley (Iraq in Fragments), Milena \n     Kaneva (Total Denial), and Alex Gibney (Enron: The Movie) \n     are all scheduled to appear. And Jarecki, whose 2005 doc \n     Why We Fight won a grand jury prize at Sundance, will \n     teach a three-hour media lab on Sunday at 1 p.m. Three \n     nights of live music and a Friday night community potluck \n     dinner round out the five days of brainy cinema.\n       Mountaintop grew out of a serendipitous meeting five years \n     ago between Becker and Kimberly Ead, now festival manager. At \n     the time, Becker was a teacher--she holds a master's degree \n     in special education from the University of Munich--and an \n     informal consultant to her husband's filmmaking. But she was \n     looking for new pursuits that would express her ``deep sense \n     of political concern.'' Ead, who was working on antiwar \n     issues at Burlington's Peace and Justice Center, offered just \n     that. ``Claudia and I really connected,'' Ead remembers. ``We \n     combined her contacts in the film industry and my work as an \n     activist to create the festival.''\n       Both women have a strong commitment to educating youth \n     about film and filmmaking, and it shows in the festival. This \n     year, students from area high schools, including Harwood \n     Union, Mt. Mansfield, Burlington and Vergennes, will be \n     bussed in for special screenings. ``I'd like to add more \n     educational components to the theater,'' Becker says, looking \n     to the future, ``like a media literacy program and a \n     documentary filmmaking program.''\n       And the future looks bright, judging by the success of the \n     festival so far. Becker points to an increase in ``the level \n     of recognition. . . and in the turnout. The festival has \n     established itself as one of the premier film festivals in \n     Vermont.''\n       One positive change is that the fest is no longer a \n     renter--this is the first year Becker has owned its venue. \n     After the previous owners shut their doors, Waitsfield locals \n     kept talking about the need for a community space. Becker \n     decided she needed to buy the theater and make it a viable \n     epicenter of the Mad River Valley. Vowing to spend every last \n     dime she had, she purchased the building, hired a \n     construction crew, and began a major renovation.\n       In May 2006, Becker re-opened the theater and unveiled the \n     transformed space: an open-kitchen cafe with a full bar, old-\n     fashioned soda fountain, and Internet lounge; a newly \n     renovated smaller theater with flexible seating, to be used \n     for both movie showings and community events; and a largely \n     untouched traditional movie theater.\n       Becker's vision for the aptly named Big Picture was a \n     ``local gathering place with a global dimension,'' she says. \n     ``And I wanted the name to reflect my personal desire for \n     teaching, discourse and thought exchange.''\n       Her political beliefs aren't just talk. Becker demonstrates \n     her commitment to the ``local'' by letting organizations rent \n     the space at a price that often just covers her costs. To \n     accommodate area events, she formed a partnership with the \n     nonprofit Open Hearth Community Center, which ``wouldn't have \n     a home without Claudia,'' says Open Hearth program manager \n     Kirstin Reilly. ``She has worked with the board to create a \n     space that is useful for the community's needs.''\n       Becker has brought an eclectic mix of first-run and \n     documentary films, thought-provoking discussions, music, \n     comedy and art exhibits to Big Picture. Last fall, New \n     Hampshire comedian Cindy Pierce drew a huge crowd for her \n     show on the mysteries of women's sexuality. Soon after, the \n     theater filled up again for a discussion of international \n     security issues with former U.N. weapons inspector Scott \n     Ritter.\n       Becker says she's still working on balancing her political \n     passions with the need to turn a profit. ``It has been a real \n     learning experience to find what works and what doesn't,'' \n     she admits. ``Live music continues to be a challenge. But \n     when we bring in a political speaker, the place is \n     packed.''\n       Becker seems to have found a management style that suits \n     her: a nonhierarchical organization that still allows her to \n     jump in and be the boss when needed. And when friends and \n     family visit, they're put to work. Jarecki is often seen \n     pouring beers behind the bar. The couple's daughter Anna has \n     baked cookies to sell in the cafe.\n       ``When I was hiring, I was very careful to find people who \n     had a positive attitude and a predisposition for \n     multitasking,'' Becker says. Her core team is composed of \n     women: Ead; theater manager Jo-Anne Billings; and chef Amanda \n     Astheimer, who aims to deliver on Becker's international \n     culinary vision. Several men work as projectionists and \n     concessions staff.\n       All hands will be on deck during this week's film festival. \n     ``I am looking forward to it all being over, just so I can \n     take a breath,'' Becker says.\n       But she also recognizes that a busy theater is the best \n     reward. Becker defines success as ``seeing people having a \n     great time; working with and within the community; feeling \n     that I am doing something that is greater than myself.'' If \n     she can bring new issues and ideas to filmgoers' attention, \n     so much the better.\n       ``I want to open people's minds and inspire discourse,'' \n     Becker says. ``I don't believe I can have an impact on what \n     people do with the information, but I feel it is important to \n     get it out there.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/17/senate-section/article/S2203-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GREEN MOUNTAIN COFFEE ROASTERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure air \npassengers have access to necessary services while on a grounded air \ncarrier and are not unnecessarily held on a grounded air carrier before \nor after a flight, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nOlympia Snowe to introduce ``The Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act \nof 2007,'' a bill which addresses an issue recently in the news--\nairlines trapping passengers on the ground in delayed planes for hours \nand hours without adequate food, water or bathrooms.\n  This week, at John F. Kennedy International Airport, a JetBlue \nairplane sat on the tarmac for 11 hours. Over this New Year's Eve \nweekend, American Airlines had to divert planes to Austin because of \nthe bad weather and one plane sat on the tarmac for nine hours.\n  For the passengers, the conditions were not good. There was not \nenough food and potable water, and the bathrooms stopped working. \nAccording to news reports, after waiting for five hours an elderly \nwoman asked for food and was told she could purchase a snack box for \n$4.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  I have been stuck on the tarmac many times in my travel back and \nforth to California. Weather delays are unavoidable, but airlines must \nhave a plan to ensure that their passengers--which often include \ninfants and the elderly--are not trapped on a plane for hours and \nhours. If a plane is stuck on the tarmac or at the gate for hours, a \npassenger should have the right to deplane. No one should be held \nhostage on an aircraft when an airline can clearly find a way to get \npassengers off safely.\n  This is not the first time that passengers have been trapped on an \nairplane an extreme amount of time. In 1999, after a Northwest plane \nwas delayed on the tarmac for at least nine hours with the same poor \nconditions, many Members of Congress were outraged and several \nintroduced comprehensive passenger bill of rights legislation.\n  While those bills did not become law, they had a powerful effect on \nthe airlines, which agreed to a 12-point ``Airline Customer Service \nPlan.'' In the plan, the airlines committed to providing passengers \nwith better information about ticket prices and delays, better efforts \nto retrieve lost luggage, fairer ``bumping'' policies and to meeting \nessential needs during long on-aircraft delays. And since 1999 the \nairlines have made improvements to passenger service.\n  But in recent years, as the industry has grown ever more competitive, \nairlines are increasingly operating with no margin of error. Planes are \ncompletely sold out, gates are continuously utilized, airport \nfacilities are stretched thin. This means that when bad weather hits, \nthe airlines can find themselves unable to readily accommodate delays \nand cancellations. And the results, as we have seen this winter, can be \ndisastrous.\n  And that is why today we are introducing the ``Airline Passenger Bill \nof Rights Act of 2007,'' commonsense legislation designed to ensure \nthat travelers can no longer be unnecessarily trapped on airplanes for \nexcessive periods of time or deprived of food, water or adequate \nrestrooms during a ground delay.\n  The legislation requires airlines to offer passengers the option of \nsafely leaving a plane they have boarded once\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\nthat plane has sat on the ground three hours after the plane door has \nclosed. This option would be provided every three hours that the plane \ncontinues to sit on the ground.\n  The legislation also requires airlines to provide passengers with \nnecessary services such as food, potable water and adequate restroom \nfacilities while a plane is delayed on the ground.\n  The legislation provides two exceptions to the three-hour option. The \npilot may decide to not allow passengers to deplane if he or she \nreasonably believes their safety or security would be at risk due to \nextreme weather or other emergencies. Alternately, if the pilot \nreasonably determines that the flight will depart within 30 minutes \nafter the three hour period, he or she can delay the deplaning option \nfor an additional 30 minutes.\n  I believe this legislation will do much to help consumers while \nplacing reasonable requirements on the airlines and I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n        Carper, and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 680. A bill to ensure proper oversight and accountability in \nFederal contracting, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Accountability in \nGovernment Contracting Act of 2007. This bill, which I am delighted is \ncosponsored by Senators Lieberman, Coleman, Carper, and McCaskill, will \nimprove our stewardship of taxpayers' money by reforming contracting \npractices, strengthening the procurement workforce, reforming our IG \ncommunity, and including other provisions to combat waste, fraud, and \nabuse. It will also provide increased oversight and transparency in the \nFederal Government's dealings with its contractors.\n  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy estimates that the Federal \nGovernment purchased approximately $410 billion in goods and services \nlast year--more than a 50 percent increase in Federal purchases since \n2001.\n  As the administration's proposed budget suggests, the costs of war, \nnatural disaster, homeland-security precautions, and other vital \nprograms will drive those expenditures to even higher levels in the \nyears ahead.\n  Each of us in this Chamber knows that the Federal Government's \nprodigious purchasing can create abundant opportunities for fraud, \nwaste, and abuse. Whether the problem is purchases of unusable trailers \nfor hurricane victims, shoddy construction of schools and clinics in \nIraq, or abuse of purchase cards by Government employees, we must do a \nbetter job of protecting taxpayer dollars and delivering better \nacquisition outcomes.\n  Recognizing that imperative requires that we also recognize the \nobstacles in our path. Such obstacles include resource constraints, \ninexcusable rushes to award contracts, poor program administration, and \nperverse incentives.\n  Other challenges to fair, effective, and open competition and \noversight include inadequate documentation requirements, overuse of \nletter contracts that fail to include all the critical terms until \nafter performance is complete, excessive tiering of subcontractors, and \ninsufficient publicly available data on Federal contracts.\n  Too often, the problem of waste, fraud, and abuse stimulates floods \nof outrage and magic-bullet proposals that lean more toward symbolic \ngestures than practical reforms. The Accountability in Government \nContracting Act of 2007 confines itself to sensible, practical reforms \nthat will really make a difference.\n  Competition for Government contracts clearly helps to control costs, \nencourage innovation, and keep contractors sharp. It is basic \neconomics--and it's the law, as Congress provided in the Competition in \nContracting Act of 1984. This bill promotes more open competition for \nGovernment contracts--a positive step for both contractors and \ntaxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, the tide has been running the wrong way. Competition, \nintended to produce savings, has sharply diminished. While the dollar \nvolume of Federal contracting has nearly doubled since the year 2000, a \nrecent report concluded that less than half of all ``contract \nactions''--new contracts and payments against existing contracts--are \nnow subject to full and open competition: 48 percent in 2005, compared \nto 79 percent in 2001. This is inexcusable.\n  The dangers inherent in sole-source contracting are on full display \nin Iraq. For example, the Kellogg, Brown, and Root unit of Halliburton \ndesigned and was awarded a multi-year sole-source contract for the \nRestore Iraqi Oil project. A Defense Department audit concluded that \nthe firm later over-charged the government $61 million for fuel. \nIncredibly, the Army Corps of Engineers permitted the overcharge.\n  According to a January 2007 Congressional Research Service report, \nKellogg, Brown, and Root's contract work in Iraq included billing for \n$52 million to administer a project that entailed only $13 million in \nactual project work, piping unpurified water into showers and laundries \nused by our troops, and billing for 6 months of failure while using an \nunsuitable technique to lay oil pipeline beneath a river.\n  As these examples suggest, we need more competition, less sole source \ncontracting, and tougher management in Federal contracts. The bill I \nintroduce today extends a practice adopted in the fiscal year 2002 \nDefense Authorization Act government-wide, mandating competition for \neach task or delivery order over $100,000, the Simplified Acquisition \nThreshold.\n  The bill would promote more informed and effective competition for \norders over $5 million by requiring more information in the statement \nof work. At minimum, contractors would be given a clear statement of \nagency requirements, a reasonable response period, and disclosure of \nsignificant evaluation factors to be applied. For awards to be made on \na best-value rather than lowest-cost basis, the agency must provide a \nwritten statement on the basis of the award and on the trade-off \nbetween quality and cost.\n  To increase the quality of competitive bids, the bill mandates post-\naward debriefings for task or delivery orders valued over $5 million. \nDebriefings improve the transparency of the Federal acquisition process \nby providing information that contractors can use to improve future \noffers.\n  Competition helps secure good value for taxpayers' money, but there \nare exceptions, and they should be the exception and not the rule, when \nsole-source contracting is appropriate. Sole-source contracting \nheightens the importance of effective oversight, but oversight is often \nhampered by a lack of publicly available information on sole-source \ncontract awards.\n  The bill addresses that problem by requiring publication at the \n``FedBizOpps'' website of notices of all sole-source task-or-delivery \norders above $100,000, within 10 business days after the award.\n  I shall note some other important provisions of the bill.\n  The bill will rein in the practice of awarding contracts missing key \nterms, such as price, scope or schedule, and then failing to supply \nthose terms until the contractor delivers the good or service--thereby \nplacing all risk of failure on the government. In Iraq and Katrina \ncontracting, we saw the perils of failing to supply the ``missing \nterm'' promptly. For example, the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction last July identified 194 individual task orders valued \nat $3.4 billion that were classified as ``undefinitized contract \nactions.''\n  This is entirely too much money and too many contract actions to \nlinger in this status. The bill corrects this flaw by requiring \ncontracting officers to unilaterally determine all missing terms, if \nnot mutually agreed upon, within 180 days or before 40 percent of the \nwork is performed, with the approval of the head of the contracting \nagency, and subject to the contract disputes process.\n  Contracting for Hurricane Katrina and Iraq has also involved \nexcessive tiers of subcontractors, driving up costs and complicating \nadministration. The bill extends a tiering-control rule we placed in \nthe Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, preventing \ncontractors from using subcontracts for more than 65 percent of the \ncost of the contract, not including overhead and profit, unless the \nhead of agency determines that exceptional circumstances apply.\n  To further decrease the Government's reliance on large single-source\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\nservice contracts, the bill strengthens the preference for multiple \nawards of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, or IDIQ, contracts \nby prohibiting single awards of IDIQ contracts for services over $100 \nmillion. The Government would therefore have at least two contractors \nfor these large service contracts, who would then be required to \ncompete with each other for all task and/or delivery orders, unless \nstrict grounds for exceptions applied.\n  To ensure that agencies' increasing use of interagency contracting is \nproducing value, we require the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to \ncollect and make publicly available data on the numbers, scope, users, \nand rationales for these contracts.\n  But increased competition will not solve all our ills. We must also \naddress the lack of personnel to award and administer Federal \ncontracts. We moved into the 21st century with 22 percent fewer Federal \ncivilian acquisition personnel than we had at the start of the 1990s. \nThe Department of Defense has been disbursing enormous amounts of money \nto contractors since the first gulf war, but has reduced its \nacquisition workforce by more than 50 percent from 1994 to 2005.\n  Among the current, attenuated Federal acquisition workforce, nearly \n40 percent are eligible to retire by the end of this fiscal year. \nMeanwhile, the number and scale of Federal purchases continue to rise, \nmaking this human-capital crisis even more dire.\n  Therefore, the bill would help Federal agencies recruit, retain, and \ndevelop an adequate acquisition workforce. Its mechanisms include \nacquisition internship programs, promoting contracting careers, a \ngovernment-industry exchange program; an Acquisition Fellowship Program \nwith scholarships for graduate study, requirements for human-capital \nstrategic plans by chief acquisition officers, and a new senior-\nexecutive-level position in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to \nmanage this initiative.\n  In keeping with earlier Senate action, the bill also targets wasteful \nuse of purchase cards by seeking better analysis of purchase-card use \nto identify fraud as well as potential savings, negotiate discounts, \ncollect and disseminate best practices, and address small-business \nconcerns in micro-purchases.\n  Such information is clearly necessary. In a hearing before the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, GAO detailed how \na FEMA employee provided his purchase card number to a vendor, who \nagreed to provide the government 20 flat-bottom boats. Besides the \nfact that FEMA agreed to pay $208,000 for the boats, about twice the \nretail price, the vendor used the FEMA employee's purchase card \ninformation to make two unauthorized transactions totaling about \n$30,000. Neither the cardholder nor the approving official disputed the \nunauthorized charges. As if this was not bad enough, FEMA failed to \ngain title to the boats. It did not even enter 12 of the 20 boats into \ntheir property system. Eventually, one of the boats was later found \nback in the possession of the original owner.\n\n  The bill restricts the de-facto outsourcing of program-management \nresponsibility when a large contractor becomes a ``lead systems \nintegrator'' for a multi-part project. The bill requires OFPP to craft \na government-wide definition of lead systems integrators and study \ntheir use by various agencies.\n  The bill also specifically addresses demonstrated problems in \ncontracting for assistance programs in Afghanistan. Numerous reports of \nfraud, waste, and abuse in that country, such as the shockingly poor \nconstruction of schools and clinics by the Louis Berger Group, echo the \nfindings of the SIGIR in Iraq.\n  The Louis Berger Group was awarded a contract to build schools and \nclinics to help restore a decent life for the people of Afghanistan. Of \nthe 105 structures they erected before their work was stopped, 103 \nsuffered roof collapses after the first snowfall. Here was a case that \ncombined a waste of taxpayer funds, damage to the U.S. image we were \ntrying to enhance, and an actual danger to the people we were trying to \nhelp.\n  This bill requires the Administrator of USAID to revise the strategy \nfor the agency's assistance program in Afghanistan to include \nmeasurable goals, specific time frames, resource levels, delineated \nresponsibilities, external factors bearing on success, and a schedule \nfor program evaluations. All of these things should have been done from \nthe outset, not after billions in Federal funds were expended.\n  Title II of the bill introduces targeted reforms of the Inspector \nGeneral system. IGs play a vital role in preventing and detecting \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. We must attract more of these specialists to \ngovernment service, and make the career attractive.\n  One vital provision in our bill might appear to run counter to that \naim but the provision, in fact, preserves the independence of our \nInspector Generals. It prohibits IGs from accepting any cash award or \ncash bonus from the agency that they are auditing or investigating. \nThis codifies the honorable practice of most IGs of declining to accept \nsuch awards because of the inherent conflict of interest they present.\n  The balancing mechanism for that prohibition is to increase the \nsalaries of Presidentially appointed IGs from Senior Executive Service \nLevel III to Level IV. This also corrects a common anomaly wherein \nDeputy IGs collecting performance pay earn more than their supervising \nIG. The bill removes the inequity and the disincentive to accepting a \npromotion.\n  The bill makes other reforms that will increase the quality of IG \nreports and audits. For example, it clarifies that IGs' subpoena power \nextends to electronic documents. It also sets out professional \nqualifications for the designated Federal entity IGs, or DFE IGs. These \nIGs work in our smaller Federal agencies and are not subject to \nconfirmation. This is no excuse for this failure to supply minimum \nprofessional qualifications for these important positions.\n  This bill also corrects a serious problem that has left millions of \nfraudulently disbursed dollars un-recouped. Currently DFE IGs do not \nhave the power to institute lawsuits to recover claims under $150,000, \neven if they have a compelling case. This is unacceptable. DFE IGs need \nthe power to pick this ``low hanging fruit,'' whose cumulative cost can \nbe huge. The bill corrects this problem by giving DFE IGs the same \nauthority that Presidentially appointed IGs have to investigate and \nreport false claims, and to recoup losses resulting from fraud below \n$150,000.\n  I believe this summary shows how the Accountability in Government \nContracting Act of 2007 combines practical, workable, and targeted \nreforms to improve a complex process that expends hundreds of billions \nof taxpayer dollars every year. It will pay recurring dividends for \nyears to come in higher-quality proposals, in more efficiently \nadministered projects, and in better results for our citizens. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 681. A bill to restrict the use offshore tax havens and abusive \ntax shelters to inappropriately avoid Federal taxation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses \nare undermining the integrity of our tax system, robbing the Treasury \nof more than $100 billion each year, and shifting the tax burden from \nhigh income persons and companies onto the backs of middle income \nfamilies. We can shut down a lot of these abuses if we have the \npolitical will. That's why I am introducing today, along with Senators \nNorm Coleman and Barack Obama, the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act which \noffers powerful new tools to do just that.\n  We all know there are billions of dollars in taxes that are owed but \nnot paid each year. It's called the tax gap. The latest estimate is \n$345 billion in unpaid taxes each year owed by individuals, \ncorporations, and other organizations willing to rob Uncle Sam and \noffload their tax burden onto the backs of honest taxpayers. We also \nestimate that, of that $345 billion annual tax gap, offshore tax haven \nabuses account for as much as $100 billion. Abusive tax shelters, both \ndomestic and offshore, account for additional billions in unpaid taxes \nper year. To pay for critical needs, to avoid going even deeper into \ndebt, and to protect honest taxpayers, we must shut these abuses down.\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today is the product of years of \nwork by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. I serve as \nChairman of that Subcommittee. Senator Coleman is the ranking \nRepublican, and Senator Obama is a valued Subcommittee member. Through \nreports and hearings, the Subcommittee has worked for years to expose \nand combat abusive tax havens and tax shelters. In the last Congress, \nwe confronted these twin threats to our treasury by introducing S. \n1565, the Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act. Today's bill is an \nimproved version of that legislation, reflecting not only the \nSubcommittee's additional investigative work but also innovative ideas \nto end the use of tax havens and to stop unethical tax advisers from \naiding and abetting U.S. tax evasion.\n  A tax haven is a foreign jurisdiction that maintains corporate, bank, \nand tax secrecy laws and industry practices that make it very difficult \nfor other countries to find out whether their citizens are using the \ntax haven to cheat on their taxes. In effect, tax havens sell secrecy \nto attract clients to their shores. They peddle secrecy the way other \ncountries advertise high quality services. That secrecy is used to \ncloak tax evasion and other misconduct, and it is that offshore secrecy \nthat is targeted in our bill.\n  Abusive tax shelters are another target. Abusive tax shelters are \ncomplicated transactions promoted to provide tax benefits unintended by \nthe tax code. They are very different from legitimate tax shelters, \nsuch as deducting the interest paid on your home mortgage or \nCongressionally approved tax deductions for building affordable \nhousing. Some abusive tax shelters involve complicated domestic \ntransactions; others make use of offshore shenanigans. All abusive tax \nshelters are marked by one characteristic: there is no real economic or \nbusiness rationale other than tax avoidance. As Judge Learned Hand \nwrote in Gregory v. Helvering, they are ``entered upon for no other \nmotive but to escape taxation.''\n  Abusive tax shelters are usually tough to prosecute. Crimes such as \nterrorism, murder, and fraud produce instant recognition of the \nimmorality involved. Abusive tax shelters, by contrast, are often \n``MEGOs,'' meaning ``My Eyes Glaze Over.'' Those who cook up these \nconcoctions count on their complexity to escape scrutiny and public \nire. But regardless of how complicated or eye-glazing, the hawking of \nabusive tax shelters by tax professionals like accountants, bankers, \ninvestment advisers, and lawyers to thousands of people like late-\nnight, cut-rate T.V. bargains is scandalous, and we need to stop it. \nHiding tax schemes through offshore companies and bank accounts in tax \nhavens with secrecy laws also needs to be stopped cold. It's up to \nCongress to do just that.\n  Today, I would like to take some time to cut through the haze of \nthese schemes to describe them for what they really are and explain \nwhat our bill would do to stop them. First, I will look at our \ninvestigation into offshore tax havens and discuss the provisions we \nhave included in this bill to combat them. Then, I will turn to abusive \ntax shelters and our proposed remedies.\n  For many years, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has been \nlooking at the problem of offshore corporate, bank, and tax secrecy \nlaws and practices that help taxpayers dodge their U.S. tax obligations \nby preventing U.S. tax authorities from gaining access to key financial \nand beneficial ownership information. The Tax Justice Network, an \ninternational non-profit organization dedicated to fighting tax \nevasion, recently estimated that wealthy individuals worldwide have \nstashed $11.5 trillion of their assets in offshore tax havens. At one \nSubcommittee hearing, a former owner of an offshore bank in the Cayman \nIslands testified that he believed 100 percent of his former bank \nclients were engaged in tax evasion. He said that almost all were from \nthe United States and had taken elaborate measures to avoid IRS \ndetection of their money transfers. He also expressed confidence that \nthe offshore government that licensed his bank would vigorously defend \nclient secrecy in order to continue attracting business.\n  In a hearing held in August 2006, the Subcommittee released a staff \nreport with six case studies describing how U.S. individuals are using \noffshore tax havens to evade U.S. taxes. In one case, two brothers from \nTexas, Sam and Charles Wyly, established 58 offshore trusts and \ncorporations, and operated them for more than 13 years without alerting \nU.S. authorities. To move funds abroad, the brothers transferred over \n$190 million in stock option compensation they had received from U.S. \npublicly traded companies to the offshore corporations. They claimed \nthat they did not have to pay tax on this compensation, because, in \nexchange, the offshore corporations provided them with private \nannuities which would not begin to make payments to them until years \nlater. In the meantime, the brothers directed the offshore corporations \nto cash in the stock options and start investing the money. The \nbrothers failed to disclose these offshore stock transactions to the \nSEC despite their position as directors and major shareholders in the \nrelevant companies.\n  The Subcommittee was able to trace more than $700 million in stock \noption proceeds that the brothers invested in various ventures they \ncontrolled, including two hedge funds, an energy company, and an \noffshore insurance firm. They also used the offshore funds to purchase \nreal estate, jewelry, and artwork for themselves and their family \nmembers, claiming they could use these offshore dollars to advance \ntheir personal and business interests without having to pay any taxes \non the offshore income. The Wylys were able to carry on these tax \nmaneuvers in large part because all of their activities were shrouded \nin offshore secrecy.\n  In another of the case histories, six U.S. taxpayers relied on \nphantom stock trades between two offshore shell companies to generate \nfake stock losses which were then used to shelter billions in income. \nThis offshore tax shelter scheme, known as the POINT Strategy, was \ndevised by Quellos, a U.S. securities firm headquartered in Seattle; \ncoordinated with a European financial firm known as Euram Advisers; and \nblessed by opinion letters issued by two prominent U.S. law firms, \nCravath Swaine and Bryan Cave. The two offshore shell companies at the \ncenter of the strategy, known as Jackstones and Barneville, supposedly \ncreated a stock portfolio worth $9.6 billion. However, no cash or stock \ntransfers ever took place. Moreover, the shell companies that conducted \nthese phantom trades are so shrouded in offshore secrecy that no one \nwill admit to knowing who owns them. One of the taxpayers, Haim Saban, \nused the scheme to shelter about $1.5 billion from U.S. taxes. Another, \nRobert Wood Johnson IV, sought to shelter about $145 million. Both have \nsince agreed to settle with the IRS.\n  The persons examined by the Subcommittee are far from the only U.S. \ntaxpayers engaging in these types of offshore tax abuses. Recent \nestimates are that U.S. individuals are using offshore tax schemes to \navoid payment of $40 to $70 billion in taxes each year.\n  Corporations are also using tax havens to avoid payment of U.S. \ntaxes. A recent IRS study estimates that U.S. corporations use offshore \ntax havens to avoid about $30 billion in U.S. taxes each year. A GAO \nreport I released with Senator Dorgan in 2004 found that nearly two-\nthirds of the top 100 companies doing business with the United States \ngovernment had one or more subsidiaries in a tax haven. One company, \nTyco International, had 115. Enron, in its heyday, had over 400 Cayman \nsubsidiaries.\n  Data released by the Commerce Department further demonstrates the \nextent of U.S. corporate use of tax havens, indicating that, as of \n200l, almost half of all foreign profits of U.S. corporations were in \ntax havens. A study released by the journal Tax Notes in September 2004 \nfound that American companies were able to shift $149 billion of \nprofits to 18 tax haven countries in 2002, up 68 percent from $88 \nbillion in 1999.\n  Here's just one simplified example of the gimmicks being used by \ncorporations to transfer taxable income from the United States to tax \nhavens to escape taxation. Suppose a profitable U.S. corporation \nestablishes a shell corporation in a tax haven. The shell corporation \nhas no office or employees, just a mailbox address. The U.S. parent\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\ntransfers a valuable patent to the shell corporation. Then, the U.S. \nparent and all of its subsidiaries begin to pay a hefty fee to the \nshell corporation for use of the patent, reducing its U.S. income \nthrough deducting the patent fees and thus shifting taxable income out \nof the United States to the shell corporation. The shell corporation \ndeclares a portion of the fees as profit, but pays no U.S. tax since it \nis a tax haven resident. The icing on the cake is that the shell \ncorporation can then ``lend'' the income it has accumulated from the \nfees back to the U.S. parent for its use. The parent, in turn, pays \n``interest'' on the ``loans'' to the shell corporation, shifting still \nmore taxable income out of the United States to the tax haven. This \nexample highlights just a few of the tax haven ploys being used by some \nU.S. corporations to escape paying their fair share of taxes here at \nhome.\n  Our Subcommittee's most recent investigation into offshore abuses \nhighlighted the extent to which offshore secrecy rules make it possible \nfor taxpayers to participate in illicit activity with little fear of \ngetting caught. Through a series of case studies, the Subcommittee \nshowed how U.S. taxpayers, with the help of offshore service providers, \nfinancial institutions, and sometimes highly credentialed tax \nprofessionals, set up entities in such secrecy jurisdictions as the \nIsle of Man, the Cayman Islands, and the island of Nevis, claimed these \noffshore entities were independent but, in fact, controlled them \nthrough compliant offshore trustees, officers, directors, and corporate \nadministrators. Because of the offshore secrecy laws and practices, \nthese offshore service providers could and did go to extraordinary \nlengths to protect their U.S. clients' identities and financial \ninformation from U.S. tax and regulatory authorities, making it \nextremely difficult, if not impossible, for U.S. law enforcement \nauthorities to get the information they need to enforce U.S. tax laws.\n  The extent of the offshore tax abuses documented by the Subcommittee \nduring this last year intensified our determination to find new ways to \ncombat offshore secrecy and restore the ability of U.S. tax enforcement \nto pursue offshore tax cheats. I'd now like to describe the key \nmeasures in the Stop Tax Havens Act being introduced today, which \nincludes the use of presumptions to overcome offshore secrecy barriers, \nspecial measures to combat persons who impede U.S. tax enforcement, and \ngreater disclosure of offshore transactions.\n  Our last Subcommittee staff report provided six case histories \ndetailing how U.S. taxpayers are using offshore tax havens to avoid \npayment of the taxes they owe. These case histories examined an \nInternet based company that helps persons obtain offshore entities and \naccounts; U.S. promoters that designed complex offshore structures to \nhide client assets, even providing clients with a how-to manual for \ngoing offshore; U.S. taxpayers who diverted business income offshore \nthrough phony loans and invoices; a one-time tax dodge that deducted \nphantom offshore stock losses from real U.S. stock income to shelter \nthat income from U.S. taxes; and the 13-year offshore empire built by \nSam and Charles Wyly. Each of these case histories presented the same \nfact pattern in which the U.S. taxpayer, through lawyers, banks, or \nother representatives, set up offshore trusts, corporations, or other \nentities which had all the trappings of independence but, in fact, were \ncontrolled by the U.S. taxpayer whose directives were implemented by \ncompliant offshore personnel acting as the trustees, officers, \ndirectors or nominee owners of the offshore entities.\n  In the case of the Wylys, the brothers and their representatives \ncommunicated Wyly directives to a so-called trust protector who then \nrelayed the directives to the offshore trustees. In the 13 years \nexamined by the Subcommittee, the offshore trustees never once rejected \na Wyly request and never once initiated an action without Wyly \napproval. They simply did what they were told. A U.S. taxpayer in \nanother case history told the Subcommittee that the offshore personnel \nwho nominally owned and controlled his offshore entities, in fact, \nalways followed his directions, describing himself as the ``puppet \nmaster'' in charge of his offshore holdings. When the Subcommittee \ndiscussed these case histories with financial administrators from the \nIsle of Man, they explained that none of the offshore personnel were \nengaged in any wrongdoing, because their laws permit foreign clients to \ntransmit detailed, daily instructions to offshore service providers on \nhow to handle offshore assets, so long as it is the offshore trustee or \ncorporate officer who gives the final order to buy or sell the \nassets. They explained that, under their law, an offshore entity is \nconsidered legally independent from the person directing its activities \nso long as that person follows the form of transmitting ``requests'' to \nthe offshore personnel who retain the formal right to make the \ndecisions, even though the offshore personnel always do as they are \nasked.\n\n  The Subcommittee case histories illustrate what the tax literature \nand law enforcement experience have shown for years: that the business \nmodel followed in all offshore secrecy jurisdictions is for compliant \ntrustees, corporate administrators, and financial institutions to \nprovide a veneer of independence while ensuring that their U.S. clients \nretain complete and unfettered control over ``their'' offshore assets. \nThat's the standard operating procedure offshore. Offshore service \nproviders pretend to own or control the offshore trusts, corporations, \nand accounts they help establish, but what they really do is whatever \ntheir clients tell them to do. In truth, the independence of offshore \nentities is a legal fiction, and it is past time to pull back the \ncurtain on the reality hiding behind the legal formalities.\n  The reality behind these offshore practices makes a mockery of U.S. \nlaws that normally view trusts and corporations as independent \nentities. They invite game-playing and tax evasion. To combat these \noffshore abuses, our bill takes them head on in a number of ways.\n  The first section of our bill, Section 101, tackles this issue by \ncreating several rebuttable evidentiary presumptions that would strip \nthe veneer of independence from the U.S. person involved with offshore \nentities, transactions, and accounts, unless that U.S. person presents \nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary. These presumptions would \napply only in civil judicial or administrative tax or securities \nenforcement proceedings examining transactions, entities, or accounts \nin offshore secrecy jurisdictions. These presumptions would put the \nburden of producing evidence from the offshore secrecy jurisdiction on \nthe taxpayer who chose to do business there, and who has access to the \ninformation, rather than on the Federal Government which has little or \nno practical ability to get the information. The creation of these \npresumptions implements a bipartisan recommendation in the August 2006 \nSubcommittee report on tax haven abuses.\n  The bill would establish three evidentiary presumptions that could be \nused in a civil tax enforcement proceeding: (1) a presumption that a \nU.S. taxpayer who ``formed, transferred assets to, was a beneficiary \nof, or received money or property'' from an offshore entity, such as a \ntrust or corporation, is in control of that entity; (2) a presumption \nthat funds or other property received from offshore are taxable income, \nand that funds or other property transferred offshore have not yet been \ntaxed; and (3) a presumption that a financial account controlled by a \nU.S. taxpayer in a foreign country contains enough money--$10,000--to \ntrigger an existing statutory reporting threshold and allow the IRS to \nassert the minimum penalty for nondisclosure of the account by the \ntaxpayer.\n  In addition, the bill would establish two evidentiary presumptions \napplicable to civil proceedings to enforce U.S. securities laws. One \nwould specify that if a director, officer, or major shareholder of a \nU.S. publicly traded corporation were associated with an offshore \nentity, that person would be presumed to control that offshore entity. \nThe second provides that securities nominally owned by an offshore \nentity are presumed to be beneficially owned by any U.S. person who \ncontrolled the offshore entity.\n  These presumptions are rebuttable, which means that the U.S. person \nwho is the subject of the proceeding could provide clear and convincing \nevidence\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\nto show that the presumptions were factually inaccurate. To rebut the \npresumptions, a taxpayer could establish, for example, that an offshore \ncorporation really was controlled by an independent third party, or \nthat money sent from an offshore account really represented a \nnontaxable gift instead of taxable income. If the taxpayer wished to \nintroduce evidence from a foreign person, such as an offshore banker, \ncorporate officer, or trust administrator, to establish those facts, \nthat foreign person would have to actually appear in the proceeding in \na manner that would permit cross examination in order for the taxpayer \nto rebut the presumption. A simple affidavit from an offshore resident \nwho refused to submit to cross examination in the United States would \nbe insufficient.\n  There are several limitations on these presumptions to ensure their \noperation is fair and reasonable. First, the evidentiary rules in \ncriminal cases would not be affected by this bill which would apply \nonly to civil proceedings. Second, because the presumptions apply only \nin enforcement ``proceedings,'' they would not directly affect, for \nexample, a person's reporting obligations on a tax return or SEC \nfiling. The presumptions would come into play only if the IRS or SEC \nwere to challenge a matter in a formal proceeding. Third, the bill does \nnot apply the presumptions to situations where either the U.S. person \nor the offshore entity is a publicly traded company, because in those \nsituations, even if a transaction were abusive, IRS and SEC officials \nare generally able to obtain access to necessary information. Fourth, \nthe bill recognizes that certain classes of offshore transactions, such \nas corporate reorganizations, may not present a potential for abuse, \nand accordingly authorizes Treasury and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to issue regulations or guidance identifying such classes of \ntransactions, to which the presumptions would then not apply.\n\n  An even more fundamental limitation on the presumptions is that they \nwould apply only to transactions, accounts, or entities in offshore \njurisdictions with secrecy laws or practices that unreasonably restrict \nthe ability of the U.S. government to get needed information and which \ndo not have effective information exchange programs with U.S. law \nenforcement. The bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \nidentify those offshore secrecy jurisdictions, based upon the practical \nexperience of the IRS in obtaining needed information from the relevant \ncountry.\n  To provide a starting point for Treasury, the bill presents an \ninitial list of 34 offshore secrecy jurisdictions. This list is taken \nfrom actual IRS court filings in numerous, recent court proceedings in \nwhich the IRS sought permission to obtain information about U.S. \ntaxpayers active in the named jurisdictions. The bill thus identifies \nthe same jurisdictions that the IRS has already named publicly as \nprobable locations for U.S. tax evasion. Federal courts all over the \ncountry have consistently found, when presented with the IRS list and \nsupporting evidence, that the IRS had a reasonable basis for concluding \nthat U.S. taxpayers with financial accounts in those countries \npresented a risk of tax noncompliance. In every case, the courts \nallowed the IRS to collect information about accounts and transactions \nin the listed offshore jurisdictions.\n  The bill also provides Treasury with the authority to add or remove \njurisdictions from the initial list so that the list can change over \ntime and reflect the actual record of experience of the United States \nin its dealings with specific jurisdictions around the world. The bill \nprovides two tests for Treasury to use in determining whether a \njurisdiction should be identified as an ``offshore secrecy \njurisdiction'' triggering the evidentiary presumptions: (1) whether the \njurisdiction's secrecy laws and practices unreasonably restrict U.S. \naccess to information, and (2) whether the jurisdiction maintains a tax \ninformation exchange process with the United States that is effective \nin practice.\n  If offshore jurisdictions make a decision to enact secrecy laws and \nsupport industry practices furthering corporate, financial, and tax \nsecrecy, that's their business. But when U.S. taxpayers start using \nthose offshore secrecy laws and practices to evade U.S. taxes to the \ntune of $100 billion per year, that's our business. We have a right to \nenforce our tax laws and to expect that other countries will not help \nU.S. tax cheats achieve their ends.\n  The aim of the presumptions created by the bill is to eliminate the \nunfair advantage provided by offshore secrecy laws that for too long \nhave enabled U.S. persons to conceal their misconduct offshore and game \nU.S. law enforcement. These presumptions would allow U.S. law \nenforcement to establish what we all know from experience is normally \nthe case in an offshore jurisdiction--that a U.S. person associated \nwith an offshore entity controls that entity; that money and property \nsent to or from an offshore entity involves taxable income; and that an \noffshore account that wasn't disclosed to U.S. authorities should have \nbeen. U.S. law enforcement can establish these facts presumptively, \nwithout having to pierce the secrecy veil. At the same time, U.S. \npersons who chose to transact their affairs through an offshore secrecy \njurisdiction are given the opportunity to lift the veil of secrecy and \ndemonstrate that the presumptions are factually wrong.\n  We believe these evidentiary presumptions will provide U.S. tax and \nsecurities law enforcement with powerful new tools to shut down tax \nhaven abuses.\n  Section 102 of the bill is another innovative approach to combating \ntax haven abuses. This section would build upon existing Treasury \nauthority to apply an array of sanctions to counter specific foreign \nmoney laundering threats by extending that same authority to counter \nspecific foreign tax administration threats.\n  In 2001, the PATRIOT Act gave Treasury the authority under 31 U.S.C. \n5318A to require domestic financial institutions and agencies to take \nspecial measures with respect to foreign jurisdictions, financial \ninstitutions, or transactions found to be of ``primary money laundering \nconcern.'' Once Treasury designates a foreign jurisdiction or financial \ninstitution to be of primary money laundering concern, Section 5318A \nallows Treasury to impose a range of requirements on U.S. financial \ninstitutions in their dealings with the designated entity--from \nrequiring U.S. financial institutions, for example, to provide greater \ninformation than normal about transactions involving the designated \nentity, to prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from opening \naccounts for that foreign entity.\n\n  This PATRIOT Act authority has been used sparingly, but to telling \neffect. In some instances Treasury has employed special measures \nagainst an entire country, such as Burma, to stop its financial \ninstitutions from laundering funds through the U.S. financial system. \nMore often, however, Treasury has used the authority surgically, \nagainst a single problem financial institution, to stop laundered funds \nfrom entering the United States. The provision has clearly succeeded in \ngiving Treasury a powerful tool to protect the U.S. financial system \nfrom money laundering abuses.\n  The bill would authorize Treasury to use that same tool to require \nU.S. financial institutions to take the same special measures against \nforeign jurisdictions or financial institutions found by Treasury to be \n``impeding U.S. tax enforcement.'' Treasury could, for example, in \nconsultation with the IRS, Secretary of State, and the Attorney \nGeneral, require U.S. financial institutions that have correspondent \naccounts for a designated foreign bank to produce information on all of \nthat foreign bank's customers. Alternatively, Treasury could prohibit \nU.S. financial institutions from opening accounts for a designated \nforeign bank, thereby cutting off that foreign bank's access to the \nU.S. financial system. These types of sanctions could be as effective \nin ending the worst tax haven abuses as they have been in curbing money \nlaundering.\n  In addition to extending Treasury's ability to impose special \nmeasures against foreign entities impeding U.S. tax enforcement, the \nbill would add one new measure to the list of possible sanctions that \ncould be applied to foreign entities: it would allow Treasury to \ninstruct U.S. financial institutions not to authorize or accept credit \ncard transactions involving the designated foreign jurisdiction or \nfinancial institution. Denying tax haven banks the\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nability to issue credit cards for use in the United States, for \nexample, would be a powerful new way to stop U.S. tax cheats from \nobtaining access to funds hidden offshore.\n  Section 103 of the bill addresses another problem faced by the IRS in \ncases involving offshore jurisdictions--completing audits in a timely \nfashion when the evidence needed is located in a jurisdiction with \nstrict secrecy laws. Currently, in the absence of fraud or some other \nexception, the IRS has 3 years from the date a return is filed to \ncomplete an audit and assess any additional tax. Because offshore \nsecrecy laws slow down, and sometimes impede, efforts by the United \nStates to obtain offshore financial and beneficial ownership \ninformation, the bill gives the IRS an extra 3 years to complete an \naudit and assess a tax on transactions involving an offshore secrecy \njurisdiction. Of course, in the event that a case turns out to involve \nactual fraud, this provision of the bill is not intended to limit the \nrule giving the IRS unlimited time to assess tax in such cases.\n  Tax haven abuses are shrouded in secrecy. Section 104 attempts to \npierce that secrecy by creating two new disclosure mechanisms requiring \nthird parties to report on offshore transactions undertaken by U.S. \npersons.\n  The first disclosure mechanism focuses on U.S. financial institutions \nthat open a U.S. account in the name of an offshore entity, such as an \noffshore trust or corporation, and learn from an anti-money laundering \ndue diligence review, that a U.S. person is the beneficial owner behind \nthat offshore entity. In the Wyly case history examined by the \nSubcommittee, for example, three major U.S. financial institutions \nopened dozens of accounts for offshore trusts and corporations which \nthey knew were associated with the Wyly family.\n  Under current anti-money laundering law, all U.S. financial \ninstitutions are supposed to know who is behind an account opened in \nthe name of, for example, an offshore shell corporation or trust. They \nare supposed to obtain this information to safeguard the U.S. financial \nsystem against misuse by terrorists, money launderers, and other \ncriminals.\n  Under current tax law, a bank or securities broker that opens an \naccount for a U.S. person is also required to give the IRS a 1099 form \nreporting any capital gains earned on the account. However, the bank or \nsecurities broker need not file a 1099 form if the account is owned by \na foreign entity not subject to U.S. tax law. Problems arise when an \naccount is opened in the name of an offshore entity that the bank or \nbroker knows, from its anti-money laundering review, is owned or \ncontrolled by a U.S. person. The U.S. person should be filing a tax \nreturn with the IRS reporting the income of the ``controlled foreign \ncorporation.'' However, since he or she knows it is difficult for the \nIRS to connect an offshore accountholder to a particular taxpayer, he \nor she may feel safe in not reporting that income. That complacency \nmight change, however, if the U.S. person knew that the bank or broker \nwho opened the account and learned of the connection had a legal \nobligation to report any account income to the IRS.\n  Under current law, the way the regulations are written and typically \ninterpreted, the bank or broker can treat the foreign account holder as \nan independent entity separate from the U.S. person, even if it knows \nthat the foreign corporation is merely holding title to the account for \nthe U.S. person, who exercises complete authority over the corporation \nand benefits from any capital gains earned on the account. Current law \nthus arguably imposes no duty on the bank or broker to file a 1099 form \ndisclosing the account to the IRS.\n  The bill would strengthen current law by expressly requiring a bank \nor broker that knows, as a result of its anti-money laundering due \ndiligence or otherwise, that a U.S. person is the beneficial owner of a \nforeign entity that opened the account, to disclose that account to the \nIRS by filing a 1099 form reporting account income. This reporting \nobligation would not require banks or brokers to gather any new \ninformation--financial institutions are already required to perform \nanti-money laundering due diligence for accounts opened by offshore \nshell entities. The bill would instead require U.S. financial \ninstitutions to act on what they already know by filing a 1099 form \nwith the IRS.\n  The second disclosure mechanism created by Section 104 targets U.S. \nfinancial institutions that open foreign bank accounts or set up \noffshore corporations, trusts, or other entities for their U.S. \nclients. Our investigations have shown that it is common for private \nbankers and brokers in the United States to provide these services to \ntheir wealthy clients, so that the clients do not even need to leave \nhome to set up an offshore structure. The offshore entities can then \nopen both offshore and U.S. accounts and supposedly be treated as \nforeign account holders for tax purposes.\n  A Subcommittee investigation learned, for example, that Citibank \nPrivate Bank routinely offered to its clients private banking services \nwhich included establishing one or more offshore shell corporations--\nwhich it called Private Investment Corporations or PICs--in \njurisdictions like the Cayman Islands. The paperwork to form the PIC \nwas typically completed by a Citibank affiliate located in the \njurisdiction, such as Cititrust, which is a Cayman trust company. \nCititrust could then help the PIC open offshore accounts, while \nCitibank could help the PIC open U.S. accounts.\n  Section 104 would require any U.S. financial institution that \ndirectly or indirectly opens a foreign bank account or establishes a \nforeign corporation or other entity for a U.S. customer to report that \naction to the IRS. The bill authorizes the regulators of banks and \nsecurities firms, as well as the IRS, to enforce this filing \nrequirement. Existing tax law already requires U.S. taxpayers that take \nsuch actions to report them to the IRS, but many fail to do so, secure \nin the knowledge that offshore secrecy laws limit the ability of the \nIRS to find out about the establishment of new offshore accounts and \nentities. That's why our bill turns to a third party--the financial \ninstitution--to disclose the information. Placing this third party \nreporting requirement on the private banks and brokers will make it \nmore difficult for U.S. clients to hide these transactions.\n  Section 105 of our bill strengthens the ability of the IRS to stop \noffshore trust abuses by making narrow but important changes to the \nRevenue Code provisions dealing with taxation of foreign trusts. The \nrules on foreign trust taxation have been significantly strengthened \nover the past 30 years to the point where they now appear adequate to \nprevent or punish many of the more serious abuses. However, the \nSubcommittee's 2006 investigation found a few loopholes that are still \nbeing exploited by tax cheats and that need to be shut down.\n  The bill would make several changes to close these loopholes. First, \nour investigation showed that U.S. taxpayers exercising control over a \nsupposedly independent foreign trust commonly used the services of a \nliaison, called a trust ``protector'' or ``enforcer,'' to convey their \ndirectives to the supposedly independent offshore trustees. A trust \nprotector is typically authorized to replace a foreign trustee at will \nand to advise the trustees on a wide range of trust matters, including \nthe handling of trust assets and the naming of trust beneficiaries. In \ncases examined by the Subcommittee, the trust protector was often a \nfriend, business associate, or employee of the U.S. person exercising \ncontrol over the foreign trust. Section 105 provides that, for tax \npurposes, any powers held by a trust protector shall be attributed to \nthe trust grantor.\n  A second problem addressed by our bill involves U.S. taxpayers who \nestablish foreign trusts for the benefit of their families in an effort \nto escape U.S. tax on the accumulation of trust income. Foreign trusts \ncan accumulate income tax free for many years. Previous amendments to \nthe foreign trust rules have addressed the taxation problem by \nbasically disregarding such trusts and taxing the trust income to the \ngrantors as it is earned. However, as currently written, this taxation \nrule applies only to years in which the foreign trust has a named \n``U.S. beneficiary.'' In response, to avoid the reach of the rule, some \ntaxpayers have begun structuring their foreign trusts so that they \noperate with no named U.S. beneficiaries.\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\n  For example, the Subcommittee's investigation into the Wyly trusts \ndiscovered that the foreign trust agreements had only two named \nbeneficiaries, both of which were foreign charities, but also gave the \noffshore trustees ``discretion'' to name beneficiaries in the future. \nThe offshore trustees had been informed in a letter of wishes from the \nWyly brothers that the trust assets were to go to their children after \ndeath. The trustees also knew that the trust protector selected by the \nWylys had the power to replace them if they did not comply with the \nWylys' instructions. In addition, during the life of the Wyly brothers, \nand in accordance with instructions supplied by the trust protector, \nthe offshore trustees authorized millions of dollars in trust income to \nbe invested in Wyly business ventures and spent on real estate, \njewelry, artwork, and other goods and services used by the Wylys and \ntheir families. The Wylys plainly thought they had found a legal \nloophole that would let them enjoy and direct the foreign trust assets \nwithout any obligation to pay taxes on the money they used.\n  To stop such foreign trust abuses, the bill would make it impossible \nto pretend that this type of foreign trust has no U.S. beneficiaries. \nThe bill would shut down the loophole by providing that: (1) any U.S. \nperson actually benefiting from a foreign trust is treated as a trust \nbeneficiary, even if they are not named in the trust instrument; (2) \nfuture or contingent U.S. beneficiaries are treated the same as current \nbeneficiaries; and (3) loans of foreign trust assets or property such \nas real estate, jewelry and artwork (in addition to loans of cash or \nsecurities already covered by current law) are treated as trust \ndistributions for tax purposes.\n  Section 106 of the bill takes aim at legal opinions that are used to \ntry to immunize taxpayers against penalties for tax shelter \ntransactions with offshore elements. The Subcommittee investigations \nhave found that tax practitioners sometimes tell potential clients that \nthey can invest in an offshore tax scheme without fear of penalty, \nbecause they will be given a legal opinion that will shield the \ntaxpayer from any imposition of the 20 percent accuracy related \npenalties in the tax code. Current law does, in fact, allow taxpayers \nto escape these penalties if they can produce a legal opinion letter \nstating that the tax arrangement in question is ``more likely than \nnot'' to survive challenge by the IRS. The problem with such opinions \nwhere part of the transaction occurs in an offshore secrecy \njurisdiction is that critical assumptions of the opinions are often \nbased on offshore events, transactions and facts that are hidden and \ncannot be easily ascertained by the IRS. Legal opinions based on such \nassumptions should be understood by any reasonable person to be \ninherently unreliable.\n  The bill therefore provides that, for any transaction involving an \noffshore secrecy jurisdiction, the taxpayer would need to have some \nother basis, independent of the legal opinion, to show that there was \nreasonable cause to claim the tax benefit. The ``more likely than not'' \nopinion would no longer be sufficient in and of itself to shield a \ntaxpayer from all penalties if an offshore secrecy jurisdiction is \ninvolved. This provision, which is based upon a suggestion made by IRS \nCommissioner Mark Everson at our August hearing, is intended to force \ntaxpayers to think twice about entering into an offshore scheme and to \nstop thinking that an opinion by a lawyer is all they need to escape \nany penalty for nonpayment of taxes owed. By making this change, we \nwould also provide an incentive for taxpayers to understand and \ndocument the complete facts of the offshore aspects of a transaction \nbefore claiming favorable tax treatment.\n\n  To ensure that this section does not impede legitimate business \narrangements in offshore secrecy jurisdictions, the bill authorizes the \nTreasury Secretary to issue regulations exempting two types of legal \nopinions from the application of this section. First, the Treasury \nSecretary could exempt all legal opinions that have a confidence level \nsubstantially above the more-likely-than-not level, such as opinions \nwhich express confidence that a proposed tax arrangement ``should'' \nwithstand an IRS challenge. ``More-likely-than-not'' opinion letters \nare normally viewed as expressing confidence that a tax arrangement has \nat least a 50 percent chance of surviving IRS review, while a \n``should'' opinion is normally viewed as expressing a confidence level \nof 70 to 75 percent. This first exemption is intended to ensure that \nlegal opinions on arrangements that are highly likely to survive IRS \nreview would continue to shield taxpayers from the 20 percent penalty. \nSecond, the Treasury Secretary could exempt legal opinions addressing \nclasses of transactions, such as corporate reorganizations, that do not \npresent the potential for abuse. These exemptions would ensure that \ntaxpayers who obtain legal opinions for these classes of transactions \nwould also be protected from tax code penalties.\n  In addition to tax abuses, last year's Subcommittee investigation of \nthe Wyly case history uncovered a host of troubling transactions \ninvolving U.S. securities held by the 58 offshore trusts and \ncorporations associated with the two Wyly brothers. The offshore \nentities had obtained these securities by exercising about $190 million \nin stock options provided to them by the Wylys. The Wylys had obtained \nthese stock options as compensation from three U.S. publicly traded \ncorporations at which they were directors and major shareholders.\n  The investigation found that the Wylys generally did not report the \noffshore entities' stock holdings or transactions in their SEC filings, \non the ground that the 58 offshore trusts and corporations functioned \nas independent entities, even though the Wylys continued to direct the \nentities' investment activities. The public companies where the Wylys \nwere corporate insiders also failed to include in their SEC filings \ninformation about the company shares held by the offshore entities, \neven though the companies knew of their close relationship to the \nWylys, that the Wylys had provided the offshore entities with \nsignificant stock options, and that the offshore entities held large \nblocks of the company stock. On other occasions, the public companies \nand various financial institutions failed to treat the shares held by \nthe offshore entities as affiliated stock, even though they were aware \nof the offshore entities' close association with the Wylys. The \ninvestigation also found that, because both the Wylys and the public \ncompanies had failed to disclose the holdings of the offshore entities, \nfor l3 years federal regulators were unaware of those holdings and the \nrelationships between the offshore entities and the Wyly brothers.\n  Corporate insiders and public companies are already obligated by \ncurrent law to disclose share holdings and transactions of offshore \nentities affiliated with a company director, officer, or major \nshareholder. Current penalties, however, appear insufficient to ensure \ncompliance in light of the low likelihood that U.S. authorities will \nlearn what went on in an offshore jurisdiction. To address this \nproblem, our bill would establish a new monetary penalty of up to $1 \nmillion for persons who knowingly fail to disclose offshore holdings \nand transactions in violation of U.S. securities laws.\n  The Subcommittee's August 2006 investigation showed that the Wyly \nbrothers used two hedge funds and a private equity fund controlled by \nthem to funnel millions of untaxed offshore dollars into U.S. \ninvestments. In addition, that and earlier investigations provide \nextensive evidence on the role played by U.S. company formation agents \nin assisting U.S. persons to set up offshore structures. Moreover, a \nSubcommittee hearing in November 2006 disclosed that U.S. company \nformation agents are forming U.S. shell companies for numerous \nunidentified foreign clients. Some of those U.S. shell companies were \nlater used in illicit activities, including money laundering, terrorist \nfinancing, drug crimes, tax evasion, and other misconduct. Because \nhedge funds, private equity funds, and company formation agents are as \nvulnerable as other financial institutions to money launderers seeking \nentry into the U.S. financial system, the bill contains two provisions \naimed at ensuring that these groups know their clients and do not \naccept or transmit suspect funds into the U.S. financial system.\n\n  Currently, unregistered investment companies, such as hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds, are the only class of financial institutions \nunder the Bank Secrecy Act that transmit substantial offshore funds \ninto the United\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\nStates, yet are not required by law to have anti-money laundering \nprograms, including Know Your Customer, due diligence procedures. There \nis no reason why this growing sector of our financial services industry \nshould continue to serve as a gateway into the U.S. financial system \nfor monies of unknown origin. The Treasury Department proposed anti-\nmoney laundering regulations for these groups in 2002, but has not yet \nfinalized them, even though the principal hedge fund trade association \nsupports the issuance of federal anti-money laundering regulations. Our \nbill would require Treasury to issue final regulations within 180 days \nof the enactment of the bill. Treasury would be free to work from its \nexisting proposal, but the bill would also require the final \nregulations to direct hedge funds and private equity funds to exercise \ndue diligence before accepting offshore funds and to comply with the \nsame procedures as other financial institutions if asked by federal \nregulators to produce records kept offshore.\n  In addition, the bill would add company formation agents to the list \nof persons subject to the anti-money laundering obligations of the Bank \nSecrecy Act. For the first time, those engaged in the business of \nforming corporations and other entities, both offshore and in the 50 \nStates, would be responsible for knowing the identity of the person for \nwhom they are forming the entity. The bill also directs Treasury to \ndevelop anti-money laundering regulations for this group. Treasury's \nkey anti-money laundering agency, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \nNetwork, testified before the Subcommittee that it was considering \ndrafting such regulations.\n  We expect and intend that, as in the case of all other entities \ncovered by the Bank Secrecy Act, the regulations issued in response to \nthis bill would instruct hedge funds, private equity funds, and company \nformation agents to adopt risk-based procedures that would concentrate \ntheir due diligence efforts on clients that pose the highest risk of \nmoney laundering.\n  Section 204 of the bill focuses on one tool used by the IRS in recent \nyears to uncover taxpayers involved in offshore tax schemes, known as \nJohn Doe summonses. The bill would make three technical changes to IRS \nrules governing the issuance of these summonses to make their use more \neffective in offshore and other complex investigations.\n  A John Doe summons is an administrative IRS summons used to request \ninformation in cases where the identity of a taxpayer is unknown. In \ncases involving known taxpayers, the IRS may issue a summons to a third \nparty to obtain information about a U.S. taxpayer, but must also notify \nthe taxpayer who then has 20 days to petition a court to quash the \nsummons to the third party. With a John Doe summons, however, IRS does \nnot have the taxpayer's name and does not know where to send the \ntaxpayer notice, so the statute substitutes a procedure in which the \nIRS must apply to a court for advance permission to serve the summons \non the third party. To obtain approval of the summons, the IRS must \nshow the court, in public filings to be resolved in open court, that: \n(1) the summons relates to a particular person or ascertainable class \nof persons, (2) there is a reasonable basis for concluding that there \nis a tax compliance issue involving that person or class of persons, \nand (3) the information sought is not readily available from other \nsources.\n  In recent years, the IRS has used John Doe summonses to obtain \ninformation about taxpayers operating in offshore secrecy \njurisdictions. For example, the IRS has obtained court approval to \nissue John Doe summonses to credit card associations, credit card \nprocessors, and credit card merchants, to obtain information about \ntaxpayers using credit cards issued by offshore banks. This information \nhas led to many successful cases in which the IRS identified funds \nhidden offshore and recovered unpaid taxes.\n  Use of the John Doe summons process, however, has proved \nunnecessarily time consuming and expensive. For each John Doe summons \ninvolving an offshore secrecy jurisdiction, the IRS has had to \nestablish in court that the involvement of accounts and transactions in \noffshore secrecy jurisdictions meant there was a significant likelihood \nof tax compliance problems. To relieve the IRS of the need to make this \nsame proof over and over, the bill would provide that, in any John Doe \nsummons proceeding involving a class defined in terms of accounts or \ntransactions in an offshore secrecy jurisdiction, the court may presume \nthat the case raises tax compliance issues. This presumption would then \neliminate the need for the IRS to repeatedly establish in court the \nobvious fact that accounts, entities, and transactions involving \noffshore secrecy jurisdictions raise tax compliance issues.\n\n  Second, for a smaller subset of John Doe cases, where the only \nrecords sought by the IRS are offshore bank account records held by a \nU.S. financial institution where the offshore bank has an account, the \nbill would relieve the IRS of the obligation to get prior court \napproval to serve the summons. Again, the justification is that \noffshore bank records are highly likely to involve accounts that raise \ntax compliance issues so no prior court approval should be required. \nEven in this instance, however, if a U.S. financial. institution were \nto decline to produce the requested records, the IRS would have to \nobtain a court order to enforce the summons.\n  Finally, the bill would streamline the John Doe summons approval \nprocess in large ``project'' investigations where the IRS anticipates \nissuing multiple summonses to definable classes of third parties, such \nas banks or credit card associations, to obtain information related to \nparticular taxpayers. Right now, for each summons issued in connection \nwith a project, the IRS has to obtain the approval of a court, often \nhaving to repeatedly establish the same facts before multiple judges in \nmultiple courts. This repetitive exercise wastes IRS, Justice \nDepartment, and court resources, and fragments oversight of the overall \nIRS investigative effort.\n  To streamline this process and strengthen court oversight of IRS use \nof John Doe summons, the bill would authorize the IRS to present an \ninvestigative project, as a whole, to a single judge to obtain approval \nfor issuing multiple summons related to that project. In such cases, \nthe court would retain jurisdiction over the case after approval is \ngranted, to exercise ongoing oversight of IRS issuance of summonses \nunder the project. To further strengthen court oversight, the IRS would \nbe required to file a publicly available report with the court on at \nleast an annual basis describing the summonses issued under the \nproject. The court would retain authority to restrict the use of \nfurther summonses at any point during the project. To evaluate the \neffectiveness of this approach, the bill would also direct the \nGovernment Accountability Office to report on the use of the provision \nafter five years.\n  Finally, Section 205 of the bill would make several changes to Title \n31 of the U.S. Code needed to reflect the IRS's new responsibility for \nenforcing the Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) requirements and to \nclarify the right of access to Suspicious Activity Reports by IRS civil \nenforcement authorities.\n  Under present law, a person controlling a foreign financial account \nwith over $10,000 is required to check a box on his or her income tax \nreturn and, under Title 31, also file an FBAR form with the IRS. \nTreasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which \nnormally enforces Title 31 provisions, recently delegated to the IRS \nthe responsibility for investigating FBAR violations and assessing FBAR \npenalties. Because the FBAR enforcement jurisdiction derives from Title \n31, however, and most of the information available to the IRS is tax \nreturn information, IRS routinely encounters difficulties in using \navailable tax information to fulfill its new role as FBAR enforcer. The \ntax disclosure law permits the use of tax information only for the \nadministration of the internal revenue laws or ``related statutes.'' \nThis rule is presently understood to require the IRS to determine, at a \nmanagerial level and on a case by case basis, that the Title 31 FBAR \nlaw is a ``related statute.'' Not only does this necessitate repetitive \ndeterminations in every FBAR case investigated by the IRS before each \nagent can look at the potential non-filer's income tax return, but it \nprevents the use by IRS\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\nof bulk data on foreign accounts received from tax treaty partners to \ncompare to FBAR filing records to find non-filers.\n  One of the stated purposes for the FBAR filing requirement is that \nsuch reports ``have a high degree of usefulness in . . . tax . . . \ninvestigations or proceedings.'' 31 U. S. C 5311. If one of the reasons \nfor requiring taxpayers to file FBARs is to use the information for tax \npurposes, and if IRS is to be charged with FBAR enforcement because of \nthe FBARs' connection to taxes, common sense dictates that the FBAR \nstatute should be considered a related statute for tax disclosure \npurposes, and the bill changes the related statute rule to say that.\n  The second change made by Section 205 is a technical amendment to the \nwording of the penalty provision. Currently the penalty is determined \nin part by the balance in the foreign bank account at the time of the \n``violation.'' The violation is interpreted to have occurred on the due \ndate of the FBAR return, which is June 30 of the year following the \nyear to which the report relates. The statute's use of this specific \nJune 30th date can lead to strange results if money is withdrawn from \nthe foreign account after the reporting period closed but before the \nreturn due date. To eliminate this unintended problem, the bill would \ninstead gauge the penalty by using the highest balance in the account \nduring the reporting period.\n\n  The third part of section 205 relates to Suspicious Activity Reports, \nwhich financial institutions are required to file with FinCEN whenever \nthey encounter suspicious transactions. FinCEN is required to share \nthis information with law enforcement, but currently does not permit \nIRS civil investigators access to the information. However, if the \ninformation that is gathered and transmitted to Treasury by the \nfinancial institutions at great expense is to be effectively utilized, \nits use should not be limited to the relatively small number of \ncriminal investigators, who can barely scratch the surface of the large \nnumber of reports. In addition, sharing the information with civil tax \ninvestigators would not increase the risk of disclosure, because they \noperate under the same tough disclosure rules as the criminal \ninvestigators. In some cases, IRS civil agents are now issuing an IRS \nsummons to a financial institution to get access, for a production fee, \nto the very same information the financial institution has already \nfiled with Treasury in a SAR. The bill changes those anomalous results \nby making it clear that ``law enforcement'' includes civil tax law \nenforcement.\n  Overall, our bill includes a host of innovative measures to \nstrengthen the ability of Federal regulators to combat offshore tax \nhaven abuses. We believe these new tools merit Congressional attention \nand enactment this year if we are going to begin to make a serious dent \nin the $100 billion in annual lost tax revenue from offshore tax abuses \nthat forces honest taxpayers to shoulder a greater tax burden than they \nwould otherwise have to bear.\n  Until now, I've been talking about what the bill would do to combat \noffshore tax abuses. Now I want to turn to what the bill would do to \ncombat abusive tax shelters and their promoters who use both domestic \nand offshore means to achieve their ends. Most of these provisions \nappeared in the Levin-Coleman-Obama bill from the last Congress. Some \nprovisions from that bill have been dropped or modified in light of \nthose that were enacted into law.\n  For five years, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has been \nconducting investigations into the design, sale, and implementation of \nabusive tax shelters. Our first hearing on this topic in recent years \nwas held in January 2002, when the Subcommittee examined an abusive tax \nshelter purchased by Enron. In November 2003, the Subcommittee held two \ndays of hearings and released a staff report that pulled back the \ncurtain on how even some respected accounting firms, banks, investment \nadvisors, and law firms had become engines pushing the design and sale \nof abusive tax shelters to corporations and individuals across this \ncountry. In February 2005, the Subcommittee issued a bipartisan report \nthat provided further details on the role these professional firms \nplayed in the proliferation of these abusive shelters. Our Subcommittee \nreport was endorsed by the full Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs in April 2005. Most recently, a 2006 Subcommittee \nstaff report entitled, ``Tax Haven Abuses: The Enablers, the Tools, and \nSecrecy,'' disclosed how financial and legal professionals designed and \nsold yet another abusive tax shelter known as the POINT Strategy, which \ndepended on secrecy laws and practices in the Isle of Man to conceal \nthe phantom nature of securities trades that lay at the center of this \ntax shelter transaction.\n  The Subcommittee investigations have found that many abusive tax \nshelters are not dreamed up by the taxpayers who use them. Instead, \nmost are devised by tax professionals, such as accountants, bankers, \ninvestment advisors, and lawyers, who then sell the tax shelter to \nclients for a fee. In fact, as our 2003 investigation widened, we found \na large number of tax advisors cooking up one complex scheme after \nanother, packaging them up as generic ``tax products'' with boiler-\nplate legal and tax opinion letters, and then undertaking elaborate \nmarketing schemes to peddle these products to literally thousands of \npersons across the country. In return, these tax shelter promoters were \ngetting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, while diverting \nbillions of dollars in tax revenues from the U.S. Treasury each year.\n  For example, one shelter investigated by the Subcommittee and \nfeatured in the 2003 hearings has since become part of an IRS effort to \nsettle cases involving a set of abusive tax shelters known as ``Son of \nBoss.'' Following our hearing, more than 1,200 taxpayers have admitted \nwrongdoing and agreed to pay back taxes, interest and penalties \ntotaling more than $3.7 billion. That's billions of dollars the IRS has \ncollected on just one type of tax shelter, demonstrating both the depth \nof the problem and the potential for progress. The POINT shelter \nfeatured in our 2006 hearing involved another $300 million in tax loss \non transactions conducted by just six taxpayers.\n\n  The bill we are introducing today contains a number of measures to \ncurb abusive tax shelters. First, it would strengthen the penalties \nimposed on those who aid or abet tax evasion. Second, it would prohibit \nthe issuance of tax shelter patents. Several provisions would deter \nbank participation in abusive tax shelter activities by requiring \nregulators to develop new examination procedures to detect and stop \nsuch activities. Others would end outdated communication barriers \nbetween the IRS and other enforcement agencies such as the SEC, bank \nregulators, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, to allow \nthe exchange of information relating to tax evasion cases. The bill \nalso provides for increased disclosure of tax shelter information to \nCongress.\n  In addition, the bill would simplify and clarify an existing \nprohibition on the payment of fees linked to tax benefits; and \nauthorize Treasury to issue tougher standards for tax shelter opinion \nletters. Finally, the bill would codify and strengthen the economic \nsubstance doctrine, which eliminates tax benefits for transactions that \nhave no real business purpose apart from avoiding taxes.\n  Let me be more specific about these key provisions to curb abusive \ntax shelters.\n  Title III of the bill strengthens two very important penalties that \nthe IRS can use in its fight against the professionals who make complex \nabusive shelters possible. Three years ago, the penalty for promoting \nan abusive tax shelter, as set forth in Section 6700 of the tax code, \nwas the lesser of $1,000 or 100 percent of the promoter's gross income \nderived from the prohibited activity. That meant in most cases the \nmaximum fine was just $1,000.\n  Many abusive tax shelters sell for $100,000 or $250,000 apiece. Our \ninvestigation uncovered some tax shelters that were sold for as much as \n$2 million or even $5 million apiece, as well as instances in which the \nsame cookie-cutter tax opinion letter was sold to 100 or even 200 \nclients. There are huge profits to be made in this business, and a \n$1,000 fine is laughable.\n  The Senate acknowledged that in 2004 when it adopted the Levin-\nColeman amendment to the JOBS Act, S. 1637, raising the Section 6700 \npenalty\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\non abusive tax shelter promoters to 100 percent of the fees earned by \nthe promoter from the abusive shelter. A 100 percent penalty would have \nensured that the abusive tax shelter hucksters would not get to keep a \nsingle penny of their ill-gotten gains. That figure, however, was cut \nin half in the conference report, setting the penalty at 50 percent of \nthe fees earned and allowing the promoters of abusive shelters to keep \nhalf of their illicit profits.\n  While a 50 percent penalty is an obvious improvement over $1000, this \npenalty still is inadequate and makes no sense. Why should anyone who \npushes an illegal tax shelter that robs our Treasury of needed revenues \nget to keep half of his ill-gotten gains? What deterrent effect is \ncreated by a penalty that allows promoters to keep half of their fees \nif caught, and of course, all of their fees if they are not caught?\n  Effective penalties should make sure that the peddler of an abusive \ntax shelter is deprived of every penny of profit earned from selling or \nimplementing the shelter and then is fined on top of that. Section 301 \nof this bill would do just that by increasing the penalty on tax \nshelter promoters to an amount equal to up to 150 percent of the \npromoters' gross income from the prohibited activity.\n  A second penalty provision in the bill addresses what our \ninvestigations have found to be a key problem: the knowing assistance \nof accounting firms, law firms, banks, and others to help taxpayers \nunderstate their taxes. In addition to those who meet the definition of \n``promoters'' of abusive shelters, there are professional firms that \naid and abet the use of abusive tax shelters and enable taxpayers to \ncarry out the abusive tax schemes. For example, law firms are often \nasked to write ``opinion letters'' to help taxpayers head off IRS \nquestioning and fines that they might otherwise confront for using an \nabusive shelter. Currently, under Section 6701 of the tax code, these \naiders and abettors face a maximum penalty of only $1,000, or $10,000 \nif the offender is a corporation. This penalty, too, is a joke. When \nlaw firms are getting $50,000 for each of these cookie-cutter \nopinion letters, it provides no deterrent whatsoever. A $1,000 fine is \nlike a jaywalking ticket for robbing a bank.\n\n  Section 302 of the bill would strengthen Section 6701 significantly, \nsubjecting aiders and abettors to a maximum fine up to 150 percent of \nthe aider and abettor's gross income from the prohibited activity. This \npenalty would apply to all aiders and abettors, not just tax return \npreparers.\n  Again, the Senate has recognized the need to toughen this critical \npenalty. In the 2004 JOBS Act, Sen. Coleman and I successfully \nincreased this fine to 100 percent of the gross income derived from the \nprohibited activity. Unfortunately, the conference report completely \nomitted this change, allowing aiders and abettors to continue to profit \nwithout penalty from their wrongdoing.\n  If further justification for toughening these penalties is needed, \none document uncovered by our investigation shows the cold calculation \nengaged in by a tax advisor facing low fines. A senior tax professional \nat accounting giant KPMG compared possible tax shelter fees with \npossible tax shelter penalties if the firm were caught promoting an \nillegal tax shelter. This senior tax professional wrote the following: \n``[O]ur average deal would result in KPMG fees of $360,000 with a \nmaximum penalty exposure of only $31,000.'' He then recommended the \nobvious: going forward with sales of the abusive tax shelter on a cost-\nbenefit basis.\n  Section 303 of our bill addresses the growing problem of tax shelter \npatents, which has the potential for significantly increasing abusive \ntax shelter activities.\n  In 1998, a Federal appeals court ruled for the first time that \nbusiness methods can be patented and, since then, various tax \npractitioners have filed applications to patent a variety of tax \nstrategies. The U.S. Patent Office has apparently issued 49 tax \nstrategy patents to date, with more on the way. These patents were \nissued by patent officers who, by statute, have a background in science \nand technology, not tax law, and know little to nothing about abusive \ntax shelters.\n  Issuing these types of patents raises multiple public policy \nconcerns. Patents issued for aggressive tax strategies, for example, \nmay enable unscrupulous promoters to claim the patent represents an \nofficial endorsement of the strategy and evidence that it would \nwithstand IRS challenge. Patents could be issued for blatantly illegal \ntax shelters, yet remain in place for years, producing revenue for the \nwrongdoers while the IRS battles the promoters in court. Patents for \ntax shelters found to be illegal by a court would nevertheless remain \nin place, creating confusion among users and possibly producing illicit \nincome for the patent holder.\n  Another set of policy concerns relates to the patenting of more \nroutine tax strategies. If a single tax practitioner is the first to \ndiscover an advantage granted by the law and secures a patent for it, \nthat person could then effectively charge a toll for all other \ntaxpayers to use the same strategy, even though as a matter of public \npolicy all persons ought to be able to take advantage of the law to \nminimize their taxes. Companies could even patent a legal method to \nminimize their taxes and then refuse to license that patent to their \ncompetitors in order to prevent them from lowering their operating \ncosts. Tax patents could be used to hinder productivity and competition \nrather than foster it.\n  The primary rationale for granting patents is to encourage \ninnovation, which is normally perceived to be a sufficient public \nbenefit to justify granting a temporary monopoly to the patent holder. \nIn the tax arena, however, there has historically been ample incentive \nfor innovation in the form of the tax savings alone. The last thing we \nneed is a further incentive for aggressive tax shelters. That's why \nSection 303 would prohibit the patenting of any ``invention designed to \nminimize, avoid, defer, or otherwise affect the liability for Federal, \nState, local, or foreign tax.''\n  Another finding of the Subcommittee investigations is that some tax \npractitioners are circumventing current state and federal constraints \non charging tax service fees that are dependent on the amount of \npromised tax benefits. Traditionally, accounting firms charged flat \nfees or hourly fees for their tax services. In the 1990s, however, they \nbegan charging ``value added'' fees based on, in the words of one \naccounting firm's manual, ``the value of the services provided, as \nopposed to the time required to perform the services.'' In addition, \nsome firms began charging ``contingent fees'' that were calculated \naccording to the size of the paper ``loss'' that could be produced for \na client and used to offset the client's other taxable income the \ngreater the so-called loss, the greater the fee.\n\n  In response, many states prohibited accounting firms from charging \ncontingent fees for tax work to avoid creating incentives for these \nfirms to devise ways to shelter substantial sums. The SEC and the \nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants also issued rules \nrestricting contingent fees, allowing them in only limited \ncircumstances. Recently, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \nissued a similar rule prohibiting public accounting firms from charging \ncontingent fees for tax services provided to the public companies they \naudit. Each of these federal, state, and professional ethics rules \nseeks to limit the use of contingent fees under certain, limited \ncircumstances.\n  The Subcommittee investigation found that tax shelter fees, which are \ntypically substantial and sometimes exceed $1 million, are often linked \nto the amount of a taxpayer's projected paper losses which can be used \nto shelter income from taxation. For example, in four tax shelters \nexamined by the Subcommittee in 2003, documents show that the fees were \nequal to a percentage of the paper loss to be generated by the \ntransaction. In one case, the fees were typically set at 7 percent of \nthe transaction's generated ``tax loss'' that clients could use to \nreduce other taxable income. In another, the fee was only 3.5 percent \nof the loss, but the losses were large enough to generate a fee of over \n$53 million on a single transaction. In other words, the greater the \nloss that could be concocted for the taxpayer or ``investor,'' the \ngreater the profit for the tax promoter. Think about that--greater the \nloss, the greater the profit. How's that for turning capitalism on its \nhead!\n  In addition, evidence indicated that, in at least one instance, a tax \nadvisor\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nwas willing to deliberately manipulate the way it handled certain tax \nproducts to circumvent contingent fee prohibitions. An internal \ndocument at an accounting firm related to a specific tax shelter, for \nexample, identified the states that prohibited contingent fees. Then, \nrather than prohibit the tax shelter transactions in those states or \nrequire an alternative fee structure, the memorandum directed the \nfirm's tax professionals to make sure the engagement letter was signed, \nthe engagement was managed, and the bulk of services was performed ``in \na jurisdiction that does not prohibit contingency fees.''\n\n  Right now, the prohibitions on contingent fees are complex and must \nbe evaluated in the context of a patchwork of federal, state, and \nprofessional ethics rules. Section 304 of the bill would establish a \nsingle enforceable rule, applicable nationwide, that would prohibit tax \npractitioners from charging fees calculated according to a projected or \nactual amount of tax savings or paper losses.\n  The bill would also help fight abusive tax shelters that are \ndisguised as complex investment opportunities and use financing or \nsecurities transactions provided by financial institutions. In reality, \ntax shelter schemes lack the economic risks and rewards associated with \na true investment. These phony transactions instead often rely on the \ntemporary use of significant amounts of money in low risk schemes \nmischaracterized as real investments. The financing or securities \ntransactions called for by these schemes are often supplied by a bank, \nsecurities firm, or other financial institution.\n  Currently the tax code prohibits financial institutions from \nproviding products or services that aid or abet tax evasion or that \npromote or implement abusive tax shelters. The agencies that oversee \nthese financial institutions on a daily basis, however, are experts in \nbanking and securities law and generally lack the expertise to spot tax \nissues. Section 305 would crack down on financial institutions' illegal \ntax shelter activities by requiring federal bank regulators and the SEC \nto work with the IRS to develop examination techniques to detect such \nabusive activities and put an end to them.\n  These examination techniques would be used regularly, preferably in \ncombination with routine regulatory examinations, and the regulators \nwould report potential violations to the IRS. The agencies would also \nbe required to prepare joint reports to Congress in 2009 and 2012 on \npreventing the participation of financial institutions in tax evasion \nor tax shelter activities.\n  During hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \non tax shelters in November 2003, IRS Commissioner Everson testified \nthat his agency was barred by Section 6103 of the tax code from \ncommunicating information to other federal agencies that would assist \nthose agencies in their law enforcement duties. He pointed out that the \nIRS was barred from providing tax return information to the SEC, \nfederal bank regulators, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard (PCAOB)--even, for example, when that information might assist \nthe SEC in evaluating whether an abusive tax shelter resulted in \ndeceptive accounting in a public company's financial statements, might \nhelp the Federal Reserve determine whether a bank selling tax products \nto its clients had violated the law against promoting abusive tax \nshelters, or help the PCAOB judge whether an accounting firm had \nimpaired its independence by selling tax shelters to its audit clients.\n  A recent example demonstrates how harmful these information barriers \nare to legitimate law enforcement efforts. In 2004, the IRS offered a \nsettlement initiative to companies and corporate executives who \nparticipated in an abusive tax shelter involving the transfer of stock \noptions to family-controlled entities. Over a hundred corporations and \nexecutives responded with admissions of wrongdoing. In addition to tax \nviolations, their misconduct may be linked to securities law violations \nand improprieties by corporate auditors or banks, but the IRS has \ninformed the Subcommittee that it is currently barred by law from \nsharing the names of the wrongdoers with the SEC, banking regulators, \nor PCAOB.\n  These communication barriers are outdated, inefficient, and ill-\nsuited to stopping the torrent of tax shelter abuses now affecting or \nbeing promoted by so many public companies, banks, and accounting \nfirms. To address this problem, Section 306 of this bill would \nauthorize the Treasury Secretary, with appropriate privacy safeguards, \nto disclose to the SEC, federal banking agencies, and the PCAOB, upon \nrequest, tax return information related to abusive tax shelters, \ninappropriate tax avoidance, or tax evasion. The agencies could then \nuse this information only for law enforcement purposes, such as \npreventing accounting firms or banks from promoting abusive tax \nshelters, or detecting accounting fraud in the financial statements of \npublic companies.\n  The bill would also provide for increased disclosure of tax shelter \ninformation to Congress. Section 307 would make it clear that companies \nproviding tax return preparation services to taxpayers cannot refuse to \ncomply with a Congressional document subpoena by citing Section 7216, \nwhich prohibits tax return preparers from disclosing taxpayer \ninformation to third parties. Several accounting and law firms raised \nthis claim in response to document subpoenas issued by the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, contending they were barred by the \nnondisclosure provision in Section 7216 from producing documents \nrelated to the sale of abusive tax shelters to clients for a fee.\n  The accounting and law firms maintained this position despite an \nanalysis provided by the Senate legal counsel showing that the \nnondisclosure provision was never intended to create a privilege or to \noverride a Senate subpoena, as demonstrated in federal regulations \ninterpreting the provision. This bill would codify the existing \nregulations interpreting Section 7216 and make it clear that \nCongressional document subpoenas must be honored.\n  Section 307 would also ensure Congress has access to information \nabout decisions by the Treasury related to an organization's tax exempt \nstatus. A 2003 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Tax \nAnalysts v. IRS, struck down certain IRS regulations and held that the \nIRS must disclose letters denying or revoking an organization's tax \nexempt status. The IRS has been reluctant to disclose such information, \nnot only to the public, but also to Congress, including in response to \nrequests by the Subcommittee.\n  For example, in 2005, the IRS revoked the tax exempt status of four \ncredit counseling firms, and, despite the Tax Analysts case, claimed \nthat it could not disclose to the Subcommittee the names of the four \nfirms or the reasons for revoking their tax exemption. Our bill would \nmake it clear that, upon receipt of a request from a Congressional \ncommittee or subcommittee, the IRS must disclose documents, other than \na tax return, related to the agency's determination to grant, deny, \nrevoke or restore an organization's exemption from taxation.\n  The Treasury Department recently issued new standards for tax \npractitioners issuing opinion letters on the tax implications of \npotential tax shelters as part of Circular 230. Section 308 of the bill \nwould provide express statutory authority for these and even clearer \nregulations.\n  The public has traditionally relied on tax opinion letters to obtain \ninformed and trustworthy advice about whether a tax-motivated \ntransaction meets the requirements of the law. The Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations has found that, in too many cases, tax \nopinion letters no longer contain disinterested and reliable tax \nadvice, even when issued by supposedly reputable accounting or law \nfirms. Instead, some tax opinion letters have become marketing tools \nused by tax shelter promoters and their allies to sell clients on their \nlatest tax products. In many of these cases, financial interests and \nbiases were concealed, unreasonable factual assumptions were used to \njustify dubious legal conclusions, and taxpayers were misled about the \nrisk that the proposed transaction would later be designated an illegal \ntax shelter. Reforms are essential to address these abuses and restore \nthe integrity of tax opinion letters.\n  The Treasury Department recently adopted standards that address a \nnumber of the abuses affecting tax shelter opinion letters; however, \nthe standards\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\ncould be stronger yet. Our bill would authorize Treasury to issue \nstandards addressing a wider spectrum of tax shelter opinion letter \nproblems, including: preventing concealed collaboration among \nsupposedly independent letter writers; avoiding conflicts of interest \nthat would impair auditor independence; ensuring appropriate fee \ncharges; preventing practitioners and firms from aiding and abetting \nthe understatement of tax liability by clients; and banning the \npromotion of potentially abusive tax shelters. By addressing each of \nthese areas, a beefed-up Circular 230 could help reduce the ongoing \nabusive practices related to tax shelter opinion letters.\n  Finally, Title IV of the bill incorporates a Baucus-Grassley proposal \nwhich would strengthen legal prohibitions against abusive tax shelters \nby codifying in Federal tax statutes for the first time what is known \nas the economic substance doctrine. This anti-tax abuse doctrine was \nfashioned by federal courts evaluating transactions that appeared to \nhave little or no business purpose or economic substance apart from tax \navoidance. It has become a powerful analytical tool used by courts to \ninvalidate abusive tax shelters. At the same time, because there is no \nstatute underlying this doctrine and the courts have developed and \napplied it differently in different judicial districts, the existing \ncase law has many ambiguities and conflicting interpretations.\n  This language was developed under the leadership of Senators Baucus \nand Grassley, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee. \nThe Senate has voted on multiple occasions to enact it into law, but \nHouse conferees have rejected it each time. Since no tax shelter \nlegislation would be complete without addressing this issue, Title IV \nof this comprehensive bill proposes once more to include the economic \nsubstance doctrine in the tax code.\n  The eyes of some people may glaze over when tax shelters and tax \nhavens are discussed, but unscrupulous taxpayers and tax professionals \nclearly see illicit dollar signs. Our commitment to crack down on their \ntax abuses must be as strong as their determination to get away with \nripping off America and American taxpayers.\n  Our bill provides powerful new tools to end the tax haven and tax \nshelter abuses. Tax haven and tax shelter abuses contribute nearly $100 \nbillion to the $345 billion annual tax gap, which represents taxes owed \nbut not paid. It's long past time for taxes owing to the people's \nTreasury to be collected. And it's long past time for Congress to end \nthe shifting of a disproportionate tax burden onto the shoulders of \nhonest Americans.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Stop Tax \nHaven Abuse Act, which I am proud to cosponsor with Senators Levin and \nColeman. This bill seeks to improve the fairness of our tax system by \ndeterring the abuse of secret tax havens and unacceptable tax avoidance \nstrategies. It is a serious solution to a serious problem.\n  An investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations found that offshore tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions \nhold trillions of dollars in assets and are often used as havens for \ntax evasion, financial fraud, and money laundering. Experts estimate \nthat abusive tax shelters and tax havens cost this country between $40 \nbillion and $70 billion every year, and the burden of filling this gap \nis borne unfairly by taxpayers who follow the rules and can't afford \nhigh-priced lawyers and accountants to help them game the system.\n  The problem is not new, but we need a new solution. Several years \nago, the subcommittee heard testimony from the owner of a Cayman Island \noffshore bank who estimated that all of his clients--100 percent--were \nengaged in tax evasion, and 95 percent were U.S. citizens. In 2000, the \nEnron Corporation--remember Enron?--established over 441 offshore \nentities in the Cayman Islands. A 2004 report found that U.S. \nmultinational corporations are increasingly attributing their profits \nto offshore jurisdictions. A 2005 study of high-net-worth individuals \nworldwide estimated that their offshore assets now total $11.5 \ntrillion. The IRS has estimated that more than half a million U.S. \ntaxpayers have offshore bank accounts and access those funds with \noffshore credit cards.\n  Unfortunately, the tax, corporate, or bank secrecy laws and practices \nof about 50 countries make it nearly impossible for American \nauthorities to gain access to necessary information about U.S. \ntaxpayers in order to enforce U.S. tax laws. Today, the Government has \nthe burden of proving that a taxpayer has control of the tax haven \nentity and is the beneficial owner. This allows taxpayers to rely on \nthe secrecy protections of tax havens to deceive Federal tax \nauthorities and evade taxes.\n  This is not a political issue of how low or high taxes ought to be. \nThis is a basic issue of fairness and integrity. Corporate and \nindividual taxpayers alike must have confidence that those who \ndisregard the law will be identified and adequately punished. Those who \ndefy the law or game the system must face consequences. Those who \nenforce the law need the tools and resources to do so. We cannot sit \nidly by while tax secrecy jurisdictions impede the enforcement of U.S. \nlaw.\n  Under this bill, if you create a trust or corporation in a tax haven \njurisdiction, send it assets, or benefit from its actions, the Federal \nGovernment will presume in civil judicial and administrative \nproceedings that you control the entity and that any income generated \nby it is your income for tax, securities, and money-laundering \npurposes. The burden of proof shifts to the corporation or the \nindividual, who may rebut these presumptions by clear and convincing \nevidence.\n  This bill provides an initial list of offshore secrecy jurisdictions \nwhere these evidentiary presumptions will apply. Taxpayers with foreign \nfinancial accounts in Anguilla, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, or \nDominica, for example, should be prepared to report their accounts to \nthe IRS. And this bill will make it easier for the IRS to find such \ntaxpayers if they do not.\n  The Treasury Secretary may add to or subtract from the list of \noffshore secrecy jurisdictions. The list does not reflect a \ndetermination that a country is necessarily uncooperative but merely \nthat it is difficult to obtain adequate financial and beneficial \nownership information from that country and it is ripe for tax abuse. \nIf an offshore jurisdiction is in fact uncooperative and impedes U.S. \ntax enforcement, however, this bill gives Treasury the authority to \nimpose sanctions, including the denial of the right to issue credit \ncards for use in the United States.\n  This bill also establishes a $1 million penalty on public companies \nor their officers who fail to disclose foreign holdings and requires \nhedge funds and private equity funds to establish anti-money laundering \nprograms and to submit suspicious activity reports. Importantly, this \nbill clarifies that the sole purpose of a transaction cannot \nlegitimately be to evade tax liability. Transactions must have \nmeaningful ``economic substance'' or a business purpose apart from tax \navoidance or evasion.\n  There is no such thing as a free lunch--someone always has to pay. \nAnd when a crooked business or shameless individual does not pay its \nfair share, the burden gets shifted to others, usually to ordinary \ntaxpayers and working Americans without access to sophisticated tax \npreparers or corporate loopholes.\n  This bill strengthens our ability to stop shifting the tax burden to \nworking families. All of us must pay our fair share of the cost of \nsecuring and running this country. There is no excuse for benefiting \nfrom the laws and services, institutions, and economic structure of our \nNation, while evading your responsibility to do your part. I believe it \nis our job to keep the system fair, and that is what this bill seeks to \ndo.\n  I commend Senator Levin and Senator Coleman for their leadership on \nthis important issue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S.J. Res. 3. A joint resolution to specify an expiration date for the \nauthorization of use of military force under the Authorization for Use \nof Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 and to authorize the \ncontinuing presence of United States forces in Iraq after that date for \ncertain military operations and activities; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yesterday, the House of Representatives clearly \nexpressed its support for our troops and its disapproval of the \nPresident's action to escalate the war. Today, it is the Senate's turn.\n  Today, I believe that by voting for cloture, a majority of the Senate \nwill convey the same message. There may not be 60 votes, but I believe \nthere will be a majority. Our forces have been in Iraq for 4 years, \n$380 billion has been spent, more than 3,000 troops have been killed, \nand nearly 24,000 have been wounded. My home State of California has \nlost more than 300 brave men and women, with thousands injured.\n  Iraq is in chaos: Sunni fighting Shia, Shia fighting Sunni, car \nbombs, IEDs, assassinations, mortar attacks, downed helicopters, death \nsquads, and sabotaged infrastructure. Every day, we learn of new \nattacks, new casualties, new bloodshed, and no end in sight.\n  I believe this surge is a mistake. Four years ago, U.S. Armed Forces \nwent to Iraq to be liberators. Today, they are caught in the bloody \ncrossfire of internecine fighting. The question is, Can the American \nmilitary solve a civil war? I don't believe it can. It was certainly \nnot the mission Congress authorized in 2002. So the time has come for \nthe Senate to say so, just as the House has done. The time has come to \ndeclare that our time has come and gone in Iraq. The time has come to \nspeak clearly, and the time has come to change course.\n  The authorization for use of military force, approved by the Congress \nin October 2002, carries with it congressional approval of this war. \nThe way to change course is to change that authorization. Therefore, \ntoday, I introduce legislation that will put the expiration date of \nDecember 31, 2007, on the authorization for use of military force.\n  The President would be required to return to Congress if he seeks to \nrenew the resolution. The resolution recognizes that conditions have \nchanged since the 2002 authorization was approved. Saddam Hussein is \ngone. An Iraqi Government has been established. It also recognizes the \nflaws of the 2002 authorization. Iraq, in fact, had no weapons of mass \ndestruction. It was not closely allied with al-Qaida.\n  This resolution does not call for a precipitous withdrawal--let me \nstress that--but it sets a time limit--the remaining 10 months of the \nyear--to stage an orderly redeployment and to transition this mission. \nThat mission would be limited to training, equipping, and advising \nIraqi security and police forces; to force protection and security for \nU.S. Armed Forces and civilian personnel; support of Iraqi security \nforces for border security and protection, to be carried out with the \nminimum forces required for that purpose; targeted counterterrorism \noperations against al-Qaida and foreign fighters within Iraq; and \nlogistical support in connection with these activities.\n  I believe this legislation is the next logical step following today. \nIt is simple, it is concise. After the majority vote today sends our \ndisapproval to the President, it is time to consider the next step. I \nsubmit this resolution as a possible next step.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 3\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, \nFebruary 27, at 11:30 a.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nS. 184, Calendar No. 26, a bill to provide improved rail and surface \ntransportation security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, my understanding is the \nSenate would next turn to the so-called 9/11 bill on which the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee worked. That bill is not \nyet on the calendar and will be filed sometime this week.\n  I understand that the pending unanimous consent request is that we \nturn to a different bill, which has been reported by the Commerce \nCommittee. At this point, I am compelled to object to this unanimous \nconsent request and say to the majority leader, once the 9/11 bill is \navailable and Members have had an opportunity to review the \nlegislation, I will be happy to revisit this consent request. So I, \ntherefore, object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in response to my friend, he is absolutely \nright. We had every intention of moving to the Homeland Security bill, \nbut it wasn't reported out of the committee. The matter I read, \nCalendar No. 26, is part of a big bill. I, frankly, understand why \nthere is an objection. We are going to file a cloture motion. \nHopefully, in the interim period of time, when people have a chance to \nlook at this bill, we will get consent from the Republicans to move \nforward.\n  The reason I am moving to this bill now is I didn't want to waste \nTuesday. Time is so precious around here that I wanted to get to this \nor some vehicle as soon as we can. We will do our best in the next few \ndays to try to work this out.\n  The Republican leader already objected to my request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now move to proceed to S. 184 and send a \ncloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close the debate on the motion to proceed to S. 184, a bill to \nprovide improved rail and surface transportation security.\n         Harry Reid, Russell D.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 81 and \nthe Senate then proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Res. 81) recognizing the 45th anniversary of \n     John Hershel Glenn, Jr's historic achievement in becoming the \n     first United States astronaut to orbit the Earth.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the time is late and a lot of people \nwant to go a lot of different places, but I have to say that John Glenn \nis one of the most amazing people I have ever known, to think that I \nhad the opportunity to serve with him in this body, a man who was an \nace in World War II, knocking down enemy aircraft in his marine \nvehicle. He was an ace in the Korean war and, of course, America's most \nfamous astronaut.\n  I will just say in passing, when I first came here as a Senator, at \nour Tuesday luncheon, Senator Glenn said: Does anybody want to go with \nme? I am going to go out on the USS Kennedy, which is an aircraft \ncarrier. He said: I am going to watch some landings. I said: Well, gee, \nJohn Glenn, aircraft carrier, which I have never been on. I said: I \nwill try that. And I did.\n  It was interesting. We flew out in an airplane. It was stopped very \nquickly because a hook grabbed the airplane. Then I watched these new \npilots, who had never landed on an aircraft carrier, coming in, wings \nwobbling. They would wave some off: ``Dirty, dirty''--that is the word \nthey used to get this thing out of there. Lots of them landed.\n  Then John Glenn got in one of those planes and was catapulted off the \naircraft carrier and came in on a landing himself. He is an amazing \nman.\n  I have one final story about John Glenn. My office was in the Hart \nBuilding. Nevada had the champions in double Dutch jump-roping. They \nwere out in the atrium of the Hart Building showing me what they could \ndo. It is amazing--several people jumping at the same time. They asked \nme to do it. I made--I wouldn't say a fool of myself, but I couldn't do \nit. I didn't realize John Glenn was standing watching this. Here is a \nman, at the time had to be 70 years old, and he walked over and said: \nCan I try that? He was like one of the kids. An amazing man.\n  This is a resolution recognizing the 45th anniversary of his historic \nachievement. Becoming the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth is \nonly one of the achievements this great man did--and he is still \nhealthy and strong--with his wonderful wife Annie.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 81) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 81\n\n       Whereas John Herschel Glenn, Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, \n     in Cambridge, Ohio, and grew up in New Concord, a small \n     college town a few miles from the larger city of Zanesville, \n     Ohio;\n       Whereas John Glenn attended New Concord High School and \n     earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from \n     Muskingum College, which also awarded him an honorary Doctor \n     of Science degree in engineering;\n       Whereas John Glenn enlisted in the Naval Aviation Cadet \n     Program shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor and was \n     commissioned in the United States Marine Corps in 1943;\n       Whereas John Glenn served in combat in the South Pacific \n     and also requested combat duty during the Korean conflict.\n       Whereas John Glenn was a dedicated military officer, flying \n     149 missions during 2 wars;\n       Whereas John Glenn received many honors for his military \n     service, among them the Distinguished Flying Cross on 6 \n     occasions, the Air Medal with 18 Clusters, the Asiatic-\n     Pacific Campaign Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the \n     World War II Victory Medal, the China Service Medal, the \n     National Defense Service Medal, and the Korean Service Medal;\n       Whereas John Glenn served several years as a test pilot on \n     Navy and Marine Corps jet fighters and attack aircraft;\n       Whereas, as a test pilot, John Glenn set a transcontinental \n     speed record in 1957 by completing the first flight to \n     average supersonic speeds from Los Angeles to New York;\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\n       Whereas John Glenn was a pioneer in the realm of space \n     exploration and was selected in 1959 as one of the original 7 \n     astronauts in the United States space program, entering the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) \n     Project Mercury;\n       Whereas John Glenn was assigned to the NASA Space Task \n     Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia;\n       Whereas, in 1962, the Space Task Group was moved to \n     Houston, Texas, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft \n     Center;\n       Whereas, on February 20, 1962, John Glenn piloted the \n     Mercury-Atlas 6 ``Friendship 7'' spacecraft on the first \n     manned orbital mission of the United States;\n       Whereas, after launching from the Kennedy Space Center in \n     Florida, John Glenn completed a 3-orbit mission around the \n     planet, reaching an approximate maximum altitude of 162 \n     statute miles and an approximate orbital velocity of 17,500 \n     miles per hour;\n       Whereas John Glenn landed Friendship 7 approximately 5 \n     hours later, 800 miles southeast of the Kennedy Space Center \n     near Grand Turk Island;\n       Whereas, with that pioneering flight, John Glenn joined his \n     colleagues Alan Shepard and Virgil Grissom in realizing the \n     dream of space exploration and engaging the minds and \n     imaginations of his and future generations in the vast \n     potential of space exploration;\n       Whereas, after retiring from the space program, John Glenn \n     continued his public service as a distinguished member of the \n     Senate, in which he served for 24 years;\n       Whereas John Glenn has continued his public service through \n     his work at the John Glenn Institute at Ohio State \n     University, which was established to foster public \n     involvement in the policy-making process, raise public \n     awareness about key policy issues, and encourage continuous \n     improvement in the management of public enterprise;\n       Whereas, in March 1999, Secretary of Education Richard W. \n     Riley appointed John Glenn as Chair of the newly formed \n     National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for \n     the 21st Century;\n       Whereas the Commission played a pivotal role in improving \n     the quality of teaching in mathematics and science in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in 1998, John Glenn returned to space after 36 \n     years as a member of the crew of the space shuttle Discovery, \n     serving as a payload specialist and as a subject for basic \n     research on how weightlessness affects the body of an older \n     person; and\n       Whereas, combined with his previous missions, John Glenn \n     logged over 218 hours in space: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the 45th anniversary of John Hershel Glenn, \n     Jr.'s landmark mission piloting the first manned orbital \n     mission of the United States; and\n       (2) recognizes the profound importance of John Glenn's \n     achievement as a catalyst to space exploration and scientific \n     advancement in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/17/senate-section/article/S2219-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN SPIRITUAL\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 69\n\n       Whereas since slavery was introduced into the European \n     colonies in 1619, enslaved Africans remained in bondage until \n     the United States ratified the 13th amendment to the \n     Constitution in 1865;\n       Whereas during that period in the history of the United \n     States, the first expression of a unique American music was \n     created by enslaved African-Americans who--\n       (1) used their knowledge of the English language and the \n     Christian religious faith, as it had been taught to them in \n     the New World; and\n       (2) stealthily wove within the music their experience of \n     coping with human servitude and their strong desire to be \n     free;\n       Whereas as a method of survival, enslaved African-Americans \n     who were forbidden to speak their native languages, play \n     musical instruments they had used in Africa, or practice \n     their traditional religious beliefs, relied on their strong \n     African oral tradition of songs, stories, proverbs, and \n     historical accounts to create an original genre of music, now \n     known as spirituals;\n       Whereas Calvin Earl, a noted performer of, and educator on, \n     African-American spirituals, remarked that the Christian \n     lyrics became a metaphor for freedom from slavery, a secret \n     way for slaves to ``communicate with each other, teach their \n     children, record their history, and heal their pain'';\n       Whereas the New Jersey Historical Commission found that \n     ``some of those daring and artful runaway slaves who entered \n     New Jersey by way of the Underground Railroad no doubt sang \n     the words of old Negro spirituals like `Steal Away' before \n     embarking on their perilous journey north'';\n       Whereas African-American spirituals spread all over the \n     United States, and the songs we know of today may represent \n     only a small portion of the total number of spirituals that \n     once existed;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass, a fugitive slave who would \n     become one of the leading abolitionists in the United States, \n     remarked that spirituals ``told a tale of woe which was then \n     altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones \n     loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint \n     of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone \n     was a testimony against slavery and a prayer to God for \n     deliverance from chains.''; and\n       Whereas section 2(a)(1) of the American Folklife \n     Preservation Act (20 U.S.C. 2101(a)(1)) states that ``the \n     diversity inherent in American folklife has contributed \n     greatly to the cultural richness of the Nation and has \n     fostered a sense of individuality and identity among the \n     American people'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that African-American spirituals are a \n     poignant and powerful genre of music that have become one of \n     the most significant segments of American music in existence;\n       (2) expresses the deepest gratitude, recognition, and honor \n     to the former enslaved Africans in the United States for \n     their gifts to the Nation, including their original music and \n     oral history; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to reflect \n     on the important contribution of African-American spirituals \n     to United States history and to recognize the African-\n     American spiritual as a national treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/17/senate-section/article/S2219-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 976\n\n  Mr. REID.
