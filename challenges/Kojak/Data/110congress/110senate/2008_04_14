Mr. President, amidst a great war that threatened to tear \napart the fabric of our Nation, Abraham Lincoln gazed upon a \nbattlefield and was moved to say:\n\n       My dream is of a place and a time where America will once \n     again be seen as the last best hope on earth.\n\n  Mr. President, on Monday, April 7, U.S. Army SGT Timothy Smith gave \nhis life in pursuit of that dream. Sergeant Smith was 25 years old.\n  While serving in Iraq with the 4th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, \n10th Mountain Division, Sergeant Smith was killed when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near the armored vehicle in which he was \nriding with SGT Brandon Lords.\n  Sergeant Smith and Sergeant Lords were brothers in arms, and they had \nmade a pact that if one was lost in combat, the other would escort his \nbody home. Sergeant Lords will honor that promise by accompanying his \nfallen comrade's body to South Lake Tahoe, where he will be received by \nhis beloved family and friends before he is laid to rest.\n  Both Sergeant Smith and Sergeant Lords were emblematic of the \ncourageous young men and women who serve in the U.S. military. My words \nare certainly insufficient to fully express our gratitude for their \nvalor. Our hearts and prayers are with Tim's family.\n  Thursday night, at about 7 o'clock Washington time, I called and \nspoke to Michael, Tim's father. We had a very nice visit. I expressed \nmy sympathy, and I said to Michael: You know, I have four boys, and I \ncannot comprehend what you are going through at this time. We talked \nfor quite a long time, and he said, ``Before you hang up, would you \ntalk to Timmy's brother Tommy?'' I said that I would be happy to. He \nwas right there. So I talked to him for quite a long time. I told Tommy \nthat I could appreciate what he was going through because I was one of \nfour brothers. My brother Dale died unexpectedly in his midforties. I \nexpressed to Tommy how, even today--on that Thursday night--I would \nlike to be able to talk to my brother Dale, even though it has been \nmore than two decades ago that he died. I can see in one of my boys my \nbrother Dale's smile and the way he walks. So I could empathize much \nbetter with Tommy than I could with his dad.\n  We talked for quite a long time and he said, ``Would you talk to \nJackie?'' That is their sister. We had a wonderful visit, talking about \nhow sorry they\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\nfelt, how they will miss their brother. When I was getting ready to end \nthe conversation with Jackie, she said, ``Will you call Mom?'' Her \nmother was visiting with Tim's wife in North or South Carolina--I \nforget which. So I called her when I hung up. We had another nice \nvisit.\n  I told Michael, when I first called--and these calls are really hard \nto make. I have made a few of them, and they are difficult to make. \nThis call was no easier than the others. It was sure a nice visit we \nhad, in effect, crying on each other's shoulder. I think that is what \nthese times are for, to be able to reflect on our loved and lost. So I \nindicated to each of those four to make sure they expressed to Tim's \nwife Shayna and their son Riley how our thoughts and prayers go out to \nher and the little boy.\n  Tim graduated in 2001 from South Tahoe High School. He joined the \nArmy in April 2004--about 4 years ago. He is remembered by all as \nhaving a special sense of humor, for making people laugh, and really \nfor his warmth. He was opinionated and strong, even from a young age. \nHe was determined, courageous, and caring.\n  Tim married Shayna on the Fourth of July 2007. Their son Riley must \nnow grow up to be a man without a father but with the gift of knowing \nhis father was a real live American hero who gave his life for his \ncountry.\n  Honoring SGT Timothy Smith on the floor of the Senate is no more than \na modest tribute to his great sacrifice. I hope it is some small \ncomfort to those his life and courage touched that the Senate and the \nAmerican people share the pain of their grief and the burden of their \nsacrifice.\n  In SGT Timothy Smith's memory, as I told his parents and brother and \nsister, we pray that every man and woman serving in Iraq will come home \nsafely and soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/14/senate-section/article/S2956-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the good fortune, earlier today, to \nhave the first visit in a long time to the new Capitol Visitor Center.\n  When I first came to Washington many years ago and served as a \nCapitol policeman, every evening in the summer part of my duty was to \ngo out on the east front of the Capitol and watch things. I can \nremember having many fond memories, such as watching Carl Hayden in his \nwheelchair watching those concerts. Even back then, I thought, gee, \nthis is such a beautiful place.\n  The east front of the Capitol is so much easier for visitors coming \nto the Capitol to see than the west front because there are not those \nbig steps. Before, it didn't look very nice. The blacktop covered that \nplace. That just didn't look right--with cars parked there and oil \nspilled from the cars.\n  I had the good fortune, in the third year that I was a Senator, to \nbecome chairman of the Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee. \nBack then, the reason I was able to do it was Senator Bumpers simply \ndidn't want to do it. It was a great experience for me. I started \nworking to do something to make the east front of the Capitol a little \nmore visually nice. We did a number of things. First, we got the cars \noff.\n  With the help of many other Senators, we were able to finally get \nlegislative permission to do something about it in a big way. The \nculmination of our being able to do that was when two police officers \nwere killed on the House side, on the east front of the Capitol. That \ngave us the impetus to fund the project the way it should be funded. We \ndid that. Now that is just great. It is so wonderful.\n  The Capitol Visitor Center is the eighth major expansion of the \nCapitol in its 214-year history. The last one was out here on the east \nfront of the Capitol for the rooms we have there for holding meetings. \nThis facility out here is almost 600,000 square feet of space. It is \nequivalent in size to the current footprint of the Capitol. It consists \nof beautiful sandstone, granite, and marble from 14 different States. \nThe Capitol Visitor Center project conforms to ``Buy American'' \nstandards. I saw a lot of beautiful things but probably the most \nbeautiful on the tour this morning were the historic Olmstead fountains \nand lanterns. They have been beautifully restored and are going to be \nthe centerpiece over there.\n  Mr. President, if someone wants to visit the Capitol today, there is \nno place for them to gather. It used to be on the east front, and now \nit is on the west front. The people who work here joke about it, \nsaying: You can always tell when it is summertime because you can smell \nthe visitors. The visitors stand out in the high humidity, heat, and \nthey sweat. There is no place for them to go. The bathrooms in this \nfacility are almost nonexistent. There is one on each side, and they \nare very small. This visitors center can hold 4,000 visitors at one \ntime, and, with 8 magnetometers, they can process 2,000 people an hour. \nIt will make this place vastly more secure than it is. We expect as \nmany as 3 million visitors a year under the new process we will have \nhere.\n  When visitors come here now, there is no place for them to eat, no \nplace to go to the bathroom, and there are limited places to buy \nsouvenirs. With our new facility, there will be a 550-seat cafeteria, \nwith a beautiful kitchen that will be as good as anyplace there is in \nour country.\n  There is an 18,000-foot exhibition hall that will feature many never-\nseen-before historic documents, such as Madison's notes from the \ndrafting of the Constitution.\n  There are two 250-seat orientation theaters. When people come to the \nCapitol, they will see an 11-minute film that is done so beautifully, \nand it will tell them what they are going to see in the Capitol. That \nis as it should be. Now people walk in and don't know what to expect. \nThere is a film they will see called ``Out Of Many, One.'' It will be \nplayed every 11 minutes.\n  There are two beautiful gift shops--one on the House side and one on \nthe Senate side--and 26 restaurants. There are meeting rooms for \nconstituent meetings. The cost is a lot, about $650 million. But in \ncomparison, the Newseum, which was opened this past Friday, cost \nroughly $550 million. It took 7 years to complete, and it did not have \nall the security problems we have had here.\n  I congratulate the Office of the Architect of the Capitol. They did a \nwonderful job. Everyone has cooperated. It is a facility of which we \ncan all be proud. I enjoyed my visit through it. It will be an added \nfeature of this beautiful building, and it will make it so people can \ncome here safely and securely and all the many people who work in this \nCapitol and work in these office buildings will also certainly be more \nsafe because there is a way to come in and there is adequate security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/14/senate-section/article/S2956-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tomorrow is April 15, the day tax returns \nare due to the IRS for most citizens. It is a day most Americans meet \nwith fear and loathing. Even though most taxpayers will not file their \nreturns tomorrow because they have already done so or because they have \nfiled for an extension, April 15 remains a symbol of a burdensome tax \nliability and an even more burdensome tax compliance system for \nmillions of Americans.\n  April 15 is met with apprehension and dread for many reasons. The \nprimary one is understandable. People do not like paying taxes. Who can \nblame them? Under the best of circumstances, if you owe Uncle Sam, a \nday spent with your tax return is worse than a day spent with the \ndentist. Yes, the IRS has become one of the most despised institutions \nin American life. However, a good share of this agency's reputation is \nundeserved. In fact, considering all we require the Internal Revenue \nService to do and the resources we give them, the folks who work there \ndo a pretty darn good job.\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\n  Paying taxes is never going to be popular, nor is it ever going to be \nfun. However, we all know it does not have to be as bad as it is. A \ngreat deal of the aggravation, a good share of the complexity, and much \nof the confusion is probably unnecessary.\n  I could spend many hours speaking about what is wrong with our tax \nsystem. It is, in military parlance, a target-rich environment. In \nfact, I expect we will hear a fair number of our colleagues speaking \ntoday and tomorrow on the Senate floor deploring the tax system. But \namid all this denouncement of the IRS and the Tax Code, we in Congress \nshould recognize an ugly truth; that is, a great deal of the blame for \nour far less than first-rate tax system lies right here with us, the \nMembers of Congress who created it and who have the power to improve \nit.\n  I wish to focus on a disturbing trend we have seen growing much worse \nin recent years that is adding a great deal of stress to our already \ntroubled tax system. This is the increasing tendency of the Congress to \ncreate temporary tax provisions and then allow them to expire while \nleaving taxpayers in limbo as to what the rules are going to be.\n  If we take a look at over the past dozen or so years, we see a \ngrowing proclivity on the part of Congress to enact tax provisions on a \ntemporary basis rather than permanently. This has mostly been done to \nsatisfy the often perverse demands of our budget rules.\n  But whatever the reasons, the effect of not extending these \nprovisions before they expire has been greatly damaging to the tax \nsystem and to taxpayers' ability to understand and rely on the law. The \neffect has been to weaken this country economically and competitively.\n  Let us consider the research credit as an example. This is an \nimportant provision that has been in the law since the early 1980s, and \nit enjoys wide and bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.\n  The research credit provides a strong incentive for businesses to \nincrease their research and development activities in the United \nStates. It probably is universally accepted that R investment is the \nlifeblood of high technology and is vital to the future of our economic \nleadership.\n  We all know this, and almost to a person, the Members in this body \nwould say they support a strong, vibrant, effective, and permanent \nresearch system. Why then have we allowed this credit to expire 13 \ntimes?\n  Here we are, once again, in mid-April and our research credit has \nbeen expired since the end of last year. The worst part is, while we \nall believe it will be extended eventually, everyone knows the credit \nwill not be made permanent, and the likelihood it will be allowed to \nexpire again is very high.\n  In the meantime, many of our global trading partners have developed \nstronger and more permanent research incentives in an attempt to lure \naway research from our shores. They perceive a weakness in our \nincentive system, and they are moving to capitalize on this very \nweakness. It appears these actions are working because we are seeing \nthe amount of research activity in the United States growing much more \nslowly than it is overseas. We simply cannot afford to lose to other \ncountries our research and the jobs that research brings.\n  Unfortunately, this problem goes way beyond the research credit. Each \nyear, the Joint Committee on Taxation releases a list of expired and \nexpiring tax provisions. The list for 2008 was 28 pages long and \nincluded an unbelievable 145 provisions. By contrast, the list released \nin 2003 was 13 pages and featured 71 provisions. Fifteen years ago, \nthere would not have been much of a list at all.\n  Our habit of adding new expiring provisions in the tax law is out of \ncontrol and, worse, our refusal to deal with extending these provisions \non a timely basis well before they expire is inexcusable.\n  It is the obligation of the majority party in Congress to operate the \nlegislative trains so they run on time and produce laws on which our \npeople can at least rely, if not be proud of. While there is blame to \nspread between both parties in this area of expired tax provisions, \nwhich have such a degenerating effect on our already shaky tax system, \nwe all know who is at fault for the current fiasco.\n  I do not think anyone in this body will have trouble recalling the \nweeks-long standoff that occurred late last year over the so-called AMT \npatch. All of us, though, would probably prefer to forget it if we \ncould.\n  Instead of addressing the issue of alternative minimum tax and its \nexpired thresholds early on, which would have lent a degree of \ncertainty to an already obnoxious and insidious tax, the Democrats last \nyear dithered on both the AMT patch and on the other soon-to-expire \nprovisions.\n  The result was a last-minute agreement on the AMT patch that put this \nyear's tax filing season in jeopardy, greatly confused the American \ntaxpayers, and left behind the other now-expired tax provisions. \nPerhaps most stunningly irresponsible was the fact that we took care of \nthe AMT patch for 2007 only, and now we are facing the same scenario \nfor this year. It must have been so much fun last year that we want to \ndo it again in 2008.\n  I am very aware of the arguments surrounding the question of whether \nextending these provisions should be offset, and I will address those \non another day.\n  Today, however, on the eve of America's most hated day, I call on my \ncolleagues, and especially those on the other side of the aisle, to \nconsider why this is so and what it is we are not doing that is the \nreason why the words ``April 15,'' ``IRS,'' and ``Congress'' are among \nthe least popular in the lexicon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the next 33 hours, millions of \nAmericans will face mindless, relentless, needless tax torture trying \nto shovel their way out from under an avalanche of bureaucratic forms \nas they struggle to complete their taxes.\n  Citizens Against Government Waste has calculated that Americans spend \n4.3 billion hours each year filing their tax returns and complying with \nour tax laws. That is a lot of time to spend on something that is about \nas interesting as prolonged root canal work.\n  My guess is many Americans would rather read the phonebook than our \nTax Code, and the phonebook is actually a lot shorter. So I am going to \ngive one example of the heavy reading Americans have in front of us \nover the next 33 hours.\n  The alternative minimum tax, of course, is a killer tax for millions \nof Americans. It calculates taxable income differently than the regular \ntax. It adds a whole new layer of complexity to the Code and headache \nfor our citizens. So I am going to read one of the portions of the AMT \nrules that clobber our middle-class taxpayers, and it is the one that \nis used to calculate the size of the interest deduction middle-income \nfolks are allowed in our country.\n  Under section (C), it reads:\n\n       In determining the amount allowable as a deduction for \n     interest, subsections (d) and (h) of section 163 shall apply, \n     except that--\n       (i) in lieu of the exception under section 163(h)(2)(D), \n     the term ``personal interest'' shall not include any \n     qualified housing interest (as defined in subsection (e)),\n       (ii) sections 163(d)(6) and 163(h)(5) (relating to phase-\n     ins) shall not apply,\n       (iii) interest on any specified private activity bond (and \n     any amount treated as interest on a specified private \n     activity bond on under section 57(a)(5)(B), and any deduction \n     referred to in section 57(a)(5)(A), shall be treated as \n     includible in gross income (or as deductible) for purposes of \n     applying section 163(d),\n       (iv) in lieu of the exception under section \n     163(d)(3)(B)(i), the term ``investment interest'' shall not \n     include any qualified housing interest (as defined in \n     subsection (e)), and\n       (v) the adjustments of this section and sections 57 and 58 \n     shall apply in determining net investment income under \n     section 163(d).\n\n  It is obvious to all who are still awake at this point, since I have \ngone through just one of the sections, this is not exactly clarity in \nAmerican Government. I cannot find anybody who can get through this. I \nwould go through it again, but I only have 10\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\nminutes since our friend, Senator Cornyn, is here for his remarks.\n  These words were actually written by a human being. The only thing \nmore bizarre than the fact somebody thought they made sense was the \nlanguage was then made law by another group called the Congress. So \nthere is a reason the dictionary definition of the adjective ``taxing'' \nmeans ``wearingly burdensome.''\n  This burden is especially hard on small businesses. Small businesses \nare the engine that keeps our country going, but it is amazing they can \nmove at all under the weight of what the Tax Code subjects them to.\n  The National Association of the Self-Employed is today releasing \nresults of a survey of their members that shows what the 45 million \nsmall businesses and self-employed persons are going through with their \ntaxes.\n  The group's survey, for example, found that almost one in five people \nwho had gone to the IRS to get answers to their tax questions got \nconflicting responses, sometimes even from the same office.\n  The time small businesses waste complying with the tax laws is mind-\nboggling. Thirty-one percent of them recently said they spent 20 \npercent or more of their time every week on paperwork and other tax-\nrelated preparations. That is 1 day a week totally lost to tax \npreparation. That is a huge penalty that is being imposed on small \nbusiness for complying with the rules of the IRS.\n  Another group suffering with our Tax Code is our older people. During \nthe 2004 tax year, the IRS mailed 200,000 error notices to older \nAmericans who miscalculated their taxes. Mr. President, 34,000 went to \ntaxpayers who received the same notice in 2 tax years; 10,000 went to \ntaxpayers who received it in 3 tax years.\n  What does all this tell you? It tells you the IRS cannot make their \nexplanations understandable to the Nation's older people.\n  There was one word that kept coming up in this survey over and over. \nThe people surveyed said: You have to simplify the Code, simplify our \ntax system.\n  That is what I am trying to do with the legislation I have introduced \nas a Member of the Senate Finance Committee. It is called the Fair Flat \nTax Act, and it eases the burden on our taxpayers by offering them a \nsimplified 1040 Form. Instead of this kind of mumbo-jumbo, it is 1 \npage, 30 lines for every individual taxpayer. The folks over at Money \nmagazine, the financial publication, took the one-page 1040 form in the \nfair flat tax, and they could fill out their taxes in just 15 minutes.\n\n  The legislation makes our code flatter. It collapses the current \nsystem of six individual tax brackets down to three. The fair flat tax \neliminates scores and scores of special interest tax breaks. The \nrevenue derived from these changes is used to hold down the rates for \neverybody and keep progressivity. More importantly, with the fair flat \ntax everybody in America has a chance to get ahead. There is a new \nopportunity with this legislation to promote economic growth, to grow \nthe American economic pie, which is especially important during these \ntimes of great economic uncertainty.\n  One last point. For all of us on the Finance Committee--and I think \nSenators of both parties understand this--there is a Tax Code meltdown \ncoming. The child tax credit ends in 2010, the marriage penalty roars \nback in 2011, and it comes back harsher than ever. The same meltdown is \ngoing to hit other income taxes--capital gains, dividend taxes--and if \nCongress doesn't come up with a thoughtful and responsible bipartisan \nsolution, there is going to be new chaos in the world of taxes.\n  I have tried this afternoon to be a little bit lighthearted in \ndiscussing what is certainly a pretty dry topic for most Americans. But \nwhen you look at what they are going through tonight, if you are middle \nclass and you are dealing with AMT, this is obviously not a laughing \nmatter. The people of this country need tax reform, and they need it \nnow. The fair flat tax would make our system simpler, fairer, and more \nprogrowth. It makes sense for individuals, for families, and the \nbusinesses of our country. The Congress cannot any longer ignore the \ntax meltdown that is coming. It is time to fix the broken American tax \nsystem and eliminate this kind of needless suffering that so many of \nour citizens are going to endure over the next 33 hours.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have been listening to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Wyden, talk, and I am going to study his bill. It \nsounds like it is an answer to a long overdue problem and one that, as \nhe said, is a train wreck getting ready to happen. This is something we \nought to be able to work on in a bipartisan fashion, and I look forward \nto studying his proposal.\n  I want to spend just a few minutes talking about another important \nissue when it comes to our economy and job creation, and that is the \nColombian Free Trade Agreement, which the Speaker of the House, last \nweek, said she would not allow to come to the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives. It now remains indefinite as to when, if ever, that \nfree-trade agreement would be allowed to come to the floor.\n  It is very important for the public to understand that this is more \nthan just about free trade. It does, not coincidentally, create a \nmarket in Colombia for about $2.3 billion in goods and farm commodities \nsold by the State of Texas into Colombia. And because of a previous \nAndean Free Trade Agreement, actually Colombian goods coming into the \nUnited States bear no duty or tariff, but goods made or grown in Texas \nor throughout the United States currently bear a duty that would be \neliminated by this Colombian Free Trade Agreement.\n  Now, that is important because it creates jobs and opportunity in the \nUnited States. It levels the playing field, and it creates a situation \nwhere Colombia and the United States can become equal partners when it \ncomes to commerce and international trade.\n  But this is important for many other reasons. Because of the war on \nterror, much of our attention recently, of course, has been focused on \nthe Middle East. But we must be careful not to neglect other parts of \nthe world that are also very important to U.S. security and our \neconomic prosperity, and that is particularly the case in our own \nhemisphere. Not the least of these important regions is one of the \nclosest to us; that is, Latin America. Unfortunately, Latin America's \nclose proximity hasn't always translated into close ties and \nfriendships. We have seen firsthand and heard firsthand how some Latin \nAmerican leaders--most notably Hugo Chavez of Venezuela--have taken \nstrong stances against the United States. That is one reason it is so \nimportant we embrace wholeheartedly our friends and allies and partners \nin the region.\n  Countries that share our focus on freedom and democracy and work with \nus to fight against terrorism and the spread of narcotics need our \nsupport to counter those who support, tacitly or otherwise, the spread \nof hateful anti-American ideology and militant extremism and criminal \ndrug cartels. We must remember, if we do not stand with our friends, if \nwe do not stay involved in Latin America, someone else will.\n  Already, nations such as China and Iran have dramatically increased \ntheir alliances and influence within the region. Not long ago, \nPresident Ahmadinejad of Iran toured Latin America, strengthening \nIran's ties to the likes of Hugo Chavez and leaders of the terrorist \ngroup known as FARC.\n  Not long ago, I met with the commander of the U.S. Southern Command, \nthe U.S. military official who is in charge of that region from the \nstandpoint of the Department of Defense, Admiral James Stavridis, and I \ntalked with him about current issues, current developments, and \nchallenges that our Nation faces in his area of responsibility, which \nincludes Latin\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\nAmerica. He made it very clear to me that there is a real threat of the \nspread of terrorism in Latin America. A major component of that threat \nthat remains is this so-called Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, \nor FARC, in short.\n  It is noteworthy that recently, when Colombian forces tracked down \nFARC rebels who happened to be across the border in Ecuador, they \nconfiscated not only some computers, but they were able to confiscate \n66 pounds of uranium in the hands of the FARC in Latin America. That is \nsomething that ought to cause all of us pause, and ask a lot of \nquestions--for what purpose did they have 66 pounds of uranium in Latin \nAmerica?\n\n  The FARC continues to carry out terrorist attacks throughout the \nregion, which has caused the death of numerous innocent Colombians. \nThey finance their terrorist activities through two of the most \ndespicable forms of criminal activity imaginable--kidnapping and \nselling deadly drugs. Worst of all, the FARC continues to find \nsanctuary from Colombian prosecution inside neighboring countries such \nas Venezuela. If we do not stand firmly behind Colombia, we will see \nthe advance of both terrorist organizations in Latin America and the \nsmuggling of illegal drugs into the United States.\n  If drug smuggling were not enough to convince us of the need to \nsupport our friends and allies in Colombia, we should consider the \npotential boost to terrorist organizations throughout the world that \nmight otherwise occur. Through lessons leaned in the poppy fields of \nAfghanistan, we have been made painfully aware that the drug trade \noften finances global terrorism. Without a strong ally in Colombia to \nfight the expansion of drug cartels and terrorist-backed drug trade, \nglobal terrorism will find new financial roots from which to grow and \ncarry out its murderous plans.\n  I have had the privilege of traveling to Colombia and meeting with \nPresident Uribe personally. He affirmed to me his commitment to \nfighting back against illegal drugs and terrorism in his own country, \nand he expressed a sincere desire to continue to work closely with the \nUnited States.\n  We have a chance now to further solidify that purpose with our best \nally in Latin America. The Colombian people have heard the call to \ndemocracy and freedom and they are taking it seriously. We owe it to \nthem and we owe it to ourselves to demonstrate that the United States \nis a nation they can depend on.\n  While there is no doubt that more can be done to fully cement the \nprinciples of equality and justice, their commitment to the very same \nprinciples and rights we hold dear in this country is undeniable. The \nColombian people deserve our firm support and it is time for the United \nStates to enter into a free trade agreement with them.\n  As I mentioned last year, Texas led the Nation in exports to \nColombia. Even with damaging Colombian tariffs, Texas manufacturers and \nfarmers sold $2.3 billion worth of products to that nation. This \nagreement will remove those tariffs and allow Texas manufacturers and \nproducers to sell even more goods to this large and growing market. \nWhen this market is open, employers will be able to hire more Texans to \nwork in good, high-paying jobs, right here at home.\n  I might add, at a time when we are concerned about immigration into \nthe United States by people who cannot find work where they live, this \nis another way for us to deal with our border security issues and our \nbroken immigration system, by creating trading partners who are able to \ncreate jobs in Latin America so people do not have to come to the \nUnited States to find hope and opportunity.\n  Already, Colombia has been granted one-way preferential access to our \nmarkets. That country has added jobs to keep pace with growing trade in \nthe United States and now it is time to bring it full circle. This \nagreement will implement two-way trade and it will level the playing \nfield for our own manufacturers and exporters and create jobs right \nhere at home. At a time when our economy has suffered a bit of a \ndownturn, it strikes me as something desirable, to look for ways to \nbolster, indeed increase, jobs right here at home. This free trade \nagreement would be one way to do that.\n  Open trade helps boost the economy and it is an essential ingredient \nto the growth of businesses, jobs, and our economy in general. But \ndespite the numerous positive aspects to this agreement with Colombia, \nsome of my colleagues continue to fight against it. In any other \nsetting, it would be comical to lay side by side their complaints \nagainst this partnership with their vows to work with foreign \ngovernments, to supposedly improve our image in the world. While many \nof those on the left have vowed to work with enemies such as Hugo \nChavez and sit down with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, they balk at the prospect \nof strengthening ties and working with our greater Latin American ally. \nHow ironic indeed. It would seem their willingness to pander to some \nsupersedes their desire to restore our image internationally. Shouldn't \nwe be more willing to work with our friends and allies than our \nenemies?\n  Now, more than a year after the President first began working with \nCongress on this agreement, and 90 days away from our scheduled recess, \nthe majority is outraged. Speaker Pelosi particularly is outraged that \nthis agreement is on the fast track and the President actually asked \nthey vote on the agreement. It is sometimes comically tragic to compare \nthe work we do here in Washington with the jobs ordinary Americans do \nevery day. Only in Congress would a 3-month deadline not be enough to \nfinish a project that started about a year ago.\n  I hope the Speaker of the House will reconsider and not take the \nColombian free trade agreement with all of its ramifications as merely \na negotiating chip she can use against other projects in which she is \ninterested. We have seen that happen already with the Foreign \nIntelligence Act modernization. The failure of the House to pass that \nbill has left us literally deaf to emerging terrorist activity that \ncannot be monitored because of the failure to pass the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Why the Speaker of the House would \ncompound that mistake and add insult to injury now by sticking a thumb \nin the eye of one of our greatest trading partners and allies in Latin \nAmerica frankly escapes me.\n  I hope she will reconsider. This free trade agreement is in the best \ninterests of the United States. It will help create jobs here at home \nduring a time of a softening economy. It will allow us to have a closer \nworking partnership with one of our best allies in the region and to \ndemonstrate to the likes of Hugo Chavez and Raoul Castro that being a \nfriend to America produces some reward, which is closer economic ties \nand a better quality of life and security for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today most Americans are struggling \nwith filling out their tax returns which are due tomorrow. This week I \nam introducing legislation that will make it possible for an American \ntaxpayer to file his or her tax return on one page, a one-page optional \nflat tax on individuals and businesses at the rate of 19 percent for \nthe first two years and 17 percent thereafter. Think what a change that \nwould be. Taxpayers spend an average of over 26 hours to complete tax \nreturns; and 13.6 hours just to complete form 1040.\n  Think how different it would be to simply fill out one page and turn \nthat in. In 2005, taxpayers spent 6 billion hours and approximately \n$265 billion to comply with the Tax Code. Think how much extra leisure \ntime or productive work time we could have if every American had the \noption of a one-page simplified tax return.\n  Mr. President, $705 was the estimated compliance cost for a \nTennessean in 2005. And operating costs for the Internal Revenue \nService almost tripled between 1970 and 2004. Think how much money we \nwould save if every American had the option of filing a one-page, 17-\npercent flat tax and if every American business had the option of doing \nthe same.\n  Here is what the optional flat tax legislation I will be introducing \nthis week will do. As I mentioned earlier, it will simplify the Tax \nCode by providing an optional flat tax on individuals and\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nbusinesses. It will be a 19-percent flat tax for the first 2 years, 17 \npercent flat tax after the first 2 years, and it would create the \noption to file, as I mentioned, a simple one-page return.\n  The legislation I am introducing is almost identical to H.R. 1040 \nintroduced by Congressman Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas, in \nthe House of Representatives. Congressman Burgess introduced his \nlegislation on February 2007 and it has six cosponsors.\n  My legislation is very straightforward. If an individual selects the \noption to pay a flat tax in lieu of the current income tax, the option \nis irrevocable. Under the flat tax, taxable income has a very simple \ndefinition. It will consist simply of wages and pensions. You do not \nstart paying taxes on your income--wages and pensions--until you reach \na certain exemption level. For a married couple filing jointly, the \nexemption level is $25,580, indexed to inflation. For the single head \nof a household, you wouldn't start paying taxes until you reached \n$16,330, indexed for inflation; for a single person, $12,790, indexed \nfor inflation; and $5,510 for each dependent.\n  For example, a family of four would not pay the flat tax until the \nfamily's combined income reached $36,600. That is $25,580 for joint \nfilers plus $5,510 times two for the two dependents. No other \ndeductions would exist.\n  This optional flat tax would eliminate the marriage penalty, so it is \npro-family. This optional flat tax would eliminate the millionaires \ntax, which was put in place in the late 1960s to catch a few \nmillionaires and today is catching millions of middle-class Americans. \nIt is called the alternative minimum tax or AMT.\n  The optional flat tax for businesses is equally straightforward. It \ngives the business the option to pay a flat tax in lieu of the current \ncorporate tax structure. Once a business selects this option, it is \nirrevocable. As it is on the individual income tax form, there is a 19-\npercent tax rate for the first 2 years and then a 17-percent tax rate \nfor all other years. Businesses would be taxed on the difference of \ntotal revenue minus expenses--again, a very simple definition of \nincome. Expenses would include wages, pensions, and the costs of new \nbusiness equipment. This would provide for the immediate expensing of \nbusiness capital equipment. This immediate expensing should be a very \npro-growth provision in our Tax Code--rather than the current Code \nwhich requires spreading it out over a number of years. No other \ndeductions would exist.\n  The current tax system is overly complicated and lengthy. The Tax \nCode and corresponding regulations are over 67,000 pages and include 7 \nmillion words. It was only 400 pages in 1913 when the Federal income \ntax was first introduced, and it has now grown to over 67,000 pages.\n  Taxpayers are expected to understand and comply with this complicated \nTax Code and it gets increasingly impossible to do. That is why I, and \na great many Americans and American businesses, will welcome the \nopportunity to file a one-page, simplified flat tax in lieu of the \ncurrent system.\n  The optional flat tax that I propose is intended to be revenue \nneutral. It is intended, in other words, neither to raise more revenues \nthan the current tax system or less revenues than the current tax \nsystem. Arguably, a simpler tax will raise more revenues because a \ngreat many people pay less in taxes because they simply do not \nunderstand the forms. But the intention of my legislation is that the \ntaxes collected, the revenue level, will be the same.\n  Finally, I urge that our nation's revenue level is not about to stay \nthe same. Already the largest share of the average American's budget \ngoes to pay taxes. Taxes are high. Americans currently spend 113 days \nof every year working to pay their Federal, State, and local taxes--\nalmost twice the number of days they work to pay for housing and more \nthan three times the number of days they work to pay for food.\n  Beginning in 2010, the amount of time Americans currently spend \nworking to satisfy their tax bills will increase as millions of lower- \nand middle-income Americans and small businesses face significant tax \nhikes. Democratic leaders in Congress have already allowed the state \nand local sales tax exemption, which affects Tennesseans, to expire. \nThat is $400 a year for 600,000 Tennesseans, and the Democrats appear \nto be ready to let tax relief for millions of lower and middle-income \nAmericans meet the same fate when those tax levels expire in 2010.\n  Failure of Congress to act to stop these tax hikes will result in the \nlargest tax increase in United States history, and that is one of the \nworst things we could do to the family budget. Taxes are too high today \nand we are about to face the largest tax increase in United States \nhistory.\n  But while we are debating tax issues in the Senate, we can do \nsomething much simpler so that next year, when Americans go about \ncompleting their tax returns, they do not spend an average of 26 hours. \nInstead, they fill out one page. They do not take an average of 13.6 \nhours to complete form 1040; they fill out one page. Compliance costs \nare not $265 billion; they are dramatically reduced. Compliance costs \nfor Tennesseans, $705 dollars in 2005, go down by hundreds of dollars a \nyear.\n  The operating costs of the IRS ought to be cut, instead of \nincreasing, as they review one-page optional tax forms. The same would \nbe true for businesses who also would have the option of filing a flat \n17 percent tax, on one page. So as we look ahead to tomorrow and filing \nour tax returns, and we think about the upcoming debate about whether \nto stop the largest tax increase in history, let's get on a \nconstructive page and say to the American people: By this time next \nyear, April 15, 2009, you will have the option of filing a one-page \nFederal income tax return with a 19-percent rate for 2 years and 17 \npercent rate thereafter; businesses will get the same thing.\n  It will save money. It will encourage growth, and it will relieve a \ngreat deal of anxiety that occurs every spring when April 15 rolls \naround.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WEBB.

Madam President, as we approach the anniversary of the \nVirginia Tech tragedy, I am introducing legislation to implement one of \nthe key recommendations from the Virginia Tech Review Panel that was \nformed by Gov. Tim Kaine to examine some of the issues that arose \nfollowing the shooting.\n  It is exactly 1 year this week when a disturbed young man took the \nlives of 32 students and faculty and wounded several others on the \ncampus of Virginia Tech. I commend the Virginia Tech community for \npulling through such a difficult time and for the tremendous amount of \ncourage they displayed. I also wish to extend my continuing sympathy to \nthe families of the students and faculty who were directly impacted by \nthese shootings.\n  On April 19, 2007, 3 days after the Virginia Tech shooting, Governor \nKaine announced the formation of the Virginia Tech Review Panel to \nperform a review of the events of April 16. This panel included \nindividuals with the expertise and autonomy necessary to conduct a \ncomprehensive review. These nationally recognized individuals brought \nexpertise in many areas, including law enforcement, security, \ngovernmental management, mental health, emergency care, victims' \nservices, the Virginia court system, and higher education.\n  The genesis for the legislation I am introducing is the report \nprepared by this panel and released to the public in August 2007. A \nsimilar report was prepared for President Bush by the Attorney General \nand the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Education in \nfollow-up to meetings with\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nvarious experts across the country. Both reports documented serious \nconcerns from individuals in various communities throughout Virginia \nand the Nation regarding the treatment of student medical records.\n  One main theme that kept resonating in various communities was \nconcern with the appropriate balance between providing for the safety \nof our communities while at the same time protecting privacy rights. \nToo many college administrators are unsure how to balance the right to \nprivacy against public safety, and Federal law and regulations are of \nlittle help.\n  This bill simply attempts to clear up any ambiguity that currently \nexists within the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, known as \nFERPA, which allows for the sharing of student educational records in \norder to protect the health or safety of a student or the general \npublic.\n  FERPA, written in 1974, was created at a time when schools did not \nprovide the health care services they do today. According to the \nNational Institute of Mental Health, half of all lifetime cases of \nmental illness begin by age 14. Schools today, whether they are K-12 or \na post-secondary institution, have critical student health records in \ntheir hands.\n  It is important for Congress to ensure that we provide our school \nofficials, administrators, and counselors clear Federal guidelines to \nprotect the privacy and to ensure the safety of our students. My bill \nattempts to address the concerns raised by school officials, \nadministrators, and institutions in interpreting FERPA.\n  If one looks back at the recommendations of the Virginia Tech Review \nPanel, one notices that a key resounding issue is the misinterpretation \nof Federal and State privacy laws. My bill does three things to amend \nFERPA so that tragic situations such as the one at Virginia Tech are \nless likely to occur. First, it adds an explicit ``safe harbor'' \nprovision to make clear that no violation of FERPA occurs if a school \nofficial discloses information in a good-faith belief that it is \nnecessary to protect the health or safety of a student or the general \npublic. Second, it clarifies how FERPA applies to student treatment \nrecords held for treatment purposes. Third, it clarifies the emergency \nexception in FERPA to emphasize that in an emergency, information-\nsharing is allowed if done in a good-faith belief that doing so will \nprotect against a possible threat to the health or safety of a student \nor the general public.\n  This is a straightforward attempt to address several recommendations \nthat were made by the Virginia Tech Review Panel in clarifying the \nwidespread perception that information privacy laws make it difficult \nto respond effectively to troubled students. It is important for school \nofficials to use their best professional judgment in deciding when to \ndisclose or not to disclose information without fear of violating \nFederal educational privacy laws.\n  There is widespread agreement that existing law is in need of \nclarification. In this regard, I note that the Department of Education \nproposed a rule on March 24 of this year, which is an attempt to \nclarify and give guidance to university administration on what they can \nand cannot do in handling treatment records. I believe this bill is a \nmore direct and effective way to achieve that desired clarity.\n  Together with the passage of the Mental Health Parity Act in both the \nHouse and Senate and other measures to ensure access to mental health \nservices, my bill will be a good step in addressing this growing issue \nof mental disorders that is all too common in many communities. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate for quick passage \nof the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Amendments of 2008.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, I thank the Chair, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/14/senate-section/article/S2961-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume the motion to proceed to H.R. 1195, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 608, a \n     bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \n     Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, to \n     make technical corrections, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That means I would have how much time now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am glad you are in the chair. As a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, you have been \nvery involved in everything we have done so far and we will do in the \nfuture, in terms of rebuilding the infrastructure of this Nation, \nbuilding a transit infrastructure, and some of the other things that we \ndo.\n  I am very pleased the majority leader has called for a motion to \nproceed to H.R. 1195, the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008. \nOn August 10, 2005, President Bush signed into law the SAFETEA-LU Act, \nwhich authorized our Nation's highways, transit, and highway safety \nprograms through the end of 2009.\n  We all know a country cannot be great if it does not have the \nphysical infrastructure to move people and to move goods and to be \nefficient. The funding provided in SAFETEA-LU is currently being used \non highway and transit projects that clearly increase our economic \nproductivity, create thousands and thousands of new jobs, and improve \nAmerica's quality of life.\n  It has been several years since SAFETEA-LU was signed into law, and \nwe on the committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and on \nthe Banking Committee and on the Commerce Committee, have worked across \nparty lines to identify the technical corrections that need to be made. \nThese include updating of project descriptions, adjustments to some of \nthe legislative language, and in some cases where projects could not \nmove forward Members have said we have other projects that are ready to \nmove forward. That is why this bill is so important.\n  If we do not do this bill, we are simply going to languish until the \nnext highway bill in a couple of years, and we are going to waste time. \nWe do not have time to waste. The issues need to be addressed to ensure \nthat various programs authorized in SAFETEA-LU are being carried out \naccording to congressional intent and are not bogged down in unintended \nconsequences.\n  In an effort to address the issues identified since the passage of \nSAFETEA-LU, the House of Representatives approved H.R. 1195 in March of \n2007 by a voice vote. The legislation was subsequently amended and \napproved by voice vote in the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works in June of 2007. That is the committee I chair, and my \nranking member, Senator Inhofe, and I have worked very closely on this \nand other infrastructure matters.\n  My remarks today are on the Technical Corrections Act of 2008, which \nhas been filed as an amendment in the nature of a complete substitute \nto H.R. 1195. This amendment mirrors the earlier technical corrections \nlegislation approved by the Senate and House committees but has been \nupdated for the fiscal year, and it addresses additional issues which \nhave been discovered since H.R. 1195 was first approved by the House \nand considered by our committee.\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\n  I truly believe this is a straightforward, noncontroversial bill that \ncorrects technical issues, confirms congressional intent, and moves us \nforward. It is foolish for us to ignore this bill or to try to stop \nthis bill because it doesn't cost an additional penny. The funding \ncomes through the highway trust fund, and that funding is there. If we \ndo not make these technical corrections, a lot of projects simply will \nbe stalled. At a time when our economy is in trouble, we should be \nmoving ahead.\n  Senator Inhofe and I have worked very closely with the bipartisan \nleadership of the House Committee on Transportation Infrastructure to \ncraft this legislation that we bring to the floor as a substitute. We \nhave also worked closely with Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby \nof the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and Chairman \nInouye and Ranking Member Stevens of the Committee on Commerce, Science \nand Transportation because we wanted to ensure that corrections to \nSAFETEA-LU that fell within their jurisdiction were all included in \nthis legislation.\n  I say to my friends who may be listening to this debate, this is \ntruly a bipartisan bill. It is more than a bipartisan bill, it involves \nthree different committees and all of us want to see this move ahead. \nAgain, the legislation does not increase overall spending by the \nFederal Government. It works within the confines of the existing \nSAFETEA-LU authorization. Changes which restore funding left out of \nSAFETEA-LU are paid for through the use of existing funds. If anybody \nsays to colleagues we are spending more, we are not. We are simply \nmaking it possible for us to fulfill our promises we made to the \nAmerican people several years ago when we told them we were funding a \nhighway and transit bill.\n  Project changes are usually made because of State and local \nauthorities who have told us that changes are necessary. This \nlegislation emanates in many ways from the people back home. Let me \ngive an idea of one of the issues that is very important in this \nlegislation. It will fix an oversight in SAFETEA-LU that resulted in \nthe Surface Transportation Research, Development and Deployment \nAccount being oversubscribed. This means funding is not available for \nthe Federal Highway Administration to conduct its legacy research \nprograms and research activities. This legislation corrects the issue \nby removing the Future Strategic Highway Research Program from the \nSurface Transportation Research Development and Deployment Account and, \ninstead, funds it through funds already allocated for core highway \nprograms. This will free up about $50 million per year, enough funding \nto finance the remaining programs and projects in the Surface \nTransportation Research Development and Deployment Account and will \nallow DOT, the Department of Transportation, to continue its important \nlegacy research programs and activities, including the biennial \nConditions and Performance Report.\n\n  What is the Conditions and Performance Report? It is a report that \nprovides an appraisal of highway, bridge, and transit finance, the \nphysical condition of roads and bridges and their operational \nperformance, and estimates of future investment requirements. That will \nprovide crucial information on the current conditions and future needs \nof our national transportation system as we develop the next transit \nand highway safety bill. We will need this information. It will be \ncrucial to setting priorities in the next highway bill.\n  Remember, we have seen bridges in our Nation collapsing. We have seen \nbad problems in our infrastructure. We need to make sure we have a very \nfair appraisal of the condition of our roads, the condition of our \nbridges, what it is going to cost to fix them before we go into our \nnext funding cycle, our full funding cycle which will occur in 2009.\n  The legislation also fixes and modifies descriptions for highway and \ntransit projects that were included in SAFETEA-LU but have not yet been \ncompleted. Without the changes included in this legislation, many of \nthese projects are stuck at a red light. Until that light turns green, \nthe benefits to the transportation system will not be realized.\n  This technical corrections legislation provides a green light that \ncould unleash up to $1 billion into the economy. Remember, this is not \nnew spending. This is freeing up the dollars we already voted to spend \non transportation projects, transit projects, highway projects. This is \nfunding that has already been provided through SAFETEA-LU. It is not \nnew money, but if we do not act, simply speaking, $1 billion of \nimportant highway and transportation programs will simply not be spent.\n  Given the current slowdown in our economy, we can't afford to let \nthese funds remain unused due to technical matters. Just last month, \nPresident Bush acknowledged that we must respond decisively to the \neconomic downturn we are going through. Investing in infrastructure is \none of the best ways to stimulate our economy. Infrastructure \ninvestments provide immediate economic stimulus through job creation \nand long-term economic benefits through reduced transportation costs.\n  In the past, the Department of Transportation has told us that for \nevery $1 billion in Federal spending on transportation infrastructure, \n47,500 jobs are created. It may be that the number is slightly smaller \nnow due to inflation, but in any event we know it is tens of thousands \nof good-paying jobs.\n  The benefits of infrastructure investment stay in America. \nInfrastructure investment creates American jobs and helps American \nbusinesses that produce most of the construction materials and \nequipment used in our Nation.\n  Finally, I would like to point out again--again--that this \nlegislation will not increase spending. I have to say that over and \nover again, and it complies with earmark disclosure requirements of \nrule XLIV even though it only addresses changes to previously \nauthorized projects.\n  I thank Senator DeMint for giving me a call this morning and saying \nthat he was very pleased with the way our committee handled this \ndisclosure. I was very pleased with that call, and I thank him for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the technical corrections that have \nbeen included in this legislation so we can make the final changes \nneeded to complete SAFETEA-LU and then turn our Nation to the next \nhighway transit and highway safety authorization bill to be completed \nin the next Congress.\n  What I want to do is have put into the Record, if I might, Mr. \nPresident, without objection, a very important letter that comes from \nsome very important constituents of all of ours.\n  I am going to show who sent this letter. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 1, 2008.\n     Hon.

Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairwoman, Environment & Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington DC.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Ranking Member, Environment & Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Ranking Member, Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We are writing to urge you to schedule a \n     vote on HR 1195 making technical corrections to SAFETEA-LU \n     (Public Law 109-59) as soon as possible.\n       Since enactment of SAFETEA-LU in August of 2005, Congress \n     has worked diligently to pass into law corrections to \n     SAFETEA-LU so that full implementation of important \n     transportation programs and policies is possible. To address \n     our Nation's transportation needs and challenges the full \n     benefit of our transportation programs and policies in \n     SAFETEA-LU is needed.\n       Congress' commitment to improving our transportation \n     systems through the programs and policies it provided in \n     SAFETEA-LU can be enhanced. We stand ready to continue to \n     support this commitment.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of Highway and Transportation \n     Officials.\n       American Highways Users Alliance.\n       American Public Transit Association.\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\n       American Road and Transportation Builders Associations.\n       Associated General Contractors.\n       Council of University Transportation Centers.\n       National Sand, Stone and Gravel Association.\n       National Asphalt and Pavement Association.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is the group who sent the letter. I want to say who \nit is, who signed this letter: No. 1, the American Association of \nHighway and Transportation Officials; that is departments of \ntransportation in all 50 States--red States, blue States, purple \nStates--50 States signed this letter. They want us to move forward. No. \n2, the American Highway Users Alliance; that is millions of highway \nusers throughout this Nation of ours; the American Public Transit \nAssociation, which is transit systems from across the country, in all \nof our States; the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociations, more than 5,000 members of the transportation \nconstruction industry. We know our construction industry in the housing \nsector is hurting. That means the jobs are decreasing. This is a moment \nin time where we can give a little boost to our transportation workers; \nthe Associated General Contractors, more than 32,000 of them, service \nproviders and suppliers; Council of University Transportation Centers, \nmore than 30 university transportation centers from across the country; \nthe National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association, companies that produce \nmore than 92 percent of crushed stone and 75 percent of sand and gravel \nused in the U.S. annually; and the National Asphalt and Pavement \nAssociation, more than 1,100 companies that produce and pave with \nasphalt.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senators who might hear my voice, this a \nmoment for us to come together across party lines such as Senator \nInhofe and I have done, just as Senators Dodd and Shelby have done and \njust as Senators Inouye and Stevens have done in our respective \ncommittees. This is a simple bill. This bill simply says we have about \n$1 billion that is stuck because there have been some technical \nproblems with the language. Some projects were not able to move \nforward. We substitute some others within the same funding cap. Some \nhave legislative language which was confusing, and we are dealing with \nthat. We feel very good about this bill.\n  We have listened very carefully to the ethics in the Senate. We know \nwe needed to act to put all these projects on the Web site. We have \nidentified who has asked for them, and we really do believe this \ntechnical corrections bill is ready for action. I can only hope that we \nwill not see anybody try to hold up this bill for no reason at all.\n  If you have amendments, please let us know. We would be happy to give \nyou as much time as you want. Today is the motion to proceed to the \nbill. We urge everyone to vote for that, and that vote will occur, as I \nunderstand it, at 5:30; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will withhold the remainder of my time. How much time \ndo I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will withhold. I say that I expect that Senator Inhofe \nwill be here. I would ask my colleague from North Carolina, are you \nhere to speak on this bill?\n  Mrs. DOLE. No, I am not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will speak in morning business.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent if we can please go into morning \nbusiness to accommodate my colleagues. But I would say, Senator Inhofe \nmay well have a statement. I ask unanimous consent that my two \ncolleagues have 5 minutes each to speak and then the remainder of the \ntime be reserved for Senator Inhofe, minus my 7 minutes, then go to a \nvote at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Senator Bob Dole\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nremarkable accomplishments of a former Member of the Senate who \ndelivered his first speech in this Chamber exactly 39 years ago. It was \nApril 14, 1969, when that Senator stood, not far from here, to address \nhis Senate colleagues for the first time.\n  The Senator used his speech to call attention to a group of Americans \nwho were very close to his heart and who, up until that time, had been \nlargely ignored. It was a group of Americans he had joined on April 14, \n1945, when, as a soldier in the famed 10th Mountain Division, he was \nseverely wounded as he led his troops into battle in the hills of \nItaly.\n  As a result of his wounds, the soldier would spend 39 months in \nvarious hospitals, and doctors would operate on him eight times. \nEventually, the soldier would be left without the use of his right arm.\n  So it was that Bob Dole rose on April 14, 1969, not just to speak as \na Senator, he also spoke as one of the millions upon millions of \nAmericans who happened to have a disability.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the speech \ndelivered by Senator Bob Dole on April 14, 1969, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Apr. 14, 1969]\n\n      Proceedings and Debates of the 91st Congress, First Session\n\n                         Handicapped Americans\n\n       Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, my remarks today concern an \n     exceptional group which I joined on another April 14, twenty-\n     four years ago, during World War II.\n       It is a minority group whose existence affects every person \n     in our society and the very fiber of our Nation.\n       It is a group which no one joins by personal choice--a \n     group whose requirements for membership are not based on age, \n     sex, wealth, education, skin color, religious beliefs, \n     political party, power, or prestige.\n       As a minority, it has always known exclusion--maybe not \n     exclusion from the front of the bus, but perhaps from even \n     climbing aboard it; maybe not exclusion from pursuing \n     advanced education, but perhaps from experiencing any formal \n     education; maybe not exclusion from day-to-day life itself, \n     but perhaps from an adequate opportunity to develop and \n     contribute to his or her fullest capacity.\n       It is a minority, yet a group to which at least one out of \n     every five Americans belongs.\n       Mr. President, I speak today about 42 million citizens of \n     our Nation who are physically, mentally, or emotionally \n     handicapped.\n\n\n                        WHO ARE THE HANDICAPPED?\n\n       Who are the handicapped?\n       They are persons--men, women, and children--who cannot \n     achieve full physical, mental, and social potential because \n     of disability.\n       Although some live in institutions, many more live in the \n     community. Some are so severely disabled as to be home-bound, \n     or even bed-bound. Still others are able to take part in \n     community activities when they have access and facilities.\n       They include amputees, paraplegics, polio victims. Causes \n     of disability include arthritis, cardio-vascular diseases, \n     multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy.\n       While you may have good vision and hearing, many persons \n     live each day with limited eyesight or hearing, or with none \n     at all.\n       While you may enjoy full muscle strength and coordination \n     in your legs, there are those who must rely on braces or \n     crutches, or perhaps a walker or wheelchair.\n       While you perform daily millions of tasks with your hands \n     and arms, there are many who live with limited or total \n     disability in theirs.\n       And in contrast to most people, thousands of adults and \n     children suffer mental or emotional disorders which hinder \n     their abilities to learn and apply what is learned and to \n     cope adequately with their families, jobs, and communities.\n       Then there are those who are afflicted with combination or \n     multiple handicaps.\n\n\n                         NOT JUST THE HANDICAP\n\n       For our nation's 42 million handicapped persons and their \n     families, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are not filled with \n     ``everyday'' kinds of problems which can be solved or soothed \n     by ``everyday'' kinds of answers. their daily challenge is: \n     accepting and working with a disability so that the \n     handicapped person can become as active and useful, as \n     independent, secure, and dignified as his ability will allow.\n       Too many handicapped persons lead lives of loneliness and \n     despair; too many feel and too many are out off from our \n     work-oriented society; too many cannot fill empty hours in a \n     satisfying, constructive manner. The leisure most of us crave \n     can and has become a curse to many of our Nation's \n     handicapped.\n       Often when a handicapped person is able to work full or \n     part time, there are few jobs or inadequate training programs \n     in his locale. Although progress is being made, many \n     employers are hesitant to hire a handicapped person, ignoring \n     statistics that show he is often a better and more dependable \n     worker.\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\n       The result is that abilities of a person are overlooked \n     because of disabilities which may bear little or no true \n     relation to the job at hand. The result to the taxpayer may \n     be to support one more person at a cost of as much as $3,500 \n     per person a year. To the handicapped person himself, it \n     means more dependency.\n\n\n                               STATISTICS\n\n       Consider these statistics: Only one-third of America's \n     blind and less than half of the paraplegics of working age \n     are employed, while only a handful of about 200,000 persons \n     with cerebral palsy who are of working age are employed.\n       Beyond this, far too many handicapped persons and their \n     families bear serious economic problems--despite token \n     Government pensions and income tax deductions for a few, and \n     other financial aids. I recall a portion of a letter received \n     recently from the mother of a cerebral palsy child in a \n     Midwestern urban area:\n\n       There are the never-ending surgeries, braces, orthopedic \n     shoes, wheelchairs, walkers, standing tables, bath tables and \n     so on . . . we parents follow up on every hopeful lead in \n     clinics and with specialists; we go up and down paths blindly \n     and always expensively . . . I have talked with four major \n     insurance companies who do not insure or infrequently insure \n     CP children . . . although our daughter is included in her \n     father's group hospitalization plan, many families are not as \n     fortunate. These are just a few of the problems, compounded \n     by the fact we must try to adequately meet the needs of our \n     other ``normal'' children. In many cases, some kind of \n     financial assistance would enable us and others like us to \n     provide for our children in our homes, avoiding overcrowding \n     of already overcrowded facilities and further adding to the \n     taxpayer's burden costs for complete care.\n\n       There are other problems--availability and access of health \n     care personnel and facilities at the time and place the \n     individual with handicaps needs them. In my own largely rural \n     State of Kansas, many handicapped persons travel 300 miles or \n     more to receive the basic health services they require.\n       Education presents difficulties for many parents of \n     handicapped children. Although a child may be educable, there \n     may be few, if any, opportunities in the community for him to \n     receive an education. Private tutoring, if available, is \n     often too expensive. Sadly, to date, the Council for \n     Exceptional Children estimates less than one-third of the \n     Nation's children requiring special education are receiving \n     it.\n       In rehabilitation, the Department of Health, Education, and \n     Welfare said recently 25 percent of America's disabled have \n     not received rehabilitation services and do not know where to \n     seek such help. They estimate that at least 5 million \n     disabled persons may be eligible for assistance.\n       Other problems the handicapped person faces each day \n     include availability and access of recreation and \n     transportation facilities, architectural barriers in \n     residences and other buildings, and many, many more.\n\n\n                       still a promising outlook\n\n       We in America are still far from the half-way point of \n     assuring that every handicapped person can become as active \n     and useful as his capacities will allow. The outlook for the \n     handicapped person in 1969, however, is not altogether bleak. \n     Unparalleled achievements in medicine, science, education, \n     technology as well as in public attitudes have cemented a \n     framework in which the handicapped person today has more \n     opportunities available to him than ever before. Consider \n     first what government is doing.\n\n\n                          the government story\n\n       The story of what the Federal Government, hand in hand with \n     State governments, is doing to help meet the needs of the \n     handicapped is not one that draws the biggest and boldest \n     headlines. Broadly, the story is a ``good'' one, consisting \n     of achievements in financial assistance, rehabilitation, \n     research, education, and training of the handicapped--a \n     massive effort to help many disabled Americans live as \n     normal, as full and rich lives as possible.\n       It is, in part, the story of a man who, at age 21, became a \n     paraplegic after sustaining injuries to his spinal cord and \n     head in an accident while on the job.\n       In 1968, he joined over 2,300,000 other disabled men and \n     women who have been restored to more productive, useful lives \n     since the State-Federal vocational rehabilitation program \n     began 48 years ago.\n       In 1964, the young man--a high school dropout with a wife \n     and child--was referred to his State's division of vocational \n     rehabilitation where a thorough program of total \n     rehabilitation began. In addition, he was enrolled in a \n     training school and was graduated as a fully licensed \n     insurance agent.\n       Today--4 years later--he has his own successful insurance \n     business. He and his wife have built a new home and adopted a \n     baby.\n       It is a measure of America's concern for its handicapped \n     citizens that even 50 years ago, this story could not have \n     been told.\n       It takes place now because the Congress and the Federal \n     Government initiated and guided a vital, vigorous program of \n     vocational rehabilitation.\n       Mr. President, vocational rehabilitation is one of many \n     ways the Federal Government works to aid the handicapped. But \n     none of the Federal programs necessarily reaches or helps \n     every handicapped person.\n       Nevertheless, the role of the Government has been basically \n     successful in terms of numbers assisted, basic research \n     performed, and the movement of increasingly large numbers of \n     persons into more productive, satisfying channels. It \n     demonstrates what Congress and Federal and State governments \n     are doing to help America's handicapped better participate \n     and achieve.\n       Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent to \n     have printed in the Record, at the close of my remarks, a \n     brief summary of Federal programs for the handicapped.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n       (See exhibit 1.)\n\n\n                           the private sector\n\n       Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is in the American tradition \n     and spirit that parallel to Government effort there has \n     developed the vital and growing effort for the handicapped by \n     individuals, business and industry, churches and private, \n     voluntary organizations. It is a herculean task to properly \n     assess the many, far-reaching effects of the private sector--\n     in health care, education, employment; in research, \n     rehabilitation, by fundraising drives and through \n     professional organizations and groups for the handicapped \n     themselves. But it is here in the private sector--with its \n     emphasis on the creativity, concern, and energies of our \n     people--that America has become the envy of the world. Our \n     private economy and the resources of our people have combined \n     to improve the quality of life in America in ways and for \n     persons the Government could not begin to match or reach.\n       For the handicapped, their achievements have been no less. \n     I shall not today, detail or single out the achievements of \n     the voluntary groups and private enterprise involved in \n     aiding the handicapped. But let the record show that without \n     the sincerity, scope, and success of their efforts--in public \n     information, employment and training, in upgrading health \n     care and education personnel and facilities, in fundraising \n     and in supporting research to conquer or at least minimize \n     the effects of handicapping conditions--the prospects for the \n     handicapped individuals would not be as hopeful as they are \n     today.\n\n\n                       where do we go from here?\n\n       Mr. President, as new public and private programs are \n     developed, as old ones are strengthened and some, perhaps \n     eliminated, as we in Congress allocate comparatively limited \n     funds to help the handicapped, the responsibilities and \n     opportunities loom large before us.\n       We must insure our efforts and money are not misplaced or \n     misdirected--that they do not just promise, but really do the \n     job.\n       Are we all doing our best to see that all the knowledge, \n     information, money, and other help is consolidated and \n     available to the handicapped person in the form he can use \n     and at the time and place he most needs it?\n       Is there sufficient coordination and planning between and \n     among the private groups and the Government agencies to avoid \n     multiplicity and duplication so that we best serve America's \n     handicapped?\n       Are we sometimes engaged in a numbers race--attending to \n     cases that respond more quickly in order to show results to \n     donors, members, and taxpayers, thus sacrificing some \n     attention which should be focused on the really tough \n     problems?\n       Many handicapped persons of our Nation are no longer \n     helpless or hopeless because of private and public efforts \n     which have helped them to better help and be themselves.\n       But the fact remains that some of our Nation's handicapped \n     and their families are attacking the very programs and \n     projects created to help them.\n       Some are disillusioned and disaffected by the programs.\n       Too often, the information, the services, the human help \n     and encouragement are not reaching the person for whom they \n     were intended and at the time and place he needs them.\n       Some sincerely believe there may be better ways we can \n     demonstrate our concern and thereby better achieve for the \n     person with handicaps the independence, security, and dignity \n     to which he is entitled.\n       I am reminded of a statement given recently by the 1968 \n     president of the National Rehabilitation Association:\n\n       It is the person, not the program that is of overwhelming \n     importance. It is not the disability that claims our \n     attention, it is the person with handicaps. It is not \n     the maintenance of prestige of a particular profession \n     that matters. It is the contribution of the profession to \n     solving the complex problems of the individual who has \n     handicaps.\n\n       When more of this emphasis on the individual better \n     influences the agencies and professions dealing with the \n     handicapped, I believe we can begin to open new, more \n     meaningful vistas for more persons with handicaps.\n       We have been involved in efforts which have been creditable \n     to date. Of this, there is no doubt.\n       But are we doing our best?\n       A highly respected official of the U.S. Department of \n     Health, Education, and Welfare summed up the problem this \n     way:\n\n       I do not feel we are spending our dollars--public or \n     voluntary--as effectively as we could. We need to take a \n     whole new look at what is going on, where the service is \n     given. We need to try to design new methods and clearer \n     purposes for our efforts. We need to relate our efforts more \n     closely to the needs\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\n     of a community, to the needs of its individuals. And we need \n     to try to measure, as concretely and specifically as possible \n     what is actually achieved by our expenditures.\n\n       Our handicapped citizens are one of our Nation's greatest \n     unmet responsibilities and untapped resources. We must do \n     better.\n\n\n                        PRESIDENTIAL TASK FORCE\n\n       With this in mind, I suggest the creation of a Presidential \n     task force or commission to review what the public and \n     private sectors are doing and to recommend how we can do \n     better.\n       Composed of representatives of the public and private \n     sectors, this task force or commission could provide an \n     overview of how to provide the handicapped more help and \n     hope.\n       Such a task force or commission could provide valuable \n     assistance to Congress and the administration as we develop \n     programs and allocate comparatively limited funds for the \n     handicapped.\n       It could also help private organizations and voluntary \n     groups conduct their efforts more efficiently and \n     effectively.\n       The goal of a task force or commission, to achieve maximum \n     independence, security, and dignity for the individual with \n     handicaps, should encompass the total needs of the \n     handicapped, not just employment or education or any other * \n     * *\n       Rather the task force or commission should concern itself \n     with the whole broad spectrum of needs and services, because \n     as I have pointed out the problems of the handicapped do not \n     begin and end with the handicap itself.\n       Although there are hundreds of areas a task force or \n     commission could review, I am hopeful, if created, it would \n     include the following subjects:\n       First. Expansion of employment, transportation, and \n     recreation opportunities for the handicapped.\n       Second. A directory or central clearinghouse to help inform \n     the handicapped person and his family of available public and \n     private assistance.\n       There are many helpful handbooks and information sources \n     available. But most are not comprehensive and are more \n     accessible to professionals in the field than to the \n     handicapped who really need the guidance and information.\n       Third. Removal of architectural barriers.\n       Many persons cannot secure employment or fill their leisure \n     hours because their disabilities bar use of the facilities. \n     It is just as easy to build and equip buildings so that the \n     handicapped and unhandicapped can use them. The Federal \n     Government is doing this now for federally financed \n     structures.\n       Fourth. More development of health care on a regional or \n     community basis.\n       This is a tough, but priority matter and one which cannot \n     be accomplished quickly or inexpensively. But we must begin \n     to move toward more adequate health care facilities and \n     personnel which serve each person at the time and place he \n     needs them.\n       Fifth. Better serving the special educational needs of the \n     handicapped.\n       Both the person and the Nation suffer when any educatable \n     child--handicapped or unhandicapped--does not receive an \n     education.\n       Sixth. Income tax deductions and/or other financial \n     assistance to extend relief to more handicapped persons and \n     their families.\n       Seventh. More attention on the family of the handicapped \n     person.\n       These are the people who often need a degree of \n     encouragement, counseling, and ``rehabilitation'' themselves. \n     Are there services we should provide to family members whose \n     own lives and resources are deeply affected by the presence \n     of a handicapped person?\n       Eighth. Increased dialog and coordination between private \n     and voluntary groups and Government agencies to avoid \n     multiplicity and duplication.\n       What is at stake is not the agency, group, or program. What \n     is at stake is the future of the handicapped person with his \n     own abilities and potentialities.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       This, then, Mr. President, is the sum and substance of my \n     first speech in the Senate.\n       I know of no more important subject matter, not solely \n     because of my personal interest, but because in our great \n     country some 42 million Americans suffer from a physical, \n     mental, or emotional handicap. Progress has been and will \n     continue to be made by Federal and State governments, by \n     private agencies, and individual Americans; but nonetheless \n     there is still much to be done, if the handicapped American: \n     young, old, black, white, rich, or poor is to share in the \n     joys experienced by others. The task ahead is monumental, but \n     I am confident that there are forces in America ready and \n     willing to meet the challenge--including, of course, many of \n     my distinguished colleagues who by their acts and deeds have \n     demonstrated their great interest.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Federal Programs for the Handicapped Disabled Veterans\n\n       The program of services for disabled veterans as we know it \n     today began with enactment of the Soldier Rehabilitation Act, \n     which was passed unanimously by Congress June 27, 1918 (P.L. \n     178, 65th Congress). Under the law, the Federal Board for \n     Vocational Education, created by legislation the year before, \n     was authorized to organize and offer vocational \n     rehabilitation programs for disabled veterans.\n       The program was finally closed out July 2, 1928. In the \n     program's 10-year existence, about 675,000 veterans applied \n     for training. About 330,000 completed their courses \n     satisfactorily and were considered rehabilitated, and about \n     98 percent of them were employed at the time their training \n     was completed or terminated.\n       Soon after the U.S. entered World War II, planning began \n     for vocational rehabilitation programs for disabled \n     servicemen returning from that war.\n       On March 13, 1943, after much discussion over whether the \n     veterans program should be allied with the civilian \n     vocational rehabilitation program, the House passed a bill \n     authorizing a separate veterans' program. It was signed into \n     law 11 days later as P.L. 16, 78th Congress, and covered \n     veterans who served in the armed services between Pearl \n     Harbor Day, December 7, 1941, and the declared end of the \n     war. This legislation set into motion an effort which, before \n     termination, benefitted several hundred thousand disabled \n     veterans.\n       When the U.S. entered the Korean conflict, the Congress \n     enacted legislation to insure that the men who fought there \n     could receive the same services as World War II veterans. By \n     1955, about 36,000 Korean veterans had received vocational \n     rehabilitation training for service-connected disabilities.\n       Later legislation made it possible for veterans disabled \n     after the conclusion of the Korean conflict to receive \n     rehabilitation and other services of the Veterans' \n     Administration. This includes peace-time veterans and the \n     veterans of the Vietnam war. In 1968 alone, 5,192 veterans \n     participated in vocational rehabilitation training, bringing \n     the total number since the program began to 721,000.\n       Disabled veterans who need prosthetic and sensory aids can \n     obtain them from the Veterans Administration. In 1968 \n     prosthetic appliances and services were furnished to about \n     465,000 disabled veterans, including 5,400 Vietnam veterans. \n     Approximately $10.2 million was spent in 1968 for the \n     procurement and repair of prosthetic and other related \n     appliances.\n       Last year, too, requests for grants were approved to help \n     pay for special automobiles for 2,850 veterans because of \n     loss of hands or feet or severe eye impairment. Expenditures \n     for this benefit in 1968 totalled almost $3.5 million, \n     bringing the total cost to $83.6 million since this program \n     was enacted in 1946.\n       Another special benefit for disabled veterans is the grant \n     program for acquiring specially-adapted housing for those who \n     need braces, crutches, canes, or wheelchairs. Grants totaling \n     $4.4 million were made to 460 veterans in 1968. Since the \n     program began in 1948, 9,705 grants at a cost of $92.7 \n     million have been awarded.\n       With the creation of a new Department of Medicine and \n     Surgery December 31, 1945, the Veterans Administration set in \n     motion a new pattern of care and rehabilitation service for \n     sick, injured and disabled veterans entering VA hospitals. A \n     special rehabilitation service was developed; selected \n     hospitals were specially staffed and equipped for certain \n     disabilities such as spinal cord injury, blindness, epilepsy, \n     amputation and other conditions.\n\n\n                    programs for disabled civilians\n\n       A rehabilitation program for disabled civilians was not \n     enacted simultaneously with the veterans' program because of \n     opposition that it was not practicable and also not the \n     responsibility of the Federal Government.\n       Two years later--June 2, 1920--President Wilson signed into \n     law the Civilian Vocational Rehabilitation Act (P.L. 236, \n     66th Congress). The bill, known as the Smith-Fess Act, is one \n     of the oldest grant-in-aid programs for providing services \n     for individuals. At that time, services under the act were \n     confined to counseling, job training, artificial limbs and \n     other prosthetic appliances, and job placement. It \n     provided for an appropriation of $750,000 for fiscal year \n     1921 and $1 million for fiscal years 1922 to 1924 and for \n     payments to States cooperating in vocational \n     rehabilitation of persons disabled in industry. Federal \n     funds were to be matched by the States and were not to be \n     used for institutions for handicapped persons except when \n     individuals entitled to benefits of the act, required \n     special training.\n       In its first year, the vocational rehabilitation program \n     helped rehabilitate 523 disabled persons. Authorization for \n     the program was renewed by Congress several times until 1935, \n     when the Social Security Act included permanent \n     authorization. This action demonstrated the consensus of \n     congressional thought that vocational rehabilitation should \n     be a permanent program in the United States. Continuing to \n     grow, the program rehabilitated 11,890 persons in 1940.\n       The entry of the United States into World War II caused a \n     manpower shortage which gave disabled persons who had been \n     rehabilitated an opportunity to show the nation that the \n     disabled could be productive, capable workers. Many employers \n     began calling for more rehabilitated workers than the \n     vocational rehabilitation program, despite its success, was \n     prepared to provide. For more than 20 years since its \n     enactment, the program had been limited in scope and \n     uncertainly financed. Some States had excellent programs, but \n     many did not. Development on a national scale had been \n     uneven.\n       Legislation in 1943 helped solve some of these problems, \n     and other legislation in later years helped to shape it into \n     the more meaningful and effective program it is today.\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\n       In 1943 after an attempt to combine the Veterans' and \n     civilian vocational programs was defeated, the Vocational \n     Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1943 (P.L. 113, 78th \n     Congress) were signed into law. the 1943 law superseded the \n     1920 legislation and broadened the vocational rehabilitation \n     program--more liberal financing, increased State services, \n     and broadened the concept of rehabilitation.\n       Rehabilitation services were extended to the mentally \n     handicapped and the mentally ill. Separate State agencies for \n     the blind were incorporated into the Federal-State \n     rehabilitation program. In addition, the now 50 States, and \n     Puerto Rico were all placed on the same footing with respect \n     to Federal grants. An improved provision of the 1943 law was \n     coverage for specified corrective surgery or therapeutic \n     treatment necessary to reduce or eliminate a disability. \n     Administration of the program was transferred from the \n     Commissioner of Education to the Federal Security Agency. In \n     1950, 59,597 persons were rehabilitated.\n       There were problems, however. Partly because the financial \n     system was becoming inadequate and because there was no \n     provision for research, professional training, and other \n     features, essential progress was not being made.\n       Legislation in 1954, supported by President Eisenhower, was \n     an effort to remedy these problems. While retaining the basic \n     pattern of services, the 1954 amendments (P.L. 565, 83rd \n     Congress) made sweeping improvements. They included \n     provisions for research, demonstration, and training \n     activities. The Federal share was increased on a formula \n     basis, to give greater support to States with relatively \n     large populations and relatively small per capita income. It \n     initiated a new system of project grants for improvement and \n     extension of services. For the first time, the use of Federal \n     grants to expand, modernize and equip rehabilitation \n     facilities and workshops was also authorized.\n       In 1954, congress also amended the Hill-Burton hospital \n     survey and construction act to provide Federal grants to help \n     construct rehabilitation facilities.\n       While in 1960, 88,275 persons were rehabilitated under the \n     vocational rehabilitation program, by 1965 it had mushroomed \n     to over 135,000 persons.\n       The 1965 amendments to the vocational rehabilitation act \n     (P.L. 89-333) were designed to bring the public and voluntary \n     agencies into a closer working alliance. It expanded and \n     enlarged the program by broadening its legal and financial \n     base. Services to the severely disabled, the mentally \n     retarded, the deaf, and other handicapped individuals were \n     increased. A national commission on architectural barriers to \n     rehabilitation of the handicapped was established. Federal \n     financial support was extended to local areas for funding \n     more vocational rehabilitation programs. In a drive to build \n     more rehabilitation facilities and workshops, funds were \n     authorized for a comprehensive program to improve the \n     workshops and to construct more vocationally-oriented \n     rehabilitation facilities. Grants to States to conduct \n     comprehensive State-wide planning by agencies designated by \n     the Governors were also provided.\n       In 1967 Congress took further steps to improve \n     rehabilitation programs for the Nation's disabled. The 1967 \n     amendments (P.L. 90-99) extended and expanded grant \n     authorizations to States for rehabilitation services. \n     Provisions were made to establish a national center for deaf-\n     blind youth and adults and to extend services to disabled \n     migrants, and their families. In addition, the 1967 \n     amendments required State agencies to provide services to the \n     handicapped without regard to their residence locations.\n       Finally, just this past year, Congress passed another bill \n     amending the vocational rehabilitation program. The bill \n     increased the Federal share for basic support of State \n     programs from 75 to 80 percent, beginning in fiscal 1970, and \n     established a minimum allotment of $1 million for each State \n     to increase efficiency, expand services, and reach more \n     clients. The 1968 amendments (P.L. 90-391) also extended \n     programs of grants for innovation, for special projects and \n     for rehabilitation facilities construction and staffing.\n       The bill established a new vocational evaluation and work \n     adjustment program to serve those who are disadvantaged by \n     such reasons as physical or mental disability, youth, \n     advanced age, low educational attainment, ethnic or cultural \n     factors, or prison or delinquency records, especially in \n     association with poverty.\n       Evaluation may include preliminary diagnostic studies to \n     determine whether the individual is disadvantaged, has or \n     will have an employment handicap, and needs rehabilitation \n     services. Work adjustment services include appraisal of the \n     individual's pattern of work behavior and development of work \n     habits, work tolerance, and social and behavior patterns \n     suitable for successful job performance.\n       Establishment of the social and rehabilitation service in \n     1967 also brought about an expansion of the Federal \n     Vocational Rehabilitation Agency, and its transfer to the \n     Division of Mental Retardation, under the newly-named \n     Rehabilitation Services Administration. In 1961, President \n     Kennedy appointed the President's Panel on Mental Retardation \n     and gave them a mandate to recommend a national plan to \n     combat mental retardation.\n       The Maternal and Child Health and Mental Retardation \n     Planning Amendments of 1963 (P.L. 88-156) carried out several \n     recommendations of the panel. This act provided funds to \n     assist the States in planning comprehensive State and \n     community programs for the mentally retarded. The Social \n     Security Amendments of 1965 (P.L. 89-97) extended \n     comprehensive planning grants to the States, enabling \n     implementation of their comprehensive plans to combat mental \n     retardation.\n       The Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental \n     Health Centers Construction Act of 1963 (P.L. 88-164) \n     authorized grants to States to construct facilities to serve \n     the mentally retarded. It also provided grants to assist in \n     construction of university-affiliated facilities to provide \n     an interdisciplinary approach for clinical training of \n     specialized personnel and for demonstration of new service \n     techniques.\n       The Mental Retardation Amendment of 1967 (P.L. 90-170) \n     extended these two programs and established a new grant \n     program to pay part of the compensation of professional and \n     technical personnel in community facilities for the retarded, \n     for initial operation of new facilities, or of new services \n     in a facility. Projects have been approved for construction \n     of 242 community facilities to serve over 63,000 retardates.\n       In 1963, Congress authorized the hospital improvement \n     program to support projects to improve services in State \n     mental retardation institutions. This program is assisting \n     about 100 of the 169 existing facilities.\n       The Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1968 (P.L. 90-\n     391) authorized projects for rehabilitation of mentally \n     retarded persons not eligible for vocational rehabilitation \n     due to age, severity of handicap, or other reasons. The first \n     appropriation for this program is being requested for 1970.\n       Today, there are 90 rehabilitation agencies with 800 \n     offices operating nationwide and in four territories. They \n     serve nearly 700,000 handicapped persons each year at a \n     State-Federal cost of over a half-billion dollars.\n\n\n                         programs for the blind\n\n       One of the first pieces of legislation providing Federal \n     aid for handicapped persons was approved March 3, 1879, under \n     the title ``An Act To Promote the Education of the Blind.'' \n     This law set up a perpetual trust fund of United States \n     Bonds, the income from which, in the amount of $10,000 a \n     year, would go to the American Printing House For the Blind \n     in Louisville, Kentucky, so that books and other materials \n     could be distributed among the schools for the blind \n     throughout the country. Subsequent amendments gradually \n     increased the authorization for this program. In 1956, it was \n     $410,000 a year. Then in 1961, Congress removed the ceiling \n     from the annual appropriation and made it an amount to be \n     determined by Congress. In fiscal year 1968, the printing \n     house served some 19,000 blind children with books and other \n     teaching materials at a cost of $1.5 million.\n       The printing house was originally designed to serve blind \n     children. In 1931, Congress enacted the so-called Pratt-Smoot \n     Act (P.L. 787, 71st Congress) to ``Provide Books for the Use \n     of the Adult Blind Residents of the United States.'' This \n     legislation formed the basis for the Federally-supported \n     library service to the blind vested in the division for the \n     blind and physically handicapped in the Library of Congress.\n       In 1933, an amendment to the act made available for \n     distribution talking books, or phonograph records, in \n     addition to the Braille books already used.\n       As commercial firms became interested in producing talking \n     book records, a 1939 amendment gave preference to \n     ``nonprofit-making institutions or agencies whose activities \n     are primarily concerned with the blind.'' A 1942 amendment \n     provided maintenance and replacement of talking book machines \n     as well as the talking books.\n       Then in 1952 Congress enacted an amendment removing the \n     word ``adult'' from the act, clearing the way for blind \n     children to also benefit from the program. In 1966, another \n     amendment extended the program to include other physically \n     handicapped persons. In 1968, 140,000 handicapped readers \n     received catalogs from which to select reading matter and \n     circulation of the containers, and reels, and volumes, was \n     over 5,265,000. The expenditure for the program in 1968 was \n     $5.6 million.\n       One aspect of the vocational rehabilitation program is the \n     emphasis given to adjustment, training, and placement of \n     blind persons in competitive employment. Attention was \n     first focused on this severely disabled group as a result \n     of the passage of P.L. 113 in 1943.\n       The amendments to the vocational rehabilitation act in 1954 \n     made a limited amount of training and research money \n     available, so employment opportunities for blind workers have \n     been greatly expanded. In 1968, 6,800 blind and 12,000 \n     visually-limited persons were placed in a variety of \n     occupations. In addition, special workshops for the blind now \n     employ approximately 5,000.\n       Another phase of employment for the blind was made \n     available through the provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Act \n     (P.L. 732) in 1936 which gave preference for operation of \n     snack bars, vending stands, and other facilities of Federal \n     properties to qualified blind persons. Installation of \n     facilities, training, and supervision of blind operators are \n     responsibilities of the State licensing agencies. In 1968, \n     3,259 blind persons earned $16.6 million, an average of \n     $5,580 per operator.\n\n\n                      education of THE HANDICAPPED\n\n       In 1864 President Abraham Lincoln signed into law a bill \n     establishing a national college for the deaf later to be \n     known as Gallaudet\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\n     College, and in 1879, Congress enacted legislation giving \n     federal financial aid to the American Printing House for the \n     Blind. Unfortunately, these two programs were the extent of \n     Federal aid for education of handicapped children for the \n     next three quarters of a Century.\n       In 1954 Congress enacted the cooperative Research Act (P.L. \n     83-531) for research grants in education. In 1957, $675,000 \n     of the $1 million appropriated under the Act was earmarked to \n     be spent on research on education of the mentally retarded.\n       In 1958 Congress passed the captioned films for the Deaf \n     Program (P.L. 85-905). Originally aimed at cultural \n     enrichment and recreation, amendments in 1962 and 1965 \n     broadened the program into a flexible, comprehensive \n     instructional program for the deaf, including teacher \n     training. 1967 legislation extended the program to include \n     all handicapped children requiring special education.\n       Legislation in 1958 (P.L. 85-926) authorized grants to \n     educational institutions to help train professional personnel \n     to train teachers of mentally retarded children. In 1961, \n     Congress enacted legislation authorizing support for training \n     classroom teachers of the deaf (P.L. 87-276).\n       In 1963, these programs for training personnel to work with \n     handicapped children were expanded to include teachers of \n     children who are ``hard of hearing, speech impaired, visually \n     handicapped, seriously emotionally disturbed, crippled, or \n     other health impaired,'' as well as mentally retarded and \n     deaf. The same legislation (P.L. 88-164) authorized grants \n     for research and demonstration projects in education of \n     handicapped children. A 1965 amendment to this program \n     authorized construction, equipping, and operation of \n     facilities for research and related purposes.\n       The year 1965 saw enactment of a great body of legislation \n     to aid in the education of handicapped youngsters. The \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (P.L. 89-10) provided \n     programs through local education agencies to reach \n     handicapped children in low income areas. It also provided \n     support for supplemental services including special \n     instruction for the handicapped and for innovative programs. \n     A 1965 amendment to this act (P.L. 89-313) provided grants to \n     State agencies directly responsible for educating handicapped \n     children. This brought assistance to State-operated or State-\n     supported schools for the deaf, retarded, etc., not eligible \n     under the original act.\n       Also in 1965 Congress enacted the National Technical \n     Institute for the Deaf Act (P.L. 89-36) authorizing \n     establishment and operation of a postsecondary technical \n     training facility for young adults who are deaf. This \n     institute, which is being established at the Rochester \n     Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, complements \n     Gallaudet College, which provides a liberal arts program.\n       1966 saw more legislation for education of the handicapped. \n     There was the Model Secondary School for the Deaf Act (P.L. \n     89-694) which created a model high school as part of \n     Gallaudet College to serve deaf children of the Washington, \n     D.C. area. Planned to offer a full curriculum and the normal \n     extracurricular activities of high schools, this model high \n     school for deaf children may lead to formation of other \n     similar schools throughout the country.\n       Also in 1966, Congress passed further amendments (P.L. 89-\n     750) to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which \n     authorized funds to assist the States in improvement of \n     programs and projects for the education of handicapped \n     children at preschool, elementary, and secondary levels. The \n     1966 amendment also required establishment of a National \n     Advisory Committee on Handicapped Children to make \n     recommendations concerning programs carried on for \n     handicapped children by the Office of Education.\n       In addition, the Congress undertook a bold precedent, \n     establishing the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped to \n     administer all Office of Education programs for the  \n     handicapped. The Bureau of Education for the Handicapped has \n     made major strides in stimulating a local, State and Federal \n     partnership for improvement of education for handicapped \n     children.\n       The 1967 amendments to the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act further broadened and extended the program of \n     services to the handicapped. Regional resource centers were \n     authorized to determine special education needs of \n     handicapped children referred to them, develop educational \n     programs to meet these needs, and assist, schools in \n     providing such programs. The 1967 legislation also authorized \n     establishment and operation of centers for deaf-blind \n     children, programs designed to improve recruiting of \n     educational personnel and to improve dissemination of \n     information on educational opportunities for the handicapped.\n       The 1967 Mental Retardation amendments (P.L. 90-170) \n     provided support for training professional personnel and for \n     research and demonstration activities in physical education \n     and recreation for mentally retarded and other handicapped \n     children.\n       The most recent piece of legislation for education of \n     handicapped children was enacted in the Handicapped \n     Children's Early Education Assistance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-\n     538). It authorizes grants to public and private agencies and \n     organizations for establishment of experimental preschool and \n      early education programs which show promise of developing \n     comprehensive and innovative approaches for meeting special \n     problems of handicapped children. This legislation recognizes \n     that the most rapid learning period comes in the years before \n     school traditionally begins. The programs engendered by this \n     legislation should do much to identify handicapped children \n     early and to help give them a better start toward full, \n     productive lives.\n\n\n                     EMPLOYMENT OF THE HANDICAPPED \n\n       Once a handicapped person is rehabilitated and able to \n     support himself, he often encounters tremendous difficulties \n     in securing meaningful employment. A case is not considered \n     closed, in the vocational rehabilitation program, until the \n     disabled person is on the job, and has satisfactorily \n     adjusted in the eyes of both the disabled person and his \n     employer.\n       For many reasons, employers are reluctant to hire the \n     handicapped. The Federal Government is trying to change this \n     attitude among employers and the public and has met with some \n     success. \n       In addition to the placement program of the vocational \n     rehabilitation program, the Bureau of Employment security, \n     through state and local employment services, provides direct \n     employment counseling and assistance to physically and \n     mentally handicapped persons seeking work. Public information \n     and educational activities directed toward employers and \n     labor organizations are part of the effort made under these \n     programs. Selective placement techniques are also used to \n     help match the physical demands of a job to the physical \n     capacities of a worker.\n       The President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, \n     a voluntary group of about 600 men and women, has made great \n     accomplishments in the past 20 years to promote greater \n     employment opportunity for qualified handicapped men and \n     women. Operating within the Department of Labor and within a \n     budget that until last year had a ceiling of only a half \n     million dollars, the Committee maintains working \n     relationships with the 53 cooperating governor's committees, \n     and with the various Federal Departments, Agencies, and \n     Commissions. The Committee works to help assure that the \n     handicapped are considered for their abilities, and to help \n     facilitate development of maximum employment opportunities \n     for them. The peak of its activity, although it goes full \n     steam throughout each year, is in the first full week of \n     October, National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week.\n       The Department of Labor is also involved in training the \n     handicapped. Enactment of the Manpower Development and \n     Training Act in 1962 widened the opportunity for the \n     Department to develop meaningful training programs for \n     handicapped workers. It was estimated that by the summer of \n     1966, well over 25,000 handicapped persons had received \n     training under MDTA and over 20,000 of those had already \n     obtained jobs.\n\n\n                      HOUSING FOR THE HANDICAPPED\n\n       The Federal Government is involved in several programs \n     concerned with housing for the handicapped or disabled. The \n     Housing Assistance Administration of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development provides loans and \n     contributions to local housing authorities which, in turn, \n     provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing for low-income \n     families at rent they can afford. Handicapped persons of \n     limited income are among those eligible for benefits under \n     this program, established by the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 \n     (P.L. 75-412).\n       The Housing Assistance Administration also provides low-\n     interest, long-term loans to private nonprofit corporations, \n     consumer cooperatives, and public agencies for new and \n     renovated rental housing, dining facilities, community rooms, \n     and workshops for the elderly and the handicapped whose \n     incomes are above the levels set for admission to public \n     housing projects, but below that needed to pay rents for \n     available private housing. This program was enacted by the \n     Housing Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-372).\n       The Housing Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-70) established a grant \n     program for public and private groups to develop new or \n     improved means of providing housing for low-income persons, \n     the physically handicapped, and families. Demonstration of \n     means to provide housing is specifically authorized by this \n     legislation.\n       The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-117) \n     authorized rent supplement payments to help assure privately-\n     owned housing is available to low-income individuals or \n     families of low income. The handicapped are among those \n     eligible for this program if their income does not exceed the \n     maximum amount established in the area for occupancy of \n     federally-aided, low-rent public housing.\n\n\n                         ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS\n\n       Related to housing, Congress in 1968, passed legislation to \n     insure that certain buildings financed with Federal funds \n     are designed and constructed to be accessible to the \n     physically handicapped (P.L. 90-480). This legislation \n     applies to any public buildings constructed in whole or \n     part with Federal funds. The only exceptions are \n     privately-owned residences and buildings or facilities on \n     military installations intended primarily for use by able-\n     bodied military personnel.\n       This legislation was passed after recommendations were made \n     by the National Commission of Architectural Barriers to \n     Rehabilitation of the Handicapped, authorized by the \n     Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1965 and appointed by \n     the President in 1966.\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\n       The legislation should spur States and local governments to \n     enact legislation and regulations so that all public \n     buildings, not only those built with Federal funds, will be \n     so constructed that the disabled will be able to fully \n     utilize them. Some 45 States have laws or resolutions \n     already, but many of them are not strong enough to have much \n     effect. Only a few municipalities thus far have taken similar \n     action.\n\n\n          ASSISTANCE FOR THE NEEDY BLIND AND TOTALLY DISABLED\n\n       The Federal Government is involved in programs of support \n     for needy blind persons and for permanently and totally \n     disabled persons through social security legislation enacted \n     in 1935 and 1950. Under these public assistance programs, the \n     Government provides grants to States and the States, in turn, \n     provide three forms of assistance: cash payments for food, \n     clothing, shelter, and other basic needs; medical or remedial \n     care recognized under State law, through payments directly to \n     hospitals, physicians, dentists, and other providers of care; \n     and social services, such as counseling on personal problems, \n     help in finding better housing, referral to community \n     resources, and homemaker services.\n       These programs are available to needy blind persons so that \n     they may attain or retain their self-support or self-care \n     capability and to people over age 18 who cannot support \n     themselves because they have a permanent and total physical \n     or mental impairment.\n       In 1967 the number of persons receiving aid to the blind in \n     the States and territories with programs in operation totaled \n     over 82,000. Combined, total expenditure of local, State, and \n     Federal funds for this purpose was over $86.9 million, and \n     the average payment for all individuals participating \n     nationwide was $90.45 per month. Under the program for the \n     permanently and totally disabled, there were 646,000 \n     recipients receiving a total of $573.5 million, averaging \n     $80.60 per monthly payment.\n\n\n                  SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY INSURANCE\n\n       The basic social security program which provides benefits \n     to the worker when he retires also provides cash benefits to \n     covered disabled workers under age 65 and to their dependents \n     for as long as the worker is unable to engage in \n     ``substantial gainful activity.'' In 1967, over two million \n     disabled workers and dependents received social security cash \n     benefits totalling over $147.8 million. Under the 1965 social \n     security amendments, use of trust funds was authorized to pay \n     the cost of rehabilitation services provided by the State \n     vocational rehabilitation agencies to certain disability \n     insurance beneficiaries.\n       The ``Medicare'' Act passed in 1965 included a little-\n     publicized but valuable new arrangement for restoring more \n     disabled people: It authorized the Social Security \n     Administration to transfer from trust funds for retirement \n     and disability benefits certain amounts for vocational \n     rehabilitation services to disabled workers receiving social \n     security benefits. A limit of one percent of the total \n     benefits being received placed a control on how many funds \n     could be transferred each year. These funds are used by the \n     Federal-State Vocational Rehabilitation Program to pay for \n     services to disabled beneficiaries, most of whom can be \n     restored to activity and work, thereby resuming their \n     payments into the trust funds. For this year, $18,077,000 was \n     transferred for this work.\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       The above Federal programs have been described briefly and \n     quite possibly some programs may have been unintentionally \n     overlooked in our research.\n       At any rate, the summary may be of assistance to those \n     interested in the problems and programs concerning \n     handicapped Americans.\n\n       Mr. PEARSON. Mr. President, I should like to express great \n     pride in, and ask to be associated with this most excellent \n     statement just made by my distinguished colleague. He speaks \n     of a problem which, in his own words, affects every person in \n     our society and every fiber of our Nation.\n       Here is, then, a definition coupled with a solution and, \n     treated with sympathy and yet with reason, an approach, I am \n     sure, that will yield to progress.\n       I think that one point he so clearly set forth is the \n     challenge. That is when he asked all of us:\n\n       Are we doing our best to see that all the knowledge, the \n     information, and money, and other help is consolidated and \n     available to the handicapped person in the form he can best \n     use and in the time and place he needs it most?\n\n       I think he answered that question by saying a little later \n     on that we must do better. He makes a proposal which is \n     specific in its recommendations, and is an enormous \n     contribution, I think, to a very great problem.\n       I look forward to the other proposal that he shall be \n     making in the days ahead in regard to what is, really, one of \n     the great problems facing this country in the last third of \n     the 20th century.\n       I congratulate my distinguished colleague. I am very much \n     pleased to be here today when he makes his first speech in \n     the Senate.\n       Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas \n     yield?\n       Mr. DOLE. I yield.\n       Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I should like to join my friend, \n     the other distinguished Senator from Kansas (Mr. Pearson), in \n     commending the distinguished Senator from Kansas (Mr. Dole) \n     for his contribution this afternoon.\n       I have served in this body many years. I do not know that I \n     have ever heard a new Senator make a greater contribution in \n     what he characterizes as his first speech in this body.\n       He talked on a subject which is close to the hearts of all \n     Americans. This country has grown so fast, with over 200 \n     million people in it, with a huge Government requiring \n     complicated machinery, that it is a supertask for us to try \n     to see that some of the less fortunate people in this country \n     are not ground under the wheels of the massive instrument \n     that we have played our part in creating.\n       I predict for the junior Senator from Kansas a long and \n     distinguished career. I venture to say that although his \n     contributions, I am sure, will be great, he can always \n     remember with pride the fact that his first contribution was \n     on a subject which is so important to all Americans.\n       As a Member of the Senate, I join in congratulating the \n     distinguished Senator from Kansas on the masterly speech he \n     has just delivered.\n       Mr. MATHIAS, Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas \n     yield?\n       Mr. DOLE. I yield.\n       Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. President, I should like to join the \n     senior Senator from Kansas (Mr. Pearson) and the Senator from \n     New Hampshire (Mr. Cotton) in commenting on the speech which \n     the junior Senator from Kansas (Mr. Dole) has just \n     completed--a speech which addresses itself to a problem which \n     is becoming increasingly felt as one of the serious problems \n     in America today. The subject has a humanitarian impact \n     because it deals with the problems of the individual, but it \n     also has a social and economic impact because it affects the \n     way in which we, as a nation, deal with problems that touch \n     the lives of so many of our citizens.\n       The Senator has treated the subject in great depth, with \n     thoroughness, and with understanding. I can only say that \n     this is typical of him. He and I entered the other body on \n     the same day. We came to the Senate on the same day. I have \n     known him very well in the intervening years.\n       The remarks of the junior Senator from Kansas today are \n     evidence of the promise of the enormously valuable service \n     which he will render in this body as the years pass by.\n       I wish to express my appreciation to him for his valuable \n     contribution.\n       Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished \n     colleagues for their patience and their kind remarks.\n       Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Kansas \n     is to be commended for his statement today on problems faced \n     by the handicapped. This statement, in many ways, typifies \n     the man who made it. It is well prepared, thoughtful, and \n     above all, it is a warm and human examination of the problem.\n       The Senator from Kansas, during his four terms in the House \n     of Representatives, established himself as a man who truly \n     cares about people and does his best to aid them. His \n     emphasis is not on statistics, but on the people involved. \n     This is as it must be. The dollars spent, the programs \n     generated, mean nothing unless they benefit those in need.\n       The problem of aiding the physically, mentally, or \n     emotionally handicapped is not one to be solved by government \n     alone. In the end it is people who must help. People will \n     provide jobs, training, and dignity. A partnership of \n     government, local and national, and the private sector of our \n     economy is the wise way of approaching the question of \n     assistance to the handicapped. It is the way highlighted by \n     the able Senator from Kansas.\n       There is one final point I wish to make, Mr. President. In \n     mentioning specific causes of disability, there is one the \n     Senator from Kansas left out--service to our Nation. A great \n     number of our citizens have made the sacrifice of health and \n     well-being for the cause of peace. The distinguished Senator \n     knows well the problems of which he speaks today. He knows \n     the vitality that remains in the human soul despite injury to \n     the body. He has demonstrated how well a man can serve his \n     country despite a handicap.\n       Mr. President, I congratulate the junior Senator from \n     Kansas on his fine remarks to the Senate.\n       Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read the speech \nbecause it is as compelling and timely today as it was 39 years ago. It \noffers a comprehensive analysis of the challenges facing those with \ndisabilities and the steps that need to be taken to fulfill their \ndreams of full participation in our society. Thanks to the leadership \nand perseverance of Bob Dole and the work of other Senators such as \nSenator Domenici, Senator Harkin, and Senator Kennedy, those dreams \nbecame a reality with the passage in 1990 of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  Bob has described July 26, 1990, the day President George Herbert \nWalker Bush signed the ADA into law, as one of the most rewarding days \nof his life. He once said:\n\n       I suppose there were some that day who saw only a White \n     House lawn covered with wheelchairs and guide dogs. But that \n     just goes to show who in our society is truly limited.\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\n       My own perspective was very different. As I looked around, \n     I saw Americans with amazing gifts; Americans who could \n     finally contribute to a Nation much in need of their skills \n     and insights.\n\n  Bob Dole not only devoted much of his public life to serve as an \nadvocate for Americans with disabilities, he devoted much of his \nprivate life as well. He began the Dole Foundation and worked to raise \nmillions, which were used to fund job training and placement programs \nfor disabled workers. Bob also established a scholarship fund for law \nstudents with disabilities at the Washburn University School of Law. \nThe funds provide assistance to students with disabilities for tuition, \nbooks, and other special needs.\n  Throughout his career, Bob Dole has never wavered in his special \ncommitment to the veterans who were disabled in service to our country. \nAs my colleagues know, last year President Bush appointed Bob and \nformer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala to serve as \ncochairs of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returned \nWounded Warriors.\n  The Commission was asked to provide a comprehensive review of the \ncare provided to service men and women wounded in the global war on \nterrorism and to recommend needed improvements to that care. In the \ncourse of their work, the Commission visited DOD facilities, VA \nhospitals, and other care sites across the country. They met with \ninjured servicemembers, their families, professionals who provide \nmedical and rehabilitative services, program administrators, and many \nothers.\n  Last July, the Commission issued a final report with important \nrecommendations that would serve and support our veterans while \nsimplifying an overly complex system. As Senators Roberts and Brownback \nknow, the State motto of Kansas is: ``To the stars through \ndifficulties.''\n  Quite simply, I can think of no American who has done more in his \nlife and career to ensure that individuals with disabilities have the \nopportunity to fly as high and soar as far as their skills and talent \ncan take them than Bob Dole.\n  In doing so, he has earned more than the pride and admiration of a \nloving wife. He has earned the respect of a grateful nation and the \nenduring thanks of millions of individuals he has never met but whose \nlives are immeasurably better and richer and more productive because of \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have been listening to Senator Dole speak of her \nhusband, a great American. I would like to tell the Senator that as a \nmember of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we are now examining the \nDole-Shalala proposal that the Senator referenced, which is a quantum \nleap in good advice and sound understanding of the needs of America's \nveterans. We thank you. More importantly, we thank Senator Dole for \nthat great effort.\n\n\n                            Tax Code Reform\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I rise today, on the eve of Tax Day, 2008, to discuss the \nState of our Nation's Tax Code. Only a few weeks ago, we debated the \nfiscal year 2009 budget resolution and some recurring themes very \nquickly emerged.\n  Over and over again, both sides of the aisle were speaking of the \nproblems they heard about, the death tax and problems with the \nalternative minimum tax and the unfair tax advantage of the wealthy and \nthe burden on the middle class and other problems that are systemic \nwithin America's Tax Code.\n  You know what we did about these problems? We only offered temporary \nsolutions like we have offered for the last decade. Here is what is \nwrong with that type of thinking: There are not temporary problems that \ncan be fixed with temporary solutions, they are fundamental problems \nthat require fundamental changes in America's Tax Code.\n  Our current Tax Code is broken, and you saw Democrats and Republicans \nalike opining on the floor of the Senate during the debate over the \nbudget resolution about taxes. We tried to fix it with a temporary \nmeasure, but we have served only to make things worse. There is exactly \nwhat we have done over the last good number of years.\n  Today's Tax Code is over 67,000 pages long, and it is growing. \nAccording to IRS estimates, taxpayers spend 6 billion hours annually \ntrying to fit themselves into the Tax Code and over $265 billion in \nrelated compliance costs.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Americans, it is only going to get \nworse. Since the last major overhaul of the Tax Code in 1986, we have \nmade 15,000 changes. That is right, since 1986, we have made 15,000 \nchanges. That equates to a couple of changes to our Tax Code every day.\n  This nonstop tinkering has created a tax system that is overly \ncomplex, incredibly inefficient, and extremely unfair. We cannot \ncontinue down this unsustainable path of temporary fixes. We need to do \nfundamental reform to our Tax Code. We need a system that is simple and \ntransparent and fair. We need to wipe the slate clean and start all \nover.\n  I am amazed we have not done the very fundamental aspects of what we \nneed to do to fix the Tax Code. Our broken code does more than cost us \nmoney in compliance costs and a waste of time, it hurts us both \nsocially and economically. Socially our Tax Code tells us when is the \nbest time to marry, how many children we ought to have, how much to \nsave, how much to invest, where to live, and even, to a degree, what \ntime we should die in our lives that is the most economically \nadvantaged to our estate.\n  That is what our Tax Code does. Economically, we waste billions of \ndollars that could have been reinvested in the economy. Instead, we \nemploy some of America's brightest minds on innovation, while we waste \nthem on finding ways to navigate through this phenomenally complex \n67,000-page code. Moreover, our complex Tax Code and high corporate tax \nrate are putting Americans out of business as we compete in a world \naround us, not just here in America but all over the world. Companies \ntoday are locating where they have a greater tax advantage.\n\n  I spent several years examining several different tax systems, and \nafter examining the facts, I believe the best alternative to a broken \nTax Code has been the very tax idea I introduced some years ago. That \nwas a flat tax--no games, no gimmicks, a straightforward approach.\n  Our Tax Code is the workhorse pulling our economy, as I stated \nearlier, pulling us in the wrong direction. This horse that pulls our \neconomy, the American Tax Code, has grown very lame. I grew up farming \nand ranching. Let me tell you, when the horse got lame, you took it out \nof the harness and put it in the barn. Sometimes, if it could not get \nwell, you would simply have to dispose of it. How tragic that was.\n  But today's tragedy is the lame horse that is still in the harness, \nattempting to pull the Tax Code and the American people and the economy \nin the right direction when it is headed in the wrong direction.\n  So now as Americans file their taxes responsibly and dutifully, after \nthey have navigated their way through a maze, and they have taken them \nto their accountant, and their accountant puts his or her final seal on \nit, and they send it in, if they were to ask an IRS agent: Did I do it \nright, there is no IRS agent today, no matter how schooled and how \nlearned and how long-serving in the IRS, who can say: Yes, you have \ndone it right. And that is not appropriate. The best they can tell you \nis that they think, in fact they guess, that you did it right.\n  That ought to be an embarrassment to our country, and more \nimportantly it ought to be an embarrassment to America's policymakers. \nThat is us, those who write the Tax Code of our country that drives our \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me use some of the time for the issue at hand. First \nof all, I wish to talk about the technical corrections bill that is \ngoing to be voted on in about 15 minutes--not the bill but the motion \nto proceed to the bill.\n  The Transportation bill that we are involved in, that Senator Boxer \nand I were involved in back in 2005, that we passed August 10 of 2005, \nauthorized $286 billion in transportation and infrastructure spending \nfor fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n  Now, let me say that as a conservative standing here, that is a huge\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nnumber. I think that may have been the largest nondefense spending bill \nat the time up to that time. But it is interesting that if we spend all \nof that, it is not going to even maintain what we have today.\n  That is why we put into the bill a committee to look into new ways of \nfunding infrastructure, new ways of funding transportation. We have \nbeen doing it the same way since President Eisenhower, and it is time \nwe tried something different.\n  I think there is a resistance to continuing to increase taxes as the \nonly way of funding our infrastructure. Included in the bill are \nrecommended technical changes from the Department of Transportation \nthat address functional problems in implementing the bill, technical \nchanges to safety products which will continue to be delayed from \nbreaking ground due to simple drafting errors and descriptions.\n  Furthermore, universities and other transportation research entities \nwill not receive their fully intended funding, and the States will be \nunable to use millions of dollars in transportation funds that were \nauthorized 3 years ago.\n  Something that is interesting, the bill does not increase the overall \nsize of SAFETEA. I have heard a lot of people say: Well, this is a big \nspending bill. First of all, it is not a spending bill, it is an \nauthorizing bill. But the technical corrections are also an \nauthorization.\n  Now, it is my understanding, and I believe it is true, that the total \namount of authorization that was in the bill itself is not changed by \nthe technical corrections bill.\n  A lot of people are implying it is. I do not believe it is. We have \nhad staff and ourselves looking at it. It may change some of the \npriorities in the authorization, but the overall figure, the top line, \nis going to be the same.\n  Several of my colleagues have approached me recently with additional \nproject fixes. In some cases, I have had to say no to their requests \nbecause they either submitted them too late to be considered in our \nnegotiations with the House--the request went beyond the scope of a \ntechnical fix--or because the proposed fix was to a House project which \nthe House objected to. Let's keep in mind, we have two Houses working \non this. We have the Senate and the House of Representatives. This is a \ndifficult type of legislation to get passed. But one thing you can't do \nis start making changes and anticipate that the House is going to go \nalong with those changes, because I can tell my colleagues, they will \nnot do it. Our House colleagues have passed this bill several times, \nbut each time it comes over to the Senate it has been held up.\n  The bill before us, along with the manager's substitute amendment, is \nthe commutation of negotiations between the House and the Senate. Any \nchanges to the bill at this point will require the concurrence of the \nHouse or the bill will not proceed. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to \nunderstand that if they are planning on filing an amendment before the \nchairman and I can agree to it, we need to determine if our \ncounterparts in the House would find it to be agreeable. I suggest they \nprobably will not.\n  I heard about an hour ago, when I arrived in Washington, that it \nmight be that the administration could have some objections. I am \nhaving a hard time understanding how that could be. First, they \nsupported the bill. They signed the bill when it first passed in August \nof 2005. Technical corrections is a common thing. It does not have a \nnet increase in authorizations. I can't see why it would be. I \nunderstand there would be one provision having to do with rapid transit \nthat would not be in our committee. It was not in the committee chaired \nby Senator Boxer and formerly chaired by me. It is in the Banking \nCommittee. So we want to look at that. If that is the objection, I \ncertainly believe we can talk to the administration and keep them from \nopposing it.\n  We have some amendments that have been discussed. I have not been \nhere long enough to find out this week if people are going to come \nforward with their amendments. My junior Senator, Mr. Coburn, makes a \nvery good point on a project down in Florida called Coconut Road, that \nthere have been some problems. Apparently, all those have been \ncorrected. The only thing I wish to talk to my junior Senator about is \nif he wants to examine this, investigate this, that is a good idea. It \nis already being done. However, we have enough committees and \ncommissions around this place, thousands of them. I am not sure we need \nanother one. That is something we might want to debate. I know Senator \nBond has an amendment that he has discussed. I look forward to visiting \nwith him. Any of these amendments, yes, we want to talk about them. But \nkeep in mind, we do have this commitment that we have a technical \ncorrections bill that has to pass or we cannot implement those \nprovisions that otherwise are going to allow us to correct some of the \nproblems we have.\n  Again, here I am, a conservative, saying this is not adequate, what \nwe have done today. We have another one that should be coming up next \nyear. Hopefully, it will. Sometimes it doesn't happen like it should. \nBut in the meantime, I want that committee that is supposed to be \nexamining the way we have historically funded roads and highways and \ninfrastructure to come up with some ideas. There are experiments in \ndifferent States right now. But we will have to recognize the fact that \nthis country has got to have infrastructure for it to survive.\n  In conclusion, I assure my colleagues that I appreciate their \nresponsiveness to our numerous requests to advise the committee of \ntheir requests, thereby assisting us to help them. If we were unable to \nsatisfactorily address their concerns in this bill, there will be \nadditional opportunities do so when we reauthorize SAFETEA, and that \nreauthorization should be under way next year.\n  With that, I hope those who object to this will at least let us \nproceed to this bill. Then we can look at it and see if there are any \nof the amendments that we feel would not violate the agreement between \nthe Senate and House and would have the effect of killing the whole \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my ranking member. He and I, \nwhen we are on the same page, have had very good results. I think our \ncolleagues trust that when we can come together on something, it has \ngone through all the hoops and all the ``I's'' have been dotted and the \n``T's'' have been crossed. I want to assure colleagues that on this \nparticular piece of legislation, we have worked closely together, as \nhave Senators Dodd and Shelby over at Banking, as have Senators Inouye \nand Stevens. This is one of those moments which doesn't come that often \naround here--not often enough for me--where we do have a lot of us \nworking together across party lines, across committee jurisdictions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I neglected to mention that when we went through this \nlong and arduous legislation initially, there are probably not two \nMembers of the Senate who are more opposed to each other \nphilosophically than the two of us, Senator Boxer and myself. But we \nrecognize that the process we used is one that is fair. We developed \ncriteria. There are projects in here that met the criteria. Some of \nthem I would oppose personally, but nonetheless, you have to come up \nwith a bill if you are going to have roads to travel and infrastructure \nto serve this great Nation.\n  I compliment Senator Boxer in working with me on some of the problems \nI had initially with this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased we can work so well \ntogether. I want to thank our staffs also. We have developed very \ntrusting relationships with our senior staff, and it reflects the \nrelationship we have developed to be able, even if we disagree, to be \ncompletely honest with each other. This is helpful for the Senate as a \nwhole.\n  I wanted to share with the Senate this amazing group who came \ntogether to support us in our efforts on this technical corrections \nbill which will unleash some funding that is rather stuck right now, at \na time when we could use some construction activity. I think it is \nimportant to see. We have the American Association of Highway and \nTransportation Officials--those are Departments of Transportation from \nall 50 States--American Highway Users\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\nAlliance, millions of highway users throughout the country; American \nPublic Transit Association, transit systems from across the country; \nAmerican Road and Transportation Builders Associations, more than 5,000 \nmembers of the transportation construction industry--these people have \nall written to us and have said: Get this bill going--Associated \nGeneral Contractors, more than 32,000 contractors, service providers \nand suppliers; the Council of University Transportation Centers, more \nthan 30 university transportation centers from across the country; \nNational Stone, Sand and Gravel Association, companies in America that \nproduce more than 92 percent of crushed stone and 75 percent of sand \nand gravel used in the United States annually; and the National Asphalt \nand Pavement Association, more than 1,100 companies that produce and \npave with asphalt. These are the folks who are saying to all of us: \nPlease bring this bill to the floor, please work together.\n  I personally have a very good feeling about this bill. Senator \nDeMint, who sometimes has trouble with these bills, was complimentary \nto both of us and the work we have done. He has a couple of amendments, \nmaybe only one amendment. He said he did not intend to hold up our \nbill. So I think we are moving in a good direction. But I want to \nreiterate what Senator Inhofe said: Please, if you do have an \namendment, talk to us, because we are not going to have this bill go \nthrough unless the House signs off. So we would hope we could keep this \nbill pretty clean. We hope we can work out our differences with a \ncouple of Senators who have some problems. If we can't work it out, we \nwill have to see what the body wants to do. This is sort of a very mini \nstimulus package, frankly, and one that doesn't mean one dollar of new \nspending that hasn't already been authorized. It is a good moment for \nthe Senate.\n  I thank Senator Reid, working with Senator McConnell, for getting \nthis bill before us. A lot of our communities will be very happy when \nthey see that projects that were stalled, because there were some \ntechnical problems, can now go forward.\n  Some of our colleagues who said: Look, leg one of this project can go \nforward but not leg two. Can you change the wording?\n  We are allowing colleagues this kind of latitude. Of course, we put a \nfreeze on all of that because we had to cut off at some point. I think \nthis bill is a good bill. It is a technical corrections bill. It is not \nbreaking any new ground. We look forward to an ``aye'' vote from as \nmany of our colleagues whom we can convince this is a good idea. I \nunderstand we are about to go into the vote. I look forward to a solid \nvote. Then Senator Inhofe and I will be in the well, and we will talk \nto all our colleagues who may want to talk about their amendments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 608, H.R. 1195, an act to amend the \n     Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act: A Legacy for Users, to make technical corrections, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Richard Durbin, Charles E. \n           Schumer, Sherrod Brown, Frank R.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 1195, a bill to amend the Safe, Accountable, \nFlexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, to \nmake technical corrections, and for other purposes, shall be brought to \na close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I just need 30 seconds. On behalf of my \nranking member, Jim Inhofe, and myself, I thank colleagues for giving \nus this go-ahead to go to the technical corrections bill. It is not the \nmost exciting of bills, but it will be a bit of an economic stimulus to \nour Nation. It doesn't add a dollar of new spending; it just makes \ncorrections to a bill that is a very popular bill--SAFETEA-LU--and it \nwill allow a lot of highway construction and transit projects to \nproceed. We are very pleased with this vote.\n  Before giving up the floor so Senator Inhofe can say a couple of \nwords, if my colleagues have any amendments--we know that amendments do \nthreaten this bill--we will be delighted to speak with our colleagues \nabout them and try to figure out a way to either work them out so that \nthe House agrees and we agree we can move forward or figure out a way \nto get an early vote so we can get on with consideration and then on to \nsomething else.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and again say thank you very much to \nour colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me say I do agree with what Senator \nBoxer says, although it is a little bit\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\nmore than that. Not only does it not spend more, it doesn't authorize \nmore. I think that is very important for people to understand. There is \nsome confusion from some things I have read in different publications \nthat make it appear that we have increased the authorization. Some \nthings have been moved around, but the bottom line is it has remained \nunchanged.\n  The other thing that is important to repeat is that as big as this \nbill was, the 2005 bill we are scheduled to get into again next year, \nin 2009, it still doesn't take care of the problem. We have a problem \nin this country with the $286 billion figure; it doesn't even maintain \nwhat we have today. That is critical. I am hoping the committee that \nwas established for the purpose of exploring new ways of funding \ntransportation will come up with something a little more creative than \nthey have so far because we are not going to be able to do it just by \nredoing and expanding what Eisenhower started many years ago. So we \nneed to have this bill in order to go ahead and finish the projects \nthat we have authorized and that are paid for at this time, and we \nwon't do it unless we can pass this bill.\n  So I hope anyone--I would agree with Senator Boxer--anyone with \namendments, let's bring them down and talk about them, and I am \navailable to talk, and I am doing that as we speak. I have spoken with \na couple of Members who have talked about an amendment.

Madam President, I rise today to call the attention of the \nSenate to the 50th Anniversary of a remarkable organization that boasts \n35 million members, for whom it provides services ranging from \ndiscounted prescription drugs, to travel services, to financial \nservices. Most of us on Capitol Hill are far more familiar with this \norganization as the tireless advocate for the interests of Americans \nover the age of 50. The organization, of course, is AARP.\n  In its half-century of service, the organization that we know today \nas AARP has been transformed from its modest beginnings in 1958 when \nDr. Ethel Percy Andrus, a retired high school principal, transformed \nthe National Retired Teachers' Organization into the American \nAssociation for Retired Persons. The organization was known under this \nname until 1999 when it became just AARP to reflect the fact that many \nof its members are still active in the labor force.\n  Characteristic of the work of AARP over the past 50 years has been \nits efforts to influence national policy on behalf of the well being of \nAmericans over the age of 50 and to defend the programs that protect \nthem, especially Social Security and Medicare. More recently, AARP has \nspearheaded the effort to get bipartisan action in Congress to provide \nall Americans with health care and long-term financial security with \nits Divided We Fail campaign. I commend AARP for its outstanding \nleadership on these issues, which are so critical to millions of \nAmericans.\n  When President Bush in 2005, fresh from his election victory, made \nthe privatization of Social Security his top domestic priority, he met \nhis match in AARP, which mobilized its members to oppose this very \nrisky plan. Congressional Democrats worked very closely with AARP in \nthat effort, and in the end we were successful, at least temporarily. \nUnfortunately, given the continuing support for privatization among \nmany in Washington, that battle will have to continue in the years \nahead, and I look forward to working closely with AARP to continue to \nmake the case against privatization, and to make sure that America \nkeeps its promise to our seniors.\n  So I offer a cordial birthday greeting to an organization that is 50 \nyears old and stronger than ever. AARP has kept pace with the needs of \nmature Americans and, more importantly, it has kept faith with them. In \nthe process, it has made this country a better place for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/14/senate-section/article/S2972-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REAUTHORIZATION OF THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge the passage \nof S. 793, the reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI, \nProgram. Both the Senate and House of Representatives have passed this \nbill and it will now be sent to the President's desk to be signed into \nlaw.\n  I thank my colleague and coauthor of the Senate bill, Senator \nKennedy, and his staff for their hard work over the past few years. I \nalso extend my gratitude to Senator Enzi and his staff for their \ndiligent efforts in helping to reauthorize this important program.\n  I also must thank the leaders of this effort in the House, \nRepresentatives Bill Pascrell, Jr., Frank Pallone, Jr., and their \nstaffs who have been so dedicated to helping individuals with TBI.\n  Also, this bill would not have been possible without the cooperation \nand input from involved organizations, such as the Brain Injury \nAssociation of America, BIAA; the National Association of State Head \nInjury Administrators, NASHIA; the National Brain Injury Research, \nTreatment and Training Foundation, NBIRTT; and the National Disability \nRights Network, NDRN; and I thank them all for their contributions.\n  It means a lot to the 5.3 million Americans living with TBI, and \ntheir families, to reauthorize the only Federal program that helps \nthem. The Federal TBI Program comprises prevention and surveillance \nactivities at the Center for Disease Control, CDC, research at the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, and grants to States from the \nHealth Resources and Services Administrations, HRSA. This \nreauthorization bill expands and improves those activities, and \nincludes provisions to look at the reintegration of war vets returning \nto their communities.\n  Each year, 1.4 million people sustain a TBI and face long-term or \nlifelong need for help to perform activities of daily living as a \nresult. Direct medical costs and indirect costs such as lost \nproductivity of TBI totaled an estimated $60 billion in the United \nStates in 2000. We can help truncate those costs and ensure that people \nare connected to the services they need by continuing this important \nprogram.\n  It has been a labor of love to draft and enact legislation to \nreauthorize this important program. On behalf of individuals living \nwith TBI, and their families, I thank my colleagues in Congress for \npassing this legislation and reaffirming our commitment to helping \nthose with who suffer from traumatic brain injuries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/14/senate-section/article/S2972-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2972-S2973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, yesterday marked the official beginning \nof National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Since 1981, communities in \nVermont and across the Nation have observed this week with candlelight \nvigils and public rallies to renew our commitment to crime victims and \ntheir families. It is vitally important that we recognize the needs of \ncrime victims and their family members, and work together to promote \nvictims' rights and services.\n  We have been able to make some progress during the past 27 years to \nprovide victims with greater rights and assistance. In particular, I \nwas honored to support the passage of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, \nVOCA, Public Law 98-473, which established the Crime Victims Fund. The \nCrime Victims Fund allows the Federal Government to provide grants to \nState crime victim compensation programs, direct victim assistance \nservices, and services to victims of Federal crimes. Nearly 90 percent \nof the Crime Victims Fund is used to award victim assistance formula \ngrants and provide State crime victim compensation. These VOCA-funded \nvictim assistance programs serve nearly 4 million crime victims each \nyear, including victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child \nabuse, elder abuse,\n\n[[Page S2973]]\n\nand drunk driving, as well as survivors of homicide victims. Our VOCA-\nfunded compensation programs have helped hundreds of thousands of \nvictims of violent crime.\n  The Crime Victims Fund is the Nation's premier vehicle for supporting \nvictims' services. It is important to understand that the Crime Victims \nFund does not receive a dime from tax revenue or appropriated funding. \nInstead, it is made up of criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, \npenalties, and special assessments.\n  In 1995, after the Oklahoma City bombing, I proposed and Congress \npassed the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995. Among other important \nmatters, this legislation authorized the Office for Victims of Crime at \nthe Department of Justice to set aside an emergency reserve as part of \nthe Crime Victims Fund to serve as a ``rainy day'' resource to \nsupplement compensation and assistance grants to States to provide \nemergency relief in the wake of an act of terrorism or mass violence \nthat might otherwise overwhelm the resources of a State's crime victims \ncompensation program and crime victims assistance services.\n  Over the last several years we have made sure that the Crime Victims \nFund would remain dedicated to crime victims. We made sure that it \nwould serve as a ``rainy day'' fund and reserve to help meet crime \nvictims' needs. The ``rainy day'' fund has been used to make up the \ndifference between annual deposits and distributions three times during \nthe past 7 years. It provides security and continuity to crime victims \nprograms and to our State partners.\n  Since fiscal year 2000, Congress has set a cap on annual obligations \nfrom the Crime Victims Fund. I have worked to ensure that the cap has \nnever resulted in resources being lost to the Crime Victims Fund. I \nbelieve we need to increase the cap. With the failure of the Bush \nadministration crime prevention policies, crime began to rise under \nAttorney General Gonzales. Crime victims, the States and service \nproviders need more assistance.\n  Instead of taking that salutary action, the Bush administration is \nproposing to raid the Crime Victims Fund and zero it out. The future of \nthe Crime Victims Fund is in danger because the Bush administration has \nproposed rescinding all amounts remaining in the Crime Victims Fund at \nthe end of fiscal year 2009--just cleaning it out and leaving the \ncupboard bare. That would leave the Crime Victims Fund with a zero \nbalance going into fiscal year 2010 and create a disastrous situation \nfor providers of victims' services. That is wrong.\n  Over the last few years, we have successfully blocked the Bush \nadministration's past attempts to raid the Crime Victims Fund. This is \nnot a cache of money from which this administration should try to \nreduce the budget deficits it has created. It has turned a $5 trillion \nbudget surplus into a $9.4 trillion debt. Its annual deficits run into \nthe hundreds of millions. It is wrong to try to pay for its failed \nfiscal policies by emptying out the Crime Victims Fund. These resources \nare set aside to assist victims of crime.\n  In order to preserve the Crime Victims Fund once again, Senator Crapo \nand I, as well as 25 other Senators, sent a letter on April 4, 2008, to \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee asking that the committee to oppose \nthe administration's proposal to empty the Crime Victims Fund. We asked \nthe Committee, instead, to permit unobligated funds to remain in the \nCrime Victims Fund, in accordance with current law, to be used for \nneeded programs and services that are so important to victims of crime \nin the years ahead.\n  We need to renew our national commitment to crime victims. The Senate \ncan help by recognizing the importance of the Crime Victims' Fund and \nsupporting its essential role in helping crime victims and their \nfamilies meet critical expenses, recover from the horrific crimes they \nendured, and move forward with their lives. I urge Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to honor our longstanding commitment to crime \nvictims by working together to recognize and support victims of crime, \nand to preserve the Crime Victims Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/14/senate-section/article/S2973-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I wish today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  Early in the morning of September 9, 2007, police in Antioch, CA, \nresponded to a call regarding a fight that had broken out at a party. \nAccording to witnesses, Phillip Hale, 18, and a 17-year-old accomplice \nwere mocking and attempting to provoke a group of deaf partygoers by \nmimicking their hand movements. The two teens were asked to leave, but \ncame back sometime later with a stick, a hoe, and a brick. Witnesses \nsay a fight ensued upon their return. When police arrived on the scene, \nthey found a substantial amount of blood. One deaf victim suffered a \nminor head injury, and Hale suffered a head injury as well, for which \nhe was treated at John Muir Medical Center. According to jail records, \nHale was booked at Contra County jail on suspicion of assault with a \ndeadly weapon, conspiracy, and committing a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/14/senate-section/article/S2973-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN EDMUND LITTLE\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

Lieutenant \nColonel Little went on to become a distinguished fighter pilot in the \nSouthwest Pacific, Solomon Islands from 1942 to 1943. In 1943, he \nbecame squadron commander of the 44th Fighter Squadron which became the \nNo. 1 squadron in the South Pacific, and was involved in the fatal \nstrike against Admiral Yamamoto. Nine of the original pilots in his \nsquadron were aces.\n  During his military career, Lieutenant Colonel Little received \nnumerous awards for his hard work and dedication to the United States. \nThese awards include four Air Medals, American Campaigns Medal, \nAsiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, National \nDefense Service Medal, and Armed Forces Reserve Medal.

A bill to provide increased accessibility to information on \nFederal spending, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, throughout my career, I have been working \non the front lines of the battle for greater transparency and openness \nin our Government because I fundamentally believe the more the American \npeople and my constituents in Texas understand about the Government and \nhow it operates, the better accountability can take place, and people \nwill once again feel they are in charge, which is absolutely the case. \nKnowledge is power, and transparency permits the accountability \nnecessary for our system to work.\n  Just a few months ago, Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and I were successful in getting a bill \nsigned which modernized and greatly improved our Freedom of Information \nlaws for the first time in many years. Now it is my intent to try to \naccomplish that same thing with the Federal spending, and that is why \ntoday I am introducing the Federal Spending and Taxpayer Accessibility \nAct of 2008.\n  The first thing this bill would do would be to create an online \nearmark tracking system that taxpayers can use free of charge to search \nfor specific earmarks by recipient, by appropriations bill, by State, \nand by Member, and to do so in a real-time frame of reference during \nthe appropriations process.\n  Of course, earmarks are especially designated appropriations for \nparticular projects in particular locations. There is a lot of \ncontroversy about earmarks, but I think greater transparency would \nlimit the number of earmarks introduced because were they to be \ncompletely transparent, it would discourage the use of earmarks and \nmake certain only meritorious ones are accepted by the Congress as part \nof the appropriations process.\n  Secondly, my legislation would direct the Internal Revenue Service to \nprovide each taxpayer with a concise, easy-to-read personal record of \nthe amount of taxes they have already paid and an estimate of the \namount of taxes they will pay in the timeframe before they retire.\n  As you know, the Social Security Administration currently already \nmails out a similar statement, called a Social Security account \nstatement, which gives taxpayers a record of the earnings on which they \nhave paid Social Security taxes and a summary of their estimated future \nbenefits. So this taxpayer account statement would be sort of the \nmirror image of the Social Security statement, and it would let people \nknow how much taxes they have paid and what their tax obligation would \nlikely be into the future.\n\n[[Page S2978]]\n\n  I think this tax statement could play an important role when \ntaxpayers are planning their future finances and provide them with a \nbetter idea of how much in taxes they will pay in the future.\n  It will also have the added benefit of making them much more aware of \nwhat Washington is doing when it comes to their hard-earned money and \nthe money they send to Washington to pay the bills.\n  Finally, this legislation builds upon the Federal Funding \nAccountability and Transparency Act of 2006 that created a one-stop, \nsearchable Web site for all Federal contracts and grants. My \nlegislation would expand on this Web site by including all expenditures \nof all Federal agencies, such as salaries, rent, supplies, and \ntransportation.\n  As this chart shows, taxpayers will have to work 74 days during the \nyear just to pay their Federal taxes without getting one red cent for \nthemselves. Additionally, local taxes and State taxes account for an \nadditional 39 days of work, and that is before they begin to work to \npay their own bills, their other bills. For housing, it is roughly 60 \ndays out of the year; health insurance, 50 days out of the year; food, \n35; and transportation, 29 days out of the year. So these living \nessentials are being squeezed by the Federal tax burden, and I think it \nis important for people to understand that. Frankly, once they do, I \nthink their voices are then much more likely to be heard when loose \ntalk in Washington occurs about raising taxes.\n  I was interested to hear our colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, \ntalk about the alternative minimum tax. That is a perfect case study of \nwhy, when people talk about taxing the rich, really what they are \ntalking about is taxing people who earn a living. That was a classic \ncase where the alternative minimum tax was passed to target 155 \ntaxpayers who did not otherwise pay Federal income tax because of their \ndeductions, due to State and local taxes. Well, no surprise those 155 \ntargeted taxpayers grew last year to 6 million taxpayers, and this year \nit would have grown to 23 million middle-class taxpayers because it had \nnot been indexed. Once again, taxing the rich turns into taxing the \nmiddle class.\n  Well, I think greater transparency in the process would allow the \nmiddle class to tell Washington: Wait a minute, you need to cut out \nsome of the waste and inefficiency of Government before you come back \nto me and ask me for more of what I earn, which I need to spend on \nhousing, health insurance, food, transportation, or whatever else I see \nfit.\n  I think it is about time for taxpayers to see where their money is \ngoing, and it is in this spirit I am introducing this Federal Spending \nand Taxpayer Accessibility Act of 2008. I think it answers the \nfundamental question: Should the people who foot the bill for the \nFederal Government know what it is they are getting?\n  Never would you ask a person to make an investment without giving \nthem the ability to monitor that investment. But when it comes to \ntaxes, that is precisely what we are asking. It is time for us to open \nup the process of Federal spending to the public and let the American \npeople see where their money is going. That way they can hold their \nelected officials accountable and play a closer role in the \ndetermination of where we spend their hard-earned money.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Spending and \n     Taxpayer Accessibility Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 513\n\n       Whereas on January 9, 1905, the 26th President of the \n     United States, Theodore Roosevelt, dispatched a ``special \n     message'' to the Senate and the House of Representatives that \n     ``earnestly recommended passage'' of legislation to establish \n     a Federal reserve force of skilled and trained personnel to \n     bring ``our Army . . . to the highest point of efficiency'';\n       Whereas on December 14, 1905, the then-Secretary of War and \n     later 27th President of the United States, William Howard \n     Taft, transmitted to the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a draft bill and letter authored by Major \n     General Leonard Wood, ``strongly commending . . . proposed \n     legislation'' to ``increase the efficiency of the Medical \n     Corps of the Army'' by establishing a Federal reserve force \n     comprised of specially trained personnel;\n       Whereas in response to the recommendations of President \n     Theodore Roosevelt and senior military and civilian leaders, \n     the 60th Congress enacted Public Law 101, entitled ``An Act \n     to increase the efficiency of the Medical Department of the \n     United States\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\n     Army'', ch. 150, 35 Stat. 66, which was signed into law on \n     April 23, 1908, by President Theodore Roosevelt;\n       Whereas Public Law 101 authorized the establishment of the \n     first Federal reserve force and the first reservoir of \n     trained officers in a reserve status for a United States \n     military service;\n       Whereas Congress subsequently adapted, expanded, and \n     amended the reserve organization of the Army to include \n     additional military occupational specialties and capabilities \n     and established the organization today known as the Army \n     Reserve;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve has played a major role in the \n     defense of our Nation and in furtherance of United States \n     interests for 100 years;\n       Whereas many distinguished Americans have served honorably \n     and with distinction in the Army Reserve, including \n     Presidents Harry S. Truman and Ronald W. Reagan, the former \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry H. \n     Shelton, Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Major \n     General William J. Donovan (Director of the Office of \n     Strategic Services during World War II), Drs. Charles H. Mayo \n     and William J. Mayo, and Captain Eddie Rickenbacker;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve contributed 169,500 soldiers to \n     the Army during World War I;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve contributed 200,000 soldiers and \n     29 percent of the Army's officers during World War II and was \n     recognized by General George C. Marshall for its unique and \n     invaluable contributions to the national defense;\n       Whereas 240,500 soldiers of the Army Reserve were called to \n     active duty during the Korean War;\n       Whereas more than 60,000 Army Reserve soldiers were called \n     to active duty during the Berlin Crisis;\n       Whereas 35 Army Reserve units were activated and deployed \n     in support of operations in Vietnam, where they served with \n     distinction and honor;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve contributed more than 94,000 \n     soldiers in support of Operations Desert Storm and Desert \n     Shield in 1990 and 1991;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve contributed more than 48 percent \n     of the reserve component soldiers mobilized in support of \n     Operation Joint Endeavor and Joint Guard in Bosnia;\n       Whereas since September 11, 2001, the Army Reserve has \n     provided indispensable and sustained support for Operations \n     Enduring Freedom, Noble Eagle, and Iraqi Freedom, with 98 \n     percent of units either deploying or providing mobilized \n     soldiers and more than 147,000 individual soldiers being \n     mobilized (of which more than 110,000 individual soldiers \n     have deployed) in support of the Global War on Terrorism;\n       Whereas more than 39,000 individual soldiers of the Army \n     Reserve have served multiple deployments since September 11, \n     2001;\n       Whereas 13,003 Army Reserve soldiers were forward-deployed \n     in the Central Command Area of Responsibility on October 31, \n     2007, and 102 soldiers of the Army Reserve had borne the \n     ultimate sacrifice in support of Operations Enduring Freedom \n     and Iraqi Freedom through October 31, 2007;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve is organized into 3 components, \n     the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired \n     Reserve, which together contain more than 601,000 soldiers;\n       Whereas the Army cannot go to war or sustain a military \n     operation without the highly skilled and trained personnel of \n     the Army Reserve;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve provides more than 37 percent of \n     the mission essential combat support and combat service \n     support forces of the Army;\n       Whereas 100 percent of the Army's Internment Settlement \n     Brigades, Judge Advocate General Units (Legal Support \n     Organizations), Medical Groups, Railway Units, and Training \n     and Exercise Divisions are in the Army Reserve;\n       Whereas more than 66 percent of the Army's Civil Affairs \n     Units, Psychological Operations Units, Theater Signal \n     Commands, Expeditionary Sustainment Commands, and Medical \n     Capabilities are in the Army Reserve;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve is no longer a force held in \n     strategic reserve but today functions as an integral and \n     essential operational reserve in support of the missions of \n     the active Army;\n       Whereas the Army cannot go to war or sustain a military \n     operation without the skilled and trained Ready Reserve and \n     Retired Reserve soldiers of the Army Reserve;\n       Whereas the Selected Reserve component of the Army Reserve \n     is comprised of more than 30,000 officers and 150,000 \n     enlisted soldiers who have volunteered their personal service \n     in defense of the Constitution and their fellow citizens;\n       Whereas the Army and the Army Reserve are recognized as \n     institutions that have played historic and decisive roles in \n     promoting the cause of individual dignity and the value of \n     integration;\n       Whereas more than one in four Selected Reserve soldiers and \n     more than one in five Individual Ready Reserve soldiers are \n     women whose contributions have consistently been marked by a \n     high degree of commitment, professionalism, and military \n     bearing;\n       Whereas the ability of individual soldiers and the Army \n     Reserve to perform their wartime missions is contingent on \n     the active engagement and support of their families, \n     employers, and local communities;\n       Whereas the Army Reserve is a community-based force with an \n     active presence in 1,100 communities and 975 Army Reserve \n     centers in operation throughout the United States;\n       Whereas Sir Winston Churchill once remarked that \n     ``Reservists are twice the citizen'', a sentiment that \n     applies especially to the soldiers of the Army Reserve; and\n       Whereas the Army Reserve makes these contributions to the \n     security of our Nation in return for less than 5 percent of \n     the Army's total budget: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Army Reserve on the occasion of the \n     100th anniversary of the enactment of its original \n     authorizing law;\n       (2) recognizes and commends the Army Reserve for the \n     selfless and dedicated service of its past and present \n     citizen-soldiers whose personal courage, contributions, and \n     sacrifices have helped preserve the freedom and advance the \n     national security and homeland defense of the United States;

Res. 470\n\n       Whereas armed groups have been moving freely among Sudan, \n     Chad, and the Central African Republic, committing murder, \n     banditry, forced recruitment, mass displacement, gender-based \n     violence, and other crimes that are contributing to \n     insecurity and instability throughout the region, \n     exacerbating the humanitarian crises in these\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\n     countries and obstructing efforts to end violence in the \n     Darfur region of Sudan and adjacent areas;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2008, rebels stormed the capital of \n     Chad, N'Djamena, in their second coup attempt in two years, \n     prompting clashes with forces loyal to President of Chad \n     Idriss Deby that caused more than 100 civilian deaths, \n     thousands of displacements, and an estimated 10,000 refugees \n     from Chad to seek refuge in neighboring Cameroon;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2008, the United States Embassy in \n     N'Djamena was forced to evacuate employees' families and all \n     nonemergency staff and urged United States citizens to defer \n     all travel to Chad;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2008, the United States Government \n     condemned the armed attack on N'Djamena and expressed \n     ``support [for] the [African Union]'s call for an immediate \n     end to armed attacks and to refrain from violence that might \n     harm innocent civilians'';\n       Whereas, on February 12, 2008, the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that recent \n     offensives by the Government of Sudan in Darfur have prompted \n     up to 12,000 new refugees to flee to neighboring Chad, where \n     the UNHCR and its partners are already struggling to take \n     care of 240,000 refugees from Sudan in eastern Chad and some \n     50,000 refugees from the Central African Republic in southern \n     Chad;\n       Whereas cross-border attacks by alleged Arab militias from \n     Sudan and related inter-communal ethnic hostilities in \n     eastern Chad have also resulted in the displacement of an \n     estimated 170,000 people from Chad in the region, adding to \n     the humanitarian need;\n       Whereas there have been allegations and evidence in both \n     Chad and Sudan of government support for dissident rebel \n     militias in each other's country, in direct violation of the \n     Tripoli Declaration of February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena \n     Agreement of July 26, 2006;\n       Whereas, on January 16, 2008, the United Nations \n     Humanitarian Coordinator for the Central African Republic \n     reported that waves of violence across the north of that \n     country have left more than 1,000,000 people in need of \n     humanitarian assistance, including 150,000 who are internally \n     displaced, while some 80,000 have fled to neighboring Chad or \n     Cameroon;\n       Whereas, since late 2007, arrests, disappearances, and \n     harassment of journalists, human rights defenders, and \n     opposition leaders--particularly those reporting on military \n     operations and human rights conditions in eastern Chad--\n     mirror the repressive crackdown in the aftermath of an attack \n     on N'Djamena in April 2006, and conditions have only worsened \n     since the February 2008 attempted coup;\n       Whereas, on September 27, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), \n     authorizing a limited United Nations peacekeeping mission \n     (MINURCAT) and a concurrent European-led force (EUFOR), which \n     is permitted to ``take all necessary measures'' to protect \n     refugees, civilians, and aid workers in eastern Chad and \n     northern Central African Republic;\n       Whereas, despite the explicit support of President Deby, \n     deployment of both the 3,700 EUFOR troops and the 350 \n     MINURCAT officers has been hampered by political and security \n     delays as well as insufficient resources; and\n       Whereas continuing hostilities will undermine efforts to \n     bring security to Sudan's Darfur region, dangerously \n     destabilize volatile political and humanitarian situations in \n     Chad and the Central African Republic, and potentially \n     disrupt progress towards peace in southern Sudan: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses the concern and compassion of the citizens of \n     the United States for the hundreds of thousands of citizens \n     of Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic who have \n     been gravely affected by this interrelated violence and \n     instability;\n       (2) calls upon all parties to these conflicts to cease \n     hostilities immediately and uphold basic human rights;\n       (3) urges the governments of Chad and Sudan, with support \n     from other key regional and international stakeholders, \n     including France, Libya, and China, to commit to another \n     round of inclusive negotiations towards a sustainable \n     political solution for national and regional stability \n     facilitated and monitored by impartial third-party \n     leadership;\n       (4) calls upon the governments of Chad and Sudan to \n     reaffirm their commitment to the Tripoli Declaration of \n     February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena Agreement of July 26, \n     2006, refrain from any actions that violate these agreements, \n     and cease all logistical, financial, and military support to \n     insurgent groups;\n       (5) urges the Government of Chad to increase political \n     participation, strengthen democratic institutions, respect \n     human rights, improve accountability and transparency as well \n     as the provision of basic services, and uphold its commitment \n     to protect its own citizens in order to redeem the legitimacy \n     of the Government in the eyes of its citizens and the \n     international community;\n       (6) calls for diplomatic and material support from the \n     United States and the international community to facilitate, \n     implement, and monitor a comprehensive peace process that \n     includes an inclusive dialogue with all relevant stakeholders \n     to end violence, demobilize militias, and promote return and \n     reconstruction for internally displaced persons and refugees;
