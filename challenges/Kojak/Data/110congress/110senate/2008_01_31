Mr. President, for the education of all Senators, we just \ncompleted a caucus, and the two issues before us are FISA, the Foreign \nIntelligence Act, of course--and I am disappointed that we don't have \nsomething we can sign off on for that, but we are very close. I have \ntold the minority leader that for more than 24 hours, that we are very \nclose, and I do think we are. If things go as I think they will--\nSenator Bond and Senator Rockefeller have worked very hard--I think we \ncan complete it in 1 day--a long day, maybe a 10- or 12-hour day, but I \nthink we can do that.\n  Regarding the stimulus package, I have briefly explained to the \nRepublican leader where I think we need to go. He needs to consult with \nhis leadership and staff to determine how we get to where we both think \nthis will wind up, but that decision will be made fairly quickly.\n  I do say that I think it is going to take me--as my colleagues know, \nall last year I had four Democratic Senators running for President. I \nwish\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\nthey could all have been elected President, but only one can be, so two \nof them are out of that race now. I still have two Democratic Senators \ninvolved. As my colleagues know, next Tuesday is Super Tuesday, and \nthey are both very busy, as is Senator McCain. So I probably can't get \nthem back here until Monday, but I do need them back. So the Republican \nleader understands that, and we will try to work something out today to \ngive us a pathway to complete this stimulus package and FISA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S506-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S506-S507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NFL PLAYERS CARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when my children were growing up, we had a \nrule that they accepted--they don't seem to complain now--where we \ndidn't watch television on Sunday. It was just kind of a rule we put \ndown. The television was on all the other times, but on Sunday we \ndidn't watch TV, except on Super Bowl Sunday.\n  This coming Sunday is the 42nd Super Bowl. It is going to be in \nPhoenix, AZ. Now, whether this game is a nail-biter or a blowout, we \nwill long remember the heroics of this game, whatever they might be. It \nmight be a goal line stand. It won't be in subzero weather; it is in \nPhoenix. It may be a fourth-down Hail Mary pass that saves the day or \nit may be the player who suffers an injury in the first quarter but is \nable to limp back on the field and play through the pain and who will \nthen be known as the man who led his team to victory even though he was \ninjured. These heroes will, all of them, soak up the cheers of an \nadoring nation on Sunday.\n  But there are hundreds and hundreds of former National Football \nLeague players who no longer hear those cheers. Instead, they suffer \ngreat pain as a result of lifelong injuries from their days on the \nfield. These are the stars of yore, the stars of the past.\n  Two people from Nevada whom I know are people who were injured \nplaying professional football. These men draw pensions as a result of \ntheir injuries because they were modern-day football players. Henry \nRolling--an outstanding athlete--went to my high school, basic high \nschool, came out of high school 175 pounds, wound up being a 4-year \nAll-American, University of Nevada, Reno, played in the pros for 9 or \n10 years, and was injured. He has the benefit of all of the good things \nthat come about from being a National Football League player.\n  Some of the players are legends. To me, Henry Rolling is a legend. \nSome are wealthy. Henry Rolling is a rich man now. He lives \ncomfortably. But many others never hoisted a trophy or earned a spot in \nour memories. Many were faceless figures behind helmets, lost to \nhistory but for these yellowed photographs they show to their families, \nand maybe even some dusty highlight reels. They helped build a league \nbut never earned much from their on-the-field heroics. Often, they \nworked second jobs in the off season. So, far from basking in the kind \nof wealth we associate with the athletes of today, many are now \nstruggling just to pay their bills and make ends meet for their \nfamilies. But when they came to the National Football League's \nretirement plan to claim their disability benefits, they were told go \nsomeplace else: Go to our State and see what they have for you. The \nNational Football League can't help. As wealthy as they are, they have \nturned these players away. The league to which they gave their hearts, \nsouls, and bodies has not stood by their side.\n  In September, one of these former players who lives in Reno, NV, \nBrent Boyd, stopped in my office to visit with me to tell me about his \nstruggles, which are the struggles of many former football players. He \nis a huge man, and he is not fat. When he played, he was 6 foot 3 and \nweighed 270 pounds. You couldn't see Brent without thinking: That guy \nmust be a football player. He played football at UCLA and was drafted \nby the Minnesota Vikings.\n  Now, what do we know about the Minnesota Vikings? During his tenure \nthere, they played football on AstroTurf. Brent explained to me it \nwould be like playing a football game on cement covered with a rug. \nEvery time he hit the pavement, he was hurt. That is the way it was \nwith many of those players. He was an offensive lineman. During a \npreseason game in 1980, Brent remembers only waking up after being hit \nvery hard. He had a terrible headache. He couldn't see out of one eye. \nHis coach asked his rookie lineman whether he could see out of the \nother eye. He said yes.\n  He said go back into the game, so he went back in and he was blind in \none eye. Brent did what was expected of him; played through his injury, \nas he played through many injuries. That was the culture of the sport \nand the NFL. That was one of countless hard hits Brent took during his \nplaying days.\n  He told me:\n\n       How would you like playing football on cement? That's what \n     we did.\n\n  That was what the old artificial playing surface was like. Every hit, \nwhen he went down and hit his head, even though he had a helmet on, he \ncould feel it.\n  It wasn't until years later his doctors began to connect the dots and \ndiscovered his chronic dizziness, fatigue, depression, and headaches \nwere a result of head injuries as a result of hit after hit that he \ntook during his 6-year career.\n  I have talked about Henry Rolling, one of my Nevada heroes. I went to \nhigh school with a man by the name of Rupert Sendlein. He was a big \nman. He had a son who went to the University of Texas. He was an All-\nAmerican, and he played professional football for 8 years. At the \nbeginning of his ninth year, he went to his doctors and they examined \nhim. They said: Robin, you can't play football anymore. You have had so \nmany concussions that you have to stop.\n  Well, Brent didn't have the ability to go to a doctor when he wanted. \nRobin Sendlein now is retired in Phoenix Arizona making a lot of money. \nHis son now is the starting center at the University of Texas. Robin \nSendlein had the benefit Brent Boyd didn't have.\n  Brent is unable to hold down a steady job. He doesn't think right. He \nwent to the NFL retirement plan for help, but he was granted $1,550 a \nmonth in disability payments--far below the $8,200 promised to ex-\nplayers whose injuries resulted from football.\n  Brent told me of the struggle that ensued, many doctor visits, \ndelays, denies, and financial troubles.\n  We all know football is a terribly dangerous sport. For those who \nearn millions, perhaps it is fair to say the reward is worth the risk. \nBut Brent played in a different time. He never signed a big contract, \nnever earned a shoe endorsement deal, never appeared in commercials.\n  Now he struggles to pay his bills. He struggles to pay his rent. Is \nBrent's story an exception? No.\n  Two football greats--Mike Ditka and Jerry Kramer--people whom those \nof us my age, and probably all ages, are familiar with. Mike Ditka and \nJerry Kramer were gridiron greats. They helped create the fund to help \nretired players. They discovered heartbreaking stories from retired \nstars, including Willie Wood, a Hall of Fame safety. Willie Wood--I \nknow about him because I was in high school with Bobby Peck. He was an \nathlete but not very tall. He was All-State in football, baseball, and \nbasketball. He went to a junior college called Coalinga Junior College \nin California, which prepared people to go to USC and other great \nschools. I was stunned. Bobby Peck was not the starting quarterback. He \nwas beaten out by a man by the name of Willie Wood. Athletically, Bobby \nhad never been beaten out by anybody in anything. So he, the next year, \nwent to Dixie Junior College in St. George, UT, where he became all-\nconference, and then he went to the University of Nevada. He was in a \ndifferent league than Willie Wood, who went on to play quarterback at \nthe University of Southern California.\n  As good as he was, Willie Wood figured he was good enough to play in \nthe NFL. He tried out for the Green Bay Packers. Vince Lombardi said: \nOK, you can try out. Willie Wood became probably the greatest safety in \nthe history of the National Football League. He has had many injuries. \nHe weighed 175 pounds.\n  Others are Wilber Marshall, a three-time Pro Bowl linebacker; Conrad \nDobler, a three-time Pro Bowl lineman; and Herb Adderley, an All-Big \nTen star at Michigan State and star cornerback for the Green Bay \nPackers and Dallas Cowboys.\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\n  These are gridiron greats who also came upon many lesser known \nplayers with stories like Brent's. Mike Moseley, of the Buffalo Bills, \nsuffered knee, neck, and back injuries that forced him to retire early \nand left him permanently disabled.\n  Initially, the NFL disability committee granted him benefits. In \nSeptember 2004, a doctor hired by the NFL ruled that he could do \nsedentary work, and they cut off his benefits. This reminds me of when \nI started out practicing law. For a few years, I did insurance defense \nwork. We had doctors that insurance companies would bring in and it \ndidn't matter how bad somebody was hurt, they determined they weren't \nhurt very badly. That is what this reminds me of. Mike Moseley lost his \nhome, his car, and his savings. His life has been torn apart.\n  Another example is Brian DeMarco, a lineman for the Jacksonville \nJaguars. Similar to Mike, Brian was forced into an early retirement by \ninjury. He was unable to navigate the disability system's redtape--even \nthough his back was broken in 17 different places. Brian and his family \nwere left homeless. He told the Denver Post that the NFL:\n\n     is a multibillion dollar business, and guys are giving their \n     quality of life up for this sport. Just a little respect and \n     dignity is all we want.\n\n  These stories illustrate a point the statistics confirm. According to \none press report, almost two-thirds of former professional football \nplayers suffer injuries serious enough to require surgery, and almost \nhalf of all players retire due to injury.\n  But among the more than the 1,000 disability claims filed by former \nNFL players, about 30 percent have received approval. The rest are \nthrown in the trash bin, such as my friend from Reno, NV.\n  Brent Boyd was among the former players who testified before the \nCommerce Committee this past September. They told us how they feel \nabandoned and forgotten lost in endless doctor visits and redtape.\n  Daryl Johnson, who played 11 years as running back for the Cowboys, \ntestified that he retired with 5 years remaining on his contract after \nsuffering a herniated disc.\n  The Players' Association sent him for an evaluation with one of their \ndoctors--not his own. He was not permitted to even bring his X rays or \nMRI results. Similar to so many others, his claim was denied.\n  After the hearing last September, and countless news stories, the NFL \nand the Players' Association have taken some steps to right the wrong.\n  Where before their approval process seemed a little more than ad hoc, \nthey now apply standards used by the Social Security Administration to \ndetermine disability. We hope it is more effective.\n  They have also implemented the 88 Plan, which provides funds for a \nresidential care facility or in-home care. The question is, Who are \nthey going to give it to?\n  Brent Boyd, and so many like him, still suffer the pain of their \ninjuries, still struggle to pay their bills on far less disability \nassistance than they deserve. Some suffer the inability to think \nproperly because of the head trauma they suffered.\n  In the coming weeks, I will work with the NFL and the Players' \nAssociation and other retirees to ensure progress is being made.\n  As the bright lights shine on Super Bowl XLII this Sunday--and they \nare a multibillion dollar business, and they should help these people--\nI want Brent and his injured brothers to know they are not fighting in \nthe shadows. They deserve a spotlight also.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S507-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, Americans saw something many \nof them thought they might never see: Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader \nBoehner, and the President working as a team. Republicans and Democrats \nrose above politics and put the people and the economy first. And on \nTuesday, the House passed their compromise stimulus plan by a vote of \n385-35. Then all eyes turned to the Senate: Would we put our individual \ninterests aside, or would we throw the whole plan into jeopardy by \nloading it down with gifts for anybody who came calling?\n   Apparently the temptation for giveaways was too great for some to \nresist. As soon as the bill hit the Senate, it started to look a lot \nlike Christmas over here. Chairman Baucus added 10 new provisions \nbefore the bill was even considered in committee. Three more amendments \nwere added in committee. You could almost hear Bing Crosby's voice \ncoming out of the Finance Committee. And so the stimulus train is \nslowing grinding to a halt here in the U.S. Senate.\n   All of this only reinforces my view that the only way we'll get \nrelief to the people soon enough for it to work will be to insist on \nspeed over spending. And the only way to do that is to pass the \nbipartisan, House-passed bill. That way we can send it to the President \nfor a signature--and get much needed relief into the hands of millions \nof Americans as quickly as they are now expecting it. This is the only \nway to pass an economic growth package that doesn't grow the government \nor raise taxes and that can be signed into law in a timely manner. The \nother option is to bring it to the floor, where we know it will only \ngrow and slow under the weight of endless additional spending \nproposals. We need to act quickly. The majority leader called for a \nbill that is ``timely.'' The House acted quickly. Now it is our turn.\n   We have a choice: We can accept Washington politics as usual and \nspend weeks and weeks arguing over how much more can be added to an \nalready unwieldy bill or we can act right now and deliver a timely \neconomic growth package with bipartisan support that can be signed into \nlaw now. We could get a bill down to the President in thirty seconds if \nwe want to. The White House and the House have done their part. Now \nlet's do our part. Let's vote on the House-passed bill, without any \nfurther delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S507-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S507-S509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING OUT ARMED FORCES\n\n   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to pause for a \nmoment so I may share with them the story of a soldier lost in battle. \nOn January 5, 2007, MAJ Michael L. Mundell of Brandenburg, KY, and his \nunit were sent to secure a combat area in Fallujah, Iraq, after an \nAmerican tank reported being struck by an improvised explosive device.\n  En route to the scene, a second explosive device went off near Major \nMundell's vehicle, tragically taking his life. He was 47 years old.\n   Major Mundell served in the U.S. Army for over a decade before \nleaving active service to work as a civilian contractor to the armed \nforces. In November of 2005 he again volunteered for active duty. His \nwife Audrey tells us that Mike once told a friend ``he was going over \nthere to fight them so they couldn't come over here and hurt his \nchildren.''\n  For his bravery in service, Major Mundell received numerous medals \nand awards, including two Meritorious Service Medals, the Bronze Star \nMedal and the Purple Heart.\n  Mr. President, Major Mundell was one of those who may have been born \nin one of the other 49 States but became Kentuckian by choice. Born in \nPittsburgh, he grew up in Canonsburg, PA.\n  As a child, Mike developed a passion for military service. He wanted \nto grow up and drive tanks. When he was three, he handed his father an \nencyclopedia and asked him to read it to him.\n  His family says this began his lifelong love of reading. As an adult, \nhe enjoyed Civil War history, and would often read more than a book a \nday. He also enjoyed mysteries and thrillers, and read through the \nBible three times.\n   In 1977, Mike graduated from Canon-McMillan High School, home of the \nBig Macs. His wife Audrey liked to tease him that his high-school \nmascot was named after a hamburger, but Mike made his school proud on \nthe football field.\n\n  Mike went on to graduate from Washington-Jefferson College in 1981 \nwhere he majored in history, participated in ROTC and played soccer.\n  After graduation, Mike realized his lifelong goal of becoming an Army \nofficer when he received his commission as a second lieutenant. \nAssigned to Fort\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\nKnox, KY, for officer's basic training, Mike became a Kentuckian--that \nis, when he was not spending 3 years in Germany working as a tank \nofficer.\n  In 1984, while stationed at Fort Knox, Mike met Audrey, a student at \nElizabethtown Community College, through a mutual friend. He was \nattracted to her red hair; she liked that he was handsome and \nintelligent. They were married in 1985 and had four children: daughter \nErica and sons Ryan, Zach, and Dale. Mike had a special relationship \nwith all of his children and made each one feel as if he or she was his \nfavorite.\n  Mike raised his family in Brandenburg and was a devoted fan of the \nPittsburgh Steelers. He liked to watch historical documentaries, and \nhis favorite movies were the war films ``Glory'' and ``Patton.'' As a \nsoldier, ``strategy and tactics--that was his thing, and he was \nextremely good at it,'' says Audrey. ``He was so intelligent.''\n  After over 11 years of service, Mike left active duty in 1992 and \nwent on to become a private contractor to the Armed Forces working at \nFort Knox. Then in November 2005, he volunteered to again don the \nuniform.\n  ``Mike was offered the chance to go to Iraq and do administrative \nwork, but he said he would refuse to go if they were going to simply \nstick him behind a desk,'' said Audrey.\n  Assigned to the 1st Brigade, 108th Division, based out of \nSpartanburg, SC, Major Mundell was tasked with training the Iraqi Army. \nHis tour of duty started on Father's Day of 2006.\n  Mike wrote e-mails often to his friends and family, sometimes \nexhibiting his robust sense of humor. In an e-mail dated June 23, 2006, \nhe tried to describe the Kuwaiti heat.\n  This is what he said: ``Turn on a blow dryer, point it at yourself \nand stand there,'' he wrote. ``And stand there. And stand there. Throw \nsome dust from the vacuum in the air every once in a while. Voila! You \nare experiencing Kuwait.''\n  Other e-mails described tenser times. Take the one he wrote on July \n24, 2006, about one of the first times he found himself under fire. \n``All of the sudden . . . BOOM! . . . our radios were filled with \nshouts of `incoming!' '' he wrote. ``We took three mortars in close.''\n  Later in that same e-mail, however, Major Mundell made clear that \ndespite the danger, he was committed to his duty. He wrote:\n\n       This is the most intense, most REAL thing I have ever done \n     in my life.\n\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Major Mundell's loved ones today, \nincluding his wife, Audrey; his daughter, Erica; his sons Ryan, Zach \nand Dale; his sister and brother-in-law, Deanna and Ken Sofranko; his \nnephew, Kenny Sofranko; his niece, Taylor Sofranko; his grandmother-in-\nlaw, Jesse Edge; his mother-in-law, Carolyn Cundiff; his brother-in-\nlaw, Steve Cundiff; his sisters-in-law Angie Allen and Sandi Stout; and \nmany other beloved family members and friends.\n  Major Mundell's funeral service was held January 14, 2007, at the \nchapel in Fort Knox. The funeral procession was a mile and a half long, \nand the Mundell family was overwhelmed at the outpouring of support \nfrom the community for their lost husband, father, brother, and friend.\n  Recalling a conversation with her youngest child, Audrey tells us \nwhat his son Dale said upon seeing the crowds. ``Dale asked me, `All of \nthis for my dad?' '' Audrey says. ``And I told him, `Yes, all of this \nfor your dad.' ''\n  Mr. President, like the hundreds in Fort Knox that day, this Senate \nwishes to express its deepest gratitude to MAJ Michael L. Mundell for \nhis service. This man, who his wife Audrey describes as ``a soldier \nthrough and through,'' gave everything he had to protect his family and \nhis country. Our Nation will forever honor that sacrifice.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant John E. Cooper\n\n  Mr. President, I wish today to pause in memory of a fallen soldier, \nSSG John E. Cooper of Flemingsburg, KY. Staff Sergeant Cooper was lost \non January 15, 2007, in Mosul, Iraq, when an improvised explosive \ndevice set by terrorists went off near his humvee. He was 29 years old.\n  This was Staff Sergeant Cooper's second tour of duty in Iraq. For his \nbravery in uniform, he received numerous medals and awards, including \nthe Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, the Combat \nInfantryman Badge, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n  Staff Sergeant Cooper, an Army veteran of over a decade, knew from an \nearly age that he wanted to dedicate himself to serving his country. \n``He wanted to be a soldier from the third grade on,'' says his mother, \nJanice Botkin. ``And he was strong enough to pursue his dream of being \nin the military.''\n  As a child, John had many interests. In middle school, he became \nfascinated with Native American culture and found it to be a part of \nhis own family. ``He learned about the Trail of Tears and this sparked \nhis interest in Native Americans,'' says his mother Janice, who is \nherself of Native American heritage. John later went to several family \nreunions at Serpent Mound, a Native American site in Adams County, OH.\n  In high school, John was active in Future Farmers of America and the \ndrama club. He enjoyed being outdoors. The youngest of four children, \nhe loved to spend time with his brother Terrance and his sisters Sherri \nand Susie.\n  Because he was the youngest, John got teased a lot, but as the baby \nof the family, his siblings also spoiled him quite a bit. For instance, \nevery year the Cooper family would travel to Kings Island, an amusement \npark in nearby Cincinnati.\n  John graduated from Fleming County High School in 1995, and that \nSeptember at age 18, fulfilled his childhood aspirations by enlisting \nin the Army.\n  ``I remember that he would go running along the country roads to \nbuild himself and be ready to pass his physical training when he went \ninto basic,'' says his sister Sherri Springate. ``We're all so proud of \nhim.''\n  As a soldier, he could ``go places and do things he wouldn't be able \nto do if he stayed around here,'' says his mother Janice.\n  A skilled marksman, John served in the Army for 11 years and \ndedicated himself to making it a career. ``He really liked being a \nmilitary person,'' says Janice.\n  Over those 11 years, Staff Sergeant Cooper was deployed to \nAfghanistan, Korea and the Sinai Peninsula. He had his first tour of \nduty in Iraq and went to London.\n  By the time of his second deployment to Iraq, he was assigned to the \n2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st \nCavalry Division based out of Fort Bliss, TX. John enhanced his \nleadership skills by attending the Primary Leadership Development \nCourse and Air Assault School.\n  Staff Sergeant Cooper's family is in my thoughts and prayers now as I \nshare his story with the Senate. He will be forever loved and \nremembered by his mother, Janice Botkin; his father, Michael Cooper; \nhis stepfather, Roger Botkin; his sisters, Sherri Springate and Susie \nWest; his stepbrothers Roger Botkin, Jr., and Robert McMillan; his \nstepsisters Bonita Botkin and Sherry Hilterbrandt; his aunt, Teresa \nGates; his grandparents James and Lillian Burke; and many other friends \nand family members.\n  On January 28 of last year, Staff Sergeant Cooper's family held a \nmemorial service for John at his alma mater, Fleming County High \nSchool. People came from as far away as Indiana, Ohio, and West \nVirginia to pay their respects to this fallen infantryman, and they \nlined the entrance to the school with American flags in hand.\n  The example John set for the other soldiers was so remarkable that \nwhen the ``History Channel'' joined his unit to capture documentary \nfootage, they selected John's story to follow out of 4,000 men and \nwomen. ``They were impressed with his leadership qualities and caring \nfor the men that served under him,'' says his mother Janice.\n  The ``History Channel'' is still working on the documentary, but they \nscreened some of its footage at a memorial service for Staff Sergeant \nCooper in Texas. I am glad they recognized and were able to capture on \nfilm the character and abilities of the soldier called ``Coop'' by his \nArmy buddies.\n  I am sure John's family feels the same way. They and everyone who was \nlucky enough to know John already realize he was a true hero who was \ndedicated to his country. Now his heroism\n\n[[Page S509]]\n\nhas been documented and preserved for all to see.\n  ``We're very proud of John, what he did, and who he was,'' says \nJohn's mother.\n  I want her to know that this Senate expresses its deepest gratitude \nfor SSG John E. Cooper's life of service. And we express our deepest \ngratitude for the Cooper family, for raising a soldier and patriot who \nanswered the call in his country's time of need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S509-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a few minutes ago, the minority leader \nurged the Senate to simply pass the House stimulus bill with no \namendments, saying it will be a Christmas tree, so pass it with no \namendments.\n  I don't think the Senate wants to deprive 20 million American seniors \nof a rebate check. I don't think the Senate wants to deprive a quarter \nof a million disabled veterans of a rebate check. That is what would \nhappen if we were to follow the advice of the minority leader. He would \ndeprive 20 million American senior citizens from getting a rebate check \nunder the stimulus plan. He would deprive a quarter of a million \ndisabled vets from receiving a rebate check under the plan. I don't \nthink the Senate wants to do that.\n  I think the Senate wants to make some very modest changes to the \nHouse-passed bill, if 20 million seniors is modest. We can argue if it \nis modest. I think it is very important. I think the American public \nwould very much prefer that the Senate make some modest changes to the \nHouse-passed bill so those stimulus checks can be sent out very \nquickly.\n  We on this side do want speedy passage of the stimulus package. The \nmajority leader has indicated we will take this up on Monday, a few \ndays from today. My hope and expectation is that it will be passed on \nMonday. Remember, not too long ago, the President and the leadership in \nWashington, DC, were saying: Gee, let's get those stimulus checks out \nby February 15. This is January 31. We can get this done very quickly, \nin a matter of several days, maybe sometime near the end of next week, \nwell before February 15.\n  We want to move quickly. We want to not load up the stimulus package. \nLoading it up too much will cause delays, but we on this side of the \naisle strongly believe that 20 million seniors should get rebate checks \nand a quarter of a million veterans get rebate checks. They will not \nget those checks under the House-passed bill. That is why I do not \nthink we should willy-nilly accept the House bill which will deprive 20 \nmillion seniors and a quarter million disabled veterans of those rebate \nchecks.\n  They came of age in the Great Depression and during World War II. Of \nthem, Tom Brokaw wrote:\n\n       At the end of the twentieth century, the contributions of \n     this generation would be in bold print . . . it is a \n     generation that, by and large, made no demands of homage \n     from those who followed and prospered . . . because of its \n     sacrifices. It is a generation of towering achievement and \n     modest demeanor, a legacy of their formative years, when \n     they were participants and witness to sacrifices of the \n     highest order.\n\n  That is what Tom Brokaw wrote in his book ``The Greatest \nGeneration.'' The men and women of that generation and the one that \nfollowed are now America's seniors. These are the seniors the Finance \nCommittee is fighting for and trying to help with the economic stimulus \nbill reported yesterday.\n  America's seniors are acquainted with sacrifice. As Brokaw wrote:\n\n       They know how many of the best of their generation didn't \n     make it to their early twenties, how many brilliant \n     scientists, teachers, spiritual and business leaders, \n     politicians and artists were lost in the ravages of the \n     greatest war the world has seen.\n\n  They fought for their country, our American seniors. They gave a \nlifetime of labor, they gave a lifetime of service, they paid a \nlifetime of taxes, and they contribute to the economy today. But 20 \nmillion of these seniors would not get a check in the House-passed \nstimulus bill. Twenty million American seniors would get a check in the \nFinance Committee substitute.\n  These 20 million seniors would be left out of the House-passed tax \nrebate. Why? Because they do not have at least $3,000 in earned income, \nas in wages, or enough taxable income to meet the test set up by the \nHouse bill. In contrast, the Finance Committee plan would allow almost \nall seniors to receive at least $500. They would have to show they \nreceived at least $3,000 in Social Security income on their 2007 tax \nreturn.\n  Many American seniors live on fixed incomes. Some earn some wages, \nsome make some money, but many American seniors live only on fixed \nincomes--their Social Security benefits. Many struggle to pay their \nmedical bills. Many struggle to pay their heating bills, especially as \nenergy costs are going up so high. Drug prices are going up too. \nSeniors deserve to be included in any rebate program.\n  When we are contemplating distributing stimulus checks broadly across \nmost American families, it would be wrong not to include 20 million \nseniors of the greatest generation. A rebate to seniors works for \nAmerica's economy too. It is not just the right thing to do, but it \nworks for our economy and here is why. Economists agree consumer \nspending fueled by tax rebates can boost America's economy, and \nAmericans over age 65 are responsible for 14 percent of all consumer \nspending. Let me repeat that. Americans over age 65 are responsible for \n14 percent of all consumer spending.\n  Look at this chart to my right. It indicates something very simple, \nvery basic, and very important--and not simply from an economic \nstandpoint but also doing what is morally right for our seniors as well \nas from an economic perspective. Americans over age 65 spend 92 percent \nof their income in any given year. That is represented by this \nhorizontal bar on the top in the blue. I will say it again. Americans \nover age 65--that is what this line represents--spend almost all their \nincome in any given year. They spend 92 percent of their income in any \ngiven year.\n  Now, contrast that with a household headed by a person a little \nolder, over age 75. They spend an even higher percentage of their \nincome--98 percent. That is higher than any other demographic group \nover the age of 25. Seniors spend the money they receive; much more \nthan any other demographic group over the age of 25.\n  Other Social Security recipients can benefit too. In 2006, 18 million \nAmericans received Social Security disability benefits, or survivor \nbenefits. Widows, widowers, and disabled veterans--disabled Americans--\ncan qualify for an equal tax rebate, too, under the Finance Committee \nplan. Millions of them would get nothing under the House plan.\n  The Finance Committee bill also provides benefits to another group of \nAmericans who have sacrificed for their country: disabled veterans. \nOnce again, the House left them out. The House said no to a quarter of \na million disabled veterans. They said no rebate checks if you are a \ndisabled vet and if you don't have significant earned income. Under the \nHouse bill, more than a quarter million disabled vets would receive no \nrebate. Why? Because they have no obligation to file a tax return.\n  The Finance Committee bill would provide rebate checks for these \nquarter of a million disabled veterans. The Finance Committee bill \nwould get rebates to disabled veterans receiving at least $3,000 in \nnontaxable disability compensation. That is it. The House forgot about \nthat. They forgot about a quarter of a million disabled vets. The \nSenate plan makes them eligible to earn the same $500 rebate as wage \nearners and Social Security recipients--the same. The Department of \nVeterans Affairs would distribute the rebate.\n  My colleagues know America is once again at war. Many of my \ncolleagues have visited with wounded soldiers who have come home from \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, my colleague from Kentucky a few \nminutes ago made a very moving tribute to several fallen soldiers from \nhis State of Kentucky. Many of my colleagues have, as\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\nI have, gone to Walter Reed and visited with their wounded warriors. \nMore than 21,000 service men and service women have now been wounded in \nIraq and Afghanistan--21,000.\n  Now, thank God, not all of them will become disabled veterans, but \nmany will. No one can question their sacrifice, no one can question \ntheir contribution, and no one can question that they have earned the \nright to participate in this rebate program every bit as much as any \nother American. So let us honor the Americans who came of age in the \nGreat Depression and during World War II. Let us honor the Americans \nwho have fought for our country in its wars only to come home disabled. \nAnd let us ensure that these greatest Americans receive their fair \nshare of any economic stimulus.\n  That is what is at stake. That is why the Senate should not \nrubberstamp the House-passed bill. That is why the Senate should pass \nthe Finance Committee's stimulus bill. To do anything less would be to \nshortchange millions of seniors and veterans who have earned the right \nto be called the greatest Americans.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today is January 31. It is signifying the \nend to many things: the end of the month, maybe we will begin to see a \nlittle bit of spring down the road, but it is also the end of an \namazing career of someone we all know and love, and that is Marty \nPaone.\n  Marty Paone has worked for 32 years on the Hill, 28 years on the \nSenate floor. He started in the House Post Office before working in \nSenate parking. He joined the cloakroom in 1979 and was appointed \nDemocratic Secretary in 1995 by Senator Daschle. He worked under four \nDemocratic leaders: Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, Senator Daschle, \nand Senator Reid. I think every one of them would agree with the word \nthat I would use to describe Marty Paone--``indispensable.''\n  We do not know what we are going to do without Marty here. He has \nbeen such an amazing presence, so knowledgeable; not only about the \nrules of the floor but just about how this body works. I know Senator \nReid relied on him for just about every kind of advice. Again, his \nadvice was indispensable.\n  I am particularly appreciative of his kindness to me when I was a new \nSenator, teaching me the way the place worked, helping me realize when \nthere would be votes so I could time my schedule. As most of you know, \nI like to be busy, but I hate to miss votes, as everybody else. And he \nwas just the most knowledgeable, decent, kind, indispensable person \naround here.\n  Now Marty is leaving. We really are going to miss him. We are going \nto miss his dedication to this institution. I think if you made a list \nof the people most dedicated to the Senate, Marty Paone would be in the \ntop 10 or 20 in all our history.\n  We are going to miss his ever-present--he hovered in the background \nquietly--omniscience, always knowing what was going on, and always \nbeing there to help. We are going to miss Marty just as a person who, \nin his quiet, droll way, is actually a very funny guy.\n  I want to wish Marty the best. I think I speak on behalf of 100 \nSenators and everyone who served previously. I thank his wife Ruby for \nputting up with the long hours. I know because I would call Marty at \nhome on weekends much of the time asking him for advice or when there \nmight be a vote or this or that. His three kids, Alex, Stephanie, and \nTommy--Stephanie is at William & Mary, Alex goes to VCU, and Tommy is \nstill in high school. And a particular hello, because I have heard she \nis watching, to Marty's mother Evelyn Paone.\n  Mrs. Paone, God gave you 95 years, and let's hope he gives you many \nmore. I know you are so proud of Marty, maybe even a little prouder \nthan we all are.\n  Marty, we will miss you, we thank you, we love you. Good luck, \nGodspeed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I rise today with a truly heavy heart. At \nArlington Cemetery, on January 17, 2008, I attended the funeral \nservices of my friend, COL D'Arcy Grisier. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith his wife beloved Roberta, or, as we call her, Bert, and their \nthree children Sean, Kelly, and Darcy.\n  D, as he was called by his friends, was a caring father, loving \nhusband, and a member of my extended family. A patriot in every sense \nof the word, D spent 26 years serving this Nation in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. Upon retiring from the Corps in 2003, D decided to continue \nserving this country in a different capacity.\n  From 2003 until September of this past year, Colonel D was my \nmilitary legislative assistant. In this capacity D advised me on all \nnational security matters, all the while reminding me that once a \nMarine always a Marine and that the ``M'' in Marine is always \ncapitalized.\n  Those of us who were friends with D will remember him more for who he \nwas than the lifetime of service he gave to this country. My staff and \nI will miss D always knowing exactly what the Redskins were doing \nwrong.\n  We will miss him always saying ``keep your seats'' whenever he \nentered a room. We will miss him constantly singing Jimmy Buffet songs \nout loud, and losing at least two sleeves of golf balls every time he \nplayed. We will miss his laughter and his camaraderie. Most of all, we \nwill miss his friendship.\n  Mr. President, if D Grisier knew that I was making this statement \nabout him, he would probably be upset. That was the type of individual \nhe was.\n  While he would not have wanted this attention, Americans deserve to \nknow D's story and the caliber of person who spent a lifetime serving \nthem.\n  This past summer at our annual staff retreat Colonel D announced that \nhe would be leaving the office to go and work in the Pentagon as the \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense for Budget and Appropriations. This \nwas bittersweet for many of us.\n  We were thrilled for D, of course, but sad to see him go. \nUnfortunately, he was never able to report to work for his new job, a \nchallenging position that he looked forward to starting.\n  During his tenure on Capitol Hill he had many accomplishments, which \nD referred to as ``doing the people's business.''\n  These accomplishments included advising me in my role as chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management \nSupport.\n  In this capacity, he drafted legislation and amendments, wrote \nnumerous floor statements, staffed me in high level meetings, advised \nme on billion-dollar spending bills, and, on occasion, voted my proxy, \nor what D would refer to his role as, the ``extremely junior Senator \nfrom Nevada.''\n  He spent a great deal of time in Nevada at our military bases and \nmeeting with veterans. D also took great care in helping the families \nof our State's fallen heroes. He moved mountains in order to relieve \nsome of the stress and anxiety they face at such difficult times.\n  After D announced to the office that he would be leaving for the \nPentagon he told a short story. I believe this story reflects the type \nof individual that he truly was.\n  D told us that the professional accomplishment he was most proud of \nwas bringing a Junior ROTC program to Douglas High School.\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\n  The fact that D took pride in accomplishing those less glamorous \ntasks that directly impacted the lives of Nevadans is what made him the \nman he was, and made him the man all of us admired.\n  President Ronald Reagan once said that ``Some individuals go through \nlife wondering whether or not they've made a difference. Marines don't \nhave that problem.''\n  Mr. President, I am here to tell my colleagues that this could not be \nany truer than in the case of COL D'Arcy Grisier.\n  America is a stronger Nation because of the lifetime of public \nservice that Colonel D gave.\n  I will truly miss my friend.\n  His last saying that all of us used to kind of get a chuckle out of, \nwhen he was tired of talking, he used to say: ``My, my, look at the \ntime.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S511-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S511-S518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, yesterday the Finance Committee went to \nwork. We marked up a stimulus package after the House had done their \npackage on Tuesday, I believe. They sent a package to us because, quite \nfrankly, as we look out across this great Nation, we understand that \nour economy needs a jolt. It needs a quick jolt. It needs something for \nhard-working Americans to participate in bringing this country back on \nline and getting our economy going and moving forward. That is exactly \nwhat we did in the Finance Committee. We took the bill the House had \nquickly done. They moved quickly with the administration to put \nsomething out there. That was a good thing to do, get us started and \nget us moving in the Congress. But, unfortunately, as we looked at that \npackage they sent us, there were some very hard-working Americans, some \njustifiable Americans who needed to be a part of stimulating this \neconomy who had been left out.\n  So what we did in the Finance Committee was to try to make some \nimprovements in a timely way to the package the House had already \nproduced and to get it over here so we could get to work on it here on \nthe floor of the Senate and move it forward so that the people of this \ncountry could again reinvigorate themselves and their economies and get \nback to work. Our plan included two very key groups the House had left \nout. Those two groups are our seniors and disabled veterans.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, like myself and many others, has a \ntremendous respect for the seniors of this Nation. These are the \nindividuals who have built this country. They have labored hard. They \nhave given their all. The fact that their Social Security income does \nnot count as income on their tax returns is no reason to leave them out \nof this equation. The other group is our disabled veterans. I know my \ncolleagues can realize the importance of this group. These are \ncourageous Americans who have fought, given to this country in order \nthat we can live in this great land and enjoy the freedoms we do. There \nis no reason we should leave these two groups out in stimulating the \neconomy.\n  At least 20 million seniors depend primarily on Social Security \nincome for their retirement. These are individuals who are out there in \ntheir communities. They are working hard still to be an active part of \nthe community. But more importantly, they are also those who need it \nthe most. They are the ones who are deciding between whether they are \ngoing to purchase their prescription drugs, whether they are going to \nbuy food, whether they are going to pay the utility bill, and whether \nthey will be able to do that small something special for a grandchild \nor a neighbor. Those are the kinds of people they are.\n  I did a call-in show yesterday. There was the most delightful man, an \nelderly gentleman--I believe he was from South Carolina--who called in \nto the program.\n  He said: I am one of those seniors. I don't want to be forgotten. I \nwant to be a part of stimulating this economy. I really need it. I am \nappreciative that you didn't forget our wounded warriors, our disabled \nveterans, those who have given of themselves that this country could be \nfree and respected. But I have to tell you, if you leave us out, it \nwill be OK because I still believe in this country, and I still believe \nin those who do need it, those folks who are working hard to take care \nof their families.\n  That is just the kind of person we need to help, somebody who has \nthat kind of compassion, somebody who respects the fact that they need \nit, but they are going to continue to give back in whatever possible \nway they can.\n  There is no excuse for us not bringing up this Senate Finance \nCommittee package and passing it, leaving those two groups of \nindividuals out in this great opportunity to revitalize our economy, \nput faith back in the American people that we are going to act quickly, \nthat we are going to target these resources to places where we know \nthey will get back into the economy.\n  If you look at the facts from the AARP, older Americans spend about \n92 percent of their income--a greater proportionate share than all \nother adults. They are going to spend those resources on putting it \nback into the economy. Food, for instance--more than 85 percent of the \nfood we consume in this country is produced or processed in this \ncountry. Those are American jobs they are going to be supporting. It is \nan economy that supports us all which they will be supporting. It is \ncritical that we make sure these two groups are not left out, and we \ndid that in the Finance Committee. Those were two of our priorities.\n  I was so proud to join with my colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe of \nMaine, to offer the amendment for our wounded warriors. I was so proud \nof Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for working with us to make that \nhappen, realizing a group had been left out that was essential and that \nshould not lose the opportunity nor the belief we have in them that \nthey are an integral part of this American fabric. They are the very \nreason we enjoy and maintain the freedoms we have.\n  Our disabled veterans are such an incredibly important group. We know \nthere are approximately 3.2 million veterans who receive disability \nincome from the Veterans' Administration who will be eligible for \nrebates under the Finance Committee plan; 3.2 million of them receive \ndisability income they cannot count as income on their tax returns. We \ndon't know that all 3.2 million will qualify, but we do know that, at \nthe least, a quarter of a million of them will. We know for a fact that \na quarter of a million of them will qualify for that rebate. It is \ncertainly more than that that is possible. But the point is not how \nmany of them qualify. The point is that we would attempt to leave out \nany of them in terms of being able to participate in this economic \nstimulus.\n\n  These Americans--our wounded warriors, our disabled veterans, just \nlike our seniors and just like hard-working American families--are \ngoing to spend their rebate checks on a variety of needs. They are \neither going to be spending it on food or a new pair of shoes. They are \ngoing to be taking care of their needs, maybe pumping money back into \nthe economy in a multitude of ways.\n  The Senate plan is a good plan. It is good for Americans. It is good \nfor seniors. It is good for disabled veterans. It is good for our \neconomy. We have worked in the committee in a timely way. We have \ntargeted these dollars. We have kept a rein on the amount of money we \nare spending, having been advised by all kinds of economists, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, former Secretaries of the Treasury, who said \nto us: Do not make the plan too big. Keep it limited.\n  That is exactly what we did. But we did take the opportunity to not \nforget two very valuable parts of the American fabric and the American \nfamily; that is, our seniors and our disabled veterans.\n  If we take up this Finance Committee package and pass it quickly and \nget it to the President, then we will have achieved the goal of \nstimulating our economy and not leaving out any Americans who could be \nsuch a vital part in helping us do that.\n  So I encourage all of my colleagues, let's don't sit here and \nsquabble over a whole lot of things. Let's move quickly, taking what \nthe House has done, making the improvements we have\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\nmade, and move forward, get this done. Then we have an even greater \nopportunity to start in on the work that is the business of the U.S. \nCongress; that is, to make sure the investment we have made in these \npeople and in this great stimulus package is not lost or squandered \nbecause we are going to follow it up with a multitude of other things \nthat are on our plate that can continue to stimulate the economy.\n  The one that comes to mind, to me, is the farm bill. The farm bill, \nwhich we passed out of here with 78, 79 votes--it would have been more \nif all the Members had been here; we had never gotten that many votes \nfor a farm bill, I don't think, in our history--is a great opportunity \nto infuse rural America with development dollars, conservation programs \nthat need to be funded, and looking at nutrition programs, which are \nessential. I just mentioned that 85 percent-plus of the food we consume \nin this country is grown or processed here. Think of the good American \njobs we stimulate when we make sure those nutrition programs are in \nplace.\n  We have a host of opportunities before us. I hope--I hope--we will \nnot drag our feet on this stimulus package; that we can come together \nin a bipartisan way, just as we did in the Finance Committee, and vote \nfor this stimulus package that has come out of committee with the \nimprovements that do not leave any of our American families behind.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a period of morning business.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me congratulate the Senator from \nArkansas on her fine and important work on the Finance Committee. Let \nme also congratulate Majority Leader Reid for his leadership, and \nSenator Baucus, Senator Grassley, and the other members for taking the \nball a significantly strong step forward as we deal with the economic \nproblems facing our country.\n  I think it is clear to the vast majority of the American people, if \nnot to the President of the United States, that our country has some \nvery serious economic problems. The middle class is shrinking. Tens of \nmillions of Americans are working longer hours for low wages. Poverty \nis increasing. And there is a level of economic desperation among the \nlowest income people in our country that many of us have not seen for a \nvery long time.\n  As we speak, senior citizens in the State of Vermont are finding it \nextremely difficult to pay for their home heating fuel bills, which are \nsoaring, as they are seeing record-breaking levels of the cost for home \nheating oil.\n  Emergency food banks in the State of Vermont and throughout this \ncountry are literally running out of food because many low-income \nworking people are simply, today, not being able to earn enough money \nto purchase the food they need for their families.\n  Homeless shelters are running out of beds. We have some major \neconomic problems, and the time is long overdue for this Congress to \nbegin to address them.\n  As we discuss an economic stimulus package, there are Members of the \nSenate--and there are many Americans--who have appropriately raised \nquestions about the amount of money we intend to spend in an economic \nstimulus package. There are people who point out, quite correctly, that \nin this country today we continue to have record-breaking deficits, and \nwe have a huge national debt.\n  All of that is a very legitimate concern I share. That is why we \nshould not heed the advice of the President who, in his State of the \nUnion Address, urged us to extend hundreds of billions of dollars in \ntax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of our population. No, I do not \nthink the wealthiest people in this country need more tax breaks. I \nthink we have to start focusing our attention on the needs of the \nmiddle class, on working families, on those Americans most in need.\n  At this point, let me give thanks to our friends in the House who \npassed an economic stimulus package which has started the ball rolling. \nNow, with the legislation we are debating in the Senate, it is our job \nto improve upon what the House did, and I hope we will be doing exactly \nthat.\n  While the House bill has a number of important attributes, the \nstimulus package passed yesterday in the Senate Finance Committee is, \nin fact, a much better and a far more significant piece of legislation. \nThe Senate bill, among other things, understands low-income senior \ncitizens across this country are facing very serious economic problems. \nLike low- and middle-income working people, they need help.\n  Senior citizens, every week I go back to Vermont, tell me they cannot \nsurvive on their Social Security checks, and that the cost-of-living \nCOLAs are too small. They cannot find the money they need to heat their \nhomes. They are having a hard time purchasing the food they need. That \nis why I very strongly support the provision in that legislation passed \nby the Senate Finance Committee which will enable over 20 million \nsenior citizens to get a one-time $500 tax rebate. This is money that \nwill be part of an economic stimulus because these are some of the \npeople most in need who will certainly spend that money quite quickly, \nhelping to create jobs in the process.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues, in a nonpartisan way, to stand with \nthe hard-pressed, low-income senior citizens of our country and support \nthe provision in the Senate Finance Committee bill which says we are \ngoing to provide a tax rebate to senior citizens. They cannot and must \nnot be excluded from the economic stimulus package.\n  Further, the Senate bill does another very important thing in \nreaching out to our disabled American veterans, many of whom are also \nstruggling economically. By definition, these are people who have been \ndisabled defending the United States of America. They must not be \nforgotten as we discuss an economic stimulus package. At the very \nleast, what the Senate Finance Committee did will provide a rebate for \nsome 250,000 of those veterans, and perhaps even more. That is the \nright thing to do from a moral perspective. Those people deserve that \nhelp. In fact, helping them will also provide an economic stimulus.\n  The Senate Finance bill also extends unemployment benefits by 13 \nweeks in all States and 26 weeks in States experiencing high rates of \nunemployment. That is a good and proper thing to do as well. As \nunemployment rises--and especially in those areas where there are \nconsistently high levels of unemployment--many people are going to run \nout of unemployment benefits. Their unemployment benefits will expire. \nThose benefits need to be extended, and that is what the Senate bill \ndoes, and the House bill does not.\n  So in my view, the legislation coming out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee is a more significant piece of legislation than that passed \nin the House in helping those people who are most in need. It is also \nmore important in terms of providing the economic stimulus our economy \nneeds.\n  But to be very frank with you, what came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee is an important step forward, an important improvement over \nwhat existed in the House, but we need on the floor of the Senate to do \nmuch more than what was done in the Senate Finance Committee.\n  For example, the Senate Finance Committee bill does not provide any \nfunding for food stamps. According to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, over 35 million Americans struggled to put food on the \ntable last year, and the number of the hungriest Americans--those \npeople who literally do not have enough food every day--that number \ngoes up and up and up.\n  Economists from different political persuasions, both the left and \nthe right, have told us food stamp benefits would be one of the best \nways to stimulate the economy. So, once again, you are dealing with the \nmoral issue: As the United States of America, in the year 2008, we \nshould not tolerate a situation where any American goes hungry, where \nfood banks are running out of food. That is not what America should be \nabout.\n  Second of all, as we expand the Food Stamp Program, we create a very \nimportant economic stimulus by definition. If people do not have enough \nfood to eat, they are going to spend that money. They are going to \nspend it on food, food which is, by and large, grown in the United \nStates of America, and we are going to create jobs in that\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nprocess. So my hope is, again, in a bipartisan or tripartisan manner, \nthe Senate will add food stamps to the economic stimulus package.\n  The Baucus substitute--the Senate Finance Committee bill--just like \nthe House bill, does not provide any money for the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, usually known as LIHEAP. This is a program \nwhich is extraordinarily important to cold-weather States such as \nVermont, New England, all across the northern tier. But, in fact, it is \nimportant to every State in this country because in Arizona, in the \nsummer, when it gets to 120 degrees, people there need help as well.\n  Right now, in the State of Vermont, and all over this country, we \nhave senior citizens and low-income people struggling--tearing out \ntheir hair--trying to figure out how they are going to pay to heat \ntheir homes when the cost of home heating oil is now well over $3 a \ngallon. The reality is that because we have not increased funding for \nLIHEAP to the degree that we should, either the amount of money each \nindividual person is getting is going down or States are making the \ndecision to provide LIHEAP funding to fewer of our people. Neither \nalternative is acceptable.\n  This is a cold winter in various parts of this country. It has been \nbelow zero in the State of Vermont recently. No American should go \ncold. No American should be forced to make a choice between food and \nheating his or her home. We have to expand LIHEAP funding. People who \nreceive that will be spending that money, and that is also an economic \nstimulus. So in my view, including food stamps, LIHEAP, and \nunemployment benefits in the economic stimulus package is not only the \nright thing to do in terms of stimulating the economy, it is the moral \nthing to do. It is what we as a nation should be doing.\n\n  For too long I think the White House and the Congress have been \nidentified with programs that help the wealthiest people in this \ncountry--the people, in fact, who do not need any help at all. The \nrichest 1 percent is doing fine without any tax breaks from Congress. \nNow is the time to start paying attention to the middle class, the \nworking families, the vast majority of our people who are struggling \neconomically. Now is their time, and we have to listen to their needs \nand respond to them.\n  In addition to addressing issues such as LIHEAP, food stamps, and \nunemployment compensation, there are other areas we should be moving \nforward on: rebuilding and repairing our schools, bridges, roads, \nculverts, sewer systems, rail, ports, and airports. Not only would we \nbe addressing the tremendous problems we have in our crumbling \ninfrastructure, but that is also a quick route to put people in the \nconstruction industry back to work. In the State of Vermont, it is \nestimated that we have over $1 billion in work that has to be done in \nour infrastructure. The estimate, according to the engineers, is that \nwe have over $1 trillion of unmet infrastructure needs in America. We \nshould be rebuilding our schools, making them more energy efficient, \nand in the process we put our working people in the construction \nindustry back to work. We should address that issue as well.\n  Coming from a cold weather State, I am very conscious of the issue of \nweatherization. It makes zero sense that in Vermont and all across this \ncountry we have millions of lower income people who are living in homes \nwhich are poorly insulated, which do not have storm windows, their \nroofs leak energy, so these people are spending money for heating fuel \nthat is literally going out the window and through the roof. \nWeatherization projects are already in existence in all of the States. \nPutting money into weatherization puts people to work. It saves on the \nfuel costs for many seniors, lower income people, and it also, not \nunimportantly, helps us reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So funding \nweatherization is a win-win-win. We should do that as well.\n  I also believe we should be increasing renewable energy investments \nin wind and solar. That is, as I understand it, in the Finance \nCommittee bill, which is very important. We are losing out to the rest \nof the world in creating the kinds of industries we need through solar, \nenergy, and wind. In the process, we would create many good-paying \njobs. The idea that we have not yet passed an extended tax credit for \nwind and solar makes zero sense. We have to move in that area as well.\n  I personally also wish to see included in a stimulus package \nincreased funding for community health centers, because when people \nlose their jobs, they are losing their health care. Federally qualified \nhealth centers have been a wonderful tool to bring people into primary \nhealth care access, regardless of their incomes.\n  Back in 2001, I was an early backer of tax rebates--one of those who \nactually came up with that concept. I support tax rebates for the \nmiddle class, for low-income families with children, and for persons \nwith disabilities. I also believe that senior citizens should be \nreceiving help in this bill as well through a bonus in their Social \nSecurity checks.\n  So I think we are making some progress. I think the Senate bill is \nfar better than the House bill. I think we have the responsibility on \nthe floor of the Senate to improve upon what was done in the Finance \nCommittee. I hope that in a nonpartisan way, this Senate will reach out \nto the American people and let them know we are aware of the pain they \nare experiencing; we know what is happening in the low-income \ncommunity; we know what is happening to our veterans; we know what is \nhappening to our senior citizens; and we finally are going to start \nfocusing on their needs, rather than the needs of the wealthiest 1 \npercent who have occupied so much of the attention of the Senate for so \nmany years.\n  We have an opportunity to do something very important for the \nAmerican people. I hope we do it, and I hope we do it as quickly as we \npossibly can.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from \nVermont, who comes from a cold weather State, this Senator comes from a \nwarm weather State, and a lot of the ideas proffered by the Senator \nfrom Vermont apply to my State as well as his. He has very eloquently \nlaid out how; that if you want to do stimulus, the quickest way to get \nthe money into the economy and flowing so those dollars can turn over \nis increased compensation, unemployment compensation, and increased \nfood stamps. This $300-per-person rebate approved over in the House, \nimproved over here--not just because it is $500, but because it is \ngoing to senior citizens as well in the Senate Finance Committee \npackage, whichever one of those you look at, it is going to be May, \nJune, July, or August before those checks get out into the economy. If \nyou want to do stimulus immediately, you are talking about 2 weeks away \nwith increased unemployment compensation and food stamps.\n  What the Senator says about taking care of our veterans, our disabled \nveterans, and what he says about the infrastructure, is true. We \ndesperately need infrastructure improvements. As far as a stimulus \nright now, that is not going to put the money out there, but a lot of \nthis stimulus package is psychological. It is the fact that the Federal \nReserve, through monetary policy, by cutting the interest rates that \nbanks share with each other--that helps, but there is a delay, a lag, \nbefore that does anything. The immediate jolt is psychological. So too \nwith this stimulus package. At the end of the day, this Senator is \ngoing to support it because we do need that psychological jolt, that \nthe Government is standing behind us, not slipping further into \nrecession. But if this Senator had his druthers, he shares a lot of the \nideas that the Senator from Vermont has proffered on the quick ways to \nget the money out into the economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Colorado \nbe recognized following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I can tell my colleagues that \nour people are hurting. We don't normally think of the State of \nFlorida, which is in the megatrend, which is the fourth largest State, \nwhich is going to become the third largest State within 4 years, the \nState that is the microcosm of the entire country in almost every \ndemographic group--we reflect the country, in large part because a lot \nof the country has moved to Florida--you don't\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nnormally think of a go-go State such as that as being hurting \neconomically. But, indeed, our State is hurting. A lot of it has to do \nwith the real estate market going flat. You take tremendously robust \nareas such as Fort Myers, Lee County on the southwest coast of Florida; \nit has been in a building boom for years. Of course, that real estate \nmarket is flat now, and from all the ripple effects throughout the \neconomy as a result of that, we are hurting. Our people are hurting \nbecause they are paying more for gas, for milk, for bread. Meanwhile, \nbecause of the flat real estate market, they are seeing their housing \nvalues plummet, and many of them are trying to correct the situation by \nselling their houses, which they can't sell, or unwinding the bad loans \nthey have. But then they can't get buyers to look at their homes.\n  We see the statistics bear this out nationally. December's rate on \nunemployment was 5 percent, and that is the highest it has been in 2 \nyears. The GDP growth for the last quarter of last year, 2007, \nincreased only .6 of a percent compared to an almost 5-percent increase \nin the third quarter of 2007. Yesterday, the Fed, in response, cut the \ninterest rates again by a half point, and this is the second rate cut \nin 8 days. Today, the Department of Labor released the initial \nunemployment claims for the week that ended last week, January 26, and \nguess who had the largest unemployment increase in the country? My \nState of Florida. The layoffs are concentrated in construction, in \ntrade, in service, and manufacturing.\n  We are in the middle of a crisis with foreclosures, mortgage \ndefaults, and we are hearing the experts say that the worst is still to \ncome. Two million Americans could lose their homes. We had in Florida \nlast year, in 2007, the second highest mortgage foreclosure rate with \nmore than 2 percent of all our households entering some state of \nforeclosure during the year. That is a 100-percent increase over the \nprevious year, and Florida home sales last year were down 31 percent \ncompared to the previous year. Oh, by the way, the median home price \ndropped 13 percent.\n  So we are now seeing that ripple effect through the economy, \nparticularly in a State such as mine that was such a hot growth market. \nWe are seeing it in the deterioration of the home values, and we are \nseeing it in the State's economy. The fall-off of revenues to the State \nof Florida has been significant.\n  Since the housing crisis is at the heart of this slowdown, it is \ncrucial that in this rescue passage we target these specific concerns. \nThere is going to be a temporary increase in the conforming loan limits \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as the FHA program. I think these \nmeasures will help restore confidence and liquidity in the housing \nmarket. The Senate bill adds more aid, including a provision that would \nallow State and local governments to issue bonds to help with the \nfinancing of those subprime loans.\n  Then, of course, we mentioned earlier disabled veterans. This package \nis going to provide quick help to disabled veterans, as well as \nseniors, and I am certainly hoping that we are going to get a clear up-\nor-down vote on providing an additional 13 weeks of unemployment \ncompensation that is going to help ease the pain of those who are being \nlaid off because of this recession we have now slipped into.\n  Time is of the essence. In a perfect world, we shouldn't have to do \nthis, because whatever we come up with in this package we have to go \nout and borrow, and that means we are going to borrow it from China. \nThat is not good. That is piling on more debt to the national debt. But \nthe fact is we have to do something. I am going to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the state of our \neconomy and the need for Congress to pass the economic stimulus \nlegislation that we reported out of the Senate Finance Committee \nyesterday, with my strong support. I urge my colleagues to embrace the \nurgency we should be bringing to this legislation.\n  This is an issue that has understandably received significant \nattention over the past several weeks and continues to cause people in \nmy State of Colorado and across the Nation a great deal of concern.\n  I want to start by listing a few pertinent facts.\n  After one of the worst holiday retail seasons in years, consumer \nspending, which accounts for two-thirds of the national economy, is \nexperiencing a sharp pullback.\n  Economists are now predicting that GDP growth for 2008 will barely \nexceed 2 percent for the year.\n  Home values are plummeting in many areas, and foreclosures are on the \nrise. In 2007, Colorado ranked fifth in the Nation in foreclosures. \nForeclosures were up 30 percent over 2006 and 140 percent over 2005.\n  The December unemployment rate in Colorado was up nearly half a \npercentage point from November.\n  A barrel of oil costs over $90. On average, a gallon of gas costs \nalmost $3.\n  The economy is on thin ice.\n  But economic indicators are one thing, and the financial pressures \nthat middle-class families are feeling is another. Families across \nColorado and the Nation are feeling squeezed by the growing costs of \nenergy, education, and health care. Savings are melting away, and \ndisposable income is a thing of the past for many Americans.\n  I know what it feels like to not know whether you will have enough \nmoney to provide your family with the things they need or the future \nthey deserve.\n  With that in mind, there is no better way we can start the important \nwork of the second session of the 110th Congress than by providing some \nmeasure of relief to Americans who are struggling financially, and by \ndoing whatever we can to reinvigorate the slumping economy.\n  I believe that the central components of the Finance Committee \npackage do an excellent job of meeting those objectives.\n  I strongly support providing a one-time tax rebate to low- and \nmiddle-income families to help them pay their bills and make it through \nthese tough times. This will help jumpstart consumer spending, because \nmost of these rebates will get spent almost immediately.\n  The Senate package will provide $500 per individual, $1000 per \ncouple, and $300 for every child under the age of 17 for qualifying tax \nfilers. I am pleased that the Senate rebate proposal includes upper \nincome limits to ensure that the rebates are targeted, in addition to \nbeing timely and temporary.\n  I also support tax incentives that provide relief for small \nbusinesses and encourage them to invest and create jobs. These \nbusinesses are the engine of the economy in my State of Colorado and \nacross the Nation--helping them is an excellent way to get our economy \nmoving again.\n  I support extending unemployment benefits for an extra 13 weeks, and \neven longer in high-unemployment States. We have seen a lot of evidence \nabout how effective these benefits are at targeting assistance to \npeople who need it and will spend it, and I am glad we were able to get \nthat done in the Finance Committee.\n  Our bill also provides rebates to nearly 20 million seniors living on \nSocial Security income and nearly 250,000 disabled veterans that were \nleft out of the House bill.\n  Our bill temporarily extends important renewable energy and energy \nefficiency tax incentives. These tax credits will spur investment and \njob creation in an industry that is critical to our economic future.\n  Our bill temporarily raises the national cap on tax-exempt mortgage \nrevenue bonds, which State and local governments may use to provide \nlow-interest financing to low-income home buyers and homeowners. This \nproposal will help address another central contributor to our economic \ntroubles--the fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis, which has \nbeen especially severe in my State of Colorado.\n\n  Lastly, our bill strengthens safeguards designed to prevent people \nfrom obtaining tax rebates they are not entitled to by requiring tax \nfilers to have a valid Social Security number in order to receive a \nrebate.\n  As a result of these important proposals, I believe the stimulus \nlegislation currently before the Senate will go a long way toward \nmeeting our primary objective: putting money as quickly as possibly \ninto the hands of people and businesses who will put it right back into \nthe economy.\n  Having said that, I believe that once we pass this stimulus package \nwe will\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\nneed to take a second set of steps to bolster the Nation's longer term \nfiscal health.\n  I believe we need to move quickly to pass a farm bill that will help \nrevitalize rural economies in Colorado and across the country. I \nbelieve we need to boost investment in our Nation's infrastructure and \ndo more to help address the crisis in housing and real estate. Also I \nbelieve we need to strengthen our programs that provide assistance to \nAmerican workers, businesses, and farmers who are adversely impacted by \nour trade policies.\n  Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to do what we can now to put \nmoney right back into the economy by working quickly to pass the \nlegislation before us, but also pledge to continue to work to enact \npolicies that could make a real difference to our economy's long-term \nhealth.\n  The American economy is hurting, but it is fundamentally resilient. I \nfirmly believe that by working quickly to provide short-term stimulus, \nand by taking modest steps to provide stability in the longer term, we \ncan get back on track.\n  Just this week, we heard from the President of the United States on \nthe need for us to move forward with an economic stimulus package \nbecause he recognizes, as do American families, that the economy is in \ntrouble. It is remarkable that we have bipartisan movement moving \nforward, with the President working with Speaker Pelosi and others to \ntry to get a stimulus package put together that makes sense for the \nUnited States of America.\n  Yesterday, in the Finance Committee, there was another demonstration \nof what you can do when you work together. With the leadership of \nSenators Baucus and Grassley, we put together a robust package that \nshould be considered on the floor here--hopefully, later today.\n  I wish to say a few things about that package. It is important for us \nto recognize that what came out of the House has now been put into a \nFinance Committee package that is much improved that will help us \nstimulate the economy in a number of different ways.\n  There are improvements that need to be made with the House \nlegislation. Like any other legislation, as you get into the details, \nyou find ways of making it better. That is what Senators Baucus and \nGrassley and the members of the Finance Committee did yesterday.\n  I wish to simply address five key points that I believe make this \npackage an improved one.\n  The first point is simplicity. The House version has a rebate \npackage, attempting to get money back into the pockets of consumers to \nstimulate demand in the economy. That package is a relatively complex \nformulation of how you provide those rebates. Our package coming out of \nthe Finance Committee is not. It says that if you are a tax filer, you \nare going to get $500. If you are filing jointly, you and your spouse \nget $1,000. If you are filing jointly and you have two children, it \nwill be $1,600. It is a relatively simple package to understand, and \nthat is about two-thirds of what is included in the package. So the \nAmerican public will be able to understand what it is they are going to \nget without having to go through an accounting exercise in order to \ndetermine what kind of tax rebates they are going to get. So the \npackage out of the Finance Committee should be applauded for its \nsimplicity. It improves significantly upon the House package in that \nregard.\n  Secondly, there were groups of important Americans whom we have a \nmoral obligation to stand up for who were left out of the package that \ncame out of the House. Twenty million seniors in America, who are the \nones who paved the way for all of us to have the America we have today, \nwould be left out of the tax rebate in the House package. The reason \nthey would be left out in the House package is because the way that \nformulation of the tax rebate was put together is based on earned \nincome. If you are a retired senior on Social Security or on a pension, \nyou don't have earned income. That means you don't qualify for the tax \nrebate.\n  Therefore, what we did in this much-improved package out of the \nFinance Committee is said we are going to provide the tax rebate to \nthese 20 million Americans. I hope that across the United States of \nAmerica, those who care about seniors, and seniors themselves, are \nwatching what the Senate does this afternoon and tomorrow and beyond \nwith respect to this much-improved package that would add these 20 \nmillion seniors to the tax rebate.\n  In addition, the House package that came over here also left out \nanother very important group of people: disabled veterans. Mr. \nPresident, 250,000 disabled veterans are left out of the tax rebate \nbecause the benefits they receive are not characterized as earned \nincome. I would bet, if you ask our colleagues in the Senate today--\nDemocrats and Republicans--they would say they want to stand for our \nveterans and honor our Nation's commitments to help them. They would \nsay we ought not to leave 250,000 veterans behind. The Senate Finance \nCommittee, in a bipartisan way, said: We are not going to leave 250,000 \ndisabled veterans behind. We are going to get them the tax rebate they \ndeserve. So our Finance Committee package, in my view, closes these \ngaps that were left in the House package that was passed last week.\n  In addition, what we do in our Finance Committee package is move \nforward with the extension of unemployment insurance. Yes, we are \nseeing the signs of significant unemployment in many States. In my \nState alone, unemployment has gone up about half a percentage point in \nthe last several months. If you focus on Michigan, Ohio, and Nevada, \nwhere you are seeing unemployment rates as high as 8 percent, when you \nsee that, it is important for us to recognize that our unemployment \ninsurance program should reach those people who don't have a job. At \nthe end of the day, if you think about the quality of life for people \nin this country, if you don't have a job, you cannot have a quality of \nlife. Extending those benefits is very important.\n  In addition, our package takes some of what the House did with \nrespect to incentives for job creation for small and big businesses \nalike--about $50 billion, more or less, is what would be used to \nincentivize job creation through both small and large businesses. It \nwould do it by creating bonus depreciation and other mechanisms to \nincentivize businesses to invest in themselves.\n  When you think about small businesses in particular, we know they are \nthe economic generators of most of the jobs we have in America today. \nBy providing a mechanism that gives the bonus depreciation, we will be \nable to make sure these businesses are able to invest in themselves. I \nknow of one small business owner in Colorado who said that because of \nthis package, he will be able to move forward and open a restaurant, \nwhere he will be able to hire somewhere between 20 and 35 people. So \nthis stimulus package will do a lot for small business. It is something \nwe very much appreciate.\n  But we decided not just to leave it there because there are some \nother important aspects of the economy that need to be addressed in the \nshort term. We did that through some improvements in that aspect of the \nstimulus package.\n  First, we looked at the energy issue we are facing in America today. \nWe know that in many States the new frontier of the energy revolution \nis coming our way. In Colorado, you see it in how we are capturing the \npower of the Sun and wind and the power of the biomass. But many of the \nproduction tax credits and investment tax credits are going to expire. \nThis positive economic wave needs a short-term extension. We have done \nthat in this package, thanks to the leadership of Senator Cantwell and \nothers on the Finance Committee who pushed that amendment so hard.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Finance Committee \npackage and get our economy up and running again.\n  In conclusion, this is a stimulus package. That means it needs to be \ntargeted, timely, and temporary. But this package isn't going to solve \nthe economic problems that are facing our country today. There are \nlonger term issues that are crying out for a solution, much of which we \nought to be able to do in the Congress this year alone. I am throwing \nout just a few of those examples.\n  First, the 2007 farm bill. As the Presiding Officer knows, food \nsecurity is\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\nimportant in Montana. It is important for the Nation, and it is \nimportant for the world. As attorney general for Colorado and now as a \nSenator, I have had a sign on my desk that says ``no farms, no food.'' \nI wonder what would happen to America if we didn't have our grocery \nshelves stocked with food and have the most inexpensive and high-\nquality foods of any nation in the world.\n  The 2007 farm bill, which we crafted out of the Agriculture \nCommittee, which garnered the support of 82 Senators in this Chamber, \nneeds to be brought across the finish line. So the administration--the \nPresident--should be asking us to move that farm bill through and get \nit done quickly. We need to be able to do it. We were able to get it \nthrough the Senate. We need to pivot off of the stimulus package and \nget the farm bill done. The food security of America requires us to do \nthat.\n  We cannot just stop, in my view, moving forward with the farm bill. \nThere is also other work we need to do.\n  We are in a housing crisis in America today. We are in a housing \ncrisis in my State of Colorado. In Colorado, we have 1 out of 375 homes \ncurrently in foreclosure. These are families who lived in those homes \nwho have lost those homes. One out of 375 homes is in foreclosure. But \nthat doesn't tell the story of pain. Yes, those families are certainly \nsuffering, but think about all of the other homeowners in Colorado--\nprobably 90 percent of them--who have seen a decline in home values. \nFor most Americans, their home is essentially the majority of the \nequity they own. So when you see a decline in home values, you also see \na taking away from the value most American families have built into \ntheir homes.\n  When you look at the housing industry, the home construction \nindustry, it is, as my friend Senator Conrad said yesterday in the \nFinance Committee, not in a recession; homebuilders are, in effect, in \na depression because of what is happening in the housing market in the \nNation. We try to do something in this bill, but there is other work we \nhave to do to try to stand up the housing component of our economy \nbecause that is such a key indicator of the strength of our economy.\n  So we need to do the farm bill, and we need to do additional \nsignificant work to try to right the housing crisis. But we cannot stop \nwith the farm bill and we cannot stop with the housing issues. We also \nneed to address other issues that are long term, which we have a \nhistoric opportunity to address, including the issue of energy and \nrenewables, which we tried to get through the Senate last year.\n  We must stop for a moment and say thank you that a part of the energy \npackage we debated on the Senate floor is now law. We have CAFE \nstandards that are going to bring about significant savings in oil that \nwe currently import from other countries. That is a very good thing. We \nhave a renewable fuels standard that has quintupled our goal where we \nwant to go in growing energy independence. We created an energy package \nthat says we as America have a vision that, by 2025, 25 percent of our \nenergy will come from the power of the Sun, the power of the wind, and \nfrom the crops we grow in America. What was missing in that package was \na part of the legislation the Finance Committee passed in a bipartisan \nway which would have given us the jet engine to power this clean energy \neconomy for the 21st century.\n  We must return to that energy legislation to complete a package that \nwill help us move forward to address the fundamental values at issue. \nThose fundamental values are very simple. They are about national \nsecurity, so we are not compromising foreign policy by our \noverdependence on foreign oil. Those values are about making sure we \nare taking care of our planet and addressing the issue of global \nwarming, and those values are the economic opportunities for America \nfrom shore to shore to create economic opportunity from the new energy \neconomy.\n  While this stimulus bill is important and we must move forward with \nthis bill in an urgent manner, let's all remember that this is but \nphase 1 of what we have to do to restore the foundations of a good \nlong-term economy for the United States. This will be good work if we \ncan get this work done in the Senate. But there is still much work in \nthe days ahead.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Finance \nCommittee, along with the distinguished Chair, to speak about what we \ndid in terms of the Senate Finance stimulus package which I think is \nsomething that makes a tremendous amount of sense for people, for \ninvestment, for the economy.\n  Before speaking about unemployment compensation insurance, which is a \ncritical part of the package, let me say that I commend most sincerely \nour chairman, Senator Baucus, our ranking member, Senator Grassley, for \nagain not only working together but producing something that is a \nbalanced approach, that addresses both stimulus from the standpoint of \nhelping people, puts money directly back into people's pockets, but \nalso helping to stimulate and support businesses, small businesses, \nlarge businesses, those not only earning a profit and make investments \nbut those that are not earning a profit and making investments.\n  They had the vision to work with us in the area of alternative energy \nproduction, to extend production tax credits which directly relate to \njobs. That is a part of this bill as well. I thank them for taking a \nlook at the House package, and while we commend what was done--it was \nbipartisan, they did it quickly, it was a step in the right direction \nworking with the White House--we found there were parts of what they \ndid in structuring the rebate that needed to be fixed because we found \nthat over 20 million seniors would be left out of getting a rebate \nbecause they do not have earned income; they are living on Social \nSecurity. They would have been left out, as well as about a quarter of \na million disabled veterans, again, living on disability, not having \nearned income. Not only is it the right thing to do, the moral thing to \ndo to make sure our seniors can get help, that we are helping disabled \nveterans, but economically it is the smart thing to do because we know \nthose who are living on fixed incomes are spending the dollars because \nthey have to be able to live, to pay the rent and the mortgage and the \nheating bill and the food and prescription drug costs, all of those. So \nimmediately giving help to those who are struggling to make ends meet \nis not only right, it is smart in terms of the economy.\n\n  The Senate package expands on what the House did to make sure we \ndon't leave out people, that we don't leave out senior citizens and \ndisabled veterans. We also make sure we don't leave out millions of \nAmericans who have worked all their lives, middle-income wage earners \nwho have built the American dream for their family, have a home, have \nhad in the past the ability to send the kids to college, maybe they \nhad, in Michigan, a cottage up north or a snowmobile; they had the \nability to live the good life that we have all wanted for ourselves and \nour children and have found themselves caught in an economic downturn \nand, in fact, a recession.\n  For the State of Michigan it looked like for too long a recession. A \nlot of middle-income families now find themselves in a situation where \nthey are out of work. They want to work. Nobody wants to live on 40 \npercent of their income, which is what unemployment compensation \nprovides, and try to make the mortgage payment, care for the kids, pay \nthe heating bill and the food bill and do all those things that we need \nto do--pay the gas prices, and so on. Nobody wants to be unemployed, \nand nobody wants to find themselves in a situation where they have to \nlive on unemployment benefits. But we have millions of people who find \nthemselves in that situation.\n  Our Finance package makes sure we can extend benefits, 13 weeks for \nunemployed individuals in every State and then an additional 13 weeks \nfor those who are in States of high unemployment. This is the right \nthing to do. It is not only the moral thing to do, it is the smart \nthing to do when it comes to the economy.\n  We had economists from President Reagan's time, economists from \nPresident Clinton's time. We had everything\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\nin between. We had the Congressional Budget Office tell us that \nextending unemployment compensation is one of the top two ways, along \nwith food stamps, to stimulate the economy quickly. We don't have to \nwait until the IRS gets done with tax season, doing all the rebates and \ngetting around to doing the additional rebates in May, June, and July; \nthis can happen immediately. We go directly to those who, \nunfortunately, are not in a position to save but need to spend every \nsingle dollar that comes into their household in order to try to hold \nthings together and not lose the house and to keep their family going.\n  All the signs show this will be a terrible recession for American \nworkers. We are moving in a direction that is extremely difficult. The \nnational unemployment rate has shot up to 5 percent, and experts \npredict it is going to rise above 6 percent in 2009. We have never had \nsuch a dramatic jump in unemployment without having a recession.\n  In many States the jobs picture is far gloomier. As I mentioned, in \nMichigan, we have an unemployment rate of 7.6 percent. That is one area \nwhere we don't want to be first. In fact, we are working very hard to \nturn that around in a number of ways. Other parts of this bill deal \nwith alternative energy, and that is great for us because we are making \nthose wind turbines and solar panels and the alternative fuel vehicles. \nWe are working very hard to move ourselves out of that situation. But \nwe have a lot of people who are working very hard who, through no fault \nof their own, have lost their job and have not been able to find \nanother one in this economy.\n  In addition to Michigan's 7.6 percent, Mississippi is at 6.8 percent \nunemployment. Ohio, Alaska, and South Carolina are all over 6 percent \nand expected within the month to meet the trigger that is in this bill \nof 6.5 percent. That is a possibility. The unemployment problem is, \nunfortunately, getting worse rapidly. We had more than half a million \nworkers join the ranks of the unemployed in the last month; 500,000 \npeople who have become unemployed in the last month alone. Workers who \nhave lost their jobs are having more trouble finding work today than in \npast recessions. Today 17 percent of workers have been looking for a \njob for more than 26 weeks, compared to only 11 percent in 2001.\n  Let me also stress that in the last package we had, the last stimulus \npackage, we were looking at long-term unemployment of 11.3 percent, \nback in January 2001 when we were first talking about a stimulus and \ndecided to include unemployment insurance. Now, as of December, this \nlast December, long-term unemployment is 17.5 percent. It is 55 percent \nhigher than it was when we started first talking about the last \nstimulus package in which we included unemployment compensation \nextension. I am very grateful to the chairman, the leadership of the \nFinance Committee, and our leader, Senator Reid, for speaking out about \nthis and supporting our efforts to make sure this is in the package.\n\n  This problem is affecting workers all across the economic spectrum, \neven those with a college education and years of experience. We have \nengineers in Michigan. We have talented, well-qualified, well-educated \npeople who find themselves in this situation of losing their jobs. \nThere are nearly two unemployed workers for every job opening across \nthe country, which is also critical to talk about. We have right now \n7.7 million Americans who are competing for 4 million jobs.\n  Some people say: Well, if somebody is on unemployment compensation, \nthey just don't want to work. If we extend that compensation for \nanother 13 weeks or 26 weeks, people just don't work. That will be an \nincentive not to work.\n  I welcome anyone to talk to a family in Michigan and say that. The \nreality is, we have 7.7 million Americans competing for 4 million jobs. \nThat raises a whole other host of issues I will not get into today \nabout how we need to start exporting products and stop exporting jobs \nand all the other things we need to do to tackle this issue of a strong \neconomy. The reality is for too many folks, that debate is not going to \nhelp. They are looking at, right now: Am I going to be able to keep the \nlights on? Am I going to be able to keep the phone on? Am I going to be \nable to make sure I can make a mortgage payment so my family is not out \non the street? Those are the questions that are being asked. No one is \nfinding themselves in unemployment insurance living it up. It is just \nabout trying to help them keep the family together, keep things \ntogether until they can find that next job. This is what they are \ncompeting against.\n  Because it is becoming harder to find a job, more families are \nfinding that our unemployment insurance system is not providing enough \nsupport because of the numbers. Mr. President, 37 percent of \nrecipients, 37 percent of the people who are unemployed exhaust their \nbenefits before finding a job, and more will follow as the recession \ndeepens. And 2.6 million people ran out of benefits in 2007. Again, \nthey were competing for jobs where there are not enough jobs.\n  These aren't just numbers. There is a lot of numbers that can make \nthis case. But it is about millions of people, millions of Americans, \nmillions of middle-class Americans, millions of people who are working \nhard to be in the middle class or fighting like crazy to stay in the \nmiddle class. That is what this is about. They are willing to work \nhard. They are looking for a job. They want a job. They are desperately \nconcerned about losing their chance at the American dream for \nthemselves and their families.\n  In good economic times, our current employment benefits are enough to \ntide families over for the few weeks that it takes to find another job. \nI remember those times. Somebody needs some temporary help, they lose a \njob, turn around, go out on a few interviews and, a few weeks later, \nthey have another job. But these are not those times. These are not \ngood times.\n  Yesterday's alarming GDP figures show that economic growth has \ntrickled to a near halt. Savings have plummeted. Debt is rising. Mr. \nPresident, 200,000 families each month risk losing their home. It is \nstaggering, in the greatest country in the world. The Fed has cut \nshort-term interest rates more rapidly than at any other time in \nhistory. It is clear that we are facing an economic crisis that will \nmake it even harder to find a job in the coming months. Faced with \nthese clear warning signs, we must act quickly.\n  Anything that we pass--and I sure hope it is the Senate Finance \nproposal because I think it is balanced, it is effective, it is \ntargeted, and it is the right thing to do--has to include extending \nunemployment compensation for these families who have found themselves \nin such a traumatic situation. It is wrong to abandon them when they \nneed it the most. It is the smart thing to do according to all \neconomists. If we want to say we have done something that is targeted, \nthat is quick, extending unemployment is much quicker than a rebate \ncheck. I certainly support the rebate check, but it is going to take a \nwhile to get those to people. Unemployment extension is much quicker. \nIt is one of the quickest things we can do.\n  So from every angle, this is the right thing to do. Most importantly, \nthough, I look at the families who are looking to us to do the right \nthing.\n  In the past we have waited too long, and working families have \nsuffered. In the wake of September 11, the unemployment rate rose to \n5.3 percent in October of 2001. There was a bipartisan consensus we \nshould do something, but political gridlock prevented us from enacting \nanything until the following March of 2002. By that time, unemployment \nwas up to 5.7 percent and went to 5.9 percent in April. The 2001 \nrecession proved devastating for our economy and, unfortunately, too \nmany families have not recovered from that time. The bill passed by the \nFinance Committee yesterday is a crucial step forward for our economy \nand for our workers and their families.\n  By extending unemployment benefits for 13 weeks and providing an \nadditional 13 weeks of benefits in high-unemployment States, as I said \nbefore, we provide an immediate boost to the economy and at the same \ntime help hard-working middle-class families weather this storm.\n  All of the economists agree: Each $1 invested in benefits to out-of-\nwork Americans leads to a $1.64 increase in growth--$1 equals $1.64 in \ngrowth. That is clearly one of the top two things we\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\ncan do to be able to stimulate the economy. This compares to only \npennies of stimulus in other areas.\n  No stimulus package will be effective unless it provides real \nsecurity for families struggling the most. We have to address this \nissue. We have to address this unemployment situation.\n  Let me say, in closing, when we look at the coming year--in January \nof last year, average unemployment was 4.6 percent. At this time, it is \n5 percent, although many areas are much higher than that. But it is \nprojected that by next year the unemployment rate will go up to 6.5 \npercent. Now, granted, Michigan right now is at 7.6 percent. There are \nother States that are above 6 percent, above or close to 6.5 percent. \nBut this is the direction in which we are going.\n  One of the things about acting now with an unemployment compensation \nextension is we can help those families at this moment who need help \nnow. We can actually be ahead of the curve rather than way behind in \nhelping a family be able to keep their house or to be able to put their \nfamily at ease, knowing that at least there will be something \navailable.\n  The Senate Finance package makes sense. It is the right thing to do. \nOn the business side, we not only focus on investments for those that \nare making a profit but for those that are not but are still making \ninvestments in important areas of the economy, such as manufacturing in \nMichigan. We extend critical tax credits for alternative energy \nproduction, which is critical. We make sure over 20 million seniors are \nnot left out, that over 250,000 disabled veterans are not left out. We \nadd a piece for State and local bonding authority for housing, which \nwill help and support what the House did.\n  Then we do what I have talked about today: We remember the faces of \nthe people who have worked hard to make this country great, middle-\nclass families across this country who through no fault of their own \nand, I would argue, too much of the time through action of the current \nadministration or inaction on what we need to be doing on enforcing \ntrade policy or changing the way we fund health care in this country or \ndoing other aggressive actions in order to keep jobs and expand jobs, \nfind themselves caught in this economic downturn.\n  They are looking to us. If there ever was a time that they would \nexpect their Government to act on behalf of middle-class America, it \nwould be now. It is critically important. I am very pleased the Senate \nFinance package includes extended unemployment compensation. I hope \nwhen it is time to vote, we will see a very strong bipartisan vote on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, before stepping down, I see my good friend, the \nranking member, the Republican ranking member of the Finance Committee, \non the floor. I personally thank him for working with us on an approach \nthat is good for people. It is good for families, individuals, for \nseniors, disabled veterans, good for business, looks to the future on \nenergy. I appreciate his leadership, as always.\n  I am hopeful we will see a bipartisan vote that says we get it and we \nare committed and we are willing to move in a way that supports the \neconomy and the families of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me share with my colleagues my \nexperiences of traveling through the State of Maryland during these \nlast few weeks. I had the chance to be on the Eastern Shore of Maryland \nthis week. I have been to western Maryland. I have been to the urban \ncenters.\n  I can tell you, there are families in my State that are hurting. They \nare uncertain about their future. They are not only worried about \nwhether they should buy an automobile or go out to eat dinner, they are \nconcerned about their economic security. They are not sure what \ntomorrow will bring. They see a shrinking of the middle class. They do \nnot know how bright their economic future will be.\n  I have seen seniors who are concerned about their financial \nstability. They hear all this talk about trying to cut back on Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and they are worried about where they will be as \nfar as being able to pay their bills. They need to know we are \nconfident about America's future.\n  I must tell you, I think what the Federal Reserve did in reducing the \nprime rate was the right thing to do. It will have an immediate impact \nas far as reducing the prime interest rate, but it also instills \nconfidence in our economy and in our future.\n  I believe the Congress has a similar responsibility. It is important \nwe pass a short-term economic stimulus package as quickly as possible. \nBut that package needs to be targeted. By ``targeted,'' I mean it needs \nto put money in the hands of people who will spend that money, who will \nbe able to help our economy, and it must be fair. It must be fair to \nthose who are really at risk because of the economic conditions our \nNation is confronting.\n  I think the bill that passed in the other body was a good start. It \nwas a bill that would provide money to basically middle-income \nfamilies. I think that money is likely to get back into our economy. \nJust as importantly, it was a signal of confidence in our economy and \nconfidence in America's future.\n  I believe it is our responsibility to try to improve that package. I \nthank the leadership of the Senate Finance Committee and my colleagues \non the Senate Finance Committee for bringing out a package that I \nbelieve improves the bill that came over from the other body. It \nimproves it in several ways. Let me just talk about three of the \nprovisions because I think they are very important to a short-term \neconomic stimulus package.\n  First, the Senate Finance Committee's recommendations would include \nlow-income seniors. Now, low-income seniors are really concerned about \ntheir future. But just as importantly, it is not only the fair thing to \ndo, the right thing to do, it is going to help our economy because low-\nincome seniors, if you give them that check, are going to go out and \nbuy something. That is going to help us. It is going to help the \ngrocery stores. It is going to help the retail establishments. It is \ngoing to help the restaurants. It is going to generate economic \nactivity. So it is in our interest to accomplish the objectives of an \neconomic stimulus package to include low-income seniors. I am very \nproud the Finance Committee included that in their package they are \nrecommending to us.\n\n  The second thing they put in their package, which I think is very \nimportant, is the extension of unemployment insurance benefits. All \nStates would get an extra 13 weeks and, for those high-unemployment \nStates, 26 weeks. Now, again, this is a matter of fairness. The people \nwho are directly impacted by the downturn in our economy are those who \nare on unemployment, who do not have jobs, who have lost their jobs. We \nare finding that the unemployment rates are getting higher.\n  I come from a State that does not have a high unemployment rate. We \nhave a rather diverse economic structure in Maryland, so we are not \nquite hit as hard as the rest of the country as far as employment \nnumbers are concerned. But I am proud to support the provision and \nencourage my colleagues to support that provision which provides the \nextra benefits for those States that have been hit the hardest because \nthey have people who are going to have a much more difficult time \nfinding new employment. So it is a fair thing to do. It is the right \nthing to do during an economic downturn.\n  But it also is going to help our economy. If you give money to people \nwho are unemployed, those individuals are going to spend that money. \nThey are\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\ngoing to spend it on basic necessities. That is going to help economic \ngrowth. It is going to help everyone in this country. So it is \ntargeted, and it is fair.\n  The third provision that I really appreciate being in the Senate \nFinance bill is one to help the housing market. We have a housing \ncrisis. In all parts of Maryland, we have homeowners, some of whom are \nin foreclosure and many others who are at risk of losing their homes. \nBut we have young families that are trying to buy a home, we have \npeople trying to sell a home, and they can't. There is a credit crunch \nout there.\n  The Senate Finance bill will at least start us on the way of trying \nto help the trigger for our current economic problems. I say ``the \ntrigger'' because there were signs we were going to have a slowdown in \nour economy, but it was triggered by the mortgage crisis. In that \nregard, the Senate Finance bill does something about that. It is \ntargeted to the problem we have in our economy.\n  So I thank the members of the Senate Finance Committee, the \nleadership, the bipartisan leadership of that committee for improving \nthat package. It is a modest change from the House package in dollars, \nbut it is huge as far as the impact it will have on the people in our \ncommunities in trying to deal with the current economic problems.\n  I thank Leader Reid for being prepared to bring up this issue now. We \ncannot delay it. It is timely. It is important. We have to get this \nbill done. I appreciate our leader bringing this bill to the floor as \nquickly as we possibly can.\n  I have urged my friends on the other side of the aisle to please work \nwith us. We might have some differences. Let's work out those \ndifferences. But do not use the delaying tactics of this body so we \ncannot vote on a stimulus package as soon as possible. We would like to \ndo it today. If we cannot do it today, let's do it Monday. But let's \nget it done because the effectiveness of an economic stimulus package \ndepends upon it getting out as quickly as possible. Part of it is a \nmessage to the people of this country. I think if we put aside our \npartisan differences and get it done, it will be an incredible message \nto the American people.\n  Let me also point out that once we have gotten that done, once we are \nable to work out this short-term stimulus package, I hope we can use \nthe same spirit of cooperation for the long-term economic challenges we \nhave in this Nation. We have long-term economic challenges to deal with \nif we are going to be as competitive as we need to be and if we are \ngoing to see the kind of economic growth we should have and see the \ngrowth of the middle class and middle-class families being able to \nenjoy the fruits of our society.\n  We need to deal with the frustrations of typical families in Maryland \nand around the Nation that are worried about energy costs. They are \nworried about the cost of gasoline and filling up the tanks of their \ncars. They are worried about health care costs and the rising health \ncare costs in our communities. They are concerned about the housing \nmarket.\n  We can use the same degree of bipartisan cooperation and focus, as \nwe, hopefully, will have on the short-term economic package, on our \nlong-term economic problems. Let's get energy independence in America. \nLet's bring down the cost of energy. Let's make it predictable. Let's \nnot be dependent upon the whim of other countries. Let's develop \nalternative fuels. Let's do the conservation we need. Let's make energy \nmore reliable and affordable and, by the way, more environmentally \nfriendly. Let's bring down health care costs. Let's deal with the \nnumber of people who are uninsured--which is terribly expensive to all \nof us--who use our health care system in a more costly way, many times \nthrough the emergency room. Let's work together to bring down the cost \nof health care so it is more affordable and accessible to every family \nin our communities. Let's deal with the credit crunch in a responsible \nmanner so homeowners who need to sell their homes have a market in \nwhich they can sell their homes and so families who want to buy homes \nhave the resources in order to do that. That should be our challenge \nfor 2008. If we get this package done and can address these underlying \nissues, then I think we have carried out the responsibility each of us \nhas.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased we are on the verge of passing the short-\nterm economic stimulus package. I urge my colleagues to make sure this \nis brought up quickly. I hope we are able to take up the provisions \nthat are included in the Finance Committee package, and perhaps some \nadditional improvements.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about the economic stimulus package.\n  In the last several years, millions of Americans have seen their \nprimary source of wealth--their homes--plummet in value. As many as 2 \nmillion mortgage holders may lose their homes in this subprime crisis \nwe are seeing. Investors around the world are now very concerned about \nthe state of our economy. In my home State of Washington and across the \ncountry, people are very worried. We see Americans losing their jobs, \nwe see them struggling to make ends meet, to buy groceries, to pay \ntheir power bills, even to afford health insurance. With our markets in \ndecline, we have the opportunity now to give this economy a jump-start \nand help prevent a full-fledged recession.\n  Experts are telling us that taking action now to stimulate the \neconomy by giving millions of taxpayers a rebate could help increase \nproduction and lift employment. Businesses--especially American \nmanufacturers--need people to buy their products, and Americans need \nmoney to spend on those. I believe a quick stimulus bill that gives \nAmericans some of their tax money back could make a real difference. \nBut we also have to ensure that whatever action we take, it is \ntemporary and targeted to where it can do the most good, and I am \noptimistic we can do that.\n  I wish to thank our House colleagues for coming to a quick agreement \nwith the President on an economic stimulus package. Their proposal was \na very good start, and I wish to thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking \nMember Grassley for getting to work immediately on a Senate plan. I \nhope we can all agree to get a bill to the President by February 15 and \nget this economy moving again.\n  In the last few days, I have talked with several economists who have \nappeared before our Budget Committee. They have shared their analysis \nof what Congress can do to prevent our economy from a full recession, \nand I think the legislation that was passed by the Senate Finance \nCommittee largely meets their recommendations.\n  The Finance Committee bill would give middle and lower income \nAmericans a $500 rebate check. It ensures that seniors who receive \nSocial Security will get that rebate and, importantly, it extends the \nrebate to ensure that our disabled veterans who would not have \nqualified under the legislation at this point would get that rebate as \nwell. I think this is particularly important. It restores the income \ncap so the rebates will go to the people who need it the most.\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\n  Any bill we pass has to ensure the rebates are targeted at seniors \nand working families. They are the backbone of our economy. They are \nthe ones who need the money most, and they are the most likely to spend \nit. So you can be sure I will continue to fight any proposal that \nchanges those provisions.\n  But I wish to add a few words to underscore the importance of \nincluding seniors in this bill. More than 20 million seniors depend on \nSocial Security for their income, and they spend 92 percent of it--a \ngreater proportionate share than all other adults--and seniors are \namong those who are hurt the worst during an economic downturn because \nof increasing health care costs. As our Finance Committee Chairman \npointed out, seniors have worked hard all their lives, they pay taxes \nall their lives, and many of them still pay sales, property, and, of \ncourse, other taxes. So leaving seniors out of any stimulus bill would \noverlook their importance to our economy. It would make our stimulus \nbill much less effective and, most importantly, it would be enormously \nunfair.\n  I am encouraged by the progress we have made so far. I think a \ntemporary, targeted stimulus is the shot in the arm our country needs. \nI have been pleased to see the President has been willing to work with \nus in Congress. I also believe there is a great deal more we can and \nshould do that will help millions of struggling families and turn our \neconomy around over the longer term. I know many of my colleagues \nagree. So I hope the President continues to see the value of working \nwith us on longer term investments that will pay off for years to come.\n  One of those investments that I have high hopes will get us back to \nrestoring our economy is a summer jobs program for teenagers. The \nunemployment rate for teenagers has jumped in the last year. For all \nteens, it is 17 percent, up from 13 percent in December of 2006. Among \nAfrican Americans who are ages 16 to 19, it is almost 35 percent as of \nlast month. Thirty-five percent unemployment for African-American youth \nbetween the ages of 16 and 19.\n  A summer jobs program would have a number of immediate and long-term \nbenefits. We all know teenagers are likely to quickly spend any money \nthey earn, so of course it would provide an immediate economic \nstimulus. But it also would work to begin to create a new generation of \nworkers. Research shows teens who get work experience earn more over \ntheir lifetime.\n  Last November, I held a field hearing of my HELP Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Workplace Safety at South Seattle Community College. We \nfocused on the need to create a number of pathways, multiple pathways \nto career success for our young workers. We had representatives from \nthe private sector, organized labor, and they all talked about the need \nfor a new generation of skilled workers, while students said they were \nnot getting enough information about career opportunities and options. \nI heard about the real need for green-collar workers and the dire need \nfor skilled trade workers who drive our country's economic engines. \nQuite frankly, attracting these young people to our labor force is \nsomething I believe is vital to our economic future in this Nation.\n\n  But the summer jobs program I have been talking about has another \nbenefit for our communities. Teens with jobs are less likely to commit \ncrimes or join gangs. A columnist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer \nwrote a story that caught my eye a few weeks back. It was about a 17-\nyear-old boy who had been killed in what police believe was a gang-\nrelated shooting. The columnist, Robert Jamieson, interviewed some of \nthe boy's friends for the piece he wrote. One friend said the boy had \napplied for nearly a dozen jobs, but couldn't get anyone to call him \nback, so he turned to other means. Tragically, we lost him in a gang-\nrelated shooting.\n  Tragically, too many of our young people face the same choice between \njoining a gang or sticking with a discouraging job search. That story, \nI believe, illustrates why a jobs program for young people is one of \nthe most important investments we can make in all our futures.\n  I wish to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to provide \nthe opportunities and the resources to ensure that this generation of \nworkers and the next have the skills employers need so we can compete \nin the global economy.\n  I also believe we can create jobs and stimulate the economy by making \ndesperately needed investments in our infrastructure, including our \nroads, bridges, levees, and mass transit systems across this country. \nInvesting in our infrastructure would create jobs and increase spending \non construction materials that would immediately infuse millions of \ndollars into our economy. Do you know that for every billion dollars of \nFederal spending on highways and transit, we create a whopping 47,500 \njobs. That is putting people to work. Those investments would pay off \nin the long term as well by helping ensure that our roads and bridges \nand mass transit systems are safe and they are strong.\n  Finally, we have to do more to address the housing crisis itself that \nhas spread across this country. While the economy may be headed toward \nrecession, the housing market is in a depression. According to the New \nYork Times, the number of homes set for foreclosure is higher than at \nany time since the Great Depression. We are seeing communities in this \ncountry where people are literally abandoning their homes because they \ncannot afford their mortgages, and they cannot find a willing buyer. In \nthis country, home ownership has always been a sign of prosperity, but \nnow, for millions of Americans, it has become a trap. With each and \nevery foreclosure, the foundation of every one of our communities \nweakens as well.\n  There were warning signs more than a year ago that this crisis could \naffect the entire Nation, but President Bush took a hands-off approach \nand ignored the problem. Regulators failed to take aggressive action. \nNow economists tell us the worst is yet to come.\n  Our economic strength depends on Americans having a safe and stable \nplace to live and raise their families. Our economy will not be stable \nagain until this housing crisis is corrected. We have to take action to \nhelp prevent more drastic problems, and we have to ensure that this \nsituation can't happen again. Families facing foreclosure must be able \nto get mortgage counseling or help in refinancing their mortgages.\n  The Finance Committee bill includes as well critical tax relief which \nI support for businesses that were directly impacted by the home \nbuilding industry, which has, as we all know, now come to a standstill. \nWe must reform the lending system to prevent more families from losing \ntheir homes. I think we should have two main goals.\n  First of all, we need to modernize the FHA to enable the Federal \nGovernment to offer an alternative to nontraditional loans we have seen \nexplode in the past several years. Secondly, we need to ensure that \nGovernment lenders can replace some of the worst subprime loans with \nsound, traditional mortgages. I believe those investments will have a \npositive ripple effect on the economy for years to come. I guarantee I \nwill be back on this floor many times over the next several months \npushing this Congress to take action.\n  The current economic trouble we face is a direct result of this \nadministration's failure to plan for the future and lead us in the \nright direction. Similar to any family who prepares to balance its \ncheckbook, we have to take stock of our finances and get our books back \nin order. American families understand how to live within their means. \nWhen they sit down and work out their yearly budget, they consider all \ntheir costs, decide how to invest in savings, and balance their \ncheckbooks. The Bush administration inherited a budget surplus, but \nthey squandered it with policies paid for by borrowing funds from \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  By waging a war in Iraq and failing to be honest about the true costs \nof that war, President Bush has racked up a mountain of debt with no \nstrategy whatsoever to pay it back. Instead of looking out for the \nneeds of everyday Americans, he allowed his friends on Wall Street to \ntake massive paychecks, while allowing predatory lenders to work \nunregulated. At the same time, the Bush administration has failed to \ninvest in our roads, bridges, in health care, in education, in energy \nindependence, and in our safety here at home. These are things that \nhelp our citizens get to work, stay healthy and safe, and these are \nthings that keep our economy stable over the long term. The longer we \ngo without addressing our\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\ncrumbling highways, our skyrocketing health care costs or our \ndependence on foreign oil, the higher the costs will be when we have no \nchoice and limited options to fix those problems. We saw that with \nKatrina. We saw it with the Minnesota bridge collapse.\n  Every family knows ignoring the need to spend wisely on things you \ndepend on and failing to live within your means is a recipe for serious \ntrouble down the road. So while the economic stimulus we are working on \nwill do a lot of good in the short term, we have to insist that we deal \nwith the real causes of our economic problems. It is time to take a \nlesson from American families: balance the budget, be honest about the \ntrue costs of this war, and think seriously about how we move forward. \nIt is time to insist the Federal regulators who are supposed to watch \nout for economic trouble actually do their jobs.\n  It is time to stop ignoring our needs right here at home. President \nBush has shown a willingness to work with Congress on this economic \nstimulus package. I hope he continues to see the value in working with \nus on the longer term policies that our economy and American families \nbadly need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will speak on the stimulus package. \nBefore I give a general overview of it, I want to say something about \none of the several mistakes, or oversights, that is in the House bill. \nI don't mean to imply that these were known as oversights at the time. \nBut one stands out so strongly you wonder whether the House is \nconsistent in its approach to the issue of illegal aliens. I will speak \nfrom the standpoint of my experience with the children's health \ninsurance bill.\n  You may be familiar with this phrase: ``Where you stand depends upon \nwhere you sit.'' Nothing better illustrates that point than this debate \nand the issue of rebates for illegal immigrants. We are told we must \npass the House bill and that changes are unnecessary. In other words, \nsomehow you assume the House of Representatives passed the perfect bill \nand we ought to rubberstamp it. I disagree. I think the House bill \nmakes it too easy in several areas, but especially in the area of \nillegal immigrants, to get rebate checks. According to Numbers USA, the \nHouse bill could allow as many as 3 million illegal immigrants to \nreceive rebate checks. The House minority leader's spokesman was quoted \nin the press as saying:\n\n       There is no language in the measure that would enable \n     illegal immigrants to receive a tax rebate.\n\n  There is no language whatsoever in the House bill that would prevent \nan illegal immigrant from receiving one of these tax rebate checks. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the Rotunda should be quite familiar \nwith this line of reasoning, because they devoted countless times on \nthe House floor last fall trying to convince people that because the \nSCHIP bill didn't explicitly prevent States from covering children up \nto 400 percent of poverty, it must mean States can cover kids up to 400 \npercent of poverty.\n  The same folks who want us to believe the House bill is fine said we \nhadn't done enough to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving \nbenefits in SCHIP, even though the SCHIP bill had this very language:\n\n       Nothing in this Act allows Federal payment for individuals \n     who are not legal residents. Titles 11, 19, and 21 of the \n     Social Security Act provide for the disallowance of Federal \n     financial participation for erroneous expenditures under \n     Medicaid and under SCHIP respectively.\n\n  That was in our bill that passed last year. It is amazing how the \nstandard has changed. The same people who said the language I just read \nwasn't good enough when we took up the children's health insurance \nprogram are now saying no language whatsoever is fine.\n  The simple fact is the House bill allows illegal immigrants to get \nrebate checks, plain and simple. It is important for us to fix that, \nand I believe we will before the bill leaves the Senate. We should not \ngive rebate checks to people who have come to this country illegally, \nand we should give the House of Representatives an opportunity to fix \nthis huge mistake that is in the bill they sent to us. I cannot imagine \nwhy anyone on the House side would complain about our doing that after \nall the uprising we had last fall about the Senate even considering the \nlanguage I read--didn't do enough to prevent people here illegally--\nmeaning illegal immigrants--from getting children's health insurance \nprogram. My recent experience in negotiating with the House on the \nissue of illegal immigrants and public benefits taught me that certain \nfolks seem to care quite a lot about that issue, except somehow it was \nan oversight in this tax rebate bill.\n  I will quote from the debate on the SCHIP bill in the House of \nRepresentatives of October 25 of last year. I will not actually quote \nthe Members by name. You can find it in the Congressional Record if you \nwant to know who said it, but it doesn't matter who said it. It was an \noverwhelming opinion of people in that body--particularly Republicans. \nOne Member alleged that the SCHIP bill tried ``to give benefits to \nillegal immigrants while we still have Americans unserved.'' He went on \nto say, ``that is not right. This is not fair. This is not \ndemocratic.''\n  Suppose I put ``tax rebates'' in there in place of ``benefits,'' and \nparaphrase it this way, with the same quote: ``To give [tax rebates] to \nillegal immigrants while we still have Americans unserved. That is not \nright. This is not fair. This is not democratic.''\n  Well, let's go on. If it weren't right there in the SCHIP bill, it is \nsurely not right here in this tax bill. It is also not fair. We should \nnot leave some Americans unserved when it comes to rebates, such as \nseniors and disabled veterans, as they did in the House of \nRepresentatives, while we are going to let illegal immigrants get \nrebate checks.\n  I want to give you another quote. This is also from the same day, \nOctober 25:\n\n       I don't think our constituents want us to vote for a bill \n     that makes it easier for illegal immigrants to get tax-paid \n     health care.\n\n  That is the SCHIP bill.\n\n       I think this bill does that.\n\n  So if that were the case, then I would think that Member of the House \nwould not want to make it easier for illegal immigrants to get tax-paid \nrebate checks.\n  Finally, here is a quote from September 25, 1 month before that, in \ndebate on the SCHIP program in the other body, from a Member who used \nto chair one of the committees of jurisdiction over there:\n\n       What that means is that they want illegal residents of the \n     United States of America to get these benefits. This is what \n     the objection means. So for that reason alone, I would ask \n     that we vote against this bill.\n\n  ``For that reason alone,'' he said--regardless of what else is good \nabout the bill, including the language the Senate put in, which was \nmeant not to give the SCHIP program money to illegal aliens. It still \nwasn't enough. Yet now that tax rebate bill comes over from that very \nsame body and would let illegal immigrants get rebate checks.\n  So I say, for that reason alone, it is a reason for this body to defy \npeople in that body who said we should not have changed the Senate bill \none iota. To my colleagues on the House side, the shoe is now on the \nother foot. The same principle that applied then should apply now. If \nyou felt strongly enough to stop the SCHIP bill over your concerns \nabout illegal immigrants receiving public benefits, then you certainly \nshould not object to the Senate repairing a bill you sent us that would \nallow illegal immigrants to get a rebate check. You cared about it \nthen; you should care about it now. You said it wasn't right then. \nWell, it is not right now. You said it wasn't fair then. Well, it is \nnot fair now. The Senate will fix it. It was a mistake that the Senate \nwill fix.\n\n  Let's get back to some history about the purpose of the Senate. For \nanybody to think a bill would come over here from the other body \nwithout fair consideration by this body, I have used this example \nbefore, and I don't know whether George Washington actually said this, \nbut it has been in the history books so long that it is fact as far as \nI am concerned. He was trying to demonstrate to people then about the \nnew Constitution and the purpose of the House and the Senate. He had a \ncup of coffee on a saucer. The cup with the coffee in it was the House \nand the saucer was the Senate. The hot coffee in the cup was a piece of \nlegislation, I assume. So what he did to explain the\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\ndifference between the House and Senate is say this is the House of \nRepresentatives writing a bill. Then he poured out the hot coffee into \nthe saucer. I don't know whether we do it anymore or not--I don't do \nit, but I have seen it demonstrated that you can pour it out to cool so \nyou don't burn your tongue. He explained that the Senate's role was to \ngive deep consideration, to let the pressure that comes upon a body \nthat is elected for a 2-year period of time--a body that might be more \nresponsible to the transient will of the majority, that that transient \nwill of the majority needed to have a body to kind of rethink things, \nmaybe verify that what the House did was absolutely right, or maybe \nverify that everything they did was absolutely wrong, or that a few \nchanges might be made. And then, after that, the Senate passes the bill \nand it goes on its merry way to the President of the United States.\n  But I believe that people I have heard from lately, including, I \nguess, even our own President of the United States, have said that \nsomehow the Senate ought to automatically take what the House did and \nforget all about the historical purpose of the Senate, and be on our \nway, with these mistakes in it--that a person who is illegally in this \ncountry could get a rebate check, when I doubt, if we are taking the \nneeds of all of the people, that can help us revitalize this economy, \nthrough rebate checks and through enhanced investment.\n  Madam President, I also came to the floor to discuss this bill \ngenerally. I will start by thanking Chairman Baucus for his courtesy, \nhard work, and patience in this legislative effort. As we have in the \npast, we wanted to process the economic stimulus issue through the \ncommittee. That process started shortly after this session of Congress \nopened. We talked substance and process. We had discussions with the \nadministration, especially Secretary Paulson. We had discussions with \nour leaders. We had two private meetings and took input from our \ncommittee members. We had two hearings on an economic stimulus.\n  Our goal in the Finance Committee was a bipartisan economic stimulus \npackage. We both wanted a bipartisan economic stimulus package that \nresponded to the needs of Americans and business and would provide a \nmuch needed boost for the economy. During this same period, the \nPresident sent a strong message that Congress must act, and Congress \nought to act quickly to design a fiscal stimulus package aimed at \nboosting the economy. The President said such a plan would provide a \n``shot in the arm'' to keep the economy healthy.\n  Last week, the bipartisan, bicameral congressional leadership met \nwith the President. At that meeting, the Senate leaders more or less \nyielded the legislative process and the substance of this important \nquestion to the House and the Senate. In other words, Senate leaders \nagreed that whatever package the House leadership and White House \nagreed on would be treated as a fait accompli in the Senate. The Senate \nleadership's sudden shift in direction caught Chairman Baucus and me by \nsurprise and, as I noted above, we had already engaged in the committee \nprocess for several weeks.\n  We were fully engaged on a member and staff level. Many of our \nmembers and staff brought to the table the experience from three \nstimulus bills earlier this decade.\n  I respect the role of leaders here. My guess is Chairman Baucus and \ntwo-thirds of the committee members who supported the bill yesterday \nalso respect the role of our leaders. Many in the leadership on my side \nof the aisle worried about the problem that might arise if the Senate \nhad no role other than to rubberstamp the House bill. They are rightly \nconcerned about the Senate processing a bill, dragging it out, and \nloading up the bill. Certainly, that is a reasonable concern. \nCertainly, that is something we find happening often in the Senate. But \nis that concern in itself so great that the Senate should abdicate all \nof its legislative responsibility? Is that concern so great that the \nFinance Committee members should have no say over legislation falling \nwithin its jurisdiction?\n  In my almost quarter century of service on the Finance Committee, I \nam not aware of any precedent such as this. I am also not aware of any \nprecedent on the House side. At the end of last session, some in the \nHouse side might have complained about the outcome of legislation \nfavoring the Senate position. I am not, however, aware of a situation \nwhere House leaders on either side virtually ceded their role in \nlegislating on a tax bill this important. As I said, I respect the \nconcerns of leaders about timing.\n  It comes down to this: The leaders' concerns with timing might weigh \nagainst the question of the quality of the House bill. In other words, \nis a ``take it or leave it'' House bill which passes quickly better \nthan a Senate bill which allows the Senate to work its will?\n  I have laid out the leaders' concern about timing. Now we question \nthe adequacy of the House bill. That is the other side of the balance \nwe need to strike. I know other members on both sides have asked \nthemselves the same questions, including Chairman Baucus. Chairman \nBaucus makes the ultimate call. Even if I had decided the importance of \nquick action outweighed the benefits of going through the committee \nprocess, the chairman would have made the ultimate call to go ahead. \nThat was the call the chairman made back in 2002, and it was the call \nhe made this time.\n  In 2002, I disagreed on the substance, and we had a party line \nmarkup, but the committee did process the stimulus bill. So to anyone \non my side who says my opposition would have stopped the chairman from \ngoing forward, check the history books. It did not stop the committee \nin 2002, and it will not stop it now.\n  The same outcome occurred in 2003, when I was chairman of the \ncommittee and Senator Baucus was the ranking member. We went forward in \n2003. This time we were able to proceed in a bipartisan manner, and \nwhat did the committee process yield? Let's examine this side of the \nquestion. Asked another way: Did the committee process improve the \nHouse bill with Senate amendments?\n  One thing I heard loudly and clearly from Republicans was concerns \nabout suffocating income limits. The chairman heard me out and agreed \nto eliminate them. Unfortunately, the support from the Republican side \nof the aisle did not line up with the principle I heard from them that \nthey wanted included in the bill as a correction to the House bill.\n  On the chairman's side of the aisle, meaning the Democratic side of \nthe aisle, there was great controversy over taking those limits off. We \nheard the uncapped proposal over and over defined as something \nspecifically benefiting Bill and Melinda Gates.\n  To those on the left, let me tell you there must be a lot of Bill and \nMelinda Gateses out there. The reason I say that is $12 billion of \nrebate checks is involved in going back to the House income caps. With \nthe amount of checks capped, it means there are millions of families, \nnot a few millionaires, who are being affected.\n  As I said, those facts did not move many on my side away from the \nHouse bill that contains those caps, so I revisited the issue with the \nchairman. The caps are back, but at a much higher level. They begin to \nphase out at $150,000 for single taxpayers and $300,000 for married \ntaxpayers.\n  So we include a few more middle-income people. That is double the \nHouse income limits, helping more middle-income people.\n  It is safe to say the higher income limits will aid a lot of \nalternative minimum tax-paying families we hear about. From my \nperspective, this is a big improvement over the House bill. So if you \nsupport the Finance Committee bill, you are recognizing the burden \nthese taxpayers' families bear through the AMT. I don't want to hear \nany more demagoguery about Bill and Melinda Gates getting checks \nbecause there is not going to be any more billionaires getting checks, \nno millionaires getting checks, no ``half millionaires'' getting \nchecks. But a lot of upper middle-income families who will not get a \ncheck under the House bill will get a check under the Finance Committee \namendments.\n  Most on my side would consider these higher income caps an \nimprovement of the House bill. I particularly credit Senators Crapo and \nKyl for bringing up this point in our Finance Committee meetings.\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\n  Some on the other side, especially those from high-income, high-tax \nblue States, will quietly support this change as well but not echo it \nbecause they don't want to face the chagrin of Members who think that \nnobody on the Democratic side ought to be concerned about anybody who \nhas a little higher income.\n  At the other end of the income scale are 20 million low-income \nseniors. I underscore that point, 20 million low-income seniors. The \nHouse bill leaves them out entirely. The chairman's mark in the Senate \ncorrects that situation.\n  In the House bill, you will not find seniors with Social Security \nincome covered in this bill. You will find them covered in the Senate \nbill.\n  Since we do not have the bill text yet--I am holding up the \nchairman's mark--we made this happen by including Social Security \nbenefits as a qualifying income in the chairman's mark, and here is \nwhat that mark says on page 3:\n\n       All eligible individuals are entitled . . . if they satisfy \n     at least two of the following criteria: The sum of an \n     individual's: earned income . . . and (2) Social Security \n     benefits must be at least $3,000.\n\n  That language is not in the House bill. Because that language is not \nin the House bill, 20 million seniors would not have gotten checks--if \nthat House bill had been rubberstamped by the Senate.\n  During our committee process, many members discussed this defect in \nthe House bill. As a result of careful Finance Committee member \ndeliberations, we were able to improve the House bill.\n\n  Many disabled veterans do not get checks under the House bill. Here \nagain, the House bill does not cover disabled veterans. Under the \nSenate bill, disabled veterans will be covered.\n  On page 2, the Finance Committee document says these words:\n\n       The provision modifies the chairman's mark to expand the \n     rebate benefit to disabled veterans.\n\n  During careful Finance Committee deliberations, Senators Lincoln and \nSnowe filed an amendment to ensure that disabled veterans would be \ncovered. The chairman incorporated that amendment into his modified \nmark. Does anyone think this is an inappropriate improvement in the \nHouse bill? I ask that of those who insist we rubberstamp this House \nbill, if they do not have guts enough to tell Chuck Grassley that be \nincluded, at least in their own mind, I hope they know they are wrong \nby not including the disabled veterans by saying we ought to \nrubberstamp the House bill. So the House bill, which some are insisting \ncannot be improved by the Finance Committee, excludes 20 million \nseniors and disabled veterans.\n  The House bill could also send checks to illegal aliens. That is \nright. As I said before, I spent a great deal of time on this point, \nfor those who maybe missed the beginning. The House bill, which some \nare saying is the best bill we can get and ought to be rubberstamped in \nthe Senate, is going to allow illegal aliens to get checks before we \ntake care of all the people.\n  Do my colleagues understand the House of Representatives passed a \nbill to give rebate checks to stimulate the economy, making it possible \nfor illegal aliens to get checks but not 20 million seniors and \ndisabled people in this country who are here legally?\n  I wish to be specific on the modifications in the chairman's mark, \nand here is again the document to which I am referring. On page 2, this \nis what the document says:\n\n       The provision denies the basic credit and the qualifying \n     child credit to individuals if they do not include on their \n     tax return a valid taxpayer identification number for: (1) \n     themselves (and if they are married, their spouse) and (2) \n     any children for whom the qualifying child tax credit is \n     claimed. For these purposes, a valid taxpayer identification \n     number is defined as a Social Security number.\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       If an individual fails to provide a correct taxpayer \n     identification number, such omission will be treated as a \n     mathematical or clerical error. As under present law, the \n     Internal Revenue Service may summarily assess additional tax \n     dues as a result of a mathematical or clerical error without \n     sending the taxpayer a notice of deficiency and giving the \n     taxpayer an opportunity to petition the Tax Court. Where the \n     IRS uses the summary assessment procedure for mathematical \n     and clerical errors, the taxpayer must be given an \n     explanation of the asserted error and given 60 days to \n     request that the IRS abate the assessment.\n\n  This provision uses current IRS verification techniques. It ensures \nthat the taxpayer getting the check is identified by the tax system.\n  During Finance Committee deliberations, Senator Ensign and his staff \nraised this important issue. Senator Ensign filed an amendment that was \naddressed in the modified chairman's mark.\n  The House bill has no such provision. Again--I am not going to keep \nholding up these bills--we have the House bill without this provision; \nthe Senate bill with that provision. There is no language in the House \nbill to address a problem Senator Ensign properly raised in the \ncommittee. The committee bill improves the House bill by making sure \nillegal aliens do not get a check.\n  The Finance Committee amendment also beefs up the business stimulus \npackage by adding additional years to the current law net operating \nloss carryback rules. The Finance Committee bill adds extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits. I know this was a big sticking point \nin the negotiations between the House and the White House. In this \nrespect, I favor the House bill. My personal preference would be to \neliminate this provision. It, however, was a key issue for all the \nDemocrats. So in compromise--and we do not get anything done in the \nSenate if we do not have some compromise; nothing is strictly \nDemocratic or strictly Republican, nothing can pass here except under a \nprocess of reconciliation. So in compromise, the chairman has it worked \nout, and it was essential that it be worked out.\n  I pushed hard for investment energy incentives, and the chairman \nagreed with me in that respect. So the last piece of this compromise is \nan expansion of investment incentives to seamlessly extend investment \nincentives for wind, biomass, and other renewable energy projects. In \ncommittee, these provisions caught some criticism, and I expect we will \nhear more of the same during this debate. I will respond in detail when \nthose criticisms are given.\n  I compliment committee members on finding a bipartisan middle ground. \nThe committee stimulus package raises the caps on rebate checks, \nexpanding the benefits to more middle-class Americans, Social Security \nrecipients, and disabled veterans. It makes sure illegal immigrants do \nnot get checks. It also expands some of the business relief, and it \naddresses unemployment. The energy investment incentives round out the \npackage.\n  I ask Members to go back to the basic question of balancing quick \naction on a House bill--and that House bill being imperfect as I \npointed out in this debate--versus improvements that were made by the \nFinance Committee. The House bill could be passed quickly without \nimprovement or we could finish the process in the Senate and add \nimprovements made by the Finance Committee. I would challenge anyone to \nargue that none of the improvements made by the committee process are \nimportant enough to finish the job in the Senate. I hope nobody comes \nover and tells us that, for instance, it is OK to give rebate checks to \npeople who are here illegally.\n\n  Having made that point, Madam President, we could prove our leaders \nright if we load up the bill in the Senate. So we ought to keep our eye \non the ball and not load it up because we want to get a stimulus \npackage passed. We don't want that to sink. Christmas is over, so let's \nnot make this the traditional Christmas tree that sometimes legislation \nbecomes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, today our country is facing difficult \neconomic times. Economic growth is slowing, consumers have maxed out \ntheir credit cards and are cutting back on spending, and the value of \nthe dollar continues falling while prices for gas and food rise. Daily \nwe hear news about growing problems in the mortgage industry, forcing \nour neighbors into foreclosure. In my State of Wisconsin, foreclosures \nare up 27 percent from this time last year, and it will get worse as \nmore subprime mortgages adjust to\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\nunaffordable higher interest rates. Working families around the country \nare facing stagnant wages while prices rise, and their most important \ninvestment--their home--is losing value.\n  In response to this bleak picture, the House and Senate have been \nable to move quickly in a bipartisan way to try to head off a growing \neconomic storm. It is a rare moment these days when Senators set aside \ntheir individual priorities and agree on legislation for the greater \ngood. But that is what has happened with the economic stimulus package \nthat we are currently considering. This package strikes a balance \nbetween rebates, business needs, and immediate relief, and I am proud \nto support the bill before us today.\n  The centerpiece of this legislation is a rebate of $500 per \nindividual and $1,000 per couple, with an additional $300 rebate per \nchild. This will provide effective and efficient relief for families \nwhile jump-starting our economy.\n  We need to get this money into the hands of people who will spend it, \nso I applaud the Finance Committee decision to include income caps. \nIncome caps ensure that recipients of the rebate--low- and middle-\nincome working families--will put the money back into the economy.\n  Finally, as the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I want to \nvoice my strong support for the extension of rebates to low- and \nmoderate-income seniors. The House-passed legislation would leave out \nnearly 20 million elderly people from receiving the rebate, even though \nthey are facing the same rising prices as everyone else. Seniors living \non fixed incomes deserve to share in this rebate after paying taxes for \nall their working lives.\n  However, this package is not perfect. I was disappointed to see \nadditional funding for food stamps was not included. As chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over food stamps, the \nhunger and nutrition programs are something I take very seriously. The \nstrain this economy imposes on lower income Americans is abundantly \nclear to me. Before we even understood we were headed toward economic \ncrisis, we increased WIC funding by some $600 million over the \nPresident's request simply to feed the people already in the program. \nAnd now that the crisis has become clear, how can we stand by and not \ndo more?\n  I hope the Senate will soon act to add an additional $5 billion in \nfood stamp funding. With the downturn in the economy, we all know even \nmore people will need a helping hand to put food on their family's \ntable. We should increase funding for food stamps this year because we \nknow there are families in dire need. And we should boost food stamps \nbecause we know spending will stimulate our economy. Every dollar spent \non food stamps generates $1.73 in economic activity, and it happens \nquickly. Eighty percent of all benefits are used within 2 weeks of \nbeing sent out, and 97 percent are redeemed by the end of the month. \nAnd we don't have to create a new mechanism to deliver this stimulus. \nAdding food provisions to this package just makes sense.\n  I am pleased the Senate has come together quickly to move this \nimportant package. We cannot delay, and we should not let this bill get \nbogged down. We need to pass it soon so hard-working Americans get the \nhelping hand they deserve when they need it most.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, first of all, I thank the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus, and our ranking member, Senator \nGrassley, for their combined tireless leadership in advancing a very \ncritical piece of legislation, the stimulus bill that has been passed \nby the Finance Committee and will be considered by the Senate shortly. \nI thank them for spearheading such an important initiative in a very \ntimely fashion. It is an issue of critical consequence to the Nation.\n  We know there is a decline in our economy. We are seeing the economic \nindicators, which I will speak to shortly. There is no doubt that \nacross the board it is absolutely vital that we enact as quickly as \npossible a stimulus package to begin to address the erosion we have \nidentified and that we have seen in our economy.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking \nmember for working so quickly to address many of the issues raised on \nthis very comprehensive piece of legislation, understanding that some \nof the issues that have been raised--even since the time in which the \nHouse of Representatives had voted upon their package, they also \nincorporated many provisions that I think are more targeted and will \nstrengthen the bill that passed in the House of Representatives and the \nbill that had been negotiated between the House and the President.\n  I do think it is important for the Senate to have the opportunity to \nhave its input on this bill that is going to be so vital to America and \nto our constituents and to make sure it is as precise and calibrated as \npossible in order to rejuvenate the economy and, hopefully, to \ngalvanize some of the economic dimensions of our economy that have \ntaken a turn for the worse.\n  It is imperative that we act in a timely fashion. I think changing \nthe package and incorporating those issues that are also essential to \nbuild upon the strengths of the legislation that passed in the House of \nRepresentatives are not mutually exclusive. We cannot afford to stand \nidly by as the economy continues to erode. That is why I think there is \na collective conclusion that we have to develop a package that can be \nsupported in both the House and Senate and will be signed by the \nPresident.\n  The Finance Committee held a number of hearings recently on the \nquestion as to whether to even have a stimulus package. I know there is \ndebate on both sides of the political aisle and among economists as to \nwhether it is essential. But the fact is, more than half of the \neconomists surveyed in this country believe there is a recession that \nis imminent. So, obviously, we have a responsibility to take every \npossible step and every possible measure that can avert or at least \nmitigate the impact and the brunt of any recession.\n  Dr. Martin Feldstein, former chair of the Council of Economic \nAdvisors for President Reagan, expressed his support for a stimulus \nplan. Last week, before the Senate Finance Committee, he said:\n\n       Because of current credit market conditions, there is a \n     risk that interest rate cuts will not be as effective in \n     stimulating the economy as they were in the past. That is why \n     a stimulus measure deserves our attention.\n\n  It certainly deserves our attention and our informed decisions, in \nterms of what exactly should be considered in a stimulus package. No \ndoubt, time is of the essence--we all agree on that--in passing a \nviable and effective piece of legislation. But our obligation, as well, \nis to be deliberative on one of the issues that is of great consequence \nto this country.\n  We have to develop the best possible package, building upon the \nstrength of the House measure, and it must be targeted to those who \nneed the support; and we need to rebuild the economy and, hopefully, \navert any potential recession. We have to strike the right balance \nbecause, obviously, that will be central to averting a recession, \navoiding it, as we face a confluence of historic and unprecedented \neconomic indicators that are profoundly troubling.\n  We can anticipate more than $600 billion in resets in the adjustable \nrate market in the spring, which is, of course, on top of all the \nresets that have occurred recently. We are experiencing a housing \ncrisis. Recently, the Commerce Department indicated that the drop in \nhome prices is at the lowest since they began keeping records in 1963. \nLikewise, the price of oil per barrel has now skyrocketed and spiked \nrecently to $100 per barrel. Gasoline is approximately $3 at the pump, \nand we can anticipate, according to a report even of today, that it may \ngo as high as $3.50 per gallon. The number of long-term unemployed \ntoday is nearly twice the rate of the unemployed immediately prior to \nthe recession of 2001 and 2002, when we extended unemployment benefits. \nSo we have seen the\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\nlong-term unemployment rate jump significantly.\n  We have had an unemployment rate that surged most recently, in the \nshort term, from 4.7 percent to 5 percent in 1 month alone. Obviously, \nwe don't know what to anticipate in future months. That is why it is so \ncritical to have the stimulus package in place.\n  Most troubling is what the Commerce Department indicated yesterday: \nthat a growth in the gross domestic product has slowed to .6 percent in \nthe fourth quarter of last year, for an annualized rate of more than \n2.2 percent for 2007. That happens to be the slowest annual rate of \ngrowth in 5 years. So there is no question that we must use the fiscal \ntools at our disposal to mitigate the impact of a slowing economy and, \nhopefully, avoid any potential recession.\n  One of the economists who appeared before the committee--Dr. Jason \nFurman of the Brookings Institution--echoed as much when he said that \n``a well-designed fiscal stimulus in the form of increased government \nspending or tax reductions, has the potential to help cushion the \neconomic blow.''\n  So the package agreed to yesterday in the Finance Committee, in my \nview, meets this challenge and achieves those goals. It is well-\nbalanced, effective, and it will stimulate the economy through some key \nprovisions that I think are essential, in terms of addressing the \nproblems we are facing. One is the refundable tax rebate, of course; \nthat is, to spur the buying power of all Americans across the board, \nbut most especially low-income and senior consumers, which is \nimportant.\n  The House-passed package doesn't include a benefit for senior \ncitizens. It doesn't include the more than 20 million seniors on fixed \nincomes. They would not benefit from the stimulus package enacted in \nthe House of Representatives. It doesn't include an extension of \nunemployment benefits which, again, I might add, economists have \nidentified as one of the surest ways to impact the economy. You will \nhave the most affect on spending almost immediately--in fact, some \neconomists have said within 2 months, as opposed to the rebate, by the \ntime it passes the Congress and is signed by the President, but also \nbecause of the length of time it takes to distribute it. Even under the \nmost efficient means possible, we will not feel the effect of it until \nthe spring or later midyear. So then it would take a while to really be \nabsorbed into the economy so that an extension of unemployment benefits \nwould become essential and pivotal. In fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice said it has the greatest amount of cost-effectiveness and the \nleast amount of lag time before it is felt in the economy, it has the \nmaximum amount of impact on the overall economy in terms of its \neffectiveness, and it has the most certainty about the impact it will \nhave on the economy to spur economic spending.\n\n  Finally, we have an extension of the energy tax incentives. People \nsay we should not have the energy tax incentives in this legislation. \nYet it is interesting to note that it would create more than 100,000 \njobs, by industry estimates, by the end of the year--100,000 jobs. The \nwhole goal and focus of this legislation is to create more jobs, and if \nwe know definitively there are provisions that will create more jobs \nimmediately because of pending projects, then doesn't it make sense to \ninclude them in this legislation? It will spur economic activity or \nspur consumption, and it will reduce our dependency on imported oil.\n  Investment incentives for small businesses will also be included in \nthis legislation to work in conjunction with other initiatives through \njob creation by providing for expensing for small businesses so they \ncan write off more of their capital investments or be able to use the \nextended carryback of operating losses and extending that period from 2 \nto 5 years so they can reach back further. They have their choice of \nincentives, whatever works for a company. They may be in a struggling \nsituation, and they can write off their losses of current years against \ntheir profits of past years. It makes sense to put these provisions and \nincentives in one single package that will help to spur the economy.\n  In addition, of course, is the bonus depreciation as well--another \ndimension of economic investment that can make a difference in serving \nas a catalyst in our economy.\n  Finally, in this legislation, we include a provision that was omitted \nin the House of Representatives package, and that is one that would \nmake sure our disabled veterans benefit from the stimulus package, \nbenefit from the rebates.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, for initiating this amendment. \nI joined her in that effort in the Finance Committee because we thought \nthat was a major omission, to exclude more than 250,000 of our Nation's \nservice disabled veterans because their compensation is not taxable. We \nwanted to make sure they should be able to participate in the stimulus \nplan. Our disabled veterans deserve to be part of the rebate plan, and \nthis package makes sure that happens. I appreciate my colleagues on the \ncommittee who supported this pivotal provision.\n  This legislation casts a wide economic net, and that makes it more \nequitable, especially to the most vulnerable among us in America. It \ndoesn't merely represent sound economics to propel this stimulus, but \nit is also in greater alignment with Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, \nwho said that a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly \nand structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as \nmuch as possible in the next 12 months or so. The measure we will be \nconsidering and debating does affect the aggregate. It does ensure that \nits impact is felt as much as possible, and it does so on a more \naccelerated timetable.\n  The tax rebate incorporated in this legislation is obviously central, \nand the refundability makes it all the more effective. That is why I \nwas a strong advocate in ensuring that refundability was part of the \nstimulus package, that it certainly had to be included to make sure the \nlow-income and middle-income Americans and households would have the \nability to have the benefits of any rebate because it would also make a \ndifference in stimulating our economy because two-thirds of consumer \nspending is really what drives our economy. It is the economic engine. \nWe depend on consumer spending to drive our economy. So the \nrefundability portion is very important because it will make sure those \npeople who benefit from this rebate are ones who also need this rebate. \nThey need it to pay for the necessities of daily life, given spiraling \ncosts in terms of oil, food, and gasoline. We want to make sure we can \nmitigate the impact of this declining economy and the rising costs in \ntheir households.\n  When we had various witnesses before the committee, we talked about \nthe effectiveness of the refundable tax rebate. In fact, the Hamilton \nProject, which was conducted by economists at Brookings Institution, \nnoted that a one-time tax rebate equal to 1 percent of the GDP, which \nis about $140 billion in today's economy, and directed at households \nlikely to spend money would boost the level of GDP by 1 percent or more \nfor two consecutive quarters, increasing the annualized GDP growth rate \nby about 4 percent in the first quarter of the effect.\n  So if the aim of this bill is to arm American consumers with \nadditional money to stimulate consumer spending, it is integral that \nthis benefit is extended to the 20 million working families and the 20 \nmillion seniors who were omitted from the House bill who are more \nlikely to spend the money that will be included in the stimulus \npackage.\n  The package which is before the Senate which was enacted by the \nFinance Committee will be absolutely vital to low-income Americans and \nto seniors who otherwise would not have benefited from the package \nwhich was enacted in the House. So, again, the Senate Finance Committee \npackage builds upon the provisions that were incorporated in the House \nlegislation and are strengthened in the package that was marked up in \nthe Senate yesterday.\n  I think it is absolutely critical that we make sure no one is left \nbehind when it comes to benefiting from this rebate that is directed at \nlow-income and middle-income households because they are the ones who \nare most likely to spend this rebate because of the driving costs of, \nas I said, oil and food and the daily necessities of life.\n\n  I also think it is important to extend the unemployment benefits, as \nI said\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\nearlier. The fact remains that the unemployment rate for the long term \nis twice as high as it was in the recession in 2002. We included \nextension of unemployment benefits. After all, if the purpose of this \npackage is to put in place the fiscal tools to make sure we can do \neverything within our power to avert a potential recession, then we \nhave to make sure these tools are absolutely in place to make sure we \ncan avoid a potential decline in our economy that leads to a recession.\n  In my home State alone, the case for an extension is undeniable. As \nthe State department of labor reported, the announced layoffs for \nFebruary and March are up an unconscionable 75 percent over the layoffs \nthat occurred in December and January. Unemployment is increasing, \ncertainly in my State. We have seen it reflected in the recent numbers. \nWe have no way of knowing the extent to which it will get worse, but we \ndo know by all accounts and certainly by the economic indicators, by \nthe general consensus of economists, that a recession is a potential, \nthat it could potentially be imminent in the short term. So all the \nmore important to put in place a provision to extend unemployment \nbenefits because it will have the maximum effect in our economy to \nimpact direct spending. Also, I think it is important that it will \nstimulate the economy. In fact, Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy said that \nevery dollar spent now on unemployment will result in an infusion in \nthe economy of more than $1.64 cents.\n  So the beneficiaries of this extension certainly will be those who \nhave been unemployed for the long term, who have seen their benefits \nexpire. If they have already exhausted their 26 weeks of benefits, they \nwill have an additional 13 weeks. For those high-unemployment States, \nwhich is triggered at 6 percent or more, they will then get an \nadditional 13 weeks of benefits. It would provide an immediate infusion \nof cash through a very reliable mechanism that is already in place to \nthe people who very likely will spend that money on consumer goods.\n  The fact is that long-term unemployment is twice as high today as it \nwas in 2001 and the 2002 recession at a time when oil was only $25 a \nbarrel, and today we have seen it is almost $100 a barrel. We cannot \nafford to ignore this potentially dire situation which this long-term \nunemployment rate poses. That is why I think it is absolutely important \nthat we do everything we can to ensure that a stimulus package includes \nthe extension of unemployment benefits.\n  I also am pleased that we have energy tax incentives, as I said \nearlier, as well. Energy production tax credits will be extended in the \nfirst quarter of this year. By all industry estimates, it is indicated \nthat we could create more than 100,000 jobs. I know in my own State of \nMaine, with some of the investments that have already been made in wind \npower, for example, there is more than $1.5 billion worth of projects \nthat are pending, that are waiting for this energy tax credit.\n  We know that in the final analysis, we are going to enact an energy \ntax credit that will cultivate the renewable sources of energy we need \nto generate in this country so we can reduce our dependency on foreign \noil. What better way to do it than through tax credits. We know they \nhave worked, and we know that later this year we will be considering \nthese energy tax credits to extend them. So why not extend them now if \nwe are certain it is going to create jobs? As I said, by industry \naccounts, the experts have estimated that more than 100,000 jobs will \nbe created as a result of these tax credits.\n  So it is unquestionable in terms of the benefits economically, it is \nunquestionable in terms of the benefits to our energy security and our \nindependence, which is inextricably linked to economic security and \nprogress. I do not think anybody in this Chamber can believe that \nlessening our dependence on oil and lowering its price per barrel, \nwhich these approaches will facilitate, will not prove to be an \nimmediate boon to our economy. So these incentives are necessary, in my \nopinion, because they also address the root causes of our current \ndownturn.\n  I hope, in the final analysis, when we get to the question of a \nstimulus package, we will also include financing for low-income fuel \nassistance.\n  Two years ago, I advanced a billion-dollar initiative in increasing \nfinancing for low-income fuel assistance. At that time, heating oil was \n$2.44 a gallon. Today, our families, households are paying an \ninconceivable, incomprehensible increase of $3.45 a gallon--nearly \n$3,000 just to get through a winter. The average resident in the State \nof Maine uses about 850 gallons to 1,000 gallons, so that cost is near \n$3,000. The eligibility income for low-income fuel assistance is \napproximately $13,000. It takes more than a quarter of their income to \npay for heating their home--more than a quarter of their income, of the \n$13,000. It is absolutely inconceivable that any family could live on \n$13,000 and pay more than a quarter of their income toward home heating \noil that continues to rise as we speak when we are talking $3.45 a \ngallon.\n  It is only right we fund this indispensable program. We have provided \nsome increases. It is clear we need to do more, and what better way to \nstimulate the economy and to ensure households have the benefit of an \nincrease in low-income fuel assistance than providing it as part of the \nstimulus package, particularly at the time of crisis for households in \nthe cold weather regions of this country. I know there will be an \namendment offered at the time we are considering the stimulus package.\n  Finally, I wish to mention as ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee that there are two vital provisions, as I said earlier, \nregarding small business expensing and the extending of the carryback \nperiod of operating losses from 2 to 5 years. They are critically \nimportant initiatives because they certainly will be a great catalyst \nfor the generation of jobs in America. Small businesses are the key to \njob creation in this country, key to our economy. They are responsible \nfor creating two-thirds of all new jobs in America. They represent 99 \npercent of all of our employers. They represent half of the employees \nin this country, so they are pivotal to the success or failure of our \neconomy. The more we can invest in small business, the more we will see \nthe benefits in terms of job creation. That is indisputable by any \nmeasurement, by any account; that they are able to create the kind of \njobs directly that benefit our economy, benefit the people we \nrepresent, and they can make that investment quickly.\n\n  That is certainly true when it comes to expensing, where they will be \nable to write off up to $250,000 in this initiative, where they will be \nable to use bonus depreciation, for example, and other important \ninvestments for capital incentives, and also as well for the carryback \nperiod, in extending and reaching back to 5 years. Any one of these \ninitiatives or in combination is going to be absolutely vital to \nhelping generate new jobs in our economy and helping to mitigate the \ndownturn in our economy.\n  The gravity and the urgency of our economic situation cannot be \noverstated, and it unquestionably requires swift and decisive action. \nSo I hope at the time we consider this stimulus package, there will be \nstrong support for the initiative that passed the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand the leaders may well be \ncoming to the floor here in the next few minutes, and certainly when \nthey arrive I will defer to them for the business about which I know \nthey will want to inform the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S526-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S526-S528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to talk about the global war on \nterror here for the next few minutes, and to recount some very good \nprogress we happen to be making in Iraq and that the Iraqis appear to \nbe making. I realize that because the news is not as bad as it once \nwas, it has now fallen off the front page of the newspaper. Yet I think \nit is very important not only to our national security but because we \nare being asked to support our men and women in uniform in a variety of \nways that we keep close track of the developments occurring both in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq. That is the subject of my comments.\n  First, I acknowledge a report from the Associated Press indicating \nthat\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\none of al-Qaida's top commanders in Afghanistan, and a key liaison of \nthe Taliban, Abu Laith al-Libi, was apparently killed in military \naction at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Reports indicate he is \nactually the fourth person in command of the al-Qaida and the Taliban, \nright after Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and Mullah Omar, \ndemonstrating that we continue to take the fight on the offensive \nagainst the very people who are responsible for perpetrating the murder \nof 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001.\n  I believe one of the reasons why we have not had a repetition of that \nhorrific day on our own soil is because of the skill of our men and \nwomen in uniform, the weapons we have equipped them with, and the \nintelligence they have been able to gather that allows us to detect and \ndeter terrorist activities not only on our soil but in Afghanistan \nagainst ours and allied troops, as well as Iraq. I think that is a bit \nof good news that we ought to acknowledge.\n  Secondly, let me say the reason I wanted to come to the floor was \nprecipitated by my visit in January to both Afghanistan and Iraq, where \nI had a chance to not only meet with Texas troops who are fighting in \nboth of those countries but also military commanders from my State and \nacross the United States, and to learn more as a Senator and member of \nthe Armed Services Committee about the progress in both Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  I was pleased to meet with GEN Raymond Odierno, from Fort Hood, TX, \nwho is basically the second in command for General Petraeus, head of \nMultinational Forces, and who I know will be returning, along with many \nTexans, to Fort Hood in February, much to his family's pleasure. I know \nafter all the time General Odierno has spent in Iraq, his family will \nbe glad he is coming home, and particularly after the good news that \nwas reported to me there and that I want to summarize here.\n  The good news is that, as General Odierno said in a story in the \nWashington Post, reported today, we are going to be bringing back about \n40,000 troops from the height of the surge until next summer, and then \nhave what General Odierno called a strategic pause to sort of assess \nthe stability of the military and security environment in Iraq. Of \ncourse, the hope is always that we can continue to bring more and more \ntroops home, but as I heard in Iraq over and over, as the Iraqis stand \nup, we will stand down. That was the plan all along. But again, good \nnews.\n  General Odierno, in this article, was asked: Do you consider Iraq \nfragile? We have heard that phrase used over and over. While we have \nbeen successful, and the Iraqis have been successful, the conditions \nare still somewhat fragile. General Odierno was quoted in this article \nas saying: I think if we move forward with operational patience, it \nisn't that fragile. But he continued. I think if we leave tomorrow, it \nwould be very fragile--which underscores, to my way of thinking, the \nimportance of us drawing down our troops based on conditions on the \nground and not based on some arbitrary or political timetable. If we \ndid that, if we drew the troops down in a precipitous fashion based on \nsome deadline we impose, without regard to circumstances on the ground, \nin General Odierno's terms, that would create a fragile security \nsituation and perhaps even reverse the significant gains that have been \nmade.\n  We see another bit of good news, and this is in the Mideast Stars and \nStripes today, that an operation led by Iraqi forces and supported by \nAmerican troops has reopened the main highway linking Baghdad and Dyala \nProvince after 16 months of being in insurgents' hands. That is good \nnews, and another reversal for al-Qaida and the insurgency in Iraq.\n  This chart indicates the locations of al-Qaida in Iraq in December \n2006 and the battle of Baghdad that led to the actual surge. You will \nsee, Madam President, on my left here--to your right--the improvements \ndemonstrated by the shrinking of the red areas, which indicates the \npresence of al-Qaida in Iraq in December of 2007. This is presurge; \nthis is postsurge. Not only is this a surge of American troops, but \nduring the same period of time in which we surged additional American \ntroops, there were an additional 100,000 Iraqi policemen and military \nrecruited and trained, as well as some 70,000 citizens in these \nconcerned local citizen councils.\n\n  We have heard about the Anbar awakening, where people who had thrown \ntheir cause in with al-Qaida had finally gotten tired of their barbaric \npractices and their treachery and had begun to cooperate with Americans \nand Iraqi forces. That has led to what I would call--some have called--\na concerned local citizens council. I have told people it reminds me of \na neighborhood watch on steroids. What it does is provide intelligence \nas to the locations of improvised explosive devices, and perhaps \ninsurgent or terrorist activity, which has allowed our troops and the \nIraqi troops to work with the local citizens to help shrink the \ninfluence of al-Qaida in Iraq, as indicated by the comparison between \nthis chart on my right in December of 2006, presurge, and postsurge \n2007, in December. So that is obviously good news.\n  We also have four snapshots of sectarian violence in the city of \nBaghdad. You will recall that at one point we heard from some Members \non the floor that the Iraqis were on the verge of a civil war because \nof the ethnosectarian violence. You will see here that from December \n2006, as indicated by the yellow and red, how much of Baghdad was \nconsumed by sectarian violence. This, of course, had all along been the \naim of al-Qaida, to incite the sectarian hatred and violence in a way \nthat would consume Iraq. And we saw, in December 2006, that was \nunfortunately enormously successful. But you can see from December 2006 \nto December 2007, presurge to postsurge, how these areas of yellow \nactivity are shrunk, and virtually none of the red, the highly \nintensive sectarian violence, is occurring.\n  So here we see, in a very remarkable contrast from presurge and \npostsurge, a reduction in ethnosectarian violence, a dramatic \nimprovement, and perhaps best evidenced by the fact that many refugees \nare moving back from other places to their homes in these areas.\n  Finally, perhaps most demonstrative of our success is these charts \nwhich indicate an overall drop in attack trends. This chart starts in \nDecember of 2006 and ends in December 2007, indicating a tremendous \nreduction--by about two-thirds--in the number of overall attacks in \nIraq. Again, a significant improvement.\n  I think those are all the charts I have, but let me say that I also \nacknowledge the tremendous success the Iraqis have made when it comes \nto political reconciliation. That is another thing that, of course, we \nall had hoped for. In our meetings with Iraqi leaders--Shiites, Sunnis, \nand Kurds--we said: Congratulations on the success of this surge of \nIraqis and multinational forces, leading to an improved security \nsituation. But Senator Coleman and Senator Isakson and I, in our visit \nthere, told Iraqi leaders: Now you need to continue your political \nsurge, now that the security situation has improved considerably.\n  We know as a result of the improved security situation that the \nIraqis have now begun a sort of political reconciliation, both at the \nlocal, or tribal, level and at the provincial level, which has led to \ngreater security, but also at the national level. They have passed, \nfinally, one of the benchmark pieces of legislation that many Members \nof Congress had urged them to pass from time to time, known as the \ndebaathification reforms. The Iraqi Council representatives passed what \nthey called the accountability and justice law, which represents a \nsignificant step forward in the political reconciliation between the \nvarious sects and bringing back into the Government, back into society, \nsome of the baathists who are at the local level--after they have been \nvetted to make sure they are no longer a threat. Because of Saddam \nHussein's influence, people could not teach in schools, could not \nengage in civil life unless they were a member of the Baath party. \nWell, thanks to the Iraqi Council of Representatives, they now have an \nopportunity to reengage in civic life in Iraq in a way that is very \nimportant.\n  We also know the Iraqi leaders have passed a budget and an important \npension law. Recently, Iraqi health care providers gathered in Baghdad \nfor a 2-day medical conference, the first of its kind in more than 15 \nyears.\n  Madam President, I know we have other colleagues wishing to speak \nhere\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\non the floor, and I am about through with my comments, but I think it \nis worth reminding ourselves and reminding the American people what the \nimpact has been of this surge of American and Iraqi forces thanks to \nthe counterinsurgency strategy devised and deployed by GEN David \nPetraeus. I had an opportunity to see General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker in Baghdad. They are pleased with the success they have seen, \nboth militarily and from a diplomatic perspective. But they obviously \nrecognize that things still need to continue on the trend toward \nimproved relations, and the Iraqis need to continue their political \nreconciliation.\n  I think it is very important, as the story of Iraq tends to go from \nthe front page to perhaps the middle of the newspaper, or from the top \nof the evening news into perhaps not even being the subject of a news \nstory, that we recall for ourselves and for all Americans the \ncontributions our brave men and women in uniform have made.\n  This will not only protect our vital national security interests but \nmake sure other people across the world, in places such as Afghanistan \nand Iraq, can enjoy the blessings of liberty. To me that has been one \nof the most noble things America has continued to contribute, even to \npeople whom our young troops have not met, to be able to deliver to \nthem the opportunity to live in peace and to achieve their potential.\n  To me, that is one of the greatest things about this country of ours, \nthat people will put themselves in harm's way, they will risk death \nitself or serious injury to help other people enjoy those blessings of \nliberty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S528-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S528-S529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ARMY SUICIDES\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about a \nsubject that is very important to all of us. I listened to the Senator \nfrom Texas lamenting the fact that the war in Iraq has not been on the \nfront pages of the paper recently.\n  Well, I am here today to say: Actually, it has been. In fact, on the \nfront page of the Washington Post today, an article, ``Soldier Suicides \nat Record Levels. Increase Linked to Long Wars, Lack of Army \nResources.''\n  We are hearing several news outlets today reporting on the front \npages of papers and in headlines that suicides among our Active-Duty \nsoldiers are at the highest rates since the Army began keeping records \nback in 1980.\n  According to those reports, 121 soldiers took their own lives last \nyear. That is nearly 20 percent more than in 2006. The number of \nattempted suicides and self-inflicted injuries has dramatically \nincreased since the start of this Iraq war. Those findings are tragic.\n  I know all our hearts go out to those families, their friends, and to \nthe fellow soldiers of each one of those service men and women. Our \ngreat servicemembers who face deployment after deployment without the \nrest, recovery, and treatment they need are at the breaking point.\n  Many of them have seen their best friends killed, they have seen \nother untold horrors. Yet we still are expecting them to head back to \nthe battlefield to perform unaffected by what they have seen or gone \nthrough.\n  While military suicide is back in the press today, those of us who \ntravel across our States, who go home and talk to servicemembers and \nveterans who are struggling with mental health care, we know this is an \nissue, we know it all too well. We know that for family members who \nlive through this tragedy, the pain stays long after those headlines \nfade.\n  We owe it to our servicemembers and their families to be outraged \nwhen these numbers are going up and up and up and not down. We owe it \nto them to demand action. On Monday, in his State of the Union Address, \nthe President called on us, Congress, to improve the system of care for \nour wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and \ndignity.\n  Well, Congress has given the military hundreds of millions of dollars \nto improve its mental health care system. We have worked hard and \npushed through legislation to require the military and the VA to \ndestigmatize mental health treatment, to help increase the awareness of \nthe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and do further reach on \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  But it takes more than money being thrown at the problem, it takes \nleadership and it takes a change in the culture of war. The President \ncan make all the platitudes he wants, but as Commander in Chief, he \nneeds to lead by example and show he understands what these never-\nending deployments are doing to our troops and to our veterans.\n  While the Department of Defense has taken some action, today's report \nmakes me deeply concerned that progress has not been made and that \nthese programs have not been implemented throughout the system. Some of \nour soldiers are telling us all they get is a 1-800 number to call if \nthey need help.\n  Well, many soldiers need a real person to talk to. They need \npsychiatrists and they need psychologists who understand the horrors of \nwar and the stresses these troops feel after serving their third or \ntheir fourth or even their fifth tour of duty in an urban theater.\n  Too many of our troops today say they cannot even get the military to \nunderstand when they are crying out for help. As I said, the Washington \nPost reported this morning on the military suicides, with an update on \nLieutenant Whiteside. The Post wrote about this case the first time in \nDecember. She is the 25-year-old medic, an Army medic who attempted \nsuicide in theater. Then she was charged by her superiors with \nendangering another soldier.\n  Now, I met with her father before the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee when we were hearing the nomination of General Peake. \nLieutenant Whiteside had experienced a mental breakdown from stress \nserving in Iraq and she suffered from ``demonstrably severe \ndepression,'' according to her doctors.\n  But the story revealed that medical opinion was brushed aside in her \ncase and her superiors in the field said: ``Mental illness is an \nexcuse.''\n  Well, this past Monday, she was awaiting the Army's decision whether \nshe was going to be court-martialed or not, and she swallowed dozens of \npills in another suicide attempt. The Post reported today she left a \nnote that explained: ``I am very disappointed in the Army.''\n  According to this article, Lieutenant Whiteside is now in stable \nphysical condition and the charges have finally been dismissed.\n\n  But, unfortunately, she is not the only soldier who has struggled to \nget the Defense Department to understand the real trauma of military \nservice. Her story and the statistics that are being reported today are \na reflection of something many of my colleagues and I have said over \nand over: A prolonged war has stretched our military thin and is taking \na tragic toll on the brave men and women who serve in our all-volunteer \nArmy and military. They deserve more.\n  Some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have raised concerns that \nprolonged and repeated deployments are placing the overall health of \nour servicemembers at risk. David Rudd, who is the chairman of the \nDepartment of Psychology at Texas Tech University and a former Army \npsychologist, was quoted in this article this morning as saying the \nArmy suicide rates pose:\n\n       Real questions about whether you can have an Army this size \n     with multiple deployments.\n\n  Over the past weeks, both the President and White House officials \nhave hinted that a reduction of troops in Iraq is likely only \ntemporary. As a result, I continue to be very concerned about the \nreadiness of our military and our ability to sustain these wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  I think we need to ask the question: With the reality of today's \nreports and the knowledge that extended troop deployments are \nstretching our military readiness, I want to know, what is the \nPentagon's plan to address and decrease the number of Army suicides and \nsuicide attempts?\n  This afternoon, I wrote a letter to Secretary Gates, and I asked him \nthat question. I want to hear his response. We need to know that the \nchange in culture is more than a talking point; we need to know and be \nassured our senior leaders in the military are ensuring that their \nwords and programs are being executed out in the field.\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\n  Our troops are heroes who are sacrificing for this Nation. It is time \nfor this Government to wake up and provide them with the care they \nneed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to one of \nthe best soldiers we have ever had in the Senate, the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray. No one looks out for the troops more than she \ndoes. Her statement today is certainly reflective of a problem we have \nwith suicide, which I know something about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S529-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LYLE SENDLEIN\n\n  I want to make one brief correction in the statement I gave this \nmorning--not a correction, an addition. I talked about National \nFootball League players and how they are not treated right, the old-\ntimers who have been hurt playing professional football.\n  I talked about someone I went to high school with by the name of \nRupert Sendlein, who was a fine high school football player. But his \nson was an All American at the University of Texas, played many years \nof professional football.\n  What I said this morning is that his grandson, Rupert's grandson, \nLyle, was also a star All-American football player at the University of \nTexas. What I failed to mention is he started a number of games this \nyear for the Phoenix Cardinals. He is much bigger than his father and \nhis grandfather. He is 6 feet 6 inches, weighs 310 pounds, and is also \na professional football player. I want the Record to reflect that I \nforgot to mention he was playing professional football.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S529-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S529-S530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  There will be no rollcall votes today. I am disappointed we have had \none rollcall vote all week. There is no reason to point fingers. It \nsometimes happens. We have two extremely difficult areas of \nlegislation, one dealing with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nand the other dealing with the stimulus package. These two things have \nbeen very difficult to work out.\n  I have been told, with the last conversation I had with the Speaker, \nas a matter of fact, to try to work out one of the chinks we had on our \nside with the FISA legislation. I think that is worked out on our side. \nYou never know what is going to come up.\n  But that is the way it is. It is my understanding the Republicans are \ngoing to now, once the agreement has been written, they are going to \nhotline that and see if we can get that done. But regardless of that, \nthe Republican leader and I spoke a while ago, and we hope we can get \nthis done so it will give us a way to end this early next week.\n  But there will be no votes today. It would not be fair to everyone to \nstart on this bill, as we would not be able to do it for another 45 \nminutes or an hour the way things go.\n  I wish to say a couple things. The package we got from the Senate \nFinance Committee yesterday deserves the attention of the American \npeople and deserves the attention of this body, Democrats and \nRepublicans. Why? Because it is a stimulus package. Is there anything \nwrong with the House package? Of course not. It is a good package. But \nours is so much better. If we are talking about stimulating the \neconomy, I think we need to understand that 21.5 million seniors will \nstimulate that economy. And they would get one of these rebates, all \n21.5 million of them.\n  If we are concerned about stimulating the economy, who would spend it \nmore than disabled veterans? We have 250,000 disabled veterans who are \npart of our package. That is important and that is good.\n  Unemployment benefits. I am not here to boast about it, but my State, \nthe State of Nevada, for the first time in a long time, has a problem \nwith unemployment. We had, for 20 years, the most booming housing \nmarket in the country.\n  People thought they were economic geniuses. They were buying homes \nand selling them. But when the downturn came, almost half the people \nwho are in foreclosure did not live in the home. They are buying them \nfor speculation purposes. They made a lot of money in the previous \nyears, but the man came to the door and said: You cannot do that \nanymore.\n  So unemployment is a difficult problem we have. I visited this \nafternoon with the labor leaders of southern Nevada and northern \nNevada. We have a real problem. Unemployment benefits are part of the \nSenate Finance Committee package. It is important and deserves a vote. \nWe are going to have one on this at the right time.\n  Also, housing. The President in his State of the Union message talked \nabout a number of items. One of the things he talked about was to set \nup a tax-free bond provision. In the past, most of these bonds have \nbeen used to build new homes. Well, we are not building new homes.\n  So what the President wants and Senator John Kerry wants is to use \nthese bonds to refinance homes. A great idea. The President likes it. \nWe like it. That is part of the Senate Finance Committee package.\n  We also have in this package something, again, being very provincial, \ntalking about something important to the State of Nevada, renewables. \nWe have to ween ourselves from this oil that we get from despots around \nthe world. Venezuela, and some of the most tyrannical governments in \nthe world in the Middle East. They are shipping us oil every day and \naround the rest of the world. Venezuela, interestingly enough, the \nleader of Venezuela comes to the United Nations and calls our President \nnames.\n  Now, the fact is, before the United Nations, on American soil, no one \nshould have the right to call my President names like this man did. \nWhat we should have told him is: Keep your oil.\n  We couldn't do that. We depend on his oil. We depend on Venezuelan \noil.\n  This legislation that is coming from the Senate Finance Committee \nsets up some tax incentives for people to develop renewable fuels. \nPeople say: Is that going to stimulate the economy? You bet. If we \nprovide tax incentives for these companies, they will start investing \ntomorrow--tomorrow--which means jobs; not scores of jobs, not hundreds \nof jobs, not thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs. In the \nlittle town of Searchlight, NV, where I am from, I got a call when I \nwas home from Senator Richard Bryan. He owns some property a few miles \nout of Searchlight. He said: They want to put up some windmills on your \nproperty. Do you want them to do that?\n  I said: Look, I don't want anyone to think I am getting any money \nfrom windmills, so have them put up all the windmills they want. I \ndon't want anything from it. So put up the windmills.\n  Now I understand they are going to put as many as 200 of these huge \nwindmills near my town of Searchlight. These windmills would be maybe \n2\\1/2\\ miles from my home. Good, 200 megawatts of electricity. And they \nare waiting for tax incentives. Right now we have tax incentives for a \nvery short period of time. What we have done with the Senate-passed \nprovision, it will extend some of them up to 2 years because there is \nalready a year to go on some of them.\n  Also extremely important, the business package is something for which \nthe business community is clamoring. The House package has some good \ntax incentives in it for small business and businesses, but ours is \nbetter. This is in no way to criticize what the House did, but it is \nalso underlining how good our package is. So we are going to work to \npass the Finance Committee bill.\n  I have been told--I got a couple Blackberries today--by Members of \nthe minority, the Republicans, surprisingly, but I don't want to \nmention names on the floor because things can always change--but I was \nsurprised that people are supporting this, Republicans are supporting \nour package. So I think we can get 60 votes. If not, we are sure going \nto try. I think as time goes on and people look at what we have done, \nit is going to become even more appetizing. It is going to be better \neach day that goes by. So we will get to this legislation long before \nthe cutoff date that I said we would complete it; that is, February 15. \nWe have 15 days to go. We are going to finish this bill, I would hope, \nearly next week or sometime next week. We are certainly going to try.\n  One of the calls I got today was from AARP. This organization, I \ndon't know how many members they have, but millions. The one thing they \nhave identified this past year is this. This is going\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\nto bring the AARP out to tell every Senator, all 100 of us, that this \nis the most important thing they have had in a long time before the \nSenate. It will give 21\\1/2\\ million seniors a few dollars to spend to \nmake this economy better. We are going to do it as expeditiously as we \ncan. We believe it is the right thing to do, and we are going to move \nalong in that manner.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I now withdraw the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, let me say, I appreciate the patience of my \ncounterpart, Senator McConnell. On Tuesday, I can't really say this; we \nweren't that close. But all day Wednesday, all day today, we have been \nthis close. We have had the FISA thing worked out so many different \ntimes, and each time--not each time but a number of those times I \neither sent a message to the distinguished Republican leader or \nactually called him, sent him a letter. I have really tried very hard \nto finish this. I want to do it because we have a February 15 cutoff \ndate. I don't want to jam the minority, and I don't want to jam the \nHouse. I think we have an obligation as a body to get something over \nthere as quickly as possible, ``over there'' meaning to the House. \nBecause once that happens, I would like to think that then it is up to \nthe House and the Senate to work this out. But we know how conferences \nwork. The White House is going to be heavily involved in what the final \nproduct is because there is no need, at least in my estimation, to pass \nsomething that has ``veto'' written all over it. If it comes to that, \nthen I can accept a veto. But at least we need to give the White House \nan opportunity, after we pass whatever we do here, and the House has \nalready done their work, that when we do this conference, we know and \nhave input from the White House. If the decision is made after that, we \nare going to just go forward anyway. That is what we do. But I want to \nmake sure everyone understands, I am trying to do this as fairly as I \ncan, recognizing there are heavy emotions on both sides of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act extension we are trying to do. There are \ndivisions within the Democratic caucus. Not all Democrats agree how it \nshould be handled. That is why we have worked so hard coming up with \nthis agreement to move forward on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I certainly don't fault the majority \nleader, but this has indeed been an exasperating week. We had our one \nand only vote last Monday and have had none since. At that time I was \noptimistic that we were on the cusp of two important bipartisan \naccomplishments at the beginning of the second session of the 110th on \ntwo extraordinarily important issues. We had seen on the stimulus side \nan example of the administration and the Speaker of the House and the \nRepublican leader of the House coming together behind a package and \npassing it in record time, by a stunning, overwhelming majority, and \nsending it over to us. We have appeared to be on the verge of getting a \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act out of the Senate basically in \nthe same form it came out of the Intelligence Committee, 13 to 2, a \nRockefeller-Bond proposal which the President has indicated he would \nsign.\n  My optimism waned somewhat during the course of the week, but I heard \nmy dear friend, the majority leader, reiterate once again that he \nthinks we can finish both of these jobs, and finish them soon, and \nhopefully get back about that on Monday. I am hoping for a better week \nnext week. We are ever so close to achieving something important for \nthe country in two areas that are of great concern to the American \npeople, the state of our economy on the one hand and protecting us from \nterrorists on the other. Hopefully, next week will be a better week.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express some disappointment with \nsome items that we were not able to accomplish last year. I hope we \nwill quickly turn to these priorities the first thing this year.\n  My wife Diana and I travel to different parts of Wyoming most \nweekends. The No. 1 issue on people's minds is health care. Well, maybe \nit is the economy. But when they talk about the economy, they are \ntalking about health care. They may be talking about some housing \ncrunches. They may be talking about some other things. But I can tell \nyou that to a person they think health care is a big part of the \neconomy, and health care is someplace that we ought to be doing \nsomething. They all ask me what I am doing to make sure they have \nhealth care. I tell them about the things I am doing to increase \naccess, to decrease costs, to promote informed choices, and to ensure \nthat health care is more affordable, and everyone gets it.\n  I also want to say, everyone understands it. Our constituents deserve \nour help. I hope we are able to really do something on health care \nearly this year. This doesn't need to be the subject of every debate by \nthe Presidential candidates. There is a lot of overlap in what the \nPresidential candidates are saying. The people don't want to wait until \nNovember in order to be able to wait until the next year in order to \nwait for us to do something. There is plenty of things out there that \ncan be done. So I hope we are able to do something about health care, \nand do it now.\n  It is time for real action. All eyes are on this Congress to get \nsomething done. After this last week of having one vote, I think they \nare hoping we can either get FISA done or maybe we can get a stimulus \npackage done. Get something done. Maybe it would be easier to be doing \nsomething in the area of health care. That is a big concern of theirs.\n  It is shameful we haven't been able to make sure that all Americans \nhave access to affordable health insurance. I am saying: Do something. \nThe people of Wyoming are saying to me: Do something. Even if it is \nwrong, it will at least be something. And it might help.\n  Now, as the senior Republican on the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, I spend a lot of time working on solutions to our \nhealth care crisis. I have even talked to\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\nmany of the people in this body who have an idea on health care. I have \nbeen collecting those ideas. I took those ideas, and I put them in a \npackage--a package of steps that could achieve what I am talking about, \nwhich is access to affordable health insurance for every American. Any \none of those steps would improve the situation.\n  Why did I put it in steps? Well, I have noticed when we are trying to \ndo something comprehensive around here that one piece of the package \nwill have 5 people who are opposed, another piece of the package will \nhave 8 people who are opposed, another one will have 11 people who are \nopposed, and another one 7. Pretty quickly you are at 51. You cannot \npass something unless you have 51 who are for it.\n  So if we do the steps a step at a time--granted, it is not as grand \nand as promising for publicity, but if we do them a step at a time, if \nthere are 5 people who do not like it, it is 95 to 5. That is pretty \npassable around here, and it makes progress. And chances are pretty \ngood those people will express what their concerns are, and it might be \npossible to work out some of those.\n  You would be surprised how many times on this Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions we are able to go with a third way and \nfigure out something that solves a problem for somebody without \nupsetting everybody else. I would be willing to bet over the last 3 \nyears we have had more pieces of legislation passed from that committee \nunanimously than any other committee, and it has always been one of the \nmost contentious committees in the Senate. But it is also a committee \nwhere people work together to come up with solutions. That is why I \ncollected these ideas from people.\n  We have had a number of hearings over the last 3 years that dealt \nwith this issue. There are solutions that are available. So if you look \nat my Web site, you will find ``Ten Steps to Transform Health Care in \nAmerica,'' which would fix many of the common complaints I hear from my \nconstituents. Now, I am not going to go into all the details of that \nbill today. But I would encourage everyone to look at my Web site, \nwhich is www.enzi.senate.gov, to learn more about the bill. This is a \npossibility.\n  Now, there are a lot of transformations that can be done on it, but \nthis has 10 possibilities for ways we can improve health care in \nAmerica. I have to say, there are ideas from both sides of the aisle. I \ntry not to get into a polarized situation where we are saying this is \nthe Republican way, and then have somebody else say this is the \nDemocrat way, and the two never meet. We have to meet. We have to solve \nthe problems. So take a look at that www.enzi.senate.gov Web site and \nsend your letters and comments and talk to me personally, those of you \nin the Senate.\n  If this bill were to become law, the end result would be an insurance \ncard for everyone. Now, lots of people have insurance cards. Members of \nCongress have them. People who work in big companies have them. The \nkids in Wyoming who participate in the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP, have them. Lots of people have them. Most of \nthose people who have insurance cards are pretty happy with the care \nthey are getting.\n  This part of the bill would not change that. If you have an insurance \ncard now, you can keep that card, and you can keep getting the exact \nsame care you are getting now. The problem is, 47 million or so \nAmericans do not have an insurance card. This bill gives all of those \npeople insurance cards. If they cannot afford the cards because they \nare low income, one step helps them out by giving them the money they \nneed to purchase the insurance card. The bottom line is, everyone has a \ncard and everyone will be able to get the care they need.\n  Now, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said \nthe only way to give everyone an insurance card is to give all \nAmericans a Medicare card. I have to disagree with that. The Federal \nGovernment should be the payer of last resort, not the primary \npurchaser.\n  When my wife and I are traveling in my home State of Wyoming, we \nvisit a lot of senior centers. During these visits, I always hear about \nproblems with Medicare. Some seniors get upset that the cost keeps \ngoing up. Some seniors tell me they cannot find a doctor who takes \nMedicare anymore. Some seniors tell me the way the Government runs the \nprogram is confusing. Some seniors tell me it takes them months to hear \nback from Medicare when they have problems.\n  Now, I also have a lot of doctors and pharmacists--not nearly as many \nas we would like to have. We have a huge health care provider shortage \nin Wyoming, including veterinarians. I mention that a lot. We keep \ntrying to encourage them to come, and we are having some success at it, \nbut we have a huge problem. I tour the hospitals, the hospice \norganizations, the nursing facilities, and the rehabilitation centers.\n  The one consistent message all these folks relay to me is that \nMedicare does not pay them enough. Sometimes I even hear stories about \nhow they do not get paid enough to cover their own costs. You cannot \nstay in business on volume if you cannot cover your costs. And this is \nnot a volume business. This is one where it is one person at a time. \nSome folks are even closing their doors and going out of business \nbecause they cannot afford to keep their doors open under Medicare.\n  They do not like the Government telling them what they can and cannot \ndo. They do not like the Government prescribing how they practice \nmedicine. With all the problems in this program, why would Congress \nmultiply the problems giving every American a Medicare card?\n  I have to tell you about a guy who lives just outside of Pinedale, \nWY--Big Piney, WY. All these big cities kind of get me confused. But \nhis name is Dr. Close. He is actually well known internationally \nbecause he spent most of his life in Africa studying Ebola. And he is \nalso known because he has a daughter named Glenn Close whom people may \nhave seen in a movie or two. But he now lives by Big Piney, WY--a \nlittle bit out of town--and he is now an old-fashioned country doctor. \nHe makes house calls. He even does hospice work. If somebody is dying, \nhe will stay with them during those difficult times--hours and days on \nend.\n  When I visited him last time, he showed me some documents that he \ngives to people who are going to be his patients. It says: I am not \ngoing to do Medicare. He will not take Medicare. He says it takes too \nmuch time. It costs too much money. So he does not volunteer if \nthey cannot afford to pay, but he has a pretty good thing of people \ndonating--some of them who have been helped before, some who have money \nwho have kind of donated to a foundation for him. He adds some money \nthat is in a foundation. So he is able to get by that way. But he is a \ngreat source on some of the problems with Medicare and why we are \nhaving less providers who are willing to provide to anybody who needs \nMedicare. We have a lot of people out there who need help, and they \nhave Medicare. So, Medicare, as it stands right now, is not the best \nanswer for people.\n\n  So there is a much better way to get everyone an insurance card that \ndoes not take us down the path of Government-run health care. I want to \nrepeat that and make sure folks at home know what I mean when I say \n``Government-run health care.''\n  Government-run health care means that a committee in Washington is \ndeciding the care you are going to get. A committee is deciding what is \nbest for you. The decisions would no longer be made by you and your \ndoctor. Oh, yes, within limits they would be but not really. A \ncommittee in Washington is deciding what doctors you can go to and \ndeciding how much the doctor gets paid.\n  A committee in Washington is deciding which prescription drugs are \nthe most effective for you. It would not matter that you know your \nbody, that your doctor knows your body. You do know how your body \nworks, and you will have worked closely with your doctor to know what \ndrugs you should be taking. If that committee in Washington decides you \nshould not have the drugs you have taken your whole life, and instead \ndecides you should take another similar drug, then you have to take \nanother similar drug.\n  I went around Wyoming talking about Medicare Part D, and helping \npeople to know, if they needed to make a choice, how to make a choice. \nI got the volunteer people working all over the State. We had a \ntremendous signup\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\nin Wyoming. At every one of the hearings I did, I had somebody come and \nsay: I cannot get the drugs I need.\n  I would say: You are a veteran, aren't you?\n  They would say: Yes. How did you know?\n  Well, I knew because the Medicare Part D part was not in operation \nyet, and the Government was negotiating prices on veterans health. The \nonly way you can do that is to say what ones are going to be acceptable \nor get the similar ones to bid against each other, which means some of \nthem are not going to be available. That is exactly what happened. So \nsometimes when the Government gets involved, they limit what you can \ndo. That is the problem with Government-run health care.\n  I promise to work hard to make sure everyone is not forced into a \nGovernment plan. My plan gives every American the choice to pick the \ninsurance card they want. Now, there are some things we have to do with \ninsurance companies, too. But that plan that they pick can be the one \nthat best fits their needs. Every American will have the choice to \ndiscuss their care with their doctor and decide which plan is best for \nthem. This plan puts the patient first. This plan gives patients \ncontrol over their own health care.\n  Another important part, this plan is affordable. It is not free. It \nis not free--people do not appreciate things that are free--but it is \naffordable. It needs to be affordable, and it is affordable. Sometimes \nif things are free, people do not think it does anything. Now, there \nare a lot of details on my Web site about how this plan redistributes \nthe tax breaks that are currently only going to the people whose \nemployers are giving them health insurance cards. And it makes sure all \nAmericans get the tax breaks.\n  This plan also reduces the cost of health care. Right now, a lot of \nrules are in place that prohibit groups of businesses from getting \ntogether and pooling their purchasing power so they can negotiate \nbetter deals on insurance cards. They can get a bigger pool by going \nacross State lines, and you have to have a bigger one if you are going \nto negotiate with the insurance companies. Where they have been able to \ndo it in high-population States, within their State, it has worked. \nThose same groups have said: Let's expand out a little further.\n  First of all, we get a whole lot more people covered, and we will get \nlower rates. So it does not make sense if they cannot go across State \nlines and get these bigger groups--meaning if a group of shoe store \nowners in Wyoming want to get together with shoe store owners in \nMontana and Colorado and band together so they can negotiate greater \ndiscounts on health insurance, we ought to allow them to do so. That is \nwhat one of the steps does.\n  Now, the plan also recognizes our changing workforce. It provides \nreal options for people to take their insurance card with them when \nthey change jobs. No one would be trapped in a job just because their \nloved one or they need particular health insurance. Right now, under \nthe system, if they move to another business, they are probably going \nto have a preexisting condition that will not be covered. It definitely \nwill not be covered for a period of time, but it may not be covered at \nall. If you want to provide real choices, then you should also have the \nchoice to keep the coverage you have, even if you do not keep your \ncurrent job.\n  Now, to reiterate, this plan gives every American a health insurance \ncard. This plan puts patients first. This plan puts the people in \ncontrol of their own health care. This plan lets doctors and patients \nmake decisions about what care they need and receive. And this plan \nlets you choose the health care you need.\n  It is in steps, and it is evolutionary, not revolutionary. There are \nsome ideas around here that are not included in the 10 steps that are \ngreat ideas. They are just such a quantum leap that they take people \nout of insurance who currently have insurance who like the insurance \nthey have. Those people are going to be very skeptical about having us \nchange to such a revolutionary system that they lose what they have \nnow. So we have to do it in steps. We can get to where every plan \nhere--I am talking about those as the 11th and 12th steps--can work \ntogether.\n  So I am encouraging everybody to take a look at them. They are \nsensible proposals we could have enacted long ago, and I am \ndisappointed this body has not made progress on any of these issues to \nimpact every American. I hope we turn to these issues the first thing \nthis year and enact real reform.\n  The Americans deserve more than politics. They deserve results. I \nthink a surprising thing, sometimes when you look at the debate that we \ndo not finish up around here, they even expect results. We need to meet \nthose expectations.\n  Before I leave the floor, I would also like to address another aspect \nof health care. It is one that often does not get enough attention; \nthat is, mental health.\n  I am concerned we were unable to move forward on the bipartisan \nlegislation to revamp the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services, \nor SAMHSA. While I am hopeful we can complete our work on this key \nlegislation early this year, it is unfortunate we were unable to \naddress it last year.\n  As part of that debate, I hope we will leave the discussion on \ncharitable choice for the Senate floor--as we have done in the past--so \nall Members can engage, if they want to, and so we can get it out of \ncommittee. I know Senators have strong opinions about this provision, \nand I do believe that the best debate on it will be on the Senate \nfloor. It is critical that Congress turn immediately to these issues. \nThey will help every American have a healthier and happier new year, \nnot only this year, but for many years to come.\n\n  Our work is cut out for us. We can do it. We can do it in a way that \npeople will appreciate. We can do it in a way where there is common \nground across the aisle. I am committed to work on that. I hope others \nwill join me on it and help us do something. As my constituent said, do \nsomething, even if it is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S532-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S532-S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about our need to move \nswiftly on the stimulus package. We are responding obviously to a \nbipartisan package that has come out of the Finance Committee. I \nbelieve we should work on a bipartisan basis, because we are in tough \neconomic times, to hurry and get this package done. Doing the right \nthing means doing the right thing for seniors, for disabled veterans, \nfor consumers, for business. It means getting real dollars pumped back \ninto the economy now and not continuing to play a time-consuming game, \ngoing back and forth.\n  I know the House and the administration rapidly put together a \npackage and it garnered wide bipartisan support, and I applaud their \nefforts for doing that. Likewise, Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley also initiated quick, bipartisan action in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and the bill was reported out, and Senator Reid has brought \nthat bill before the full Senate. I urge my colleagues to keep pace \nwith the President's request for timely action and to support sending \nthe Finance Committee bill to the House so we can quickly move to \nconference and resolve whatever differences there are, so we can move a \npackage to the President's desk we can be proud of.\n  Our goal is to act on policies that will stimulate the economy now \nand over the next 12 months. We should not lose sight of that goal. I \nknow many of my colleagues like to talk about other proposals that may \nbe stimulative in the long run, but for me the focus should be--and I \nthink for my colleagues--on that which is truly going to be stimulative \nover the next 12 months.\n  The Finance Committee package makes significant improvements to the \nHouse bill. I think they are important aspects that strengthen our \nefforts on stimulus. The Finance Committee bill makes sure that 20 \nmillion low-income seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans are eligible \nfor a stimulus rebate--a critical aspect to correct. Now I don't think \nthe House of Representatives intended to leave these folks behind, and \nI think we can simply send a message to the House and the President \nthat we know they support including these individuals as well.\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\n  By making sure that seniors qualify for these payments, in my State, \nover 800,000 Washingtonians will be helped, and over 93,000 disabled \nveterans and their families. So we are talking about a large percentage \nof the population. These people live on fixed incomes, and it is \nessential we provide them the economic assistance they deserve. I do \nwant to congratulate Senators Lincoln and Snowe for highlighting the \nfact that the House bill failed to help these individuals--disabled \nveterans--and worked to correct this in the Finance Committee package.\n  The Finance Committee package also improves upon the House bill by \nincluding a modest temporary extension of the stimulative energy tax \ncredit and investment provisions. Some may ask: Are these energy \nprovisions stimulative? Let me respond clearly: Extending these \nprovisions is critical to the prevention of billions of dollars of \ninvestment loss and thousands of jobs lost in 2008. We need to act \nquickly or we are going to not only lose out on a positive economic \nstimulus that can be upwards of $20 billion, but people will start \ncancelling projects that are in critical areas of investment simply \nbecause we have not given them the predictability of the Tax Code.\n  This bill includes a 1-year extension of expiring clean energy and \nefficiency tax credits that will help consumers and businesses make \nstimulative investment decisions in 2008, and it happens to address one \nof the most pressing needs--energy costs--that are causing impact to \nour economy today. Extending this package of incentives now will enable \ncompanies to go forward with more renewable investments in wind and \nsolar which are currently on hold now because they are waiting for the \ncertainty of the Tax Code.\n  I wish to show my colleagues an example of what uncertainty does for \nour investment. Historically, the production tax credits have been \nrenewed at various points in time. When Congress has failed to give \npredictability--and this chart shows the megawatt production, the years \nwe failed to provide certainty--we actually saw a 93-percent drop in \n2000. In 2001 when we failed to get certainty again, we saw a 73-\npercent drop in production, and in 2004 we saw a 77-percent drop in \nproduction again. What this chart shows us is that in 2007, we are off \nto a great year as it relates to production, and the production tax \ncredit and the alternative energy that we are producing.\n  As I said, 2000 shows almost $20 billion in stimulation to our \neconomy by our investment in energy. That helps us lower energy costs \nand certainly puts more production into the mix. But if we fail to give \nthe businesses the predictability we are going to extend these tax \ncredits, those investments aren't going to be made.\n  The American Wind Energy Association estimates that the extension of \nthe production tax credit will enable $7 billion in capital spending to \ngo forward over the next 12 months, thanks to projects and contracts \nthat will be executed as planned rather than delayed because of \nuncertainty of the place-in-service date. That is, by saying the \nprojects have to be in place by the end of this year does not give them \nthe predictability of continuing to make the investment. We have been \ntold by just one appliance manufacturer that they will not give the go-\nahead on $30 million in investment in 2008 to put new energy efficiency \nappliances into production unless the tax credit is extended. That \nproduction line won't be cost-effective without it. That is what they \ntell us.\n\n  Also, the extension of the investment tax credit for solar, for \nexample, means that one large grocery store chain in the United States \nwould--if they got the credit--inject an additional $30 million into \nthe economy by following through on their plan to retrofit more stores \nwith solar panels in 2008. Each solar conversion of those stores puts \n$2 million into the economy, into manufacturing and installation of \nthose solar panels. The Federal investment credit is key to whether \nthey move forward with their investment, or whether they stop or slow \ndown. Overall, the solar industry estimates that up to 40,000 new jobs \nwill be lost in the next 12 months if we don't extend the investment \ncredit. At this time in our economy, why should we be sacrificing high-\nquality jobs because we aren't giving certainty predictability?\n  Let me give an example. In my own State, someone called our office \ntoday who is the president of Wellons, Inc., in Vancouver, WA. For more \nthan 40 years Wellons has been a leader in providing wood-fired energy \nsystems, lumber-dried kilns, and related products to the forest \nindustry. Wellons has four to six projects and maybe many more that are \nready to go, and yet a key to all these projects moving forward is \ncertainty about the production tax credit. If the production tax \ncredits aren't extended, these projects can't go forward, and as the \npresident of that organization told my office:\n\n       Every project I have hinges on the production tax credit. \n     If they aren't extended, we will start having to lay off some \n     of the 500 employees in the company.\n\n  So we have to act quickly. There are many other States that will be \nimpacted besides mine. A report that was released today by Navigant \nConsulting found that over 100,000 jobs are at risk. In fact, their \nreport shows State by State that due to a lack of production tax \ncredit--Texas, for example, 23,000 jobs could be at stake; Colorado, \n10,000 jobs; Illinois, 8,000--and I am not giving the exact number \nhere; I am rounding them up or down--Oregon, 7,000 jobs; Minnesota, \n6,000; my home State of Washington, 4,744; and the list goes on. Iowa, \nNorth Dakota, Oklahoma; Pennsylvania will lose 1,500 plus jobs; \nCalifornia, nearly 1,000 jobs; Missouri, nearly 1,000 jobs, and on and \ndown the list.\n  So the question is whether we are going to act to pass what is a \nbipartisan Senate bill that improves on the House package--it improves \non the House package including seniors, including disabled veterans, in \nmaking sure we are clear about who--in fact, that legal citizens get \naccess to these rebate checks, and to make sure we are truly making the \nbest decision about stimulative investment.\n  Now, I wish that last year we could have had some of these things \npass and having some clarity. But it is clear that the House of \nRepresentatives and the White House see this differently. So it is very \nimportant that we take the opportunity now to get this investment \nstrategy right. Doing these tax credits at the end of this year is not \nsufficient to keeping investment. If we don't, 2008 is going to look \nmore like 2004. That is that in 2008, people will cancel projects, stop \nproduction, we won't have the energy produced in the marketplace.\n  This is a large opportunity for us. It is a large opportunity to give \nbusinesses--and I should say it also gives consumers--an opportunity to \nget about $500 from a tax rebate for their consumer energy investments \ninto products that will help them keep their energy costs down, and the \nestimates are that individual consumers, besides the $500 rebate they \nwill get, will probably save between $600 and $800 on energy savings. \nThose are the kinds of things we want to do. We want to see 2008 look \neven more aggressive from a stimulative perspective than 2007. We want \npeople to be aggressive in this area because not only will it create \njobs, not only will it create economic stimulus now, but it will help \nconsumers on the key impact they are feeling in this economic hardship \nof high energy costs. The more production you get into place, that \nproduction helps us in lowering energy costs. Getting more alternative \nenergy production helps us in impacting the cost of natural gas, \nbecause you have an alternative product in the marketplace. It helps us \nin getting other supply. It certainly is supply that is there for the \nlong run. I don't think anybody thinks we are ever going to change the \ndirection we are currently seeing on high energy costs, so getting the \nlong-term production in place is also a good idea.\n  But I urge my colleagues to think clearly about this choice we are \ngoing to have; that is, to improve upon the, I am sure, unintended \nconsequences the House had in their package by clarifying that seniors \nand veterans deserve to have these benefits, and that these production \ntax credits and investments are smart investments to give business \npredictability and will be stimulative to our economy. Certainly by \nignoring that, we are at peril of making our problems worse. So I \nencourage my colleagues to support this Finance Committee package that \nhas come out in a bipartisan way and move quickly with the House to \nresolve these issues. It is\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nthe quickest path forward to getting a bill to the President and \ngetting checks into consumers' hands.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                 Tribute to Rupert Florence Richardson\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a very \nimportant Louisianan, and really a great leader of our Nation, who \npassed away recently. I come to the floor in her memory, to pause for \njust a moment and to remember this great lady.\n  Thursday, January 24, Louisiana and the Nation lost a powerful \nadvocate for justice, equality, and opportunity. Rupert Florence \nRichardson was truly a heroine of the civil rights movement, who \nbattled throughout her life not only to realize the dream of equal \nopportunity and a colorblind society, but she fought every day that I \nknew her for decent jobs, adequate health care, quality health care, \nand equal opportunities in education for all children.\n  During more than half a century of work and devotion to the civil \nrights movement, and to public service generally, Rupert Richardson \nrose into national prominence as one of the longest serving board \nmembers of the NAACP, serving from 1992 to 1995 as national head. Prior \nto that, she served that prestigious organization for 7 years as vice \npresident and also 16 years as the president of the Louisiana chapter.\n  Rupert Richardson was a mother, a teacher, a nurse, a sought-after \nspeaker, and a leader always. She had an extraordinary voice and \npresence, a really big and wonderful heart, she was a great intellect, \nand she had a passion for people. She was fondly known as the grand \ndame of the NAACP and was beloved by many in the NAACP civil rights \nfamily.\n  To us at home, you could always see Rupert coming because of her hats \nof various shapes, sizes and colors--quite decorative--which was her \nsignature trademark. She was a vibrant spirit, always busy, working, \nand always generous to those around her.\n  Rupert served many years in Baton Rouge and was no stranger to our \nNation's Capital. She was born in Texas and moved to Lake Charles, LA, \nas an infant. That is where she will be buried tomorrow. For more than \n30 years, Rupert served Louisiana in many spheres of influence, and she \nwill be fondly remembered and respectfully remembered. It was truly a \nlife of service. Her family, her friends, her sorority sisters, and \nparticularly the civil rights family in America owe a great deal to \nthis great heroine of civil rights.\n  I am happy to come to the floor of the Senate to remember Rupert \nRichardson, to speak of her, and to remind all of us of her great \ncontribution. She will be missed very much.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \neconomic stimulus package that is now under consideration by the full \nSenate and specifically to address the crucial issue of how this \npackage affects our senior citizens. I am particularly glad to be \ndelivering these remarks on an occasion when my distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida is occupying the chair because I know of the extraordinary \nefforts he dedicates in this Chamber on behalf of the citizens of his \nhome State of Florida. Like Florida, Rhode Island is a State that has a \nsignificant senior population, and so the welfare of those seniors and \nthe effect on them of this economic stimulus is a matter of great \nconcern to both of us.\n  I want to tell a quick story. Not long ago, at one of the community \ndinners I give around the State of Rhode Island to get input from \npeople, to have a chance to meet folks in our local communities, to \nhave them have a chance to talk with me, and for me to have a chance to \nhear their stories, a young man named Travis attended, and he told me a \nstory about his grandmother.\n  His grandmother is a lovely woman. She lives in Woonsocket, RI. \nWoonsocket is a historic and beautiful city in Rhode Island but a city \nthat has faced, for a long time, economic challenges. His grandmother \nis in her nineties, and she still lived in the three-story tenement, on \nher own, that she had lived in all her life in Woonsocket.\n  In Rhode Island, there are a lot of buildings where there are three \napartments, one on top of the other--three-deckers--and she lived on \nthe top floor of one of those. God bless her, at age 90, she was able \nto walk up and down those stairs every day, and she did, to go out and \ndo her errands, to visit with her grandson, and to go about her life. \nShe was fit, and she was proud of her independence. It is not easy to \ngo up and down those stairs every day, but she did it. She liked to \nlive alone. She was proud of being independent her whole life and \nwanted to remain independent.\n  One day, she went down the stairs from that third-story tenement, and \nshe walked out, as she often did, to visit her pharmacist, to pick up \nthe prescriptions she requires to maintain her health. Everything was \njust as usual, until she got to the pharmacy. She discovered that this \nwas not a usual day. She was told by the pharmacist that she had fallen \ninto the doughnut hole--the terrible coverage gap in the Part D \nMedicare prescription drug program. She hadn't seen it coming. She was \nblindsided, caught completely by surprise. You can imagine what was \ngoing through her mind when she was told she couldn't pick up her \ndrugs, that she couldn't afford them.\n  She went home to that third-floor tenement emptyhanded, without her \nprescriptions, and she walked back up those stairs. Frightened and \nalone, not sure what to do, she called Travis. Fortunately, he was able \nto help. But without any help from her Part D insurance, she couldn't \nafford to pay both her rent and that medicine.\n  She was frightened. After years of living on her own, after holding \non, really with a lot of courage and a lot of heart and a lot of \ndetermination, to that independence that meant so much to her, even if \nit meant walking up three flights of stairs every day, now she was \ngoing to lose that--not because of anything she had done wrong, not \nbecause of anything that had changed in her life, but because she had \nfallen into this trap that was set for her by this Congress when it \nbuilt that hole into the prescription drug program.\n  That call from his grandmother shook Travis pretty hard, and that is \nwhat brought him into my life. It was one of numerous stories I heard \non the campaign trail from families who had to cope suddenly with \nwatching a senior fall into that coverage gap.\n  On another occasion, I was coming out of a speech I was giving, and a \nfellow stopped me on the way out and we talked for a while. He said: \nYou know, I really want you to fix this prescription drug thing, and I \nwant to tell you why. He said: I have a brother--this was a gentleman \nabout my age. He said: I have a younger brother, now in his forties. He \nis severely disabled. He has serious mental challenges. He lives in a \ngroup home, and every week I go by and I take him out. I take him on an \nouting. I take him to the movies, to a ball game, or to walk around the \nmall, and I do it with $50.\n  My mother gives me $50 every month to help take care of my brother. \nHe said: She is elderly now. She had taken care of him all his life, \nbut then he had to move into the group home, and now she is elderly \nherself, and there is not much she can do for her son. She still loves \nhim deeply. She still cares for him very much.\n  The one last thing she could do for this boy was to give her other \nson $50 a month out of her very sparse resources to take his brother on \nthese outings.\n\n  Now, he said, I have the $50. I am going to take my brother on these \noutings anyway. That is not the issue. The issue is that my mom just \nfell in this doughnut hole and, he said, she can't give me that $50 \nanymore, and it is breaking her heart to know that after all these \nyears of caring for this boy and having this one last thing she could \nstill do for him, she couldn't do it any longer. He said: She feels \nlike a failure. Her heart is broken. Please, you have to do something \nabout this.\n  That is an indication of how close so many Americans are to the edge, \nthat this mother, whose most important expenditure in her life is to be \nable to help that son and know she was still\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\ndoing something for him, and she couldn't make that payment any longer \nbecause everything had to go to prescriptions and the basic necessities \nof just keeping alive.\n  We have heard a lot of these stories. I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer has heard these stories as he goes around Florida.\n  As an aside, I think it is worth observing while we are here, what a \nshameful mistake--what a shameful mistake--this Congress made when it \nhad the chance and it had the choice to close this terrible gap in this \ncoverage for seniors and it chose not to. It chose not to so that it \ncould give the wealthy pharmaceutical industry--one of the richest and \nmost successful industries in the country--one of the fattest perks, \none of the biggest benefits, one of the biggest insider deals that has \never come through this building--something almost unique in the annals \nof corporate special favors. What a racket. It gave them the ability to \navoid having Medicare and Medicaid negotiate with them over the price \nof their pharmaceuticals. What a racket. And we did that. The extra \ncost that puts into that system means you have to maintain that hole \nand that seniors are going to fall into that trap over and over again.\n  Well, that is a fight we are going to continue. I know the Senator \nfrom Florida feels strongly about it, I feel strongly about it, and \nmany others feel strongly about that. It is wrong to have seniors such \nas Travis's grandmother or the lady who can't make her $50 contribution \nto help her son be the ones to lose and an industry making billions, \nwhich has everything it needs, win out over them.\n  So now we have this stimulus package. Our Nation is confronting \nuncertain economic times, and Congress is working diligently to try to \nput together a package to prevent us from sliding further into the Bush \nrecession. However, when the initial agreement was announced between \nthe administration and the House of Representatives, I was concerned--\nas the Senator from Florida was; we spoke about it--that many seniors, \none of the groups who most need our help, were excluded from that deal.\n  Most seniors, who rely on Social Security benefits and savings, do \nnot pay income taxes, and they would not be eligible for an income tax \nrebate based on taxable income and delivered through the Internal \nRevenue Service. It just wouldn't reach them. Indeed, 61 percent of \nseniors who received Social Security benefits did not pay income taxes \nin 2006, the last year for which there is data. Sixty-one percent would \nhave gotten nothing under that package.\n  Well, today, more than 138,000 Rhode Islanders--to the Senator from a \ngreat big State such as Florida, that may not seem like a big number, \nbut 138,000 in a State with a population of just 1 million is a lot of \npeople--138,000 Rhode Islanders over the age of 65 receive Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  It is not a big benefit, it is not a generous benefit. It averages \n$12,374 a year. Based on the national percentage of recipients who pay \nincome tax, it means more than 84,000 Rhode Islanders would receive \nnothing under the House proposal, 84,000 Rhode Island seniors, zippo, \nnothing for them.\n  Nationwide that number climbs to 21.1 million seniors. More than 20 \nmillion seniors would not receive a dime in tax rebates under the House \nbill. That is not fair. That is not fair.\n  As long as we are putting funds out in the economy in order to \nstimulate the economy, we should make sure the program reaches fairly \nto different segments of the population and certainly not leave out \nseniors. Extending the rebate plan to seniors will give much-needed \nbreathing room to so many seniors who struggle every day to get by.\n  But in addition to being more fair, it also makes economic sense. \nAccording to the Department of Labor, Americans over 65 are responsible \nfor 14 percent of all consumer spending, and they spend an average of \n92 percent of their income every year.\n  In 2006 alone, they purchased more than $800 billion in consumer \ngoods. So if you are looking to push consumer spending, seniors are a \ngood place. That data suggests any rebate we are able to provide \nseniors will provide the kind of stimulus our country needs.\n  Furthermore, older Americans are more likely to spend the money they \nreceive and to spend it on goods and services that will help our \neconomy grow, and they will spend it sooner. They will spend it faster. \nAs we all know, one of the key purposes of this stimulus is to put the \nstimulus into the economy quickly.\n  In a Budget Committee hearing a few days ago, I asked Peter Orszag, \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, which would be a faster \nstimulus to the economy, Social Security or tax rebates. He testified: \nSocial Security. So if we can help seniors get this through Social \nSecurity, better still.\n  Last week, I wrote the Democratic and Republican leaders in the \nSenate about my concerns. I urged them to make seniors a priority in \nany stimulus package we consider. I am very encouraged and very \npleased, standing on the floor right now, that the Senate Finance \nCommittee, chaired by our distinguished colleague from Montana, Senator \nMax Baucus, has reported out of his committee, in bipartisanship \nfashion, a bill that would allow most seniors to receive a $500 rebate \nunder the Finance Committee proposal.\n       Social Security benefits would be considered as income for \n     this limited purpose. Seniors with at least $3,000 in Social \n     Security income, Social Security benefits, but we are \n     treating it this one time as income for 2007, this past year, \n     could claim the $500-per-person rebate simply by filing a tax \n     return.\n  Now, of course as we know, many seniors do not have enough taxable \nincome to require them to file tax returns. They may not have filed in \nyears and they may not be familiar with the process. So as we go \nforward, should this proposal become law, I hope it does, we must do \nall we can to inform seniors about the rebates to which they are \nentitled and to help them claim these much-needed rebates.\n  We need to call on our friends who are accountants, social service \nworkers, lawyers in the tax area, who can volunteer their time to work \nat senior centers in high-rises, work with our seniors to make sure \nseniors know they can do this and help them fill out this form so they \ncan get this benefit.\n  So many seniors desperately could use an extra $500. That is nearly a \nwhole year of this gentleman I mentioned, of his mom being able to help \nher son. Her whole thing every year was $600. It meant the world to her \nand it was only $600. And she could not do this. But this $500 will \nmake a big difference in these seniors' lives.\n  So we have to make sure no senior loses out on this money because of \nmisinformation or difficulty in navigating the tax forms. The solution \nis a strong step forward. I applaud the work of Chairman Baucus and the \nRepublican ranking member of the Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley.\n  I look forward to continuing our efforts to pass an economic stimulus \nproposal that meets the pressing needs of America's seniors while \naccelerating the stimulus the economy needs.\n  I will close by saying once again how fortunate I feel to be on the \nfloor delivering these remarks at a time when the distinguished \nSenator, Bill Nelson, for those who cannot see him, of Florida, is in \nthe Presiding Officer's chair. Because again, his strength and \ndetermination on issues that affect seniors in Florida is renowned in \nthis Chamber, and I could not hope for a better audience as someone \nwith such care and dedication to American seniors to be here.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been a long week, and our list of \naccomplishments--on paper--are not very much. But, hopefully, we are \nheaded toward a real good week next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S535-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S535-S537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me express on the record my appreciation \nfor so many people.\n  Specifically, I wish to mention Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond. \nThey and their staffs have spent days on this agreement. It is really \ngood they have a relationship that allows them to be able to reach this \nagreement. But for that, it could not have been done.\n  I am not going to talk about Republican Senators, but I am sure there \nare a lot of unsung heroes. I cannot talk about them. But the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Whitehouse, has done a remarkably good job as a member \nof the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees in helping us resolve this \nmatter so we can proceed to finish it. As I add up all this time, it is \nabout 11 hours of debate, plus the votes.\n  Senator Kennedy is also always very easy to deal with. He believes \nfervently in what he believes, but he is always very understanding of \nmy problems. I extend my appreciation to him.\n  Senator Feingold is a brilliant man, and he is someone who is always \nlooking at every bit of verbiage in any piece of legislation. He has \nbeen very good to work with, as he always is. I express my appreciation \nto him.\n  Senator Cardin has been very patient in everything we have done.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about two people.\n  I spent a lot of time today with Senator Feinstein. She is a real \nbeliever as a member of that Intelligence Committee. She is the second \nranking member on that committee. She spends days of her life in \ncommittee hearings, listening to what goes on and trying to figure out \nwhat is going on, which is not always easy. It is all done with all the \nIntelligence members away from the press. There is little recognition \nthat members of the Intelligence Committees get, other than self- \nsatisfaction that they are doing good things for the country and the \nworld. I appreciate Senator Feinstein working with us so we could get \nto this final agreement.\n  Even though his name does not appear in any of the consent agreements \nI read, Senator Leahy is a person who is going to accomplish what he \nbelieves should be accomplished in this bill, but he has done it in a \ntypical way. I had one Senator tell me--in fact, it was Senator Kent \nConrad. He said that in his entire public service, he has never known a \nbetter negotiator than Senator Leahy. I think he probably is one of the \nbest. He got a lot out of this even though his name does not appear \nanyplace.\n  We know the sincerity and the depth of feelings that Senator Dodd has \non this legislation. He is somebody who has been heavily involved in \neverything we have done in this bill. I appreciate his willingness to \nwork with us to a point here. He and I agree on what should happen in \nthis legislation. Time will only tell whether we get what our druthers \nare, but at least we are joined to try to accomplish the same thing.\n  I appreciate everyone working as they have with this legislation. It \nhasn't been easy to get where we are, but this is where we are, and I \nappreciate everyone's attention and help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S537-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TET OFFENSIVE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today, the 40th anniversary of the \nbeginning of the Tet Offensive, to commemorate the valor and \ncourageousness with which our Armed Forces fought to repel this massive \nattack.\n  Over the holiday recess, I was fortunate enough to spend a great deal \nof time in my home State of Nevada. While at home, I met with several \nveterans at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, Post 1753 in Las Vegas. \nAfter talking with them for quite a while, it was brought to my \nattention that we were only a few weeks away from the 40th anniversary \nof the onset of the Tet Offensive. In order to ensure that the heroism \nof our troops who fought in these arduous battles was not overlooked on \nthis milestone anniversary, I told my friends at VFW Post 1753 that I \nwould honor their sacrifices and the sacrifices of their fellow \nNevadans and call attention to this important occasion on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  From a tactical standpoint, the Tet Offensive would result in one of \nAmerica's most convincing victories over the combined forces of the \nViet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army, NVA. Yet few Americans recall \nthe decisiveness with which our troops routed the surprise onslaught. \nMany mistakenly believe that Tet was a military defeat, significant for \nthe enemy's ability to launch a large-scale attack on the United States \nand South Vietnamese forces. It is time to correct this mistaken \nimpression and recognize the bravery and sacrifice of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines in achieving victory during the Tet \nOffensive.\n  As many Hollywood films have since immortalized, the surprise attacks \nbegan in full during the early morning hours of January 31, 1968, the \nVietnamese lunar New Year holiday known as Tet. A few months earlier, \nthe Governments of North and South Vietnam had agreed to observe a 7-\nday truce from January 27 to February 3, 1968, in honor of the national \nholiday. With the Tet Truce abruptly violated, America's servicemembers \nregrouped to defend what would be the largest military operation \nconducted by either side up to that point in the conflict.\n  Withstanding major assaults at Hue, Khe Sanh, and Saigon, our Armed \nForces quickly turned the tide on the surprise offensive and delivered \nmajor tactical blows to both the Viet Cong and NVA. Most of the attack \nhad been successfully repelled by mid-February with few notable \nexceptions, such as fighting at the coastal port of Hue, which \ncontinued into early March. When the dust settled, tens of thousands of \nCommunist troops had died during the massive ambush, while 1,536 U.S. \nand non-Vietnamese allies perished in the violence and over 7,700 \nothers were wounded or declared missing.\n  Despite America's impressive tactical victories in the aftermath of \nthe original attacks, the Tet Offensive forever altered the course of \nthe Vietnam war. Although the Tet Offensive would serve as a major blow \nin the court of American public opinion, we must never forget the \nresolve and bravery of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, who \nfought a determined enemy and defended the freedoms of those who could \nnot defend themselves.\n  During the difficult times of today, when America remains at war \nabroad against another committed enemy, I believe we must all remember \nto take the necessary time and pay our deepest respects to those \nservicemembers who have fallen in years past. I certainly will never \nforget the 151 Nevadans who died during the course of the entire \nVietnam war, many of whom would meet their eventual fate defending the \nsouth during the Tet Offensive. To all of those valiant Americans who \nfought during this mightiest of struggles, our Nation is eternally \ngrateful for your sacrifice in turning what could have been one of our \ndarkest hours into yet another great victory in the annals of our \nNation's rich military history.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S538-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S538]]\n                     THE RETIREMENT OF GREG HARNESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the distinguished \nand respected career of Senate Librarian Greg Harness, who retires \ntoday.\n  Librarians serve as bridges, connecting information and resources \nwith those who need it. They are charged not only as the keepers of \nknowledge but also as the distributors of it, and it is a duty that \nGreg has upheld in the most respectful, prompt, and accurate manner. \nMembers of the Senate and their staff have come to rely on the vast \nresources that Greg oversees and know that each request for \ninformation, no matter how small it may seem, will be treated with the \nsame courtesy and professionalism.\n  Greg came to the Senate Library as a reference librarian in 1975, \nintending to stay only 2 years. Instead, Greg found his niche in the \nSenate Library, where he has worked for 32 years. He served in a \nvariety of capacities over his tenure, transitioning to an assistant \nlibrarian position in 1995 and finally to Senate Librarian in 1997. One \nof his most important contributions was moving the Senate Library from \nthe Capitol Building to the Russell Senate Office Building in 1999. \nGreg not only helped facilitate the move, but he also oversaw the \ndesign of the new library.\n  It is also worth noting that over the course of Greg's career, the \nfield of librarianship has been transformed by new technology. In 1975, \nthe Senate Library was the first Secretary of the Senate office to \nreceive computers, allowing researchers to access information more \nquickly. For the Senate Library, this necessitated the need for \nresearch librarians who are not only knowledgeable of traditional \npaper-based resources but are also masters of electronic resources. \nGreg understands this balance and has assembled a qualified staff to \nfulfill this need.\n  From personal experience I can attest that Greg's tenure has been a \nwelcome addition to the Senate Library's distinguished tradition of \nproviding legislative, historic, and general knowledge to all that it \nserves. The Senate has been privileged to have Greg's expansive wealth \nof intellect and wisdom. I thank him for all the services he has \nprovided to me, to other Members of the Senate, and to Senate staff. \nHis service will be truly missed, and I wish him the best in his new \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S538-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TRENT LOTT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to say a \nfew words about my friend and colleague, Senator Lott.\n  Senator Lott has compiled a long and distinguished career in public \nservice on behalf of the people of Mississippi and our Nation. He has \nbeen a tireless advocate on behalf of the needs of his State and its \npeople, particularly in light of the devastation wrought by Hurricane \nKatrina. Senator Lott also fought for our men and women in military \nuniform to ensure they have the best training, equipment, and \ntechnology available. Throughout his career, he believed that the \nAmerican people should be able to keep more of their own money instead \nof sending it to Washington. Finally, Senator Lott understood and \nappreciated the fact we need judges on the Federal bench who will \nuphold the law, not make the law.\n  During his time in the Congress, he has been an active participant in \nmany important legislative battles. The votes he has cast and the \npolicies he supported have made the State of Mississippi and our Nation \na better place.\n  Senator Lott is in a select group of individuals who have held \nleadership positions in both the House of Representatives and Senate. \nHe has served as House minority whip, Senate majority leader, Senate \nminority leader and Senate minority whip. His election to these \nimportant leadership positions in both bodies show a high level of \ntrust and respect from his colleagues.\n  With his departure the Senate will lose one of its most effective \nSenators and the people of Mississippi will lose a powerful advocate. I \ntruly appreciate his leadership, service in the Senate, and service in \nthe House of Representatives, wit, wisdom, and friendship.\n  I wish him the best of luck in all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S538-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARTY PAONE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few words of \nappreciation and to say ``Farewell'' to one of the Senate's finest \npublic servants, Marty Paone.\n  For our visitors in the gallery, and for our viewers on C-SPAN, it \nmay look like Senators are running this place. Mr. President, we know \nbetter. We trust dedicated, professional staff like Marty Paone to make \nsure things get done.\n  As all of my colleagues know, Marty is the secretary for the \nmajority, and when we were fewer Democrats around here, he was our \nsecretary for the minority. He has held this position for the past 13 \nyears. Before that, he served as the assistant secretary, worked as \nfloor staff and in the cloakroom, going back nearly three decades. In \nshort, Marty has spent close to his entire adult life here on the \nSenate floor, getting Senators where they need to be, when they are \nsupposed to be there.\n  To do his job, Marty has to be a combination of traffic cop, \ndiplomat, and parliamentarian--and he has to have the trust of the \nSenators who follow his direction. Marty has that trust, because he has \nearned that trust, and because he has all those other skills, too.\n  I have been here 35 years; it is hard for me to remember a time when \nMarty wasn't here. And I don't just mean year in and year out. I mean \nany hour of the day and night. Whenever this place is open for \nbusiness, Marty has been here, helping to maintain order and to get \nthings done. We are indebted to his many personal sacrifices, when he \nwas here instead of home with his family.\n  Indeed, it has been hard to get much done around here without relying \non Marty's expertise on Senate process. I don't know how he has managed \nto juggle all the demands on him. He is the ``go to guy'' for help on \nmoving amendments, overcoming objections, getting a place in line for \ndebate, complying with Senate rules, strategizing passing or defeating \na measure. If you want to know what is happening ``behind the scenes,'' \nMarty is the person to look to. There isn't a vote that happens, there \nisn't a negotiation that takes place, there isn't a unanimous consent \nagreement--which is what makes this place function--that Marty hasn't \nhelped to piece together or made sure it's done correctly.\n  And Marty works for each of us. While, technically, he works for the \nDemocrats, I know that many of my Republican colleagues have turned to \nMarty for guidance. He is known for always being candid and \nstraightforward. He has served us all with his honest counsel--you \ncould always count on him for a straight answer. And, remarkably, he \nhas never lost patience with any of us--no matter what we ask or how \noften we call.\n  It is hard to describe to those who haven't spent much time in the \nSenate how very important Marty Paone has been to the Senate, day-to-\nday life and historic moments. Mr. President, this is the end of an \nera. We all hope it will be the beginning of a new one for Marty, away \nfrom the heavy responsibilities he has met so well for so long. We wish \nhim well. He will be missed very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S538-4", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S538-S539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2007--SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, Monday marked the 1-year anniversary of the \ntragic death of Mone Little. On January 28, 2007, 19-year-old Mone, \ngranddaughter of late Motown legend and lead singer of The Temptations, \nDavid Ruffin, was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while walking with \nthree friends in Detroit. While Mone was not the target, she was the \nonly one in the group who was shot. Those responsible for this heinous \ncrime have not been caught.\n  Mone, a student at Oakland Community College, was in the process of \nexploring her dreams. The community continues to grieve the senseless \nloss of this young woman. Unfortunately, we experience too many of \nthese tragedies. Each year approximately 30,000 Americans are killed by \na firearm, an average of 10 children and 74 adults each day.\n  Many of us continue to urge the Senate to pass sensible gun \nlegislation. Law enforcement officers have requested help in their \ndifficult task of keeping our streets safe. Those that have been \npersonally impacted by gun tragedies have called for change in the hope \nof protecting others from the pain they have endured.\n  The American people have a right to expect better protection against \ngun violence. Until Congress acts, many more lives will be lost. I once \nagain urge my colleagues to take up and pass sensible gun legislation \nso that we can help prevent such tragedies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S539-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT M. BALL\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the life \nof Robert Ball. Bob Ball has been a champion of America's elderly since \n1939, helping to guide and strengthen our Social Security system for \nnearly 70 years. He was America's longest serving Social Security \nCommissioner, overseeing improvements to benefits such as the \nintroduction of automatic cost-of-living adjustments. Today, about a \nthird of our Nation's elderly rely on Social Security for 90 percent or \nmore of their income, and two-thirds count on it to supply at least \nhalf of their income. It has been America's most successful anti-\npoverty program ever, due in no small part to Bob's influence.\n  While he is little known outside Washington, Bob played a critical \nrole in the origins of our most recognizable Government programs. His \nwork led to the introduction of Social Security disability insurance, \nand now because of him more than 7 million Americans who can't work due \nto a disability can still live in dignity. He helped create our \nMedicare system, which now provides health care to more than 40 million \nelderly Americans. Even as he became a Social Security recipient \nhimself, he continued to defend the program against benefit cuts and \nprivatization proposals. There is no question that Robert Ball's work \nhas improved the lives of millions of Americans. His character, wisdom, \nand leadership will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very sadly, Robert M. Ball, Bob Ball, \npassed away on January 29, 2008, at the age of 93. Bob Ball had a truly \nexceptional record of public service and his passing is a loss to this \nnation. Bob Ball served as the longest serving Commissioner of the \nSocial Security Administration from 1962 to 1973 and played a critical \nrole in all changes to the Social Security programs for the last half \ncentury. He was a champion of social insurance programs, and through \nhis leadership, the Social Security Administration tackled many \nchallenges and served millions of Americans in need. Few individuals \nhave had as direct and profound an effect on the lives of our fellow \ncitizens. And I would like to express my personal gratitude for Bob \nBall's dedicated service.\n  Bob Ball began his career with Social Security in a New Jersey field \noffice in 1939. At SSA's headquarters, he served in various positions \nwith the Bureau of Old Age and Survivors Insurance. He left the agency \nbriefly in 1945 to serve as staff director for the Advisory Council on \nSocial Security to the Senate Committee on Finance, and returned 4 \nyears later serving as assistant director of the Bureau of Old Age and \nSurvivors Insurance, and eventually, deputy director and acting \ndirector.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed Bob Ball Commissioner of \nSocial Security, a position he held under both Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents--retiring in 1973. During his time at SSA, he \nhelped establish the Disability Insurance Program, the Medicare \nProgram, and the Supplemental Security Income Program. These programs \nnow protect millions of Americans from what President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt called the hazards and vicissitudes of life--disability that \nprevents work, and extended old age, both of which can cause severe \npoverty.\n  Following his retirement, Bob Ball went on to be one of the most \nactive and prolific advocates for Social Security and social insurance \nprograms. He was an influential member of the Greenspan Commission, \nwhich in 1983 reestablished Social Security on a sound financial \nfooting, and has written and spoken on every proposal to improve Social \nSecurity's current financing difficulties, including the grossly flawed \nproposals to privatize Social Security. Bob Ball founded the National \nAcademy of Social Insurance in 1986 to promote understanding and \ninformed policymaking on Social Security and other social insurance \nprograms through research, training, and public events for the exchange \nof unbiased information.\n  Bob Ball was a great American who dedicated his life to serving \nothers. His passing is a great loss to this body and to all \npolicymakers. I am sure my colleagues will join me in offering our \ndeepest condolences to his family and to his friends and colleagues. I \nhope that we can keep his dedication in mind as we continue his life's \nwork and secure our retirement and disability programs for the millions \nof Americans who benefit and will benefit from his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S539-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S539-S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WILD MONONGAHELA ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Wild \nMonongahela: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places Act. \nThis important piece of legislation sets aside over 47,000 acres of \nwilderness in the Monongahela National Forest so that our children and \ngrandchildren will have the opportunity to enjoy the forest in its \npristine state.\n  West Virginians have a proud tradition of mining and logging that \nprovides needed resources for our entire country. I have no doubt that \nthis tradition will continue for many decades\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\nto come. However, at the same time, new development is coming to West \nVirginia. This is needed development that provides jobs for West \nVirginians and helps support our economy. But with this increased \ndevelopment comes a responsibility to set some part of our natural \nenvironment aside for those who come after us.\n  The Monongahela Forest encompasses nearly 920,000 acres of land in \nthe heart of the Appalachian Mountain Range and contains some of the \nmost ecological and geological unique reaches of our State. There are \ncurrently five wilderness areas in the Monongahela including the \nCranberry Wilderness and Dolly Sods Wilderness. This bill will create \nfour new wilderness areas and expand three of the existing areas. All \nof the land being designated as wilderness was already being treated as \neither recommended wilderness by the Forest Service or as backcountry \nrecreation.\n  I want to extend my thanks to Congressman Rahall for his leadership \non this bill and congratulate him on drafting legislation that has \nreceived the support of West Virginia's entire bipartisan congressional \ndelegation. Like all members of the congressional delegation, I have \nheard from hundreds of West Virginians how wilderness is important to \nthem. I have heard how wilderness is a major draw for the outdoor \ntourism industry and will provide jobs. I have heard from West \nVirginians who want to make sure that they will be able to continue to \nfish pristine streams and hunt in the forests. They want to experience \nthe excellent hiking and backpacking the hills of West Virginia have to \noffer, and make sure their grandchildren have that same opportunity. \nBut the reason I heard more than any others from West Virginians was \nthe need to protect some small part of God's creation as His stewards \non this Earth.\n  This legislation has received support from diverse groups and people \nacross West Virginia including the West Virginia AFL-CIO, the Fayette \nCounty Commission, West Virginia Council of Churches, and both the \nPocahontas and Greenbrier County Conventions and Visitor Bureaus, just \nto name a few. I know that there will be people who feel that this \nlegislation is too big and goes too far. At the same time I recognize \nthose West Virginians who are disappointed that areas of the \nMonongahela Forest special to them were not included. But I believe \nthis legislation strikes a careful balance that will protect West \nVirginia's forests and serve our State's interests for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S540-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING JACK B. WEIL\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to make note of the \nrecent passing of Jack B. Weil of Denver, CO. I knew Jack personally. \nThat puts me in the company of thousands. The passing of Jack B. Weil \nis not only a loss for his family, but it is a loss for the city of \nDenver and the State of Colorado, so I wanted to share a bit about \nJack.\n  Jack was born on Nov 13, 1928, at Denver's Mercy Hospital. He \ngraduated from Tulane University in 1952 and entered the U.S. Army as a \nsecond lieutenant, thus beginning a life of service to causes greater \nthan himself.\n  In 1954, Jack joined the firm founded by his father, Rockmount Ranch \nWear Manufacturing Company, where he worked until illness forced him to \nretire last year. While at Rockmount, Jack used his artistic flair to \ncreate many signature designs which have become icons of western shirt \ndesign. In fact his ``Sawtooth'' pocket and ``diamond'' snap design is \nthe longest running shirt design in America, and it sits in a \ncollection at the Smithsonian. Rockmount shirts have been worn by \nworking cowboys, rodeo cowboys and the likes of Ronald Reagan, Elvis, \nEric Clapton, Robert Redford, and more.\n  Jack was active in his community throughout his life. He supported \nhigher education for all and served as the longtime chairman of the \nFoundation for the Community College of Denver. He supported the cause \nof historic preservation, even buying one of Denver's historic homes \nand fighting to preserve the historic character of the Humboldt Island \nneighborhood. He opened that same home for fundraisers for a wide \nspectrum of causes, including charitable and political ones. An \naccomplished artist, his abstract paintings provided pleasure to many \npeople and were displayed in local galleries.\n  On the political front, Jack was proof that one could have strong \nconvictions yet treat those with divergent views with respect and \ndignity. He never hesitated to state his views and he actively \nsupported them by his involvement and leadership with various political \norganizations. When discussions would get too heated, Jack was quick \nwith a wry comment or offcolor joke to break the tension and remind \neveryone of their commonalities, not their differences.\n  To the very end, Jack served others. He spent the past 2-plus years \nas the cochair of the USS Mesa Verde commissioning team. In that role, \nJack supported the crew of this brand new Navy ship with both his time \nand his money. Despite his flagging health, he even attended the \ncommissioning ceremony in Florida this past December to demonstrate his \nsupport of our brave sailors.\n  But you can not capture the essence of Jack B. Weil in his \naccomplishments. No, the true essence of Jack is captured in the lives \nhe touched. You see, Jack Weil loved people. Be it buying someone who \nwas having a bad day an ice cream cone or inviting people he had just \nmet over to his house, Jack demonstrated a heart for people that we all \nwould do well to follow. He made friends wherever he went and always \noffered words of encouragement to those who needed them. This is best \ndemonstrated by the volume of e-mails, phone calls, and letters that \nhis family has received from all over the world offering their \ncondolences and stories of how Jack touched them.\n  Though Jack moved in circles with the rich and powerful, he was \ncompletely unaffected by it. His son tells a story of Jack mentioning \none day how he had sold some shirts to ``some British musician . . . \nDavid something . . . Bowie,'' which his son thought was another one of \nJack's jokes until he received a call from David Bowie's assistant the \nnext day to order more shirts. Or the time Jack shared some laughs at a \nclub with Robin Williams while having no idea who he was. That was how \nJack was. It didn't matter if you were famous or powerful or a cleaning \nlady or a bartender, to Jack you were just his friend.\n  There is a line from a poem that all cadets at West Point learn that \nI think says it best: And when our course on earth is run, may it be \nsaid, ``Well Done, be thou at peace.'' Well Done, Jack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S540-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S540-S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LANSDOWNE IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Lansdowne \nImprovement Association on its 100th anniversary. Since April 1908, the \nassociation has served the Lansdowne community, a neighborhood that has \na rich and interesting history.\n  In the 1800s, the Whitaker Iron Company began mining ore in the area \nand farms soon followed. Once the mining pits were abandoned, \nunderground springs filled the pits creating small ponds and lakes. The \narea continued to grow and develop, particularly with the influence of \nthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The B Railroad opened the Coursey \nStation in what is now Lansdowne. The Coursey Station Senior Housing \nCenter, a thriving mainstay of the community, is named for this \nstation.\n  Throughout the 20th century, the community continued its growth \naround Coursey Station. Lansdowne quickly became known as a B town \nbecause many of its residents worked for the railroad. Many of its \nworkers commuted to Baltimore City by train. This connection lasted \nuntil the 1960s when the B railroad closed the station. To this day, \nLansdowne remains a very close-knit community.\n  The Lansdowne Improvement Association is an active and visible part \nof the community. It hosts monthly meetings that are well attended by \nthe community. Working together to benefit the neighborhood, the \nAssociation sponsors the Citizens on Patrol program and a canned food \ndrive, and it keeps residents informed about activities and concerns in \nthe community.\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\nThe Lansdowne Police and Fire Departments have developed a strong \nrelationship with the association to ensure that residents are kept \ninformed about crime and other safety issues.\n  This year, as part of the 100th anniversary celebration, the \nLansdowne Improvement Association is bringing back the once-traditional \nLansdowne Parade, featuring music and entertainment.\n  I wish to express my congratulations to the Lansdowne Improvement \nAssociation, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this \nimportant milestone for the Lansdowne community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S541-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TAMMI MACKEBEN\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize one of my \nconstituents, Tammi Mackeben, who has been named the 2008 School \nCounselor of the Year by the American School Counselor Association. \nMrs. Mackeben was also named the Texas Multi-Level School Counselor of \nthe year by the Texas School Counselor Association in 2007.\n  The School Counselor of the Year contest is open to all 100,000 \nmembers of the school counseling profession. Mrs. Mackeben was \nnominated for this award by Principal Ricardo Damian and was evaluated \nby a select panel of industry experts on several criteria including: \ncreative school counseling innovations, effective counseling programs, \nleadership skills and their contribution to student advancement. Mrs. \nMackeben is 1 of 10 finalists from across the Nation, and the only \nrepresentative from Texas.\n  Mrs. Mackeben has worked as a counselor at the Ernesto Serna Two Way \nDual Language School in El Paso, TX, for 7 years. She and her colleague \nNorma Guerra are responsible for counseling close to 700 students in \ngrades kindergarten through eighth grade. Mrs. Mackeben works with \nstudents in the sixth through eighth grades, helping them to navigate \npersonal and academic challenges, and preparing them to continue their \neducation in high school. Both Mrs. Mackeben and Ms. Guerra have \nimplemented Comprehensive Developmental Guidance and Counseling on \ntheir campus. The Guidance and Counseling Program received the CREST \nAward--Counselors Reinforcing Excellence for Students in Texas--from \nthe Texas School Counselor Association and the RAMP Award--Recognized \nASCA Model Program--from the American School Counselor Association \nduring the 2006-2007 school year.\n  The guidance, support and compassion that Mrs. Mackeben shares in her \ndaily work is perhaps one of the best gifts a teacher can offer to her \nstudents.

A joint resolution adopted by the Alaska State \n     Legislature urging Congress to defeat H.R. 39; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 21\n\n       Whereas H.R. 39, titled ``To preserve the Arctic coastal \n     plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, as \n     wilderness in recognition of its extraordinary natural \n     ecosystems and for the permanent good of present and future \n     generations of Americans,'' has been introduced in the United \n     States House of Representatives; and\n       Whereas the oil industry, the state, and the United States \n     Department of the Interior consider the Arctic coastal plain \n     to have the highest potential for discovery of very large oil \n     and gas accumulations on the continent of North America, \n     estimated to be as much as 10,000,000,000 barrels of \n     recoverable oil; and\n       Whereas oil and gas exploration and development of the \n     Arctic coastal plain of the refuge and adjacent land could \n     result in major discoveries that would reduce our nation's \n     future need for imported oil, help balance the nation's trade \n     deficit, and significantly increase the nation's security; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 16 U.S.C. 3142 (sec. 1002 of the Alaska \n     National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA)), the \n     United States Congress reserved the right to permit further \n     oil and gas exploration, development, and production within \n     the coastal plain; and\n       Whereas enhancements in technology can be used in a manner \n     that minimizes the area within the refuge that is used for \n     exploration and development, while providing the nation with \n     a needed supply of oil and gas; and\n       Whereas the oil industry is using innovative technology and \n     environmental practices that are directly applicable to \n     operating on the Arctic coastal plain and that enhance \n     environmental protection beyond traditionally high standards; \n     and\n       Whereas the state will strive to ensure the protection of \n     the land, water, and wildlife resources during the \n     exploration and development of the Arctic coastal plain; and\n       Whereas 8,900,000 of the 19,000,000 acres of the refuge \n     have already been set aside as wilderness; be it\n       Resolved, That the Twenty-Fifth Alaska State Legislature \n     urges the United States Congress to defeat H.R. 39.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-283. A resolution adopted by the California State Lands \n     Commission expressing its support for the United Nations \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, California's 1,100 mile coastline, with its \n     beautiful beaches, wild cliffs, abundant fish stocks and \n     fragile environment is a national treasure and a valuable \n     state resource, which is at the heart of a tourist industry \n     that generates nearly five billion dollars in state and local \n     taxes each year; and is central to the state's $46 billion \n     ocean economy; and\n       Whereas, the California State Lands Commission has \n     jurisdiction over the state- owned tide and submerged lands \n     below the mean high tide line out to three miles from the \n     coast as well as the lands underlying California's bays and \n     rivers; and\n       Whereas, the Commission is charged with managing these \n     lands pursuant to the Public Trust Doctrine, a common law \n     that requires these lands to be used for commerce, fishing, \n     navigation, recreation and environmental protection; and\n       Whereas, protecting and improving the environmental \n     integrity of the Pacific Ocean affects the public trust \n     values of the lands under the Commission's jurisdiction and \n     the utility of these lands to the public and the environment; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \n     Sea (UNCLOS) is an international treaty ratified by more than \n     150 countries; and\n       Whereas, UNCLOS secures a member country's sovereign rights \n     over the waters and natural resources off its shores, while \n     also obligating the member country to protect the marine \n     environment within its territorial seas, along its \n     continental shelf, and on the high seas; and\n       Whereas, specifically, UNCLOS's marine environmental \n     protections address marine pollution, dumping, fisheries, \n     living resources, mining, oil and gas exploration, and \n     scientific research; and\n       Whereas, UNCLOS provides a general governance framework \n     that establishes a means to address future marine \n     environmental problems not specifically addressed in the \n     convention; and\n       Whereas, the United States has not ratified UNCLOS despite \n     the fact that there is strong bipartisan support for \n     ratification; the treaty is supported by all major \n     environmental groups, shipping and oil interests, and current \n     and former political figures across the ideological spectrum; \n     and\n       Whereas, if the United States ratifies UNCLOS, it could, \n     among other things, enforce its environmental laws in its \n     exclusive economic zone. Moreover, the United States will be \n     in a position to lead in the future application and \n     development of UNCLOS, and develop regional and international \n     cooperation to protect and preserve the marine environment; \n     and Therefore be it\n       Resolved by the California State Lands Commission, That it \n     supports the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \n     which would promote the United States' interest in the \n     environmental health of the oceans, secure sovereign rights \n     over extensive marine areas, and protect national security \n     interests; and, be it further\n       Resolved, that the Commission's Executive Officer transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Governor of California, to the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to \n     the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S542-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S542-S543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY for the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Mark R.

A bill to amend the Improper Payments Information Act of \n2002 (31 U.S.C. 3321 note) in order to prevent the loss of billions in \ntaxpayer dollars; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Improper \nPayments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2008.\n  At first glance, a bill with a name like that might not seem too \nexciting. But I can assure my colleagues that it addresses a serious, \nlargely unknown problem that is a real threat to our fiscal well being.\n  Each year, agencies are required to look at all of their programs and \nactivities and determine which are susceptible to significant improper \npayments. For those that are deemed at risk, agencies must produce \nestimated error rates that are included in their year-end financial \nstatements. They must also come up with action plans for reducing their \nerrors.\n  In fiscal year 2007, agencies are estimated to have made nearly $55 \nbillion in improper payments. That is an astounding number, Mr. \nPresident.\n  We spend so much time around here throwing around numbers like $55 \nbillion that they begin to lose their meaning. So I want to take a \nminute or so to put that number in perspective.\n  I was surprised to learn that $55 billion is more than the total \nbudget for the Department of Homeland Security. It is also twice as \nmuch as we're projected to spend to protect the vehicles our soldiers \nare using in Iraq against roadside bombs.\n  To illustrate further the amount of money we are talking about, $55 \nbillion is just a little bit less than the total GDP of Vietnam. It is \na little bit more than the GDPs of Croatia and Slovakia. Most \nastoundingly, $55 billion equals the combined GDPs of 44 of the smaller \ncountries in the world.\n  So our Federal Government is likely wasting more money than the total \npopulations of many countries produce in a given year.\n  But $55 billion is not even a real number. It is likely just the tip \nof the iceberg. It includes no error estimates for massive programs \nlike TANF, SCHIP, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Program. So I \nexpect that we will see more than $55 billion in improper payments next \nyear and the year after.\n  My colleagues and I on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management have held six \nhearings focused on this issue now, including one this afternoon. What \nwe\n\n[[Page S545]]\n\nhave learned is that, in some cases, agencies are just not taking their \nresponsibility to deal with and address their problems with improper \npayments and the management weaknesses that can cause them. The bill I \nam bringing forward today addresses just about all of the failures and \ndeficiencies we've learned about through our oversight.\n  My bill starts by improving transparency. OMB right now has set the \nreporting threshold for improper payments too low, meaning millions of \nerrors go unreported--and potentially unaddressed--each year. I want to \nlower the reporting threshold so that Congress and the general public \nhave a better picture of the problem we face.\n  My bill would also help to prevent improper payments from happening \nin the first place by requiring that agencies come up with stronger \ncorrective action plans and aggressive error reduction targets. It \nwould also implement a recent recommendation from GAO that called on \nOMB to develop a process whereby agencies would receive regular audited \nopinions on the financial controls used to prevent improper payments \nbefore they happen.\n  My bill would also force agencies to be more aggressive in recovering \nimproper payments they make. Some agencies--and most private sector \nfirms--regularly go over their books to identify payment errors and get \nback overpayments made to contractors and others they do business with. \nWe haven't done that enough in the Federal Government. Even as the \nagencies are reporting more and more improper payments, the amount \nrecovered remains miniscule. I want to change this by requiring that \nall agencies with outlays of $1 million or more perform recovery audits \non all of their programs and activities if doing so is cost effective.\n  Finally--and perhaps most importantly--my bill would hold agencies \naccountable. Today, as I mentioned, some agencies do not appear to be \ntaking improper payments very seriously. I want to force agencies to \nhold top managers accountable for their progress--or lack of progress--\nin doing something to take better care of the tax dollars we entrust \nthem with.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get these important \nreforms enacted. I am sure we can all agree that allowing this level of \nwaste to continue unchecked is reckless and unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a program to evaluate HIV/AIDS programs \nin order to improve accountability, increase transparency, and ensure \nthe delivery of evidence-based services, to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the PEPFAR \nAccountability and Transparency Act, a bill that will increase our \nability to research and identify the most effective interventions in \ncombating global AIDS. As we work to increase funding for the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, I believe we must \nalso insure that we maximize our investment in programs that have been \nfound effective in preventing infections and delivering care to as many \npeople as possible.\n  Through the years, the science known as operations research--the \nability to identify what is working and what is not working in our \ntreatment, prevention, and care interventions--has helped to improve \nthe effectiveness of the health care delivery system that we have \nestablished and enhanced with U.S. funding.\n  Take, for example, the issue of mother to child transmission of HIV. \nIn the U.S., cases of perinatal HIV transmission have dropped \nmarkedly--from more than 1,000 in 1991 to less than 100 in 2005--\nlargely due to access to critically needed, life-extending drugs. But \nin the developing world, where fewer than 10 percent of HIV positive \npregnant women, about 1 out of every 3 children born to mothers with \nHIV end up with the virus--a wholly preventable situation. The field of \noperations research is allowing us to understand how we can, in low \nresource settings, improve testing, education, and treatment options \nthat reduce cases of perinatal transmission.\n  There are many other areas where the data from operations research \ncan transform our ability to maximize the U.S. investment in global \nAIDS funding--through measuring the impact of our prevention education \nefforts, to understanding how addressing gender inequality can reduce \nHIV infection, to ensuring that treatment is delivered in a way that \nextends the lives of people with HIV.\n  This legislation will require the Government to develop a strategic \nplan to improve program monitoring, evaluation and operations research. \nWith this plan, we can determine the effectiveness of the interventions \nwe are funding, so that we can replicate those that are working well, \nand examine ways to improve those that do not have the outcomes that we \nexpected. The bill would also increase the dissemination of research \nfindings, so that those working in low-resource settings would be able \nto easily learn and implement cost-effective interventions in their \ncommunities.\n  I am proud to support increases for PEPFAR, but I also believe that \nwe must ensure that these increases are targeted toward effective \nprograms that reach as many people as possible. This legislation will \nhelp us achieve that goal. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the Senate to support this legislation and operations research as we \nmove forward with PEPFAR reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric\n\n\n                                              AIDS Foundation,\n\n                                                 January 28, 2008.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the Elizabeth Glaser \n     Pediatric AIDS Foundation, I would like to express our strong \n     support for the PEPFAR Accountability and Transparency Act. \n     We appreciate your leadership in expanding the important role \n     of operations research, program monitoring, and impact \n     evaluation research in the President's Emergency Plan for \n     AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and applaud your efforts in maximizing \n     U.S. financial commitment to the global AIDS pandemic.\n       Significant advances have been made over the last twenty-\n     five years in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment to \n     improve the lives of children and families affected by HIV/\n     AIDS across the globe. Yet, while scientists and doctors have \n     learned a great deal about HIV, how to prevent the spread of \n     HIV, and how to treat those already infected, insufficient \n     focus has been placed on putting many of those advances into \n     action on the frontlines of the pandemic. Operations research \n     is becoming increasingly important in determining what \n     approaches work best in the field and ensuring that this \n     knowledge is applied on a broader scale.\n       Your legislation will help ensure that we maximize the \n     lifesaving impact of PEPFAR resources by elevating operations \n     research as a priority in PEPFAR, improving accountability, \n     and strengthening transparency. Specifically, the legislation \n     directs the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to work in \n     collaboration with federal agencies, country governments, and \n     implementing partners to develop a five-year strategic plan \n     to prioritize operations research, program monitoring, and \n     impact evaluation research projects and establish timelines \n     for action.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to this issue. \n     We look forward to working closely with you to ensure that \n     children, women, and families worldwide benefit from this \n     important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pamela W. Barnes,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2586. A bill to provide States with fiscal relief through a \ntemporary increase in the Federal medical assistance percentage and \ndirect payments to States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a critical \npiece of legislation, the State Fiscal Relief Act of 2008. This \nlegislation builds upon the $20 billion State fiscal relief model \npassed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush as part of the \nJobs and Growth Tax Reconciliation Act of 2003. It would provide $12 \nbillion in State aid, equally divided between an increase in Federal \nMedicaid matching payments and general revenue sharing grants to \nStates.\n  Many of my colleagues may wonder why I am introducing a $12 billion \nState fiscal relief bill instead of a $15 billion State fiscal relief \nbill--the approach I have consistently supported. The reason is simple. \nI want to build on the strong, bipartisan support of our Nation's \nGovernors, who have repeatedly endorsed a $12 billion fiscal relief \npackage--with $6 billion in additional Medicaid assistance to States \nand $6 billion in targeted grants to States. I still worry that State \ndeficits will only grow in the coming days, weeks, and months, but I am \nwilling to start with $12 billion and continue my work with our \nNation's Governors, health care providers, advocates, and others to get \nthis aid to States immediately.\n  I want to begin my remarks with the fact that leading economists \nsupport State fiscal relief. Earlier this month, Mark Zandi, chief \neconomist of Moody's Economy.com, examined the effectiveness of the \nvarious stimulus options that Congress is considering. Dr. Zandi's \nanalysis found that targeted State aid would generate increased \neconomic activity of $1.36 for each dollar of cost, because it would \nlessen State and local government budget cuts that ``are sure to become \na substantial drag on the economy later this year and into 2009.''\n  As a former Governor, who survived the tough times of the 1980s, I \nstrongly believe that States deserve to be a part of the economic \nstimulus package currently before the Senate. State and local \ngovernments are an integral part of our national economic engine. They \nprovide health care and a wealth of social services to millions of \nAmericans, particularly when the economy is weak. We should act \nimmediately to provide States with relief before they are faced with \nthe harsh decision to cut children and families off of Medicaid.\n  States experience enormous budget pressures when the economy slows. \nState revenues can evaporate rapidly during an economic downturn. \nUnlike the Federal Government, States cannot borrow infinite amounts of \ndebt from China and other countries. By law, 49 States including West \nVirginia--are required to balance their budgets and, in times of \neconomic downturn, this task becomes significantly more difficult.\n\n[[Page S548]]\n\n  A delayed Federal response to the growing impact of this downturn on \nStates is an invitation to disaster. We know from experience that \nMedicaid is consistently the first program slated for cuts during a \nState budget squeeze. This is not only a problem for current Medicaid \nenrollees; it is also a problem for hard-working Americans who have \nlost their jobs because of the economic slowdown.\n\n  In the last year, our unemployment rate has increased to 5.0 percent \nwith nearly 900,000 more Americans without jobs. The loss of a job is \nhard enough financially on an individual or family, but since the \nmajority of Americans get their health insurance through their jobs, \nthe loss of a job often results in a simultaneous loss of health \ninsurance coverage. Medicaid fills the gap for working families when \nthey lose access to private coverage. For every 1 percent increase in \nthe unemployment rate, Medicaid enrollment increases by 2-3 million \npeople.\n  During the last economic downturn, the number of uninsured Americans \nwould have been millions more if Medicaid and CHIP had not responded to \nthe twin challenges of an economic downturn and a sharp drop-off in \nprivate health insurance coverage. A critical factor in helping States \nsustain Medicaid enrollment during those difficult times was the $20 \nbillion in State fiscal relief that Congress enacted in 2003. The 2003 \nfiscal relief provisions went a long way to preserve health care \ncoverage for millions of working Americans. However, we cannot discount \nthe fact that one million low-income people had already lost Medicaid \ncoverage because we waited two years into the recession to pass State \nfiscal relief. We should not make the same mistake twice. We must act \nquickly.\n  There is no question that health care is economic stimulus. Insuring \njobless workers encourages consumption of health care services and \nprovides an economic boost to the health care sector. People without \ninsurance seek treatment less often than people who are insured. \nUninsured Americans not only have greater problems accessing needed \ncare but often spend more out-of-pocket on health care, making it \nharder for them to spend on other things.\n  The grants to States are also stimulative. For example, they can be \nused to finance unfunded Federal mandates like child support \nenforcement. Six economists recently wrote that ``restoring funding to \nthe child support program will produce well-targeted stimulus to the \neconomy because child support redistributes income toward lower-income \nfamilies who are more likely to use the income to meet their \nconsumption needs. Restoring funding to the child support program would \nalso mean that the State and county governments would not have to lay \noff child support workers and reduce the level of services that they \nprovide families in the child support program.''\n  One of the arguments against State fiscal relief that I continue to \nhear is the argument that State fiscal conditions are not that bad. We \nhave to be very cautious about that type of argument because State \nfiscal situations are changing rapidly. The recent CBO report on the \neconomy alludes to this very fact. It reads, ``Recent evidence \nindicates that many States respond relatively quickly to a downturn in \nthe economy, even if it occurs after their budgets have been enacted \nfor the year.''\n  We already know from the National Governors Association that 18 \nStates have reported budget shortfalls totaling $14 billion for 2008 \nand 17 States project shortfalls totaling $31 billion for 2009. \nHowever, we cannot simply take a snapshot of the economy today and \nargue that this is not a crisis waiting to happen. The fact of the \nmatter is that a dozen more States could be in deficit situations very \nsoon if the downturn continues. This is especially true given the \nsignificant decline in property tax revenues in many States and the \nimpact of the bonus depreciation provisions included in the stimulus \nbill in several States.\n  As proud as I am of the 2003 fiscal relief package, I want to remind \nmy colleagues that the $20 billion in relief was nearly too late. One \nmillion low-income people had already been cut off of Medicaid by the \ntime that legislation finally passed because we waited two years into \nthe recession to enact it. History does not have to repeat itself. We \nknow that working families are at risk of becoming uninsured now and \ninto the near future, so we must act swiftly to protect them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. We have a \nreal opportunity to proactively address a looming health care crisis. \nThis approach is supported by the National Governors Association as \nwell as hundreds of provider and health advocacy groups nationwide. We \nshould not allow this opportunity to pass.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide for compensation to States incarcerating undocumented aliens \ncharged with a felony or 2 or more misdemeanors; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Hutchison and I are \nintroducing two bills that will significantly alleviate the burden of \nillegal immigration on State and local governments: the SCAAP \nReimbursement Protection Act of 2008 and the Ensure Timely SCAAP \nReimbursement Act. We are joined by Senators Boxer, Kyl, Schumer, \nCornyn, Durbin, McCain, Bingaman, Craig, Cantwell, Domenici, and Crapo.\n  These bills will amend the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, \nSCAAP, statute to ensure that states and localities receive more \nfunding for costs associated with incarcerating criminal aliens, and \nthat these reimbursements are given out in a timely manner.\n  The cost of incarcerating criminal aliens is high. In California \nalone, the State spent more than $900 million in 2007 to house over \n20,000 criminal aliens.\n  Congress enacted SCAAP in 1994 to help reimburse States and \nlocalities for the cost of arrest, incarceration, and transportation of \nthese aliens.\n  However, in 2003, the Department of Justice, DOJ, reinterpreted the \nstatute. Now States are only reimbursed for what they spend \nincarcerating convicted criminal aliens and only when the arrest and \nconviction occur in the same fiscal year.\n  The DOJ reinterpretation has significantly cut the reimbursement \nlocal governments are eligible to receive for incarcerating and \nprocessing illegal aliens.\n  This reinterpretation is even more devastating because SCAAP is \nconsistently under-funded. The President has zeroed out SCAAP funding \nin his budget proposal over the past 6 years. Through bi-partisan \nsupport, Congress was only able to partially fund the program.\n  As a result, SCAAP only reimburses States for a fraction of the costs \nof incarcerating criminal aliens. For example, in fiscal year 2007, \nSCAAP reimbursed only $109.5 million of the more than $912.5 million \nspent by the California Department of Corrections that year. That means \nthe State paid $803 million of its own funds to house criminal aliens.\n  This cut has had a domino effect on public safety funding. Every \ndollar less that SCAAP reimburses States means a dollar less to spend \non critical public safety services. For example, after the SCAAP \nfunding cuts in 2003, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department \nimplemented an ``early release'' policy for prisoners convicted of \nmisdemeanors.\n  I believe it is the Federal Government's responsibility to control \nillegal immigration. The funding cuts imposed by this administration \nhave let our local public safety services down, and have made our \ncommunities less safe.\n  The SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2008 would restore the \noriginal intent of SCAAP so that States are reimbursed for the costs of \nincarcerating aliens who are either charged with or convicted of a \nfelony or two misdemeanors. States would also be reimbursed regardless \nof the fiscal year of the incarceration and conviction.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the National Sheriffs' Associate, \nCalifornia State Association of Counties, CSAC, the U.S./Mexico Border \nCounties Coalition, the Virginia Sheriffs' Association, the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriff Lee\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nBaca, and the Sheriffs' Association of Texas.\n  Our colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee unanimously passed a \ncompanion bill, H.R. 1512, and I urge you to do the same.\n  Another problem with SCAAP is the significant delay in reimbursement. \nRecently, State and county governments that foot the bill for holding \ncriminal aliens between July 2004 and June 2005 had to wait until June \n21, 2007, before they were reimbursed.\n  For example, Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, and Riverside \nCounty waited 2 years to receive their reimbursement--totaling $85.9 \nmillion. While they were waiting, public safety offices had to cut back \non critical services. This delay is worse when one considers that even \nwhen localities receive the federal funds, they are only reimbursed for \npennies on every dollar spent.\n  Delays place unreasonable budgetary burdens on States, counties, and \nmunicipalities that already shoulder most of the costs of housing \ncriminal aliens.\n  California is not alone. Every other State depends on these funds to \nperform what is ultimately a federal responsibility--to control illegal \nimmigration and its effects in our communities. These delays affect \nevery State.\n  The Ensure Timely SCARP Reimbursement Act would help ease this burden \non States and localities by requiring the Justice Department to \ndisburse funds within 6 months of the application deadline.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these much needed \namendments to the SCAAP statute. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of these two bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 439\n\n       Whereas the sustained commitment of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) to mutual defense has made \n     possible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern \n     Europe and Eurasia;\n       Whereas NATO members can and should play a critical role in \n     addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era \n     in creating the stable environment needed for emerging \n     democracies in Europe and Eurasia;\n       Whereas lasting stability and security in Europe and \n     Eurasia require the military, economic, and political \n     integration of emerging democracies into existing European \n     structures;\n       Whereas, in an era of threats from terrorism and the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, NATO is \n     increasingly contributing to security in the face of global \n     security challenges for the protection and interests of its \n     member states;\n       Whereas the Government of Georgia and the Government of \n     Ukraine have each expressed a desire to join the Euro-\n     Atlantic community, and Georgia and Ukraine are working \n     closely with NATO and its members to meet criteria for \n     eventual NATO membership;\n       Whereas, at the NATO-Ukraine Commission Foreign Ministerial \n     meeting in Vilnius in April 2005, NATO and Ukraine launched \n     an Intensified Dialogue on membership between the Alliance \n     and Ukraine;\n       Whereas, following a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in \n     New York on September 21, 2006, NATO Secretary General Jaap \n     de Hoop Scheffer announced the launching of an Intensified \n     Dialogue on membership between NATO and Georgia;\n       Whereas the Riga Summit Declaration, issued by the heads of \n     state and government participating in the meeting of the \n     North Atlantic Council in November 2006, reaffirms that \n     NATO's door remains open to new members and that NATO will \n     continue to review the process for new membership, stating \n     ``We reaffirm that the Alliance will continue with Georgia \n     and Ukraine its Intensified Dialogues which cover the full \n     range of political, military, financial, and security issues \n     relating to those countries' aspirations to membership, \n     without prejudice to any eventual Alliance decision. We \n     reaffirm the importance of the NATO-Ukraine Distinctive \n     Partnership, which has its 10th anniversary next year and \n     welcome the progress that has been made in the framework of \n     our Intensified Dialogue. We appreciate Ukraine's substantial \n     contributions to our common security, including through \n     participation in NATO-led operations and efforts to promote \n     regional cooperation. We encourage Ukraine to continue to \n     contribute to regional security. We are determined to \n     continue to assist, through practical cooperation, in the \n     implementation of far-reaching reform efforts, notably in the \n     fields of national security, defense, reform of the defense-\n     industrial sector and fighting corruption. We welcome the \n     commencement of an Intensified Dialogue with Georgia as well \n     as Georgia's contribution to international peacekeeping and \n     security operations. We will continue to engage actively with \n     Georgia in support of its reform process. We encourage \n     Georgia to continue progress on political, economic and \n     military reforms, including strengthening judicial reform, as \n     well as the peaceful resolution of outstanding conflicts on \n     its territory. We reaffirm that it is of great importance \n     that all parties in the region should engage constructively \n     to promote regional peace and stability.'';\n       Whereas, in January 2008, Ukraine forwarded to NATO \n     Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer a letter, signed by \n     President Victor Yushchenko, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, \n     and Verkhovna Rada Speaker Arseny Yatensyuk, requesting that \n     NATO integrate Ukraine into the Membership Action Plan;\n       Whereas, in January 2008, Georgia held a referendum on NATO \n     and 76.22 percent of the votes supported membership;\n       Whereas participation in a Membership Action Plan does not \n     guarantee future membership in the NATO Alliance; and\n       Whereas NATO membership requires significant national and \n     international commitments and sacrifices and is not possible \n     without the support of the populations of the NATO member \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) reaffirms its previous expressions of support for \n     continued enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) to include qualified candidates; and\n       (B) supports the commitment to further enlargement of NATO \n     to include democratic governments that are able and willing \n     to meet the responsibilities of membership;\n       (2) the expansion of NATO contributes to NATO's continued \n     effectiveness and relevance;\n       (3) Georgia and Ukraine are strong allies that have made \n     important progress in the areas of defense, democratic, and \n     human rights reform;\n       (4) a stronger, deeper relationship among the Government of \n     Georgia, the Government of Ukraine, and NATO will be mutually \n     beneficial to those countries and to NATO member States; and\n       (5) the United States should take the lead in supporting \n     the awarding of a Membership Action Plan to Georgia and \n     Ukraine as soon as possible.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the NATO \nMembership Action Plan Endorsement Act of 2008. This resolution is \nintended to express strong Senate support for Administration leadership \nin ensuring that NATO extends Membership Action Plan, MAP, status to \nGeorgia and Ukraine as soon as possible.\n  NATO has a long track record of support for continued enlargement of \nNATO to democracies that are able and willing to meet the \nresponsibilities of membership. The leaders of Georgia and Ukraine have \nclearly stated their desire to join NATO and both have made remarkable \nprogress towards meeting NATO standards.\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\n  The Membership Action Plan was launched in April 1999 to assist \ncountries in preparations for possible NATO membership by providing \nadvice, assistance, and practical support on all aspects of membership \nrequirements. NATO has identified four main categories of cooperation \nand assistance through MAP. First, NATO assists in the development of a \nnational program that covers political, economic, defense, resource \nsecurity, and legal requirements for membership. Second, NATO experts \nprovide focused and candid feedback and political and technical advice \nto the governments. Third, NATO provides an organizational structure to \nassist in the coordination of defense and security assistance received \nfrom NATO member states and other allies. Fourth, NATO provides \nassistance in the construction of an individual approach to defense \nplanning to include force, personnel, and capability reforms.\n  MAP implementation is no longer simply an activity that focuses on \nmilitary and security issues. Inter-ministerial meetings engage other \ngovernmental departments in a coordinated and systematic approach with \nthe goal of government-wide reform and progress. These goals include \nsettling international, ethnic or external territorial disputes by \npeaceful means; demonstrating a commitment to the rule of law and human \nrights; and promoting stability and prosperity through economic reform, \nsocial equality, and environmental responsibility. Each participant is \nfree to choose the elements of MAP best suited to their own national \npriorities and circumstances. In other words, if approved at the NATO \nsummit at Bucharest, Romania in April, Tbilisi and Kyiv will set their \nown objectives, targets, and work schedules.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been evolving to meet the new \nsecurity needs of the 21st century. In this era, the threats to NATO \nmembers are transnational and far from its geographic borders. NATO's \nviability as an effective defense and security alliance depends on \nflexible, creative leadership, as well as the willingness of members to \nimprove capabilities and address common threats.\n  If NATO is to continue to be the preeminent security Alliance and \nserve the defense interests of its membership, it must continue to \nevolve and that evolution must include enlargement. Potential NATO \nmembership motivates emerging democracies to make important advances in \nareas such as the rule of law and civil society. A closer relationship \nwith NATO will promote these values and contribute to our mutual \nsecurity.\n  Three years ago, the U.S. Senate unanimously voted to invite 7 \ncountries to join NATO. Today, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are making significant contributions to \nNATO and are among our closest allies in the global war on terrorism. \nIt is time again for the U.S. to take the lead in urging its allies to \nrecognize the important efforts underway in Georgia and Ukraine, and to \noffer MAP to both countries this spring.\n  Both countries have significant amounts of work to accomplish before \nthey can be offered NATO membership. Let me be clear, MAP participation \ndoes not guarantee future membership, nor does it consist of simply a \nchecklist for aspiring NATO members to fulfill. It is a guide, not an \nendorsement to NATO membership.\n  I am confident that Presidents Saakashvilli and Yushchenko understand \nthat NATO membership will not be possible without the support of their \nrespective electorates. In Georgia the issue was put to a referendum \nearlier this month and 76.22 percent of voters supported NATO \nmembership. Ukrainian leaders have identified the need for a national \nreferendum on this important issue in the future. Alliance membership \nrequires commitment and sacrifice that must have the support of the \nlocal population if they are to be successfully implemented.\n  Last week, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Steven Pifer, outlined \nin the International Herald Tribune several compelling arguments for \nextending MAP to Ukraine. He said, in part: ``Granting Ukraine a MAP at \nthe Bucharest summit . . . would enhance European security and \nstability . . . [N]one of the arguments against the measure stand up to \nscrutiny . . . Ukraine has made as much progress on democratic, \neconomic, and military reform as Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and \nAlbania when they received MAPs in 1999 . . . Kyiv has demonstrated \nthat it has serious military capabilities and the political will to use \nthem. In recent years, the Ukrainian military has provided the alliance \nwith strategic airlifts; participated, often side-by-side with NATO \ntroops, in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and elsewhere; and \nmade a significant contribution to coalition ground forces in Iraq \nduring 2004-05. Ukraine would be a net contributor to Euro-Atlantic \nsecurity.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues support this important \nresolution. It sends a strong message to the administration, our NATO \nallies, as well as to the people of Georgia and Ukraine that we are \nprepared to work closely with each to contribute to the strengthening \nof peace and security in Europe and Eurasia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S551-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 440--RECOGNIZING SOIL AS AN ESSENTIAL NATURAL \n    RESOURCE, AND SOILS PROFESSIONALS AS PLAYING A CRITICAL ROLE IN \n                  MANAGING OUR NATION'S SOIL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to see the Military Reservist \nand Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act of 2008, \na bill that Senator Snowe and I developed, pass the Senate today. \nVeterans have sacrificed in the defense of our country, and they have \nearned the support of their Government in reentering civilian life. \nSenators Hagel, Cantwell, Landrieu, Lieberman, and Tester are \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  There are currently 24 million veterans in America, including over \n1.3 million who have left military service since 2001. As the conflicts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan continue, it becomes increasingly vital that \nreturning service-members receive the assistance they need to reenter \ncivilian life. According to the Department of Labor, the unemployment \nrate among recently discharged veterans is more than double the \nnational overall unemployment rate: 11.9 percent compared to 4.6 \npercent. In addition, 55 percent of self-employed reservists \nexperienced income loss when deployed, and 22 percent said that their \nbusiness suffered serious or very serious harm.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \naddressing the concerns of veteran entrepreneurs remains a top \npriority. In January 2007, the committee's first hearing, ``Assessing \nFederal Small Business Assistance Programs for Veterans and \nReservists,'' looked at the issues facing veterans who wish to start or \ngrow a small business. In March, the committee released a report, ``The \nState of Veteran Entrepreneurship'' which described the issues facing \nveterans and listed a series of recommendations to fix those problems. \nThe Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and \nOpportunity Act of 2008 is based on those recommendations.\n  Senator Snowe and I introduced S. 1784, the Military Reservist and \nVeteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act of 2007, on \nJuly 12, 2007. In September, that bill was added by unanimous consent \nas an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill; \nhowever, unfortunately, it was dropped in the final conference \nnegotiations. In November, after working closely to address concerns of \nother Members of the Senate, the bill passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent again, and the House took up the measure on January 16. An \namended version passed the House on the same day, and the amended bill \nwas passed by the Senate today. The House changes included removing a \nstudy looking at the tax and regulatory barriers facing veterans and \nreinserting Senate language requiring veteran and military service \norganizations to serve on a new interagency task force. Although this \nbill has changed from what I envisioned many months ago, it is an \nimportant step forward in supporting the American dream of business \nownership for veterans and reservists, and I am gratified to see it \npass the Senate and urge the President to sign it as quickly as \npossible.\n  The Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and \nOpportunity Act of 2007 takes a number of steps to improve the \nGovernment's role in supporting our veterans. Specifically, it \nreauthorizes the veterans programs in the Small Business \nAdministration. This legislation increases the funding authorization \nfor the Office of Veteran Business Development from $2 million today to \n$2.3 million over 2 years. In light of the large numbers of veterans \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan and increased responsibilities \nplaced on this office by Executive Order 13360, it is high time that \nthe Office of Veteran Business Development receive the funding levels \nthat it needs.\n  The bill also creates an interagency task force to improve \ncoordination between agencies in administrating veteran small business \nprograms. One of the biggest complaints that our committee heard at its \nhearing last January was that Federal agencies do not work together in \nreaching out to veterans and informing them about small business \nprograms. This task force will focus on increasing veterans' small \nbusiness success, including procurement and franchising opportunities, \naccess to capital, and other types of business development assistance.\n  This bill also permanently extends the SBA Advisory Committee on \nVeterans Business Affairs. The committee was created to serve as an \nindependent source of advice and policy recommendations to the SBA, the \nCongress, and the President. The veteran small business owners who \nserve on this committee provide a unique perspective, which is sorely \nneeded at this challenging time. Unfortunately, continuing uncertainty \nabout the committee's future has, at times, distracted the committee \nfrom focusing on its core function. Therefore, I have called for its \npermanent extension. It is clear to me that more needs to be done to \naddress the issues facing veterans and reservists, and the role this \ncommittee plays will continue to be important.\n  Additionally, I have taken a number of steps to better serve the \nreservists\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\nwho are serving their country abroad while their businesses are \nsuffering at home. Over the past decade, the Department of Defense has \nincreased its reliance on the National Guard and Reserves. This has \nintensified since September 11, and increased deployments are expected \nto continue. The effect of this increase on reservists and small \nbusinesses continues to remain of concern. A 2003 GAO report indicated \nthat 41 percent of reservists lost income when mobilized. This had a \nhigher effect on self-employed reservists, 55 percent of whom lost \nincome.\n  In 1999, I created the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster \nLoan, MREIDL, program to provide loans to small businesses that incur \neconomic injury as result of an essential employee being called to \nactive duty. However, since 2002, fewer than 300 of these loans have \nbeen approved by the SBA, despite record numbers of reservists being \ncalled to active duty. It is clear that changes need to be made, so \nthat reservists are informed about the availability of the MREIDL \nprogram and that the program better meets their needs. At our hearing \nlast January, we heard suggestions for a number of changes, which would \nimprove the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, \nand I have included those changes in this bill. They include increasing \nthe application deadline for such a loan from 90 days to 1 year \nfollowing the date of discharge, creating a predeployment loan approval \nprocess, and improved outreach and technical assistance.\n  This bill also increases to $50,000 the amount SBA can disburse \nwithout requiring collateral under the MREIDL program. Reservist \nfamilies have already sacrificed enough when a family member is called \nto serve their country. They should not have to forfeit the success of \ntheir business and their livelihood as well. This loan program would \nallow reservist-dependent businesses to access the capital they need to \nstay afloat without having to sacrifice beyond the service of the key \nemployees. In order to give reservists time to repay the loans, the \nnoncollateralized loan created in this bill would not accumulate \ninterest or require payments for 1 year or until after the deployment \nends, whichever is longer.\n  There are two more provisions, which will help this Nation's \nservicemembers. One section of the bill will require the SBA to give \npriority to MREIDL loans during loan processing. Another provision will \ngive activated servicemembers an extension of any SBA time limitations \nequal to the time spent on active duty. This will make it easier for \nservicemembers to serve their country while continuing to meet their \nobligations at home.\n  Lastly, this bill calls for two reports. One report will look at the \nneeds of service-disabled veterans who are interested in becoming \nentrepreneurs. As a result of the war on terror and improved medicine, \nwe are seeing more service-disabled veterans than we have seen in \ndecades. For some service-disabled veterans, entrepreneurship is the \nbest or only way of achieving economic independence. Therefore, it is \nessential that we understand and take steps to address the needs of the \nservice-disabled veteran entrepreneur or small business owner.\n  This bill also calls for a study to investigate how to improve \nrelations between reservists and their employers. In January, the \ncommittee heard that recent changes by the Department of Defense to \npolicies regulating the length and frequency of reservist deployments \nis harming the ability of reservists to find jobs and the ability of \nsmall business owners to continue hiring them. Understanding more about \nthis issue is important and essential to making sure that policymakers \ncan continue to support citizen soldiers and the small businesses that \nemploy them.\n  The bill also includes a number of other important provisions that \nwere added by the House. For instance, this bill includes language \ndirecting the Office of Veterans Business Development to increase the \nnumber of Veterans Business Outreach Centers and requires them to \nimprove their participation in the Transition Assistance Program. This \nbill also creates a program reducing 7(a) loan fees for veterans, \nimproves Small Business Development Centers outreach to the veteran \ncommunity, and instructs the Associate Administrator of the Office of \nVeterans Business Development to create and disseminate information \naimed at informing women veterans about the resources available to \nthem. I am pleased that the House and Senate were able to come to an \nagreement on these provisions.\n  Veterans possess great technical skills and valuable leadership \nexperience, but they require financial resources and small business \ntraining to turn that potential into a viable enterprise. A recent \nreport by the Small Business Administration stated that 22 percent of \nveterans plan to start or are starting a business when they leave the \nmilitary. For service-disabled veterans, this number rises to 28 \npercent.\n  We owe veterans and reservists more than a simple thank you for their \nservice. The least we can do is provide critical resources to help them \nstart and grow small business and to hold Federal agencies accountable. \nThat is what our bill does.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/31/senate-section/article/S559-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
