Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period for the \ntransaction of morning business until 3:30 p.m. today. Senator Dorgan \nwill be recognized for up to 45 minutes and Senator Specter for up to \n30 minutes. We will resume H.R. 2 at 3:30 p.m. for debate only until \n5:30 p.m. During this time, Senator Sessions will be recognized for an \nhour at 4 p.m. As a reminder to Members, cloture has been filed on the \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 2. and the bill itself. Therefore, Members \nhave until 3 p.m. today to file any additional first-degree amendments.\n  Currently, there are 23 amendments pending. I am told that the vast \nmajority of these amendments, after initial review by the \nParliamentarians, will be ruled not germane or arguably not germane. \nThe cloture vote on the substitute amendment will occur prior to the \nconference luncheons tomorrow at 12 noon.\n  Mr. President, if I may say a few words in addition, today we are \ngoing to, hopefully, have a debate that will be meaningful to the \nAmerican people on minimum wage. This debate will be completed tomorrow \nin many respects, with a cloture vote on the substitute occurring \ntomorrow. The other debate we may get to this week is that dealing with \nIraq. Both are issues past Congresses have neglected and both are areas \nwhere Democrats and Republicans must work together to move America \nforward.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  It has been 10 years since the minimum wage was last raised. During \nthat period of time, the cost of food has risen 23 percent, the cost of \nhealth care almost 45 percent, the cost of housing about 30 percent, \nthe cost of gas 135 percent, and that is as of today. Of course, as we \nknow, in the past, it has been much more than that. Congressional pay \nhas risen during that period of time by $30,000 per year per Member of \nCongress. But the minimum wage has stayed the same, $5.15.\n  Today, a full-time minimum wage worker earns $10,700 a year, working \n40 hours a week. That is $6,000 below the Federal poverty line for a \nfamily of three. This is wrong. It doesn't speak well of our country. \nAt its heart, this debate is about fairness.\n  In America, we believe--I think we should believe--a person working \nfull time should be able to live a life that is not in poverty. A \nmother, a father who works hard and plays by the rules should be able \nto feed, clothe, and raise their children. Isn't it better that we have \npeople who are engaged in work rather than welfare? The answer is yes.\n  Mr. President, $7.25 might not seem like a lot of money in \nWashington, but it would mean almost $4,500 more a year for the \nNation's working poor. That is enough money for a family of 3 to buy 15 \nmonths of groceries, 19 months for their utility bills, 8 months of \nrent, 2 years of health care, 20 months of childcare, and even 30 \nmonths of college tuition at some schools.\n  Tomorrow we will have a cloture vote on the minimum wage, and I sure \nhope this will be a good bipartisan vote on cloture, so we can complete \nthis legislation quickly.\n  Senators have had time to offer amendments. As I said Friday, when is \nenough enough? After 10 years, it is\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\ntime to stop talking about this issue and finally give \nworking Americans an overdue raise.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  When the Senate completes its work on the minimum wage--whether it is \ntomorrow, the next day, next day, the next day or next week--we are \ngoing to move to Iraq, and that is a debate regarding the proposed plan \nby the President to escalate the conflict. We owe it to our troops who \nserve bravely to have a real debate about the way forward in that war.\n  We are approaching 3,100 dead American soldiers. I was watching the \nLehrer ``NewsHour.'' They show, in silence, pictures of the soldiers \nwho have died in Iraq. They do it every few days. I watched this Friday \nand was struck by the number of women in this most recent reporting of \ndeaths who are pictured there, who have been killed. They were not \ncombat troops. They were doing activities important to the cause, such \nas driving vehicles. It is hard to determine what is combat and what is \nnot combat. A helicopter went down and women were in that helicopter. A \nhelicopter went down yesterday. I don't know who was in it, but we know \ntwo Americans were killed. So we have to have a debate about the way \nforward in the war in Iraq.\n  In Washington, we hear a lot of rhetoric about how the upcoming \ncongressional debate emboldens our enemies. To quote a headline that \nappeared in a lot of newspapers, this particular one was the Las Vegas \nSun newspaper, it said: Those who peddle such deceitful, political \ntalking points ``need a lesson in civics.''\n  As Mr. Warner, the gentleman Senator from Virginia, has said in this \ndebate, Senators are ``trying to exercise the fundamental \nresponsibilities of our democracy.''\n  Critics of the war also need a lesson in history. If history has \ntaught us anything, it is that our country is strongest when all three \nbranches of Government function. Our country is strongest when this \nlegislative branch is more than a rubberstamp. And, finally, our \ncountry is strongest when we have real, meaningful debate on issues of \nconsequence on behalf of the American people.\n  There is no issue greater in consequence than what is going on in \nIraq. To suggest that the former chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, a former Secretary of the Navy, a former marine, Senator \nJohn Warner, or highly decorated Vietnam veteran Chuck Hagel, who on \nthe battlefields of Vietnam saved his own brother's life, would take \nany action to undermine our troops and embolden the enemy--of course \nnot--to suggest such is beneath any administration official or Member \nof Congress, even though they both tried it. I think they should \nreexamine what they have said. It is dangerous rhetoric, motivated more \nby politics than events in Iraq.\n  These two men are examples of this not emboldening the enemy but our \ndoing, as the legislative branch of Government, what we are obligated \nto do: to talk about this conflict in Iraq.\n  We are in a hole in Iraq. Escalating the war is deepening that hole. \nWe need to find a way out of that hole. Our troops, most of all, need \nour help. They need a policy that is worthy of their heroic sacrifices. \nThey don't need hollow speeches or inflammatory rhetoric. They don't \nneed a rubberstamp. They need someone to ask the tough questions. They \nneed a legislative branch that will finally exercise its constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  I, for one, am glad we have finally arrived at this point where \nCongress is exercising its power. We arrived here because the American \npeople demanded we exercise our power.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President asked Members of \nCongress to give escalation a chance. But the truth is, escalation is \nthe same failed President Bush policy that has already run out of \nchances. The President has escalated the war before, only to see the \nsame results: increasing chaos, innumerable costs, and a civil war that \nis spinning out of control.\n  Is there a war in Iraq that is civil in nature? Of course. A \nmarketplace where people came to buy pets, to sell pets was blown to \nsmithereens, snakes crawling away from their cages. Children taking \ntests were hit with a mortar round over the weekend. And 600 insurgents \nwere gathered in an orchard where a battle that took 15 hours ensued \nover the weekend. Is there a civil war? Of course, there is a civil \nwar. Is there chaos in Iraq? Of course, there is chaos in Iraq.\n  The President knows how the American people feel. Generals Abizaid \nand Casey, when asked whether this escalation would be a good idea, \ntold the President ``no.'' They were relieved of duty. Prime Minister \nMaliki, speaking face to face with the President, said: Mr. President, \nget American troops out of Baghdad. That is what the democratically \nelected Prime Minister of Iraq told the President of the United States. \nThe Iraq Study Group has so told the President. And now we are going to \nhave a bipartisan vote that will tell the President the same.\n  There is no military solution in Iraq; there are only political \nsolutions in Iraq. With the vote, which will eventually come, we will \ngive the President another chance to listen, listen to the generals, \nlisten to the Iraq Study Group, listen to the American people, and \nlisten to a bipartisan Congress.\n  The stunning part of this is the people of Iraq don't want us there. \nPolls show that 70 percent of the Iraqis believe Iraq would be better \noff if we were out of there. So it is another chance to listen and \nchange course. That is what we hope will be the outcome of our debate. \nThat will be the right result for the Nation, for our strategic \ninterests, and for the troops.\n  We will work with my distinguished friend, the Republican leader, to \ntry to have something that is more understandable. The way things now \nstand, if cloture is invoked tomorrow, this matter can be played out, \nas I understand the procedures here, until about 1 o'clock Friday \nmorning and, if necessary, we will do that. But hopefully we can agree \non a way to proceed through this without those many votes and arrive at \na point where we can come to some agreement as to how we should proceed \nin a reasonable, logical way, so everyone has their opportunity to \nexpress views on Iraq. We have a number of competing legislative \nmatters we can vote on. It would seem to me very likely it will take 60 \nvotes to pass anything, but at least if we set up a responsible way to \ngo forward, I think it would be more meaningful to the body and to the \nAmerican people.\n  I know my friend, the Republican leader, will work with me. We will \ntry to do the best we can for the body itself; otherwise, we will work \nthrough the rules of the Senate, which will get us there but maybe not \nas quickly and as conveniently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1256-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Let me say to my good friend, the majority leader, I \nthink we should be able to work our way through some negotiations on \nthe Iraq matter that will allow us to consider a variety of proposals \nthat may be forthcoming. With regard to the advisability of doing any \nresolution at all, I think the Washington Post basically had it right \nlast week when they said they found it curious that we would confirm \nGeneral Petraeus overwhelmingly, which we did Friday, 81 to nothing, \nand then turn around and pass a resolution saying his mission, in our \njudgment, has no chance of succeeding.\n  I hope at the end of the day such a resolution will not be approved. \nHaving said that, I do think this is the last opportunity for the \nIraqis to get it right. They need to understand that even those of us \nwho are strong supporters of the President believe this is it. This is \ntheir chance to demonstrate that they can function in this effort to \nquiet the capital city of Baghdad so it can become a place in which \npolitical compromise can in fact occur. It is very difficult for that \nto happen when there are daily car bombings.\n  With regard to the minimum wage, let me indicate, Republicans made a \npledge at the start of this session to cooperate and that is exactly \nwhat we have done. We passed one strong bill and we are about to pass \nanother by keeping that pledge. Two weeks ago some of our colleagues on \nthe other side started to dispute our commitment to cooperation over \nthe ethics and lobbying bill. One of my good\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\nfriends on the other side said Republicans hated the bill and decided \nto kill it. Another said our effort to make the bill better through the \namendment process was ``one of the worst stunts he had seen in 25 years \nas a legislator.'' What made those observations particularly absurd is \nthat on that same day, the very same day those quotes were made, the \nbill passed 96 to 2.\n  Last week, many of our colleagues on the other side were reviving \ntheir charges of noncooperation after we took up the minimum wage bill. \nOne said Republicans don't tend to vote for a minimum wage increase. \nAnother said we were putting up obstacles to the bill so we wouldn't \nhave to act on it.\n  We passed a good ethics and lobby reform bill and we are going to \npass a good minimum wage increase bill because of Republican support \nand because Republicans insisted on a bipartisan package for both \nethics and lobbying. That is the reason we saw an overwhelming vote at \nthe end, support on both sides of the aisle. It is only because \nRepublicans insisted on a bipartisan package for the minimum wage bill \nthat I expect at some point in the near future we will see a similar \nvote on that. We pledged cooperation, and cooperation is exactly what \nwe are offering in these early days of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1257-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout S. 344, which provides for the televising of Supreme Court \nproceedings. This bill is cosponsored by Senator Grassley, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Schumer, Senator Feingold, and, with unanimous consent \nSenator Cornyn--a bipartisan representation. It is identical with \nlegislation introduced in the last Congress after having been voted out \nof committee, and was voted out of committee on a 12-to-6 vote. It was \npreviously introduced in 2005. It had a hearing on November 9 of 2005 \nand was reported out of committee on March 30 of 2006.\n  The essential provision is to require televising proceedings at the \nSupreme Court of the United States unless the Court determines on an \nindividual basis that there would be an inappropriate occasion and a \nviolation of the due process rights of the parties.\n  The thrust of this legislation is to bring public attention and \nunderstanding of how the Supreme Court of the United States functions, \nbecause it is the ultimate decisionmaker on so many--virtually all of \nthe cutting edge questions of our day. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates made the decision in Bush v. Gore, essentially deciding who \nwould be President of the United States. The Supreme Court decides \ncases on the death penalty, as to who will die.\n  It decides by 5-to-4 decisions so many vital cases, including \npartial-birth or late-term abortion, deciding who will live. It decides \nthe question of who will be elected, controlling the constitutional \ndecision on campaign contributions. It decides the constitutionality--\nagain, and all of the cases I mentioned are 5 to 4--on school prayer, \non school vouchers, on whether the Ten Commandments may be publicly \ndisplayed, on whether affirmative action will be permitted, on whether \neminent domain will be allowed--the taking of private property for \ngovernmental purposes. The Supreme Court of the United States decides \nthe power of the President as illustrated by Hamdan v. Rumsfeld--that \nthe President does not have a blank check and that the President is not \na monarch.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, again in a series of 5-to-4 \ndecisions, has decided what is the power of Congress, declaring in U.S. \nv. Morrison the legislation to protect women against violence \nunconstitutional because the Court questioned our ``method of \nreasoning,'' raising a fundamental question as to where is the \nsuperiority of the Court's method of reasoning over that of the \nCongress. But that kind of decision, simply stated, is not understood.\n  Or the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act, making two decisions which are \nindistinguishable, upholding the statute on a paraplegic crawling into \nthe courthouse in Tennessee and striking down the constitutionality of \nthe statute when dealing with employment discrimination. They did so on \na manufactured test of congruence and proportionality, which is \nliterally picked out of thin air.\n  Under our Constitution, I respect the standing of the Supreme Court \nof the United States to be the final arbiter and to make the final \ndecisions. But it is, I think, fundamental that the Court's work, the \nCourt's operation ought to be more broadly understood. That can be \nachieved by television. Just as these proceedings are televised on C-\nSPAN, just as the House of Representatives is televised on C-SPAN, so, \ntoo, could the Supreme Court be televised on an offer made by C-SPAN to \nhave a separate channel for Supreme Court oral arguments. There are \nmany opportunities for the Court to receive this kind of coverage, to \ninform the American people about what is going on so that the American \npeople can participate in a meaningful way as to whether the Court is \nfunctioning as a super-legislature--which it ought not to do, that \nbeing entrusted to the Congress and State legislatures, with the \nCourt's responsibility being to interpret the law.\n  It should be noted that the individual Justices of the Supreme Court \nhave already been extensively televised. Chief Justice Roberts and \nJustice Stevens were on ``Prime Time'' on ABC TV. Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg was on CBS with Mike Wallace. Justice Breyer was on ``FOX \nNews'' Sunday. Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer had an extensive \ndebate last December, which is available for viewing on the Web--and in \ntelevision archives. So there has been very extensive participation by \nCourt members, which totally undercuts one of the arguments, that the \nnotoriety would imperil the security of Supreme Court Justices.\n  It is also worth noting that a number of the Justices have stated \nsupport for televising the Supreme Court. For example, Justice Stevens, \nin an article by Henry Weinstein on July 14, 1989, said he supported \ncameras in the Supreme Court and told the annual Ninth Circuit Judicial \nConference at about the same time that, ``In my view, it is worth a \ntry.''\n  Justice Stevens has been quoted recently stating his favorable \ndisposition to televising the Supreme Court.\n  Justice Breyer, during his confirmation hearings in 1994, indicated \nsupport for televising Supreme Court proceedings. He has since \nequivocated, but has also noted that it would be a wonderful teaching \ndevice.\n  In a December 13, 2006 article by David Pereira, Justice Scalia said \nhe favored cameras in the Supreme Court to show the public that a \nmajority of the caseload involves dull stuff.\n  In December of 2000, an article by Marjorie Cohn noted Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg's support of camera coverage, so long as it is gavel to \ngavel--which can be arranged.\n  Justice Alito, in his Senate confirmation hearings last year, said \nthat as a member of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals he voted to \nadmit cameras. He added that it would be presumptuous of him to state a \nfinal position until he\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nhad consulted with his colleagues, if confirmed. But at a minimum, he \npromised to keep an open mind, noting that he had favored television in \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  Justice Kennedy, according to a September 10, 1990, article by James \nRubin, told a group of visiting high school students that cameras in \nthe Court were ``inevitable,'' as he put it. He has since equivocated, \nstating that if any of his colleagues raise serious objections, he \nwould be reluctant to see the Supreme Court televised. Chief Justice \nRoberts said in his confirmation hearings that he would keep an open \nmind. Justice Thomas has opposed cameras. Justice David Souter has \nopposed televising the Supreme Court. Justice Souter has been the most \noutspoken opponent of televising the Supreme Court, saying if cameras \nrolled into the Supreme Court, they would roll over his--as he put it--\nover his dead body--a rather colorful statement. But there has been, as \nnoted, considerable sentiment by quite a number of the Justices as to \ntheir personal views expressing favorable disposition toward televising \nthe Supreme Court.\n  The question inevitably arises as to whether Congress has the \nauthority to require televising Supreme Court proceedings, and I submit \nthere is ample authority on Congress's generalized control over \nadministrative matters in the Court. For example, it is the Congress \nwhich decides how many Justices there will be on the Court. It is \nremembered that President Roosevelt, in the mid to late 1930s, proposed \na so-called ``packing of the Court'' plan to raise the number to 15. \nBut that is a congressional judgment. The Congress decides when the \nSupreme Court will begin its term: on the first Monday of every \nOctober. The Congress decides what number will constitute a quorum of \nthe Supreme Court: six. The Congress of the United States has \ninstituted timelines that are required to be observed by the Supreme \nCourt when determining timeliness in habeas corpus cases. So there is \nample authority for the proposition that televising the Supreme Court \nwould be constitutional.\n  There is an article which is due for publication in May 2007 by \nAssociate Professor Bruce Peabody of the political science department \nof Fairleigh Dickinson University, and in that article, Professor \nPeabody makes a strong analysis that congressional action to televise \nthe Supreme Court would be constitutional. Also, in that article \nProfessor Peabody refers at length to the legislation which I \nintroduced in 2005 and says that it would be constitutional and \nobserves that:\n\n       A case could be made for reform giving rise to more wide-\n     ranging and creative thinking of the role and status of the \n     judiciary if the Supreme Court was, in fact, televised.\n\n  He further notes that:\n\n       Televising the Supreme Court could stimulate a more general \n     discussion about whether other reforms of the court might be \n     in order.\n\n  He notes that:\n\n       The so-called Specter bill would be meaningful in giving \n     wider play to a set of conversations that have long been \n     coursing through the academy about the relationship between \n     the court and the Congress.\n\n  The Supreme Court itself, in the 1980 decision in Richmond Newspapers \nv. Virginia, implicitly recognized, perhaps even sanctioned, televising \nthe Court because in that case, the Supreme Court noted that a public \ntrial belongs not only to the accused but to the public and the press \nas well; and that people acquire information on Court proceedings \nchiefly through the print and electronic media. But we know as a \nfactual matter that the electronic media, television, is the basic way \nof best informing the public about what the Supreme Court does.\n  There was enormous public interest in the case of Bush v. Gore argued \nin the Supreme Court in December of 2000 after the challenge had been \nmade to the calculation of the electoral votes from the State of \nFlorida and whether the so-called chads suggested or showed that Vice \nPresident Gore was the rightful claimant for those electoral votes or \nwhether then-Governor Bush was the rightful claimant.\n  The streets in front of the Supreme Court chambers across the green \nfrom the Senate Chamber were filled with television trucks. At that \ntime, Senator Biden and I wrote to Chief Justice Rehnquist urging that \nthe proceedings be televised and got back a prompt reply in the \nnegative.\n  But at least on that day the Supreme Court did release an audiotape \nwhen the proceedings were over, and the Supreme Court has made \navailable virtually contemporaneous audio tapes since. But I suggest \nthe audio tapes do not fill the bill. They do not have the audience. \nThey do not have the impact. They do not convey the forcefulness that \ntelevising the Supreme Court would.\n  There has been considerable commentary lately about the Court's \nworkload and the Court's caseload. Chief Justice Roberts, for example, \nnoted that the Justices:\n\n       Hear about half the number of cases they did 25 years ago.\n\n  And, he remarked that from his vantage point, outside the Court:\n\n       They could contribute more to the clarity and uniformity of \n     the law by taking more cases.\n\n  They have a very light backlog. In the 2005 term, only 87 cases were \nargued and 69 signed opinions were issued, which is a decrease from \nprior years. They have left many of the splits in the circuits \nundecided. Former Senator DeWine, when serving on the Judiciary \nCommittee, asked Justice Alito about the unresolved authority at the \ncircuit level. Now Justice Alito characterized that as ``undesirable.'' \nBut that happens because of the limited number of cases which the \nSupreme Court takes.\n  There has also been concern, as noted in an article by Stuart Taylor \nand Ben Wittes captioned, ``Of Clerks And Perks,'' that the four clerks \nper Justice constitute an undesirable allocation of resources, and the \nTaylor-Wittes article cites the Justice's extensive extracurricular \ntraveling, speaking, and writing, in addition to their summer recesses \nand the vastly reduced docket as evidence that something needs to be \ndone to spur the Court into taking more cases.\n  If the Court were to be televised, there would be more focus on what \nthe Court is doing. That focus can be given without television, but \nonce the Supreme Court becomes the center of attraction, the center of \nattention, articles such as that written by Taylor and Wittes would \nhave much more currency.\n  The commentators have also raised a question about the pooling of the \napplications for certiorari. There were, in the 2005 term, some 8,521 \nfilers. Most of those are petitions for certiorari. That is the fancy \nLatin word for whether the Court will grant process to hear the case \nfrom the lower courts. As we see, the Court acts on a very small number \nof those cases. Only 87 cases were argued that year in a term when more \nthan 8,500 filings were recorded, most of those constituting cases \nwhich could have been heard. And, the Supreme Court has adopted a \npractice of the so-called ``cert pool,'' a process used by eight of the \nnine Justices. Only Justice Stevens maintains a practice of reviewing \nthe cert petitions himself on an individual basis, of course, assisted \nby his clerks. But when the Court is charged with the responsibility of \ndeciding which cases to hear, it is my view that it is very problematic \nand, in my judgment, inappropriate for the Justices not to be giving \nindividualized attention, at least through their clerks, and not having \na cert pool where eight of the Justices have delegated the job of \ndeciding which cases are sufficiently important to hear to a pool.\n  We do not know the inner workings of the pool, but I believe it is \nfair and safe to infer that the judgments are made by clerks. Precisely \nwhat the level of reference and what the level of consultation with the \nJustices is we do not know, but when an application is made to the \nSupreme Court of the United States to hear a case, it is my view that \nthere ought to be individualized consideration.\n  That also appeared to be the view of now Chief Justice John Roberts, \nwho said in a 1997 speech, according to a September 20, 2000, article \nin the Legal Times by reporter Tony Mauro where then-private \npractitioner John Roberts said he ``found the pool disquieting, in that \nit made clerks a bit too significant in determining the Court's \ndocket.''\n  I would suggest that is an understatement, to give that kind of power \nto the clerks and, beyond that, to give that kind of power to the \nclerks in a pool, where the individual Justices do\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\nnot even make the delegation to their own clerks with whatever review \nthey would then utilize but make that a delegation to a cert pool.\n  There have been many scholarly statements about the desirability of \nhaving greater oversight on what happens in the Supreme Court. Chief \nJustice William Howard Taft, who was the 10th Supreme Court Chief \nJustice and the 27th President of the United States, said that review \nand public scrutiny was the best way to keep the judges on their toes. \nAnd Justice Felix Frankfurter said that he longed for the day when the \nSupreme Court would receive as much attention as the World Series \nbecause the status of the Supreme Court depended upon its reputation \nwith the people.\n  These are the exact words of Chief Justice William Howard Taft:\n\n       Nothing tends more to render judges careful in their \n     decision and anxiously solicitous to do exact justice than \n     the consciousness that every act of theirs is subject to the \n     intelligent scrutiny of their fellow men and to candid \n     criticism.\n\n  Justice Felix Frankfurter's exact words were:\n\n       If the news media would cover the Supreme Court as \n     thoroughly as it did the World Series, it would be very \n     important since ``public confidence in the judiciary hinges \n     on the public perception of it.''\n\n  We have a continuing dialogue and a continuing discussion as to the \nrole of the Supreme Court in our society. We have the cutting edge \nquestions consistently coming to the Court. We have them deciding the \nissues of who will live, who will die, what will be the status of \nprayer in the schools, what will be the status of our election laws, \nand through the vagaries of due process of law and equal protection, \nthere are many standards which the Court can adopt.\n  I was candidly surprised, in reviewing the recent Supreme Court \ndecisions for the confirmation hearings on Chief Justice Roberts and \nJustice Alito, to find how far the Court had gone in striking down the \npower of Congress. It was 11 years between the confirmation proceeding \non Justice Breyer and the confirmation proceeding on Chief Justice \nRoberts. With our workload here, it is not possible, even with \nresponsibilities on the Judiciary Committee, even with responsibilities \nas chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to keep up with the Supreme \nCourt opinions.\n  When I read United States v. Morrison, where the Supreme Court struck \ndown the legislation protecting women against violence on a 5-to-4 \ndecision because Chief Justice Rehnquist questioned our ``method of \nreasoning,'' I wondered what kind of a transformation there was when \nyou leave the Senate Chamber, where our columns are aligned exactly \nwith the Supreme Court columns across the green, what kind of a \ntransformation there was with method of reasoning that there is such \nsuperior status when going to the Court. Certainly I have noted no \ncomplaint about Senators' method of reasoning when we confirm Supreme \nCourt Justices.\n  Then we picked up the Americans with Disabilities Act. We had two \ncases--one involving Alabama which involved employment discrimination \nand one involving Tennessee which involved access by a paraplegic to \nthe courtroom--dealing with exactly the same records. In the Alabama \ncase, the Supreme Court declared 5 to 4 that the act of Congress was \nunconstitutional. In the Tennessee case, exactly on the same record, \nthey decided the act was constitutional. What standard did they use? \nThey adopted a standard on a 1997 Supreme Court decision in a case \ncalled Boerne. In that case, the Supreme Court decided they would \nrender a constitutional judgment in a context where Congress had \nlegislated under article V of the 14th amendment to preserve due \nprocess of law where the challenge was made by the State that the \nStates were immune under the 11th amendment. The Supreme Court decided \nit would impose a test of whether the statute was ``congruent and \nproportional.'' This standard had never been heard in jurisprudence \nbefore that time, ``congruent and proportional.'' I defy anyone to say \nwhat those words mean in a standard which can be applied in a way which \ncan be predicted by lawyers and understood by State legislators and \nunderstood by clients.\n  In a dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia chastised the Court for \nbeing, in effect, the taskmaster of the Congress, to see if the \nCongress had done its homework, whereas in prior cases the adequacy of \nthe record was determined by a substantial record and the Court would \ndefer to the judgment of Congress, which established, through lengthy \nhearings and proceedings, a very extensive record. In talking to my \ncolleagues, those decisions by the Supreme Court undercutting \ncongressional power were not known.\n  Then we have the Supreme Court being the final arbiter on what \nhappens on Executive power, what happens at Guantanamo, what is the \nresponsibility of the President of the United States on military \ncommissions, what is the responsibility under the Geneva Conventions. \nHere again, I respect the Supreme Court's decisions, respect their role \nas the final arbiter, but say that there ought to be an understanding \nby the public. It may be that there will never be a case which has more \nimpact on the working of Government than the decision as to whether the \nFlorida electoral votes would be counted for George Bush or for Albert \nGore in the famous case of Bush v. Gore.\n  A prior version of this legislation came out of committee last year \non a bipartisan 12-to-6 vote. It has very substantial cosponsorship. I \nurge my colleagues to consider it carefully. I urge the distinguished \nmajority leader to look for a spot to bring such legislation to the \nSenate.\n  There is companion legislation which Senator Grassley is offering \nwhich gives the courts--the Supreme Court, courts of appeals, trial \ncourts--the discretion to have television. My legislation, S. 344, is \nmore targeted. It has a requirement as to the Supreme Court televising \nits proceedings unless there is some due-process violation which is \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis.\n  When the article comes out by Professor Bruce Peabody in the \nUniversity of Notre Dame Law Journal, I commend it to everyone's \nattention. I have advance text, have cited some of Professor Peabody's \nconclusions on his decision that the legislation has very important \npublic policy benefits and, as he analyzes it, is constitutional.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the written statement \nbe printed in the Congressional Record as if recited, and I ask that \nprior to the introduction of that prepared statement, my statement \nappear, that the comments I have made up until now have been a summary \nof that more extensive statement, an extemporaneous summary, and the \nfull statement follows. Sometimes people reading the Congressional \nRecord wonder why there is so much repetition, and I think a word of \nexplanation that the initial statement is a summary and the formal \nstatement is added would explain why the repetition exists.\n  I ask all of this explanation be printed in the Record. Finally, I \nask that Senator Cornyn be included as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenator Specter's Talking Points Upon Introduction of S. 344, a Bill To \n           Permit the Televising of Supreme Court Proceedings\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, once again I seek recognition \n     to introduce legislation that will give the public greater \n     access to our Supreme Court. This bill requires the high \n     Court to permit television coverage of its open sessions \n     unless it decides by a majority vote of the Justices that \n     allowing such coverage in a particular case would violate the \n     due process rights of one or more of the parties involved in \n     the matter.\n       The purpose of this legislation is to open the Supreme \n     Court doors so that more Americans can see the process by \n     which the Court reaches critical decisions that affect this \n     country and all Americans. The Supreme Court makes \n     pronouncements on Constitutional and Federal law that have a \n     direct impact on the rights and lives of all of us. \n     Televising the Court's oral arguments will enhance the \n     public's understanding of the issues and the impact of, and \n     reasons for, the Court's decisions.\n       I believe that now is the right time for this legislation. \n     In his 2006 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, Chief \n     Justice Roberts noted that ``The total number of cases filed \n     in the Supreme Court increased from 7,496 filings in the 2004 \n     Term to 8,521 filings in the 2005 Term--an increase of 13.7 \n     percent.'' Despite this increase in petitions, during the \n     2005 Term, only 87 cases were argued, and 69\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\n     signed opinions were issued. These 69 signed opinions \n     compares to 74 opinions in the 2004 Term.\n       A recent article by law professor Jeffrey Rosen in The \n     Atlantic Monthly points out that ``Fifty-four percent of the \n     decisions in the first year of the Roberts Court were \n     unanimous'' and ``the Court issued more consecutive unanimous \n     opinions than at any other time in recent history.'' I \n     commend the Supreme Court and Chief Justice Roberts for what \n     appears to be an increase in consensus, as reflected in the \n     unanimity in these cases.\n       But I am concerned about the steady decline each year in \n     the number of Supreme Court full opinions; the number of \n     cases decided by the slimmest majority of five justices; and \n     the number of opinions that have multiple dissents and \n     concurrences that lead to more confusion than clarity in the \n     law. I believe that permitting cameras into oral arguments is \n     one way to shed light on the nature of the work of the \n     Supreme Court and to improve public awareness of the Court's \n     workload, the Court's institutional prerogatives, and even \n     judicial personalities. The public wants to know: Who are \n     these judges and how do they do what they do?\n       A January 7, 2007 article by Robert Barnes in the \n     Washington Post observes that ``After decades of decline in \n     its caseload, the [Supreme] Court is once again on track to \n     take its fewest number of cases in modern history.'' The \n     article notes that during his confirmation proceedings, Chief \n     Justice Roberts observed that the justices ``hear about half \n     the number of cases they did 25 years ago'' and he remarked \n     that from his vantage point outside the court, ``they could \n     contribute more to the clarity and uniformity of the law by \n     taking more cases.'' Similarly, during his confirmation \n     hearings and in response to questions from Senator DeWine, \n     Justice Alito described unresolved splits of authority at \n     the circuit court level as ``undesirable.''\n       The Barnes article posits six possible reasons for the \n     Court's waning docket: (1) 1988 legislation passed at the \n     Court's request that limits the Court's mandatory review \n     docket (2) the change in justices over the past couple of \n     decades, (3) a decrease in splits among the circuits due to \n     an increasingly homogenous appellate judiciary appointed by \n     Republican administrations, (4) a decrease in appeals by the \n     Federal government as a result of more government wins in the \n     lower courts, (5) the ``cert pool'' process used by eight of \n     the nine Justices, which relies upon law clerks to recommend \n     which cases are ``cert-worthy;'' and (6) the possibility that \n     justices on a closely divided court are hesitant to grant \n     certiorari if they think their view will not prevail in the \n     ultimate outcome of a case. I have no particular view on the \n     merits of these possible explanations but they do make me \n     increasingly curious about the Court and its workload.\n       In a September 2005 article in The Atlantic Monthly, Stuart \n     Taylor, Jr. suggests, ``As our Supreme Court justices have \n     become remote from the real world, they've also become more \n     reluctant to do real work--especially the sort of quotidian \n     chores done by prior justices to ensure the smooth \n     functioning of the judicial system. The Court's overall \n     productivity--as measured by the number of full, signed \n     decisions--has fallen by almost half since 1985. Clerks draft \n     almost all the opinions and perform almost all the screening \n     that leads to the dismissal without comment of 99 percent of \n     all petitions for review. Many of the cases dismissed are the \n     sort that could be used to wring clear perversities and \n     inefficiencies out of our litigation system--especially out \n     of commercial and personal-injury litigation.'' Mr. Taylor \n     concludes the article by exclaiming, ``Quietly our Supreme \n     Court has become a sort of aristocracy--unable or unwilling \n     to clearly see the workings, glitches, and peculiarities of \n     the justice system over which it presides from such great \n     altitude.''\n       Mr. Taylor's frustration with the Supreme Court may have \n     reached its zenith when, in July of 2006, he coauthored an \n     article with Benn Wittes entitled, ``Of Clerks and Perks.'' \n     In this piece the authors suggest that ``an exasperated \n     Congress'' should ``fire'' the Court's clerks by reducing the \n     budget for clerks from four (4) per justice to one (1). Mr. \n     Taylor and Mr. Wittes cite the justices' extracurricular \n     traveling, speaking and writing, in addition to their summer \n     recesses and vastly reduced docket as evidence that something \n     needs to be done to spur the Court into taking up more cases. \n     According to the authors, terminating \\3/4\\ of the clerks \n     would end the justices' ``debilitating reliance on \n     twentysomething law-school graduates'' and ``shorten their \n     tenure by forcing them to do their own work, making their \n     jobs harder and inducing them to retire before power corrupts \n     absolutely or decrepitude sets in.''\n       I do not necessarily agree with Mr. Taylor or Mr. Wittes \n     about what ails the Supreme Court. I do, however, strongly \n     agree with their observation that ``Any competent justice \n     should be able to handle more than the current average of \n     about nine majority opinions a year. And those who don't want \n     to work hard ought to resign in favor of people who do.''\n       Shortly after Taylor and Wittes issued their acerbic \n     diatribe against the Court for its failure to grant \n     certiorari in more cases, a September 20, 2006 article by \n     Legal Times reporter Tony Mauro observed that eight of the \n     nine sitting justices, including the recently confirmed Chief \n     Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, would continue to \n     participate in the Supreme Court's law clerk cert-pool. Mauro \n     describes the cert-pool as an ``arrangement, devised in 1972, \n     [that] radically changed what happens when a petition for \n     review or certiorari comes in to the court. Instead of being \n     reviewed separately by nine clerks and/or nine justices, it \n     is scrutinized for the pool, presumably in greater depth, by \n     one clerk, who then writes a memo for all the justices in the \n     pool.'' Mr. Mauro goes on to remind us that in a 1997 speech \n     John Roberts gave while in private practice, ``he found the \n     pool `disquieting' in that it made clerks `a bit too \n     significant' in determining the court's docket.''\n       A December 7, 2006 article by Linda Greenhouse observed \n     that ``The Court has taken about 40 percent fewer cases so \n     far this term than last. It now faces noticeable gaps in its \n     calendar for late winter and early spring. The December \n     shortfall is the result of a pipeline empty of cases granted \n     last term and carried over to this one.'' Looking back at \n     last term, Ms. Greenhouse observed, ``The number of cases the \n     court decided with signed opinions last term, 69, was the \n     lowest since 1953 and fewer than half the number the court \n     was deciding as recently as the mid-1980s.'' Ms. Greenhouse \n     goes on to note that 16 of the 69 cases--about 23 percent--\n     were decisions with a split of five to four.\n       On January 11, 2007, in an article by Brooke Masters and \n     Patti Waldmeir, the Financial Times tells how ``For years, \n     the court declined to hear many cases that most profoundly \n     affected corporate America.'' Ms. Masters and Ms. Waldmeir \n     note that 44 percent of the Supreme Court's docket this term \n     includes cases involving business, up from 30 percent in the \n     previous two terms. Nonetheless, they note, ``Far too often . \n     . . Supreme Court rulings cast as much ambiguity as they \n     resolve.'' The authors go on to quote Steve Bokat, general \n     counsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as saying he'd \n     ``rather have a bad decision that's clear than an OK decision \n     that's not.'' According to Bokat, ``Ninety percent of the \n     time, if you get clarity in a decision with a definitive \n     holding, you at least know what your obligations are, and \n     even if you don't like the opinion you are much less likely \n     to get in trouble with litigation.'' Bokat said Chief Justice \n     Roberts ``gets this'' and ``understands the importance of \n     clarity'' yet Bokat notes that ``in order to get that \n     unanimity the decisions tend to be more narrow [and] it \n     doesn't give you much advice on what to do going forward.''\n       I should also note that recent news articles point out the \n     high Court has become more media friendly--even though the \n     same articles deem the prospect of televised proceedings \n     ``remote.'' A December 25, 2006 article by Mark Sherman \n     observes ``Lately . . . some members of the court have been \n     popping up in unusual places--including network television \n     news programs--and talking about more than just the law.'' \n     Mr. Sherman notes with some irony that then-Chief Justice \n     ``Rehnquist could stroll around the court, unrecognized by \n     tourists. Justice Anthony Kennedy snapped a photograph for \n     visitors who had no idea who he was and Justice John Paul \n     Stevens was once asked to move out of the way by a \n     picture-taking tourist.'' The article suggests that \n     despite the Supreme Court's reticence about cameras in \n     oral arguments, Chief Justice ``Roberts believes its \n     credibility will be enhanced if the justices appear less \n     remote.''\n       Frankly, I agree with the view that making the justices \n     less remote adds to the credibility of the Supreme Court. I \n     also believe that public understanding may help heal some of \n     the deep division and even cynicism we have in some segments \n     of our society. This is why I'm introducing legislation to \n     permit cameras into oral arguments. As our 27th President and \n     10th Chief Justice William Howard Taft teaches, ``Nothing \n     tends more to render judges careful in their decision and \n     anxiously solicitous to do exact justice than the \n     consciousness that every act of theirs is to be subject to \n     the intelligent scrutiny of their fellow men, and to their \n     candid criticism . . . . In the case of judges having a life \n     tenure, indeed, their very independence makes the right \n     freely to comment on their decisions of greater importance, \n     because it is the only practical and available instrument in \n     the hands of a free people to keep judges alive to the \n     reasonable demands of those they serve.\n       For their part, some of the justices have expressed an \n     openness to the idea of allowing a broader audience to see \n     oral arguments.\n       Chief Justice Roberts, in addition to comments about the \n     court needing to appear less remote, stated at his 2005 \n     confirmation hearing upon being nominated as Chief Justice, \n     ``Well, you know my new best friend, [former] Sen. Thompson \n     assures me that television cameras are nothing to be afraid \n     of. But, I don't have a set view on that.''\n       Justice Alito, at his Senate Confirmation hearings in 2006, \n     said that as a member of the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, he \n     voted to admit cameras, but a majority of his colleagues \n     rejected the idea. In response to a question I posed, Justice \n     Alito said, ``I argued we should do it'' but he went on to \n     qualify his personal belief by saying, ``it would be \n     presumptuous for me to talk about it right now'' with respect \n     to the Supreme Court. Justice Alito pledged he would ``keep \n     an open mind despite the position I took on the circuit \n     court.''\n       Justice Breyer, during his confirmation hearings in 1994, \n     indicated support for televised Supreme Court proceedings. He \n     has more recently stated, at an event in late\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\n     2005, that cameras in the Supreme Court ``would be a \n     wonderful teaching device'' but might become a symbol for \n     lower federal courts and state courts on the advisability of \n     cameras in courtrooms. Justice Breyer noted that ``not one of \n     us wants to take a step that could undermine the court as an \n     institution'' and expressed the hope that ``eventually the \n     answer will become clear . . . .''\n       Justice Stevens, according to a July 14, 1989 article by \n     Henry Weinstein in the Times Mirror, appears to support \n     cameras and he told the annual 9th Circuit Judicial \n     Conference attendees, ``In my view, it's worth a try.''\n       Justice Kennedy, according to a September 10, 1990 article \n     by James H. Rubin, told a group of visiting high school \n     students that cameras in the Court were ``inevitable.'' But \n     Justice Kennedy later stated that ``a number of people would \n     want to make us part of the national entertainment network.'' \n     In testimony before the Commerce, Justice, State and \n     Judiciary Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee \n     in March of 1996, Justice Kennedy pledged, ``as long as any \n     of my colleagues very seriously objects, I shall join with \n     them.''\n       Justice Thomas, in an October 27, 2006 article by R. Robin \n     McDonald, is quoted as saying, ``I'm not all that enthralled \n     with that idea. I don't see how it helps us do our job. I \n     think it may distract from us doing our job.'' Justice Thomas \n     added that if 80 percent of the appellate process is wrapped \n     up in the briefs, ``How many of the people watching will know \n     what the case is about if they haven't read the briefs?'' \n     Justice Thomas went on to suggest the viewing public would \n     have a ``very shallow'' level of understanding about the \n     case.\n       On October 10, 2005, Justice Scalia, opposed an earlier \n     version of my bill, stating, ``We don't want to become \n     entertainment . . . . I think there's something sick about \n     making entertainment out of real people's problems. I don't \n     like it in the lower courts, and I don't particularly like it \n     in the Supreme Court.'' Yet a recent December 13, 2006, \n     article by David Perara reports that Justice Scalia favors \n     cameras in the Supreme Court to show the public that a \n     majority of the caseload involves, ``Internal Revenue code, \n     the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act], the bankruptcy \n     code--really dull stuff.''\n       Justice Ginsburg made a similar observation: ``The problem \n     is the dullness of most [Supreme] Court proceedings.'' This \n     comment was in a December 2000 article by Marjorie Cohen who \n     noted Justice Ginsburg's support of camera coverage so long \n     as it is gavel-to-gavel.\n       Justice Scalia's, Justice Thomas' and Justice Ginsberg's \n     points are well taken. The public should see that the issues \n     decided by the Court are not simple and not always exciting, \n     but they are, nonetheless, very important.\n       So I have to disagree with Justice Souter, who appears to \n     be the staunchest opponent of cameras in the Supreme Court \n     and who famously said in 1996, ``I can tell you the day you \n     see a camera come into our courtroom, it is going to roll \n     over my dead body.''\n       Many years ago, Justice Felix Frankfurter may have \n     anticipated the day when Supreme Court arguments would be \n     televised when he said that he longed for a day when: ``The \n     news media would cover the Supreme Court as thoroughly as it \n     did the World Series, since the public confidence in the \n     judiciary hinges on the public's perception of it, and that \n     perception necessarily hinges on the media's portrayal of the \n     legal system.'' It is hard to justify continuing to exclude \n     cameras from the courtroom of the Nation's highest court. As \n     one legal commentator observes: ``An effective and legitimate \n     way to satisfy America's curiosity about the Supreme Court's \n     holdings, Justices, and modus operandi is to permit broadcast \n     coverage of oral arguments and decision announcements from \n     the courtroom itself.''\n       In recent years watershed Supreme Court precedents, have \n     been joined by important cases like Hamdi, Rasul and Roper--\n     all cases that affect fundamental individual rights. In Hamdi \n     v. Rumsfeld, 2004, the Court concluded that although Congress \n     authorized the detention of combatants, due process demands \n     that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy \n     combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the \n     factual basis for that detention before a neutral \n     decisionmaker. The Court reaffirmed the Nation's commitment \n     to constitutional principles even during times of war and \n     uncertainty.\n       Similarly, in Rasul v. Bush, 2004, the Court held that the \n     Federal habeas statute gave district courts jurisdiction to \n     hear challenges of aliens held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in the \n     U.S. War on Terrorism. In Roper v. Simmons, a 2005 case, the \n     Court held that executions of individuals who were under 18 \n     years of age at the time of their capital crimes is \n     prohibited by Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n       Then on June 27, 2005, the high Court issued two rulings \n     regarding the public display of the Ten Commandments. Each \n     opinion was backed by a different coalition of four, with \n     Justice Breyer as the swing vote. The only discernible rule \n     seems to be that the Ten Commandments may be displayed \n     outside a public courthouse (Van Orden v. Perry), but not \n     inside (McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union) \n     and may be displayed with other documents, but not alone. In \n     Van Orden v. Perry, the Supreme Court permitted a display of \n     the Ten Commandments to remain on the grounds outside the \n     Texas State Capitol. However, in McCreary County v. ACLU, a \n     bare majority of Supreme Court Justices ruled that two \n     Kentucky counties violated the Establishment Clause by \n     erecting displays of the Ten Commandments indoors for the \n     purpose of advancing religion. While the multiple concurring \n     and dissenting opinions in these cases serve to explain some \n     of the confounding differences in outcomes, it would have \n     been extraordinarily fruitful for the American public to \n     watch the Justices as they grappled with these issues during \n     oral arguments that, presumably, reveal much more of their \n     deliberative processes than mere text.\n       These are important cases, but does the public understand \n     how the Court grappled with the issues? When so many \n     Americans get their news and information from television, how \n     can we keep them in the dark about how the Court works?\n       When deciding issues of such great national import, the \n     Supreme Court is rarely unanimous. In fact, a large number of \n     seminal Supreme Court decisions have been reached through a \n     vote of 5-4. Such a close margin reveals that these decisions \n     are far from foregone conclusions distilled from the meaning \n     of the Constitution, reason and the application of legal \n     precedents. On the contrary, these major Supreme Court \n     opinions embody critical decisions reached on the basis of \n     the preferences and views of each individual justice. In a \n     case that is decided by a vote of 5-4, an individual justice \n     has the power by his or her vote to change the law of the \n     land.\n\n    5-4 Split Decisions Since the Beginning of the October 2005 Term\n\n       Since the beginning of its October 2005 Term when Chief \n     Justice Roberts first began hearing cases, the Supreme Court \n     has issued twelve (12) decisions with a 5-4 split out of a \n     total of 96 decisions--the most recent of which, Osborn v. \n     Haley, was issued few days ago (January 22, 2007). The Court \n     has also issued four (4) decisions with votes of 5-3, with \n     one justice recused. Finally, it has issued a rare 5-2 \n     decision in which Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito \n     took no part. In sum, since the beginning of its October 2005 \n     Term, the Supreme Court has issued seventeen (17) decisions \n     establishing the law of the land in which only five (5) \n     justices explicitly concurred. Many these narrow majorities \n     occur in decisions involving the Court's interpretation of \n     our Constitution--a sometimes divisive endeavor on the Court. \n     I will not discuss all 17 of these narrow majority cases, but \n     will describe a few to illustrate my point about the \n     importance of the Court and its decisions in the lives of \n     Americans.\n\n  Eighth Amendment, Death Penalty & Aggravating Factors or Mitigating \n                                Evidence\n\n       The first 5-4 split decision, decided on January 11, 2006, \n     was Brown v. Sanders, which involves the death penalty. In \n     that case the Court held that in death penalty cases, an \n     invalidated sentencing factor will render the sentence \n     unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element \n     to the aggravation scale unless one of the other sentencing \n     factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to \n     the same facts and circumstances. The majority opinion was \n     authored by Justice Scalia and joined by Chief Justice \n     Roberts and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas. Justice \n     Stevens filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter \n     joined. Similarly, Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion \n     in which Justice Ginsburg joined.\n       Last November the Supreme Court decided Ayers v. Belmontes, \n     a capital murder case in which the Belmontes contended that \n     California law and the trial court's instructions precluded \n     the jury from considering his forward looking mitigation \n     evidence suggesting he could lead a constructive life while \n     incarcerated. In Ayers the Supreme Court found the Ninth \n     Circuit erred in holding that the jury was precluded by jury \n     instructions from considering mitigation evidence. Justice \n     Kennedy authored the majority opinion while Justice Stevens \n     wrote a dissent joined by three other justices.\n       Other 5-4 split decisions since October 2005 include United \n     States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, concerning whether a defendant's \n     Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when a district \n     court refused to grant his paid lawyer permission to \n     represent him based upon some past ethical violation by the \n     lawyer (June 26, 2006); LULAC v. Perry, deciding whether the \n     2004 Texas redistricting violated provisions of the Voting \n     Rights Act (June 28, 2006); Kansas v. Marsh, concerning the \n     Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in a capital murder case in \n     which the defense argued that a Kansas statute established an \n     unconstitutional presumption in favor of the death sentence \n     when aggravating and mitigating factors were in equipoise \n     (April 25, 2006); Clark v. Arizona, a capital murder case \n     involving the constitutionality of an Arizona Supreme \n     Court precedent governing the admissibility of evidence to \n     support an insanity defense (June 29, 2006); and Garcetti \n     v. Ceballos, a case holding that when public employees \n     make statements pursuant to their official duties they are \n     not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and \n     the Constitution does not insulate their communications \n     from employer discipline (May 30, 2006).\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\n     The Justices Have Split 5-3 Four (4) Times Since October 2005\n\n                  Fourth Amendment Warrant Requirement\n\n       In Georgia v. Randolph, (March 22, 2006), a 5-3 majority of \n     the Supreme Court held that a physically present co-\n     occupant's stated refusal to permit a warrantless entry and \n     search rendered the search unreasonable and invalid as to \n     that occupant. Justice Souter authored the majority opinion. \n     Justice Stevens filed a concurring opinion as did Justice \n     Breyer. The Chief Justice authored a dissent joined by \n     Justice Scalia. Moreover, Justice Scalia issued his own \n     dissent as did Justice Thomas. In Randolph, there were six \n     opinions in all from a Court that only has nine justices. One \n     can only imagine the spirited debate and interplay of ideas, \n     facial expressions and gestures that occurred in oral \n     arguments. Audio recordings are simply inadequate to capture \n     all the nuance that only cameras could capture and convey.\n\n                   Actual Innocence and Habeas Corpus\n\n       In House v. Bell, a 5-3 opinion authored by Justice Kennedy \n     (June 12, 2006), the Supreme Court held that because House \n     had made the stringent showing required by the actual \n     innocence exception to judicially-established procedural \n     default rules, he could challenge his conviction even after \n     exhausting his regular appeals. Justice Alito took no part in \n     considering or deciding the House case. It bears noting, \n     however, that if one Justice had been on the other side of \n     this decision it would have resulted in a 4-4 tie and, \n     ultimately, led to affirming the lower court's denial of \n     House's post-conviction habeas petitions due to a procedural \n     default.\n\n       Military Commissions, Geneva Conventions and Habeas Corpus\n\n       In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a 5-3 decision in which Chief \n     Justice Roberts did not participate, the Supreme Court held \n     that Hamdan could challenge his detention and the \n     jurisdiction of the President's military commissions to try \n     him despite the 2005 enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act. \n     A thin majority of the justices held that, although the DTA \n     states that ``no court . . . shall have jurisdiction to hear \n     or consider . . . an application for . . . habeas corpus \n     filed by . . . an alien detained . . . at Guantanamo Bay,'' \n     the President could not establish a military commission to \n     try Hamdan unless Congress granted him the authority through \n     legislation. This case was of great interest and great \n     importance, and was one of a handful of recent cases in which \n     the Supreme Court released audiotapes or oral arguments \n     almost immediately after they occurred. The prompt release of \n     the audiotapes was good, but it would have been far better to \n     allow the public to watch the parties' advocates and the \n     Justices grapple with the jurisdictional, constitutional and \n     merits-related questions that were addressed in that case. \n     With due respect to Justices Scalia and Ginsberg, watching \n     the advocates respond as the Justices pepper them with \n     questions is something that should be seen and heard.\n\n  14th Amendment Due Process and Notice Concerning Tax Liens on Homes\n\n       In another 5-3 case, Jones v. Flowers, (April 26, 2006), \n     the Supreme Court considered whether the government must take \n     additional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking \n     the owner's property when notice of a tax sale is mailed to \n     the owner and returned undelivered. The public can readily \n     understand this issue. In an opinion by Chief Justice \n     Roberts, the Court held that where the Arkansas Commissioner \n     of State Lands had mailed Jones a certified letter and it had \n     been returned unclaimed, the Commissioner had to take \n     additional reasonable steps to provide Jones notice. Justices \n     Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy dissented and Justice Alito took \n     no part in the decision.\n       Not only lawyers who might listen to the audio tapes and \n     read the full opinions, but all citizens could benefit from \n     knowing how the Court grapples with legal issues related to \n     their rights--in one case something as straightforward as the \n     right to own one's home as it may be affected by unclaimed \n     mail--and in another the right of someone who is in prison to \n     be heard by a court. My legislation creates the opportunity \n     for all interested Americans to watch the Court in action in \n     cases like these.\n       Regardless of one's views concerning the merits of these \n     decisions, the interplay between the government, on the one \n     hand, and the individual on the other is something many \n     Americans want to understand more fully. So, it is with these \n     watershed decisions in mind that I introduce legislation \n     designed to make the Supreme Court less remote. Millions of \n     Americans recently watched the televised confirmation \n     hearings for our two newest Justices. Americans want \n     information, knowledge, and understanding; in short, they \n     want access.\n       In a democracy, the workings of the government at all \n     levels should be open to public view. With respect to oral \n     arguments, the more openness and the broader opportunity for \n     public observation--the greater will be the public's \n     understanding and trust. As the Supreme Court observed in \n     Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (1986), ``People in an \n     open society do not demand infallibility from their \n     institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what \n     they are prohibited from observing.'' It was in this spirit \n     that the House of Representatives opened its deliberations to \n     meaningful public observation by allowing C-SPAN to begin \n     televising debates in the House chamber in 1979. The Senate \n     followed the House's lead in 1986 by voting to allow \n     television coverage of the Senate floor.\n\n   Judiciary Committee Hearings and Action on Cameras in the Federal \n                                 Courts\n\n       On November 9, 2005, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing \n     to address whether Federal court proceedings should be \n     televised generally and to consider S. 1768, my earlier \n     version of this bill, and S. 829, Senator Grassley's \n     ``Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2005.'' During the \n     November 9 hearing, most witnesses spoke favorably of \n     cameras in the courts, particularly at the appellate \n     level. Among the witnesses favorably disposed toward the \n     cameras were Peter Irons, author of May It Please the \n     Court, Seth Berlin, a First Amendment expert at a local \n     firm, Brian Lamb, founder of C-SPAN, Henry Schleif of \n     Court TV Networks, and Barbara Cochran of the Radio-\n     Television News Directors Association and Foundation.\n       A different view was expressed by Judge Jan DuBois of the \n     Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who testified on behalf of \n     the Judicial Conference. Judge DuBois warned of concerns, \n     particularly at the trial level, where witnesses may appear \n     uncomfortable because of cameras, and thus might seem less \n     credible to jurors. I note, however, that these would not be \n     issues in appellate courts, where there are no witnesses or \n     jurors.\n       The Judiciary Committee considered and passed both bills on \n     March 30, 2006. The Committee vote to report S. 1768 was 12-\n     6, and the bill was placed on the Senate Legislative \n     Calendar. Unfortunately, due to the press of other business \n     neither bill was allotted time on the Senate Floor.\n\n       Congressional Authority to Legislate Cameras in the Court\n\n       In my judgment, Congress, with the concurrence of the \n     President, or overriding his veto, has the authority to \n     require the Supreme Court to televise its proceedings. Such a \n     conclusion is not free from doubt and may be tested in the \n     Supreme Court, which will have the final word. As I see it, \n     there is no constitutional prohibition against this \n     legislation.\n       Article 3 of the Constitution states that the judicial \n     power of the United States shall be vested ``in one Supreme \n     Court and such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time \n     to time ordain and establish.'' While the Constitution \n     specifically creates the Supreme Court, it left it to \n     Congress to determine how the Court would operate. For \n     example, it was Congress that fixed the number of justices on \n     the Supreme Court at nine. Likewise, it was Congress that \n     decided that any six of these justices are sufficient to \n     constitute a quorum of the Court. It was Congress that \n     decided that the term of the Court shall commence on the \n     first Monday in October of each year, and it was Congress \n     that determined the procedures to be followed whenever the \n     Chief Justice is unable to perform the duties of his office. \n     Congress also controls more substantive aspects of the \n     Supreme Court. Most importantly, it is Congress that in \n     effect determines the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme \n     Court. Although the Constitution itself sets out the \n     appellate jurisdiction of the Court, it provides that such \n     jurisdiction exists ``with such exceptions and under such \n     regulations as the Congress shall make.''\n       The Supreme Court could permit television through its own \n     rule but has decided not to do so. Congress should be \n     circumspect and even hesitant to impose a rule mandating \n     television coverage of oral arguments and should do so only \n     in the face of compelling public policy reasons. The Supreme \n     Court has such a dominant role in key decision-making \n     functions that its proceedings ought to be better known to \n     the public; and, in the absence of a Court rule, public \n     policy would be best served by enacting legislation requiring \n     the televising of Supreme Court proceedings.\n       My legislation embodies sound policy and will prove \n     valuable to the public. I urge my colleagues to support this \n     bill. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \n     bill be printed in the Record and I yield the Floor.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, by previous order, I am to be recognized; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, for 45 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1262-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1262-S1263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VA HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on Saturday of this past weekend, I was in \nMinneapolis, MN, for some meetings. In the Minneapolis Star Tribune \nnewspaper, there was on the front page a story that I read with \nsubstantial disappointment and concern. I will relate it to my \ncolleagues.\n  Kevin Giles for the Minneapolis Star Tribune wrote a story:\n\n       This Marine's death came after he served in Iraq.\n\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n\n  The subhead is:\n\n       When Jonathan Schulze came home from Iraq, he tried to live \n     a normal life, but the war kept that from happening.\n\n  The story is a lengthy one about a man who served in Iraq, was a \nmarine, very proud of being a marine, a combat marine. His name was \nJonathan Schulze. In Iraq, he carried a heavy machine gun as part of \nhis combat experience. He apparently indicated he had watched about 16 \nof his unit members and close friends die in some very aggressive \nfighting in Iraq, described the battles. He was twice wounded, earned \ntwo Purple Hearts, came back to this country, was discharged, and had \nvery serious post-traumatic stress disorder, severe psychological \nproblems. He couldn't sleep, reliving the combat during his sleep and \nthen having flashbacks when awake.\n  On December 14, he went to the VA center in Minneapolis, met with a \npsychiatrist, according to this news account, and was told that he \ncould be admitted for some treatment in March. This was December. On \nJanuary 12, a couple of weeks ago, he went to the VA hospital in St. \nCloud, according to this account. He told the people at the VA hospital \nin St. Cloud that he was thinking of committing suicide, thinking of \nkilling himself. His parents were with him at that point. They verify \nthat is what he told the VA hospital in St. Cloud. He was thinking of \ncommitting suicide, and he wanted to be admitted as a patient. They \ntold him they could not admit him as a patient.\n  The next day, he called the VA, called them back, and they told him \nthat he was No. 26 on the waiting list. Four days later, he hung \nhimself. This young man who served his country honorably as a U.S. \nmarine reached out for help. According to his parents, who were there \nat the time, he went to a VA hospital and said: I need help, I want to \nbe admitted, I am having thoughts of suicide, and he was refused. The \nnext day, he was told he is 26th on the list.\n  I don't know all of the facts about this. I only know the facts I \nhave read in a newspaper. But the story is nearly unbelievable to me. \nThe newspaper description of the flag-draped coffin of this young \nmarine who earned two Purple Hearts fighting for his country in Iraq \ncontains a sad, sad story of a young marine who should have gotten \nmedical help for serious psychological problems that were the result of \nhis wartime experience.\n  I am going to ask the inspector general to investigate what happened \nin this case. What happened that a young man who was a marine veteran \nwith two Purple Hearts turns up at a VA center and says: I am thinking \nof committing suicide, can you help me, can you admit me, and he is \ntold: No, the list is 26 long in front of you? Something dreadfully \nwrong happened. The result is a young man is dead. What happened here? \nDoes it happen other places?\n  We know the heavy toll war imposes on these young men and women who \nwear America's uniform and who answer this country's call. My \ncolleagues and I have all been to Bethesda and Walter Reed, and have \nvisited the veterans who have lost arms and legs, who have had head \ninjuries, especially, because the body armor these days means that the \ninjuries more often sustained are the loss of an arm or a leg or a \nbrain injury due to the improvised explosive devices. We know about the \nVA health care system. The VA health care system has been excellent in \nsome respects. It has gotten good reviews. But what has happened here? \nAre there others who show up at a VA center and say: I need help, only \nto be told no help is available? I hope that is not the case.\n  But I am going to ask the Inspector General to investigate this case \nand find out what happened. Is it happening other places? And what can \nwe do to prevent this from happening again? It is the unbelievable cost \nof war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1263-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1263-S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ISSUES OF PRIORITY\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. This week or next week we will discuss once again the war \nin Iraq--a war that has now lasted longer than World War II. President \nBush has indicated to the Congress and to the American people he has a \nnew strategy. The new strategy he is proposing is to move an additional \n20,000 American troops into Iraq. This morning, the more recent polls \nsuggest the President's approval is at 30 percent. Polls also suggest \nthe American people do not support deepening our country's involvement \nin Iraq. It is quite clear that the Congress does not support it \neither.\n  The decision by the President comes on the heels of the Baker-\nHamilton commission that had some of the best minds in this country--\nRepublicans and Democrats, old hands and younger people--who took a \nlook at this, who understand foreign policy, understand military \npolicy, and evaluated what are the potential choices, and decided that \nthe deepening of our country's involvement in Iraq would be the wrong \nchoice.\n  The blue ribbon commission told the President it would be the wrong \nchoice to deepen our involvement in Iraq. Yet, the President decided \nthat is exactly what he is going to do.\n  It is important, I think, as we discuss it this week and next week, \nto understand this Congress will always support the men and women whom \nwe have asked to go to battle for our country. I would not support any \neffort by anyone to withdraw funds for our troops. If our troops are \nthere, they must have everything they need to complete their mission \nand finish their jobs. But the fact is, in all of these discussions, I \nregret to say the President and Vice President do not have all that \nmuch credibility. Four years ago they presented to this Congress--much \nof it in top-secret briefings in this Capitol--intelligence that \nsupposedly buttressed the Administration's request that Congress pass a \nresolution that would give them the authority to use force against \nIraq. It turns out now that much of that intelligence was wrong. Much \nof it was just fundamentally wrong. Now we know that those who offered \nthe intelligence assessment to Congress knew there were serious doubts \nabout it even as they were offering it to Congress as fact. They are \nsome of the highest officials in our Government. I wish I did not have \nto say that, but it is the truth.\n  It was not good intelligence. For example, take the mobile chemical \nweapons labs that we were told existed for sure. We now understand that \nwas the product of a single source of intelligence, a person named \n``Curveball,'' a person who was likely a drunk and a fabricator. On the \nbasis of a single source, whom the Germans, who turned Curveball's \ninformation over to our country, thought not to be reliable or likely \nnot to be reliable, we were told by this administration in briefings \nthat this was a case that would justify going to war.\n  The aluminum tubes. We now understand the aluminum tubes were not for \nthe purpose of reconstituting a nuclear threat. We also understand \nthere are those in the line of--well, I was going to say the chain of \ncommand--those at high positions in our Government today who knew there \nwas substantial evidence and disagreement from other parts of our \nGovernment who did not believe the aluminum tubes were for the purpose \nof reconstituting a nuclear effort or nuclear capability in Iraq. Yet, \nthat information was withheld from the Congress, probably and \napparently deliberately withheld from the Congress.\n  Yellowcake from Niger: Again, another case of almost exactly the same \nthing.\n  It is the case that the Congress was misled by bad intelligence, and \nthe American people were misled by that same intelligence. That is not \nme saying that. It is Colonel Wilkerson, who worked 17 years as a top \nassistant to Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, who made the case at \nthe United Nations. Colonel Wilkerson, who was involved in all that \nactivity, spoke out publicly, and he said it was the ``perpetration of \na hoax on the American people.'' That is not me. Those are the words of \na top official who was involved, who was there. Yet, no one has had to \nanswer for it, no one.\n  Hearings. No oversight hearings by the majority party in the last \nCongress. No one has answered for it.\n  Now we have a new Iraqi policy, new warnings about more danger in \nIraq. But it comes at a time when there is precious little credibility. \nWe now find ourselves in Iraq, longer than we were in the Second World \nWar, in the middle of a civil war. Most of the violence in\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nIraq is sectarian violence: Sunnis and Shias killing each other; \nAmerican soldiers placed in the middle of a civil war.\n  The fact is, the leader of Iraq is now gone, dead. He was executed. \nSaddam Hussein does not exist. The Iraqi people were able to elect \ntheir own Government. They were able to vote for their own \nconstitution. That is done. That is progress. But now Iraq is in the \nmiddle of a civil war. And to deepen America's involvement in the \nmiddle of a civil war in Iraq makes little sense to me.\n  What does make sense to me is to say to the Iraqis: This is your \nGovernment, not ours. This belongs to you, not us. And you have a \nresponsibility now to provide for your own security.\n  Here is what General Abizaid, the head of Central Command, said 2 \nmonths ago. He said:\n\n       I met every divisional commander, General Casey, the corps \n     commander, General Dempsey, we all talked together. And I \n     said, ``in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq?'' And they all said no.\n\n  ``I met with every divisional commander.'' ``They said no.''\n  Now, General Abizaid, also in testimony 2 months ago, said:\n\n       And the reason [his commanders said no to additional \n     troops] is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It is easy \n     for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I believe \n     that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, \n     from taking more responsibility for their own future.\n\n  In other words, the Iraqi attitude is: if American troops can do the \njob, that is fine. Let the American troops do the job. Our \nresponsibility, it seems to me, is to say to the Iraqi people: This is \nyour country, not ours. Security is your responsibility. And if you \ncannot provide for security, the American soldiers cannot do that for \nany great length of time. You have to decide whether you want to take \nyour country back.\n  Now, as the President says, his change in strategy is to move more \nAmerican troops to Iraq. I want to describe what John Negroponte, the \nhead of our intelligence service, said in open testimony to the \nCongress 2 weeks ago:\n\n       Al-Qaeda is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the homeland.\n\n  That is testimony from the top intelligence chief in our country: Al-\nQaida is the greatest terrorist threat to U.S. interests, including to \nthe homeland. Then let me show you what he says beyond that. He says: \nal-Qaida ``continues to plot attacks against our homeland and other \ntargets with the objective of inflicting mass casualties. And they \ncontinue to maintain active connections and relationships that radiate \noutward from their leaders' secure hideout in Pakistan. . . .''\n  Understand this is who attacked America: al-Qaida. They described it. \nThey boasted about it. They murdered thousands of Americans. They \nattacked America on 9/11. Their leadership is now, according to our top \nintelligence chief, in testimony before this Congress 2 weeks ago, in a \n``secure hideout in Pakistan.''\n  It seems to me if there are 20,000 additional soldiers available, job \none for this country is to eliminate the greatest terrorist threat--the \ngreatest terrorist threat--described by the intelligence chief the week \nbefore last as al-Qaida. It ``poses the greatest threat to U.S. \ninterests, including to the homeland.'' He also says they are in secure \nhideaways in Pakistan.\n  I do not understand for a moment why the greatest priority for us is \nnot to eliminate the most significant terrorist threat to our country \nand to eliminate the leadership of the organization that boasts about \nmurdering Americans on 9/11. If that were part of the new strategy, I \nwould be here saying: I am for it. But it is not.\n  There is not, regrettably, an easy answer or a good answer with \nrespect to Iraq. The President described, last fall, prior to the \nelection, false choices. He said the choice is between stay the course \nand cut and run. That was always a false choice.\n  We have to find a way to resolve this and be able to bring American \ntroops home. It is just that simple. We have to say to the Iraqi \npeople: This country belongs to you, and you have responsibilities. \nMeet those responsibilities.\n  We have responsibilities here at home--plenty of them--and we need to \nturn inward to meet those responsibilities. That does not mean we \nshould pay no attention to what is going on around the world. But we \nalso need to begin taking care of things here at home.\n  I was at a meeting in Minneapolis, a listening session with American \ntribes this weekend. Let me tell you what one fellow stood up and said. \nHe was a tribal chair, a chairman of the tribe. He said: My two \ndaughters are living in rehabilitated trailers that were brought to our \nreservation from Michigan. They heat those trailers with wooden stoves. \nThe trailers have no plumbing. There is no running water and no indoor \ntoilets. This is in South Dakota. Sound like something in a Third World \ncountry? He said: One of my daughters has eight children. The other has \nthree. They live in donated trailers that came from Michigan, with no \nwater and no toilet. And they heat it with a wood stove. Sound like the \nUnited States? No, it doesn't to me. It sounds like a Third World \ncountry. We have lots of people in this country living on Indian \nreservations in Third World conditions. We are told there is not enough \nmoney to respond to their housing, education, and health care needs. \nThat is wrong.\n  We are going to have presented to us in a couple weeks another \nproposal for as much as $120 billion in emergency spending to deal with \nIraq and Afghanistan. That will bring to roughly $600 billion what we \nhave provided for the war. But when we have needs here at home, it does \nnot matter whether it is health care needs or housing or perhaps energy \nneeds, the Administration tells us we cannot afford to spend for that.\n  Well, we have afforded now what is going to be about $600 billion \nthat the President has requested, all on an emergency basis, most of it \nfor the war in Iraq. So we will debate and have great controversy, I \nassume, in the next couple weeks on the issue of a resolution dealing \nwith Iraq. But controversy is not a stranger to the floor of the \nSenate.\n\n\n                         Minimum Wage Increase\n\n  Mr. President, we have a provision on the floor of the Senate today \nthat should have been completed long ago dealing with the minimum wage. \nI mentioned the other day when I was talking about issues that come to \nthe floor of the Senate that butter the bread of big interests, man, \nthey float through here like greased lightning. We do not get it \nthrough fast enough, at least in the last Congress. Do you want to give \na big tax break to the biggest interests in the country? Be my guest. \nWe get it through here in 1, 2, 3 days.\n  Do you want to help the people at the bottom of the economic ladder, \nthe people who make the beds in hotel rooms for the minimum wage, the \npeople across the country in convenience stores getting the minimum \nwage--often working two, three jobs a day, 60 percent of whom are \nwomen, one-third of whom are working at the minimum wage for the only \nincome for their family--well, then, you have some trouble because then \nit is going to get stalled. That does not get through here quickly \nbecause that hallway is not clogged with people representing the folks \nwho are making the minimum wage and working two jobs a day.\n  It is just a fact, and it is a shame. We need to take care of some \nthings here at home, and we need to do so soon. This minimum wage bill \nis not rocket science, nor should it be heavy lifting for any of us \nhere. It has been 10 years since those who worked at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder have had any adjustment in the minimum wage--10 years.\n  I mentioned the other day, what about a ``maximum wage''? I am not \nproposing one. But I can tell you that the head of one of the largest \noil companies in our country, when he left his company, was making \n$150,000 a day in total income. Can you imagine that, $150,000 a day?\n  Then when he left, the papers reported, in addition to having made \n$150,000 a day, he got a $400 million parachute on the way out. Anybody \nstanding around here squawking about that? No, no complaints about \nthat. It is the little guy, the person at the bottom. After 10 years, \nthere is great complaint about trying to move a bill through the Senate \nthat would give them some help, lift that minimum wage a bit. We are \ntold: You can't do that without giving corporations a\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nbreak. I guess I don't understand the priorities. Some of the \nsuggestions that have been described, expensing for small business, I \nsupport that, but it has nothing to do with this bill. We will almost \ncertainly do it in other circumstances. We have done it before. But why \nshould we hold hostage a bill that deals with a whole lot of folks who \nwork hard all day long and for very little money, not $150,000 a day \nbut maybe $44 a day, because of those who have an appetite for \nadditional tax breaks? I don't understand that.\n\n\n                            Sweatshop Abuses\n\n  My point is, there is so much to do. I wish to talk for a moment \nabout a couple of other items that relate to this. I introduced a bill \nlast week with some of my colleagues to try to stop sweatshop abuses \noverseas, products made overseas in sweatshop conditions and sent into \nthis country to compete unfairly against American workers.\n  The fact is, American workers are losing their jobs because there is \nso much outsourcing to foreign countries. American jobs are being \nshipped to foreign countries. The very people in this Chamber who are \nreluctant to increase the minimum wage and are holding us up are the \nsame people who have voted when I have offered four times a simple \namendment that says: Let's stop giving large tax breaks to U.S. \ncompanies that ship American jobs overseas.\n  Can you think of anything more pernicious than deciding, let's figure \nout what we have to do in America; let's give a big, fat tax break to a \ncompany that would fire their workers, lock their manufacturing plant, \nshut the lights off and move the jobs overseas? They move the jobs \noverseas, manufacture a product in Sri Lanka or Bangladesh and ship it \nback here and they get a big, fat tax break out of this Congress. That \nis unbelievable to me. We can't get that repealed. And we can't, on the \nother edge of the sword, get the minimum wage increased. Boy, that \nslices the wrong direction. There is something fundamentally wrong with \nthat system.\n  I introduced legislation called the Decent Working Conditions and \nFair Competition Act that sets up a circumstance so that at least if \ncompanies are going overseas to find sweatshop conditions, hire a bunch \nof people who will work for 20 or 30 cents an hour and then produce a \nproduct and ship it back here, at least we could try to stop them. \nThere is a lot of dispute about trade and the conditions of employment. \nI think we could all agree that American workers should not have to \ncompete against the product of prison labor in China. I think we could \nall agree that if somebody is making socks in a Chinese prison, that is \nnot fair competition for an American worker. So we don't have Chinese \nprison labor products come into this country. What about the product of \nsweatshop labor, where people are brought into sweatshops?\n  I will cite an example: A sweatshop in northern Jordan, airplanes \nflying in the Chinese and Bangladeshis, with Chinese textiles, being \nput in sweatshops in northern Jordan to produce products to ship into \nthis country. Some were working 40-hour shifts, not a 40-hour week, 40 \nhours at a time. Some weren't paid for months. And then when they were \npaid, they were paid a pittance. Some were beaten.\n  Do we want that kind of product coming into this country? Is that \nwhom we want American workers to compete with? I don't think so. This \nlegislation is a first baby step toward some sanity in trying to make \nsure that what we are purchasing on the store shelves in our country is \nnot the product of sweatshop labor overseas. We define what sweatshop \nlabor is, what sweatshop conditions are. We establish a provision by \nthe Federal Trade Commission to enforce, and we also allow American \ncompanies who are forced to compete against this unfairness to take \naction in American courts to seek recompense for the damages.\n  My hope is Congress will pass this. It is bipartisan. It relates to \nexactly the same thing we are talking about for people in this country \nwho work on the minimum wage.\n  Last week, I also introduced a piece of legislation that deals with \nthis building. This is a picture of a little white building on Church \nStreet in the Cayman Islands. It is called the Ugland House. It is five \nstories. According to some enterprising investigative reporting done by \nDavid Evans of Bloomberg, this building is actually home to 12,748 \ncorporations. It doesn't look like it could house 12,748 corporations. \nIt is a five-story stucco building in the Cayman Islands, and it is \nwhat lawyers have allowed to become legal fiction so that companies \ncould create a legal address in this little white building. It is their \ntax haven Cayman Island address so they can avoid paying taxes. Isn't \nthat something? Twelve thousand seven hundred forty-eight companies \ncall this place home. We ought to stop it.\n  I have introduced legislation to stop it, to say this: When U.S. \ncompanies want to set up a subsidiary in a tax-haven country, if they \nare not doing substantial business activity in that country, then they \nhave created a legal fiction, and it will not be considered legal for \nus.\n  They will be taxed as if they never left our country. We can shut \nthis down like that. If this Congress has the will, we can shut down \nthese tax havens in a moment. And we should. Everybody else is paying \ntaxes. It will be April 15th in a couple months. The American people \nwork. They pay taxes and support the Government for the cost of roads \nand bridges and health care, all the things we do together, the \nNational Institutes of Health, and our national defense. So they pay \ntaxes. It is just that there are some in this country who decide they \ndon't want to participate. They don't want to pay taxes.\n\n  Here is a report from the Government Accountability Office. It was \ndone at my request and, I believe, that of Senator Levin as well. The \nreport showed the number of large Federal contractors who do business \nwith the Federal Government--that is, they want to benefit from having \ncontracts with the Federal Government--who set up offshore subsidiaries \nin tax-haven countries to avoid paying U.S. taxes. The very companies \nthat benefit from doing business with the Federal Government in getting \ncontracts are setting up offshore tax haven companies to avoid paying \nU.S. taxes. That is unbelievable. It ought to stop.\n  I have introduced legislation--I should call it the Ugland House Act, \nnow that I think about it--that shuts down that opportunity. This bill \ncan shut down in a moment the opportunity for companies to decide they \nwant all the benefits America has to offer them, but they don't want \nthe responsibility of paying taxes. My hope is that this bill, which is \ncosponsored by Senators Levin and Feingold, will be dealt with by the \nSenate Finance Committee and the full Senate in the days and weeks \nahead.\n\n\n                          Fast Track Authority\n\n  One final point, if I might. We are told this week that the President \nBush will be asking the Congress for something called fast-track \nauthority. Although the Constitution provides Congress the right to \nregulate foreign commerce--it is a constitutional responsibility of the \nCongress--the Congress has, in the past, given the President something \ncalled fast track, which says: Mr. President, you go out and negotiate \ntrade agreements in secret and then you bring them back and we will \nhave an expedited procedure. And we will require that no Senator be \nallowed to offer any amendments, no matter what you have negotiated.\n  I don't support fast-track authorization. I didn't support it for \nPresident Clinton. I don't support it for this President. This \nPresident has had it for 6 years over my objection. He is attempting to \nnow get an extension of it by the end of June 30. I intend--and I am \nsure a number of my colleagues with whom I have spoken intend--to \naggressively resist it. I am for trade and plenty of it. But I am for \nfair trade. I demand fair trade. This notion of a trade policy that has \nan $800 billion trade deficit is an unbelievable failure. No one can \ndescribe it as a success for this country.\n  It is time to have a fair debate about trade, what strengthens \nAmerica and what weakens it, what are the conditions under which we \nparticipate in the global economy? We have a right to participate the \nway we choose. We have been told in recent years that the way to \nparticipate in the global economy is to engage in a race to the bottom. \nIf American workers can't compete with somebody making 36 cents an \nhour, that is tough luck.\n  I have often told stories about the companies and the stories of \nstruggle\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\nof the last 100 years. But James Fyler died of lead poisoning. He was \nshot 54 times. I suppose that is lead poisoning. Why was he shot 54 \ntimes? Because it was 1914, and James Fyler was radical enough to \nbelieve that people who went underground to dig coal should be paid a \nfair wage and ought to be able to work in a safe workplace. For that, \nhe was shot 54 times. Over a century, going back to the early 1900s, we \nhave created the standards of work. We lifted America. We expanded the \nmiddle class. We said: We will put in place fair labor standards, child \nlabor provisions, safe workplace rules. We are going to lift America \nup. We are going to expand the opportunity for health care. We will \nhave good jobs that pay well. We will give people the right to \norganize. We did all of that. We created the broadest middle class in \nthe world and an economic engine that is unparalleled.\n  Now we are told it is a new day. We should compete. If there is a \nwoman named ``Saditia'' in Indonesia making shoes and she makes 21 \ncents an hour and we can't compete with that, that is tough luck. If we \nhave people in China making 33 cents an hour producing Huffy bicycles \nthat used to be produced here and we can't compete with that, tough \nluck. If the Radio Flyer little red wagon that used to be produced in \nChicago went to China, it was because we can't compete with Chinese \nworkers. If Pennsylvania House furniture left Pennsylvania and they now \nship the wood to China and then ship the furniture back, those workers \nin Pennsylvania should not complain because they couldn't compete with \nChinese workers. It doesn't matter to me whether it is Chinese workers \nor Sri Lanka or Bangladeshi. The fact is, we are seeing a diminished \nstandard in which we are racing to the bottom.\n  I read in the paper this weekend an op-ed piece. Somebody was asking: \nWhat is everybody complaining about? Things are great.\n  Wages and salaries are the way most people get their income. They are \nthe lowest percentage of gross domestic product since they started \nkeeping score in 1947. We added 5 million people to the poverty rolls \nin the last 6 years. Everything is great. Probably for some. Maybe the \nguy who is making $100,000 a day running an oil company but not for the \nperson working three jobs at a minimum wage who hasn't been boosted for \n10 years, not to Natasha Humphrey. She did everything. She went to \nStanford, an African-American woman, got her degree, went to work for a \ntechnology company. Her last job was to train her replacement, an \nengineer from India who would work for one-fifth the cost of an \nengineer in the United States. So things aren't so great for everybody. \nWhen you have a $700 billion-a-year trade deficit, over $250 billion a \nyear with China alone, I say you better pay attention. You better get \nit straight.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  There is a lot to say and a lot to do. I was going to talk about \nenergy policy briefly, but I will only say that one of the major \nchallenges in our country is the challenge of energy. We are so \nunbelievably dependent on foreign sources of oil. The bulk of our oil \ncomes from outside of our country, well over 60 percent. We are \ndependent on the Saudis and the Kuwaitis, the Iraqis, the Venezuelans, \nand others for oil. It is unhealthy.\n  We need to make a major commitment to renewable energy. What we have \ndone in energy is pretty much what we have done in too many areas. We \nput in place, in 1916, permanent robust tax incentives to incentivize \nthe production of oil It has been in place for 90 years. In 1992, we \nsaid: You know what, let's boost the production of renewable energy, so \nwe put in place a production tax credit--temporary and rather narrow. \nIt has been extended short term five times and allowed to expire three \ntimes. There has been virtually no consistent commitment to renewable \nenergy. It has been on again/off again, like a switch. That is not a \ncommitment.\n\n  If you are going to commit as a country to move in a direction on \nenergy, whether it is renewable, biofuels, or hydrogen fuel cells, you \nshould make a commitment and say: Here is where the country is headed, \nwhere we intend to be in 10 years, and we are going to give a tax \nincentive for 10 years for the production of these renewable fuels. You \nshould have targets and timetables. That hasn't been the case. It has \nbeen a rather limited, tepid, miniature kind of provision that is \nturned off again and on again, a stutter-stop approach that tells \ninvestors: Don't rely on this because this Government isn't committed \nto it. We need to do better. I hope this year we can decide, as the \nPresident asked for in his State of the Union Address, on a much more \nrobust commitment to renewable energy.\n  Having said that, let me point out, under this President and previous \nPresidents, the amount of money we have committed to the renewable \nenergy area. We have laboratories, renewable energy laboratories, whose \nfunding dropped consistently. Again, it is one thing to say something \nand have a goal; it is another thing to decide you are going to take \nsteps to meet the goal. We have not done that.\n  So, Mr. President, I have said a lot about a lot of things because we \nare facing a lot of things that, in many ways, are related, including \nthe war in Iraq, the international challenges. All of us want the same \nthing for our country. We all want this country to succeed and do well. \nI don't think there is a difference in goals. We will have sharp debate \nin the next 2 weeks, but I don't believe there is a difference in the \ngoals we have. I suspect everybody in this Chamber wants very much for \nthe Iraq war to be over, for our troops to be home, and for stability \nto exist in Iraq and in that region. I expect we share the goal on \nenergy. Does anybody think that we as a country aspire to be 60, 65 \npercent dependent upon oil from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and \nelsewhere? I don't think so. It seems to me that it would make some \nsense for us to find a way to get the best of what both sides have to \noffer in these discussions rather than the worst of each. I hope in the \ncoming days we can at least clear away the bill on the floor so we can \nmove to other issues.\n  Last week, Senator Kennedy gave a pretty animated presentation about \nhis frustration with the day after day after day digging in the heels \nof this Chamber to stop or delay the passage of a minimum wage. Again, \nI just walked through the halls coming over here. They are not filled \nwith people representing the workers at the bottom. We should represent \nthose workers. We have that responsibility. We have the responsibility \nto do the right thing, and after 10 long years, it is the right thing \nto pass this minimum wage bill and not hold it hostage for other issues \nand other agendas. We will have plenty of opportunity with amendments \nthat have nothing to do with this bill; we will have the opportunity to \noffer them. But not now. Don't hold a bill hostage that would help \nthose working two and three jobs a day trying to take care of their \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Arizona \nwanted to address the Senate. We also have, as I understand it, a \nrequest from the Senator from Alabama to speak from 4 to 5. So I would \nlike to, if I could, speak and I will yield before 4 and request that \nthe Senator from Alabama be delayed by a little. I think we were \nscheduled to come back to the minimum wage now. I don't mind starting 5 \nminutes after that. I would be glad to go 5 minutes early and make a \nrequest that we delay Senator Sessions' 5 minutes, and then the Senator \nfrom Arizona would have 10 minutes. I see my other friend here. It is \ngoing to get complicated after this. Senator Sessions, I think, is to \nbe recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator, I would like \nto get in, and I will ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes. I don't know where Senator Sessions is. I \ngather it would be fine if he is delayed for 5 minutes. I don't know \nwhat Senator Cornyn's intentions are.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfollowing Senator Kennedy and Senator Kyl for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I personally don't have any objection. As \nI understood it, as part of the general agreement on the minimum wage, \nSenator Sessions would be recognized at 4.\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\nI don't have any personal objection, and I will not object, and I will \nlet those two Senators handle Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I intend to talk now.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry. I thought I would be recognized now. Excuse me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I intend to talk for about 15 to 18 minutes, and then we \nwill be on the minimum wage bill. I plan to speak on that minimum wage \nbill. I said I would end 5 minutes early to try to accommodate the \nSenator. We are scheduled to deal with the bill at 3:30. So I have \nrecognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1267-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been a week now that the Senate \nhas had on its agenda and before the Senate legislation to increase the \nminimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. In that week, every Member of \nCongress has effectively earned $3,200, but we have not acted on an \nincrease in the minimum wage for hard-working American people who are \nearning $5.15, to raise their minimum wage to $7.25. We have had 1 week \nof talking here on the floor of the Senate without action.\n  It looks to me as if we are going to have, thankfully, as a result of \nthe action of the majority leader, a vote at least on cloture to try to \nterminate the debate. But there will be additional procedural issues \nthat will mean that those who are opposed to an increase in the minimum \nwage will be able to delay the increase in the minimum wage for another \nweek.\n  As the parliamentary situation is playing its way out, there will be \nthe possibility of 60 hours after the vote on cloture, which will take \nus effectively through the end of this week. So that will be 2 weeks \nwhere the Members of the Senate have then earned $6,400, but we have \nbeen unwilling to either vote up or down on the increase of the minimum \nwage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour.\n  For the millions of people at the lower end of the economic ladder--\nmen and women of dignity who work hard, those who are assistants to our \nteachers and work in the schools of this country, those who work in \nsome of the nursing homes and look after the elderly, many of those of \nthe great generation that fought in World War II and brought the \ncountry out of the time of the Depression--they are still earning $5.15 \nan hour. They work in many of the hotels and motels that dot the \ncountryside and the great buildings of American commerce--these people \nare working at $5.15. They will work for that tomorrow, and they worked \nfor that the day before. And now, because our Republican friends refuse \nto permit us a vote, they are going to continue to work at $5.15 an \nhour. It has been 10 years.\n  I went back and looked at the number of days we have tried to get an \nincrease in the minimum wage since our last increase, and that was 16 \ndays. So we have effectively been debating an\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\nincrease in the minimum wage for 23 days since the last increase in the \nminimum wage, and there has been opposition from our Republican \nfriends.\n  It is true that we have disposed of some 21 amendments, but there are \nalmost 100 left from that side. We don't have any. We will have some if \nthey insist on some amendments. But our side is prepared to vote now. I \ndaresay the majority leader would come out here, if the minority leader \nwould agree, and set a time--I bet even for this afternoon, in an hour, \n2 hours, perhaps even less. Perhaps some colleagues have been notified \nthat we would not have votes today, so in fairness to them we could \nstart the vote at the start of business tomorrow morning. There would \nnot be any objection here. There are no amendments on our side. Still, \nthere are 90 amendments on the other side, and they are exercising \nparliamentary procedures in order to get to delay the consideration of \nthe minimum wage, including $200 billion in changes in Social \nSecurity--that was an amendment offered from that side--$35 billion in \ntax reductions and areas of education, some of which I support, but \ncertainly with no offsets. They were never considered. They didn't \ninclude offsets, for example, with IDEA, the legislation that looks \nafter the disabled children, or didn't increase the Pell grants. We \ndidn't even have a chance to look at it. But no, no, let's do that, use \nthis vehicle for that measure. Let's get those Members on your side and \nthe Democratic side lined up to vote against providing additional \nassistance on education. Maybe we can use that in the next campaign.\n  What about health savings accounts--that wonderful idea that benefits \nthe medium income; the people it benefits are those making $133,000 a \nyear. That is the medium income of the people who benefit from the \nhealth savings accounts. We are talking about raising the minimum wage \nto $7.25. They are talking about giving additional tax benefits to \nindividuals in the health savings accounts of hundreds of thousands of \ndollars.\n  The list goes on, Mr. President. These are matters which have \nabsolutely nothing to do with the minimum wage. It is a delay, and it \nis to politicize these issues. We all know what is going on. The \nRepublican leadership is opposed to the increase in the minimum wage. \nWhen they had the majority of the Senate, they constantly opposed any \neffort. Even though a majority of the Members of this body and the \nHouse of Representatives favored an increase, they refused to permit us \nto get a vote on it, and the President indicated he would veto it if we \nhad.\n  So that is where we are as we start off this week on the issue of the \nminimum wage. We find out our side--the Democratic side--follows the \nleadership that took place in the House of Representatives with Nancy \nPelosi. They had 4 hours of debate, and 80 members of the Republican \nParty voted for an increase in the minimum wage. But here it is a \ndifferent story. For the millions of Americans who say: My goodness, \nhere is the House of Representatives; look, in 4 hours, it looks as if \nhope is on the way--and they didn't understand the strength of the \nRepublican opposition to an increase in the minimum wage. I have seen \nit at other times. We have seen it at other times.\n  It is always baffling to me, what the Republicans have against hard-\nworking Americans. What do they have against minimum wage workers? We \ndon't hear about it. They don't debate it. They will debate other \nmatters, but what do they have against them? What possibly do they have \nagainst these hard-working Americans? They are trying to provide for \nfamilies, play by the rules, and work 40 hours a week, and in so many \ninstances they are trying to bring up children. What is so outrageous?\n  Some say that if we raise the minimum wage, we are going to have the \nproblem of increasing unemployment. We have heard that argument out \nhere on the floor. Let me, first of all, show what has happened \nhistorically with the minimum wage.\n  Until recent times, we have had Republicans and Democrats who \nsupported an increase in the minimum wage, starting with Franklin D. \nRoosevelt, Harry Truman, then Dwight Eisenhower. They raised it $1 in \n1955. Then President Kennedy increased it, Lyndon Johnson, Richard \nNixon supported an increase, Jimmy Carter, George Bush I, and William \nClinton. That was the last increase. We voted on it in 1996, and it \nbecame effective in the fall of 1997. There were two different phases \nto it.\n  First, people say: When you raise the minimum wage, look what is \ngoing to happen in terms of unemployment. Unemployment will rise.\n  If we look at what has happened with unemployment at the time we \npassed the last increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour in 1997, \nwe can see there have been small increases, but the whole trend has \nbeen down. So much for the argument of unemployment.\n  They say: That chart really doesn't show it because it doesn't \nreflect what is happening in the economy in terms of job growth. Look \nat what happened when we raised the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to \n$4.75 an hour, and then we raised it again to $5.15 an hour. Look at \nthat red line showing steady and constant job growth after an increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  Look at what percent the minimum wage is. Increasing the minimum wage \nto $7.25 is vital to workers, but it is a drop in the bucket to the \nnational payroll. All Americans combined earn $5.4 trillion a year. A \nminimum wage increase to $7.25 is less than one-fifth of 1 percent of \nthis national payroll. It is less than one-fifth of 1 percent of this \nnational payroll. And we have heard from those who oppose the minimum \nwage about all of these economic calamities. These are the facts in \nterms of the national payroll. It isn't even a drop in the bucket. It \nisn't even a piece of sand on the beach it is so little. Yet they say \nthe economic indicators say this.\n  Look what has happened to States that have a higher minimum wage than \nthe national minimum wage, and see what has happened in terms of job \ngrowth. This chart shows 11 States plus the District of Columbia with \nwages higher than $5.15 an hour. Overall employment growth has been 9.7 \npercent; 39 States with a minimum wage at $5.15, 7.5 percent. Those \nStates that have had an increase in the minimum wage have had more job \ngrowth, and it is understandable. The economic reports and studies show \nthat if workers are treated fairly, there will be increased \nproductivity. They are going to stay around longer and work. There will \nbe less absenteeism, less turnover, more productivity, and you are \ngoing to increase your output. And this is all reflected in various \nstudies.\n  Look at small business. They say that is good for the Nation, but it \ndoesn't really reflect what is happening to small businesses.\n  This chart states that higher minimum wages create more small \nbusinesses. The overall growth in number of small businesses from 1998 \nto 2003 is 5.4 percent and 4.2 percent. These are the small businesses \nabout which we heard a great deal. We have the small business exemption \nthat exempts 3.6 million workers who are working for the real mom-and-\npop stores, where their gross income is less than $500,000.\n  This gives us some idea of the nature of the economic arguments. They \ndon't hold water. They didn't hold water previously. We have seen a \ndecline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage over this period of \ntime. This chart is in real dollars. We can see where it was in 1960, \n1965, 1970, 1975, going to 1980 and then a gradual decline. Starting in \n1980, under President Reagan, it is going down. And we see the \nincreases that came in the nineties under President Clinton. The \npurchasing power of $5.15, as this chart shows, was probably the lowest \nit had ever been. Its purchasing power has lost 20 percent. All we are \nasking is to get it back to $7.25 and to get the purchasing power back \nto where it was when we went to $5.15. Isn't that outrageous?\n  What have we done in taxes for all the others? We are trying to \nrestore the purchasing power. Let's look in the meantime at what we \nhave done for companies and corporations. Let me go to this, Mr. \nPresident. Look at what has happened. Productivity and profits \nskyrocket while minimum wage plummets. Look at the profits. From 1997 \nto 2006 profits were up 45 percent, productivity was up 29 percent, and \nthe minimum wage was down 20 percent.\n  Historically, in the sixties, seventies, all the way up to 1980, when \nwe saw an\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nincrease in productivity, that was shared with the workers. Companies, \ncorporations shared the increase in productivity with the workers. No \nlonger. That doesn't exist any longer. They take all of that \nproductivity, and it is now an increase in profits.\n  This chart indicates what has happened to the real minimum wage and \nwhat has happened to productivity. See, going back to the sixties, 1960 \nto 1965, even into the seventies, closer productivity, workers working \nharder, increasing productivity. They shared in the increasing \nproductivity with wages. Not anymore. All of that productivity has been \nturned into profits.\n  I want to spend my last few minutes--now that we have had the \neconomic argument--reviewing quickly the most powerful argument, and \nthat is what has happened in terms of these figures, how they translate \ninto real people's lives. The charts reflect the growth of poverty in \nAmerica. We are the strongest economic country in the world, and we \nfind that between 2000 and 2005, we see that the number of people who \nare living in poverty in the United States of America has increased by \nover 5 million--5 million in the United States of America--during this \nperiod of the economy.\n  I listened to the President talk the other night about how the \neconomy is just going like gangbusters. Talk about the number of \nbankruptcies, talk about the growth of poverty--5 million. Let's look \nat what happened with regard to the number of children who are living \nin poverty. There were 11 million in 2000 and 1.3 million more at the \npresent time.\n  This country, of all the industrial nations in the world, has the \nhighest child poverty in the world. Look at the chart and look at the \nend. Look at the red line. It is not even close. The United States of \nAmerica has the highest child poverty in the world. That means the loss \nof hopes and dreams for these children, increasing pressures in terms \nof children dropping out of school because they are living in poverty \nand are not being fed in the morning. They are not getting good quality \nhealth care or any kind of health care. Their parents have two or three \njobs and they are not getting the attention they need. The basic \nabandonment of so many children in our society.\n\n  We read last week into the Record the New York Times article about \nthe burden that is going to be on the American economy. That may get \nthe attention of some of our friends on the other side. They expect \nthat increased child poverty in this Nation is going to cost another \n$500 billion just because of what is happening to children in our \nsociety.\n  Let me show what happens to child poverty in States which have a \nhigher minimum wage. This isn't an accident. If the minimum wage is \nraised, it has an impact on child poverty. Alaska, Connecticut--all the \nway, the States that are listed here--New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, \nVermont, the State of Washington--are above the national average \npoverty rate. They have higher economic growth, higher small business \ngrowth, less child poverty. That is what we have seen. National average \nchild poverty, again, the high minimum wage States, again, have lower \nchild poverty rates.\n  Very quickly, we have seen two nations of the world that have made \nchild poverty a particular issue--Great Britain and Ireland. Now the \nminimum wage is $9.58 an hour in Great Britain. They brought 2,000,000 \nchildren out of poverty. They are a very strong economy in Europe.\n  In Ireland, they have reduced child poverty by 40 percent. They are \nalso a very strong economy.\n  What we know is that the economic arguments don't hold water, and the \nadverse impact is particularly harsh on children.\n  All during this time, we have seen this extraordinary explosion of \ntax breaks that have been given to large companies and small companies. \nThey say these can't do it unless they get help. Over the last 10 \nyears, there have been $276 billion in tax breaks for corporations and \n$36 billion in tax breaks for small businesses, and our Republican \nfriends are insisting that we add more tax breaks if we want any hope \nof getting an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Americans understand fairness, and this is not fair. Trying to hold \nup an increase in the minimum wage for hard-working Americans, who are \nworking and playing by the rules, is not fair. Americans understand \nfairness. There are no economic arguments. We have been out here now \nfor 7 days. I haven't heard them. I have been willing to debate any of \nthose arguments. No, no, we don't get into the economic arguments. We \nused to years ago. Now we don't get into them. We just have to use this \nvehicle for all these other add-ons in order to basically frustrate \nthis body from getting an increase in the minimum wage.\n  As I said before, I don't understand what it is that our Republican \nfriends find so obnoxious about hard-working men and women who are \nworking at the minimum wage, but evidently there is something because \nthey will not let the Senate of the United States act on this \nlegislation.\n  This is about fairness. This is about the hopes and dreams of \nchildren. It is about decency and fairness to women because women are \nthe primary recipients of the minimum wage. So many of them have \nchildren. Eighty percent of those who receive the minimum wage are \nadults; 40 percent of those who receive the minimum wage have been \nreceiving it for 3 years.\n  This is an issue that women are concerned about, that has an enormous \nimpact on children, that is basically a civil rights issue because \nminimum wage jobs so often are the entry jobs for men and women of \ncolor. But it comes back to fairness. It is basically the issue of \nfairness, whether we are going to be fair to hard-working Americans. \nOur Republican friends refuse--absolutely refuse--they refuse to let us \nget a vote on this minimum wage, and they have basically filibustered \nby amendment.\n  As I said, we have over 90 amendments remaining. Democrats on this \nside are prepared, ready, and willing to vote. We thank our leader for \nbringing up this legislation. We are going to continue to battle on.\n  We give assurance to those who are looking to us to represent them, \nto speak for them in the Senate, that we will speak for them. We will \nstand for them. They should know that we are on their side, and we \ndon't intend to fail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, am anxious to get on to the debate \nabout the resolutions that deal with Iraq. I will speak to that for 10 \nminutes.\n  My position is clear. I think we ought to give the President's \nstrategy a chance to work. We asked him to come up with a new strategy. \nHe has done so, and it seems to me that it is our responsibility as a \nSenate to give that a chance to work or to provide an alternative--not \nan alternative to leave but an alternative to win. There are plenty of \nways to leave. We can begin leaving now and have it done in a year. We \ncan leave in 6 months. We can leave to the border but not beyond. There \nare a lot of different ideas about how to leave, but an alternative is \nnot how to leave but how to win.\n  The President has presented such a strategy and I believe we ought to \ngive it a chance to work.\n  Resolutions that are nonbinding nevertheless have consequences. They \ncan't change the policy that is already being effected, the strategy in \nIraq, but what they can do is send very powerful messages. First, they \ncan send a message to our enemies. It seems to me the last message we \nwant to send to the enemy is that the Congress does not support the \nmission in Iraq. Obviously that emboldens the enemy. That is what GEN \nDavid Petraeus said in his testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee last week. It sends a message to our allies that we are not \nin it to the end, and they begin to wonder whether they should start \nhedging their bets.\n  By the way, it sends a message to a country such as Iran, which is \nalready beginning to offer, now, to in effect take our place in Iraq: \nThey will do the training of troops, they will do the reconstruction if \nthe Iraqis will simply invite them in. That obviously would not be in \nour best interests, not to mention the Iraqis' best interests.\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\n  Most importantly, a resolution such as this sends a message to our \ntroops. It is a very powerful message and a very negative one. It is a \nmessage that in effect says we support you, but we don't support your \nmission. We are sending you into a place where you could well die, but \nwe don't support the cause for which you are dying. We don't think you \ncan win. As a matter of fact, I have more respect for those who \nadvocate voting on whether we should continue to support the effort \nmonetarily--the legitimate function of the Congress, to cut off the \nfunds if we don't like the war--than I do for those who simply want to \n``send a message.'' At least the others would be willing to have the \ncourage of their convictions, that if this is not a winnable war, we \nbetter stop it now as opposed to simply trying to send a message.\n  Let me tell you what this message does. Last Friday night I was \nwatching the NBC ``Nightly News.'' Brian Williams was the broadcaster, \nand he called on Richard Engel, reporting from Iraq, to talk about what \nwas going on there. Richard Engel talked about the Stryker Brigade, \nApache Company, setting out on a mission to find bases for U.S. troops. \nI will quote what he said in the report.\n  He said:\n\n       It's not just the new mission the soldiers are adjusting \n     to. They have something else on their minds: The growing \n     debate at home about the war. Troops here say they are \n     increasingly frustrated by American criticism of the war. \n     Many take it personally, believing it is also criticism of \n     what they've been fighting for.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Twenty-one-year-old Specialist Tyler Johnson is on his \n     first tour in Iraq. He thinks skeptics should come over and \n     see what it's like firsthand before criticizing.\n\n  And here is what Specialist Tyler Johnson said:\n\n       Those people are dying. You know what I'm saying? You may \n     support--``oh we support the troops,'' but you're not \n     supporting what they do, what they share and sweat for, what \n     they believe for, what we die for. It just don't make sense \n     to me.\n\n  Back to Richard Engel:\n\n       Staff Sergeant Manuel Sahagun has served in Afghanistan and \n     is now on his second tour in Iraq. He says people back home \n     can't have it both ways.\n\n  And then Staff Sergeant Manuel Sahagun says the following:\n\n       One thing I don't like is when people back home say they \n     support the troops but they don't support the war. If they're \n     going to support us, support us all the way.\n\n  Engel then says:\n\n       Specialist Peter Manna thinks people have forgotten the \n     toll the war has taken.\n\n  And Specialist Peter Manna says:\n\n       If they don't think we are doing a good job, everything we \n     have done here is all in vain.\n\n  Engel concludes the report by saying:\n\n       Apache Company has lost two soldiers and now worries their \n     country may be abandoning the mission they died for.\n\n  Richard Engel, ABC News, Baghdad.\n  That report struck me. I immediately talked to my wife about it, and \nI said those three soldiers have said more eloquently than I and my \ncolleagues have, than we have, in making the point that you can't have \nit both ways. You can't both support the troops and oppose the mission \nwe are sending them on, putting them in harm's way. And can we say that \ntheir colleagues who died did not die in vain if the Senate goes on \nrecord saying we don't support your mission?\n  This is the conflict that has to be in the minds of the families of \nthose who are putting their lives on the line and the very soldiers and \nmarines who are doing the same.\n  Last Friday, this Senate confirmed GEN David Petraeus to take command \nof that theater, and there were all kinds of expressions of support for \nhim. He is, indeed, one of the finest military officers ever to come \nbefore the Senate for confirmation. No one said otherwise. Yet at the \nsame time we are talking about passing a resolution that would say to \nhim: We don't believe in the mission we have just sent you on.\n  He testified he needed more troops in order to carry out the mission \nand that he supported the President's new strategy, one component of \nwhich is to add some troops so that he has the capability, in \nconjunction with the new Iraqi troops, to stabilize and pacify the city \nof Baghdad as well as the Al Anbar Province, which is currently being \nthreatened by al-Qaida terrorists. He said he needs those new troops. \nYet Congress would go on record as saying we do not believe you should \nhave those new troops.\n  Again, at least some number of my colleagues, maybe half or \nthereabouts on the other side of the aisle, would cut off the funding \nfor the troops in order not just to send a message but to end the \ninvolvement. At least that is a position that has action attached to \nit. I disagree with it, but simply sending the message by sending David \nPetraeus on the way, patting him on the back, saying, ``Go do a good \njob but, by the way, we don't believe in the mission,'' it seems to me \nis starting off on the wrong foot.\n  He said something else in his testimony that I thought was telling. \nHe said: Wars are all about your will, your will and your enemy's will.\n  When asked a question by Senator Lieberman, he said passage of these \nresolutions would not be helpful, among other things, because you need \nto break the enemy's will in a conflict, in a war. This kind of \nresolution would inhibit his ability, General Petraeus's ability, with \nour great military, to break the enemy's will to fight. How can you \nbreak the enemy's will to fight when the people who are allegedly \nrunning the war back home have already signaled that they think it is \nlost and it is simply a matter of bringing the troops home, and that \nthe mission is not supported by a majority of the Senate?\n\n  Resolutions, even if they are nonbinding, have consequences. In this \ncase the consequences are detrimental, to our enemy, to our allies, and \nto our soldiers and their families.\n  We have some solemn responsibility here, but none is more serious \nthan putting our young men and women in harm's way. All of us want to \nbring them home safe and sound. We all understand when we vote for \nthat, people are going to die. Everyone who does that does so with a \nsolemn responsibility. We are all looking for a way also to end the \nconflict so no more have to die. But the reason we authorized this in \nthe first place was because we understood there was a mission to \nperform. Even those who disagree with the reasons to begin with \nappreciate the fact that we cannot leave Iraq a failed state. I think \nvirtually everybody in this body would agree with that proposition. We \ncannot leave Iraq a failed state. The consequences, not just to the \nIraqis and to the other people in the region but to United States \nsecurity, would be devastating.\n  Something else on which most people agree is that the Iraqis are not \ncurrently in a position to pacify Baghdad and Al Anbar Province all by \nthemselves. They need our help. That is what the testimony before the \ncommittees was last week.\n  If they need our help, if we all agree we can't leave Iraq a failed \nstate, if General Petraeus is saying we need some time and some troops \nto get this job done in conjunction with a significant change in the \nway the Iraqis are approaching the war--finally backing us up now when \nwe say we want to go into these areas and not just clear them but hold \nthem, keep the bad guys in jail, the ones who have not been killed, for \nexample--if we agree with all those things, then it seems to me the \nlast thing the Senate should be doing is considering a resolution which \nwould say we disagree with the mission, we disagree with the \nPresident's strategy, we don't think we should be sending any more \ntroops, and we want to begin a process of withdrawing from Iraq.\n  When the debate time comes, I am anxious to have it. The American \npeople deserve a debate. I heard a message yesterday that the American \npeople had spoken. Indeed they did. I had an opponent who said we \nshould withdraw from Iraq. Yet I won the last election, saying we \nneeded to stay there until the mission was completed, and I even \nsupported the addition of more troops if that were necessary. In the \ncase of Arizona, I think people have spoken.\n  The reality is, however, I think it is a mixed message. They would \nall like to get out as quickly as possible, but if you ask them, Do you \nthink we should leave before the mission is accomplished, do you think \nwe should leave even though there is the strong probability of a failed \nIraqi state, do you think we can say we support the American troops but \nwe don't support the mission, I think we would disagree with that \nproposition.\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\n  It is up to us as leaders to lead. That means to let them know we \nsupport not just them but their mission, that we want to see it \naccomplished, and we will not undercut that mission or their support by \npassing a resolution that disapproves of the new strategy.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree we have to give this strategy a \nchance to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 8 minutes, and \nfollowing that, the Senator from Alabama to speak for up to an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have two amendments before the body I \nwould like to explain briefly. Then I am impelled to respond to some of \nthe argument we have heard from the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. I guess the question he put was what do Republicans have \nagainst hard-working Americans? I will respond to that in a moment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 135\n\n  My first amendment has to do with the Federal unemployment surtax. In \nthe 1970s, the Unemployment Trust Fund faced financial strains, so \nCongress imposed a surtax to bring money into the unemployment system, \nthe unemployment compensation system, in order to meet its obligations. \nThat debt was paid off in the 1980s. Congress has continued, however, \nto collect the unemployment surtax, proving the maxim once stated by \nRonald Reagan that the closest thing to eternal life here on Earth is a \ntemporary government program. I think this proves that.\n  The Federal unemployment surtax should have expired 20 years ago. \nSince 1987, the surtax has taken approximately $28 billion out of the \npockets of U.S. businesses. Is that $28 billion over 20 years worth the \nbroken promise to eliminate it? I think not. Elimination of the surtax, \nwhich this amendment will do, will save businesses across the country--\nand in my particular State, $135 million--but it will save businesses \nacross the country proportionate amounts.\n  This is an easy and logical way to trim payroll taxes. The FUTA tax \nwithout the surtax is sufficient to fund State and Federal unemployment \nadministrations. Without the surtax, the Federal unemployment tax \ngenerates nearly $6 billion a year, and all accounts associated with \nthe Federal Unemployment Trust Fund have ample balances.\n  It is simply a matter of keeping the faith with the American people, \nwhen we tell them we have a temporary program and that program runs its \ncourse and serves its purpose, to eliminate it. That is what this \namendment would do, and I ask the support of my colleagues for that \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 138\n\n  My second amendment addresses the issue of preventive health care. \nYou might ask what does that have to do with regulatory and tax relief \nto small businesses and the minimum wage? Well, this amendment, which \nasks for the adoption of a stand-alone bill called the Workforce Health \nImprovement Program Act, would put small businesses on a level playing \nfield with big businesses to provide health benefits to their employees \nthat they can deduct but for which small businesses cannot deduct the \nsame benefits they might want to give by outsourcing those to health \nclubs, for example.\n\n  Let me explain where I am coming from. Public health experts \nunanimously agree that people who maintain active and healthy \nlifestyles dramatically reduce the risk of contracting chronic \ndiseases. A physically fit population helps decrease health care costs, \n50 percent of which, by the way, are borne by the Federal taxpayer. A \nphysically fit population reduces Federal Government spending, reduces \nillnesses, and improves worker productivity.\n  The costs, though, are not just measured in dollars. According to the \nSurgeon General's ``Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight \nand Obesity'' published in 2001, 300,000 deaths per year in America are \nassociated with being overweight or obese. Regular physical activity \nreduces the risk of developing or dying from some of the leading causes \nof illness and death in the United States.\n  Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid programs currently spend $84 \nbillion annually on five major chronic diseases: diabetes, heart \ndisease, depression, cancer, and arthritis. It is important we not only \ntreat these diseases once they are manifested but that we also explore \nways to prevent them in the first place. Consider this statistic--the \nnumbers are staggering. This is from the American Diabetes Association:\n\n       The total annual economic cost of diabetes in 2002 in the \n     United States of America was $132 billion. Direct medical \n     expenditures totaled $92 billion and $23.2 billion of that \n     was for diabetes care, $24.6 billion was for chronic \n     diabetes-related complications, and $44.1 billion was for \n     excess prevalence of general medical conditions related to \n     diabetes. Indirect costs resulting to lost work days, \n     restricted activity days, mortality, and permanent disability \n     due to diabetes totaled $40.8 billion.\n\n  One NIH study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine showed \nthat modest changes in exercise and diet can prevent diabetes in 58 \npercent of the people at high risk for the disease. What is more, the \ntrial showed that participants over 60 years of age benefited the most, \npreventing the onset of diabetes by 71 percent. Even assuming that \nintervention with modest changes in exercise and diet is only half that \neffective, they estimated the possible 10-year savings to the health \ncare system would be $344 billion.\n  I think it makes enormous sense, as we look to try and level the \nplaying field for small businesses as part of this comprehensive \npackage, that we seriously consider leveling the playing field by \nproviding an ability to prevent the occurrence--the incidence, I should \nsay--of obesity-related diseases, namely diabetes, which causes so much \nhuman misery and so much unnecessary expense that could be avoided if \nwe could encourage more Americans to a more active lifestyle and a \nbetter diet.\n  So I ask my colleagues for their consideration of this amendment as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, could I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Texas has 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes, for a total of 3 minutes, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts a moment \nago asked--because Republicans have asked for additional tax and \nregulatory relief for small businesses that employ 70 percent of the \nAmerican people--what it is that Republicans have against hard-working \nAmericans because of our desire to pass not just a minimum wage of \n$7.25 an hour, up from the $5.15 an hour. He said that this was an \neffort to politicize the issue.\n  So I would have to ask the Senator, when the minimum wage affects 2.5 \npercent of the workforce in America, mainly teenagers and part-time \nworkers, people entering the workforce, is this the way to address the \nneeds of hard-working Americans? Why is it we are so focused on a \nminimum wage, when what we ought to be focused on is maximizing the \nwages of American workers primarily, I believe, through increased \ntraining, workforce initiatives, working through community colleges \nwith the private sector to train people for good wages, much higher \nthan minimum wage, that exist in this country but go wanting for lack \nof trained workers. These programs exist in our communities in my State \nand throughout the country, and I think we would do better to focus our \nefforts to try to improve the standard of living for people across \nAmerica.\n  I simply disagree with the Senator from Massachusetts, if he says by \nfocusing on 2.5 percent of the workforce and by trying to ameliorate \nsome of the harm to small businesses that generate 70 percent of the \njobs, we are doing anything that would harm hard-working Americans. To \nthe contrary, what we are trying to do is make sure those hard-working \nAmericans have jobs, not that they are put out of work by well-\nintentioned but unsuccessful attempts for Government to mandate wages \nwithout taking into account the impact on small businesses, the primary \nemployers in our country.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Alabama, \nwho\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\nwas supposed to start speaking at 4 o'clock, allowing a couple of us to \nspeak, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank Senator \nCornyn and Senator Kyl for their remarks. I share with Senator Kyl his \nconcern over the resolution that we will be apparently addressing later \nthis week or next week. He quoted an NBC News report in which soldiers \nin Iraq in harm's way said that, in their view, you can't support the \nsoldiers without supporting the policy we sent them on, and that is a \ntroubling thing.\n  Today I talked to a businessman from Alabama--quite a fine, \nupstanding leader in the community. His son is in Iraq right now. They \nalready heard about the Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolution. \nIt was very troubling to them. They didn't know how to read it, \naccording to him, or what it meant to them. I talked to a lady not long \nago, within the last week, and she told me her son was in his second \ntour there, and he believed in what he was doing. He was proud to \nserve, but he didn't know what we were doing here. He said he: ``Didn't \nwant to be the last soldier to die if we weren't going to follow \nthrough on a policy that we have set here.''\n  So we are in a difficult time, and we need to remember those things \nas we set about our policy. I don't know all of the answers. I don't \ndisrespect people who would disagree with me on this. I know there are \na lot of people with a lot of different ideas about what to do in Iraq. \nBut my observation is and my thought is that we, as a Congress, ought \nto affirm the policies we are asking our soldiers to execute. They say \nwe are not asking them, but the President is, and the President speaks \nfor us, until Congress withdraws that power by reducing his funding. \nThe President executes the policies as Commander in Chief. So it is a \nbig deal and we need to be careful about what we do and I am \ndisappointed we will be dealing with those resolutions.\n  Mr. President, I remember during the immigration debate last fall, \nlast summer and spring, Senator Kennedy and I were on the floor one \nnight, and I talked about how I believe the large amount of immigration \nwe are seeing today, much of it illegal, was adversely affecting the \nwages of American workers. Senator Kennedy didn't object to that, but \nhe stood up and in response basically said: Well, we are going to offer \na minimum wage bill, and that is going to take care of it. If anyone \nheard Senator Lamar Alexander's speech on Friday--and not many people \ndid; it was after the vote had been cast--but he went into some detail \nand with great care explained how the minimum wage is not reaching poor \nworking people in this country in the ways most people think it is but \nthat most people making minimum wage are part of a household whose \nincome exceeds $40,000 a year, I believe was the figure he cited, and \nthere are a number of studies on that. The point being that usually it \nis a transition period for young people or others--maybe they are part \ntime and that kind of thing.\n  I am not saying people would not like an increase in the minimum \nwage, but the working poor, the people who are every day out giving \ntheir best to try to raise their families and who need to have a higher \nincome, people who have been out there for years and working, they are \nalready above $7 an hour, for the most part. If they show up on time \nand are reliable and give an honest day's work, as almost all of them \ndo, then they are going to be above $7 an hour now. Do you follow me? \nSo this is not the panacea we are concerned about. What we want and \nwhat we care about, fellow citizens and Members of the Senate, is \nhaving better wages for working Americans, having all the people be \nable to go out and get a better wage they can take home and take care \nof their families with. That includes how much taxes are taken out, how \nmuch insurance is taken out.\n  President Bush has a great proposal that is going to help a lot of \npeople. I assure my colleagues a lot of people will feel a substantial \nbenefit from this health care tax credit plan he has proposed. That is \na way to help working people, a real significant way.\n  Senator Alexander mentioned the earned-income tax credit, and he went \ninto some detail about it. Economists and experts are quite clear: The \nearned-income tax credit more appropriately benefits working Americans \nthan a minimum wage at much less cost. We spend $40 billion a year on \nthe earned-income tax credit. That is what the credit amounts to in \nterms of benefits to working Americans. Their wages are lower, and, at \ncertain levels, they don't qualify for other benefits. And as a result, \nthey do qualify for the earned-income tax credit. So I would like to \ntalk about that.\n  I offered an amendment that would have required the earned-income tax \ncredit to be paid on individual's paychecks, when they get their \npaycheck each payday. That is correct, in my view, as a matter of \npolicy. It is a complex thing. Some are concerned about the mechanics \nof it. So I offered another amendment that was accepted by the \nDemocratic leadership and the Republican leadership that required the \nDepartment of the Treasury to review what would happen and how it could \nbe done if we allowed people to get their earned-income tax credit on \ntheir weekly or biweekly paycheck. It can be done now. In fact, a \nlittle less than 2 percent of the people get their earned-income tax \ncredit, or at least a portion of it, on their check each week.\n  So we would like to talk about that because as we debate the minimum \nwage, the real debate is how to help working Americans, middle-class \nAmericans, lower income Americans get more legitimate pay for the work \nthey do.\n  Now, that is what we are all about; not some fetish with having an \nincrease in the minimum wage, particularly when it is not going to be \nas effective in meeting the needs of the working poor, as is being sold \nto this Congress and the American people.\n  In 2004, more than 22 million Americans--get this--more than 22 \nmillion Americans claimed the earned-income tax credit, putting $40.7 \nbillion into the pockets of the working poor. This is a very large \nprogram. It is a very large shift of resources to the working poor. The \namount of the credit for each recipient depends on several factors, \nsuch as the worker's income and the number of dependent children they \nclaim.\n  Nonetheless, a low-income worker with one child will be eligible to \nclaim up to $2,853 for tax year 2007, while a worker with two or more \nchildren could receive $4,718 on a 2,200-hour work year. The average \nearned-income tax credit for a beneficiary with a qualifying child was \n$1,728 in 2004. That is almost $1 an hour on average.\n  Many have criticized the earned-income tax credit over the years, \nsaying it is another welfare handout and it has far too much fraud in \nit. Some numbers have shown fraud as high as over 30 percent, but the \ntax credit is here to stay. I don't see any real movement to eliminate \nit. Why don't we see if we can make it work better?\n  The idea is to reward work. It is a benefit of the Government, an \nearned tax credit, earned by working. That was the purpose of the \nearned-income tax credit from the beginning, to encourage welfare \nrecipients and others who were not in the workforce to decide that it \nwas beneficial for them to work. Some of this came from Milton \nFriedman, the great free market economist who recently died, calling \nfor a negative income tax. That is sort of what inspired this.\n  All is not perfect. The earned-income tax credit has provided real \nmoney for low-income Americans working hard to pull their family out of \npoverty. As Senator Alexander demonstrated in some detail, remarkably \nand ably, it gets to the working poor far better than an increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  An important feature added to the earned-income tax credit occurred \nin 1978, a few years after the law was passed. That allows the credit \nrecipients to receive the benefit on their paychecks rather than as a \none-time lump sum tax refund. Now, you work all year. Most people have \nno idea if they are earning any earned-income tax credit. They are not \nreceiving extra money for their work. And next year, they file for a \ntax refund and get a big check, disconnecting, in their minds, the \nreceipt of that check with the work they did the year before. \nTherefore, it ceases to be the kind of incentive to work we want it to \nbe.\n  Receiving an advanced payment under the law is simple. Workers \nbelieving they will be eligible can fill out\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\na form or W-5 with their employer, and once completed workers will \nreceive part of their EITC benefit on their paycheck based on the \namount they are expected to receive over the year based on their \nincome. So despite a number of campaigns by the IRS to increase the \nnumber that sign up for this advance payment, only a few do, less than \n2 percent. The majority, unaware they can receive the credit in \nadvance, receive it in the form of a tax refund in the spring of the \nnext year.\n  Recipients earn the tax credit by working throughout the year. Yet \nthey do not receive the benefit until months after when they file their \ntax returns. For most workers who receive the EITC as a lump sum at the \nend of the year, they never make that connection between the increased \nwork and the increased paycheck, as they simply receive a fat check.\n  How can it encourage work if there is no correlation for most \nrecipients between the work they do and the money they receive?\n  An amendment, which the Senate has already accepted, challenges the \nSecretary of the Treasury, the Department of the Treasury, to get us a \nreport on how we can do this effectively. It is important. It will \nensure the taxpayers who are giving this benefit to working Americans \nget the second part of the benefit that the taxpayers intended them to \nreceive.\n  The first part, of course, is helping the working poor have more \nmoney for their families. We want to help them. The second benefit we \nwant to occur is for the overall economy and health of America to \nencourage people to work, to make work more rewarding. If you are \nmaking $7 an hour and you get $1 an hour pay raise as a result of the \nearned-income tax credit, you have received a substantial increase, \nwell over 10 percent increase in your take home pay, especially since \nthere are no taxes taken out of that part that has accrued as a result \nof the earned-income tax credit.\n  That encourages work. That makes work more attractive. That helps \nmeet the needs of America today. That is what this is about. A worker \nwho is making $6 an hour would be making closer to $7. Workers making \n$8 would be making closer to $9. It adds up to real money as the years \ngo by.\n  We can do a much better job of utilizing the existing program without \nany cost beyond what we are already expending, but in a way that gets \nmoney to people when they need it, right then on their paycheck. They \nmay have a tire blow out and they need a new tire. The transmission may \nhave broken in their car. A child may need to go on a trip at school. \nThey need the money as they earn it so they can apply it in a sound way \nto their family's budgetary needs instead of one big fat check sometime \nin the spring of the next year. That is a suggestion I have for \nimproving the quality of life for American workers.\n  Another sense-of-the-Senate amendment I offered, that was accepted, \nwe voted on 98 to 0, was to call on Congress to state that it is a \nsense of the Senate that we should do a better job in Congress of \nestablishing a uniform savings plan for Americans. We in the Government \nhave a wonderful plan called the thrift plan. It allows every Federal \nworker, in any department or agency, to put money in the thrift plan \nand the Federal Government would match up to 5 percent of their \ncontributions.\n  Many young people starting to work for the Government today, if they \ncontribute 5 percent each paycheck, with the Government matching it, \nwill retire with $1 million in the bank--trust me on that--with the \npower of compound interest. It is an exciting program.\n  Many private companies have similar programs, 401(k)-type programs, \nbut many don't. Half of the workers in America today work for a company \nthat does not have such a retirement plan. A chunk of those, even if \nthey do, don't take advantage of it. This is particularly concerning to \nme because I have learned from Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao that the \naverage American has nine jobs by the time they are 35. What does that \nsay to the practical men and women of the Senate? It says they are \nbouncing around a lot. They may go to a company that has a plan and \nthey may invest in it a little bit, then they go to a company that \ndoesn't. Or they go to a company that says they have to work for 6 \nmonths or a year before they can participate in their plan, or they \ndecide not to put into that plan. Or, if they put in some money and \nthey change jobs and the account is $500, $2,000, $1,500--we have \nstatistics that show that over 40 percent of them cash in those \naccounts paying the penalties--they think it is not enough money to \nworry about.\n\n  Whereas, if they set aside a small amount of money from the day they \nstart working at age 18, or out of college, every day, every paycheck, \na small amount of money set aside as is done by most of the thrift \naccount savers, they could retire with hundreds of thousands in the \nbank, which would allow for an annuity, if they purchased it at age 65, \nto pay someone $2,000 a month for the rest of their life, easy. Those \nthings are realistically possible.\n  It is a great tragedy, it is a tremendous national tragedy, that in a \ntime where we have relatively low unemployment--in my State it is not \nmuch over 3 percent, maybe 3.6 percent in Alabama--and most people are \nworking, the wages have gone up, although not as much as we would like, \nbut our wages are beginning to edge back up, that most Americans are \nnot saving. They could be setting aside even a small amount that would \ntransform their retirement years from retirement years that depend \nsolely on Social Security, the retirement years can be supplemented by \na substantial flow of money.\n  Finally, I talk about another subject, our general concern that wages \nhave not kept up in America. I share that concern. I have heard the \neconomists make the argument--many in the business community are people \nI respect--make the argument that wages tend to lag behind. Gross \ndomestic production growth goes up for a while and wages do not go up, \nbut they catch up, and there is some truth to that. I don't deny that.\n  But if you look at the numbers and how middle-class and lower income \nworkers are getting along today, you cannot be pleased with what is \noccurring, particularly in certain areas and certain fields. It is from \nthat perspective I say, as part of this debate over minimum wage which \nwe are told is designed to help people have more money to take home, to \ntake care of their families, and if you think this is not the right way \nto do it, you don't love families and you don't want to help poor \npeople; that is not correct.\n  I hope to be able to vote for this minimum wage bill. I voted for \nseveral to increase the minimum wage. I am just saying the minimum wage \nhas been demonstrated by analysis, by top-flight econometric firms, \nthat it does not reach the poor people in a way that most people think \nit does. It oftentimes helps young people who are children of some \ncorporate executive who may be working.\n  Our motivation, and I think it is universal in the Senate, through \nthe legislation moving through the Senate now, is designed to improve \nthe take-home pay of Americans so they can more ably benefit from the \ngreat American dream and take care of their families effectively.\n  Significant economic evidence indicates the presence of large amounts \nof illegal labor in low-skilled job sectors is depressing the wages of \nAmerican workers. That is an important statement if it is true, right? \nIf that is true, isn't that important? First of all, we are a nation of \nlaws. We think the laws ought to be enforced.\n  Overwhelmingly the American people agree with that. But if it also is \ndepressing the wages of working Americans, that is a double concern, \nparticularly as we are asking ourselves in this debate: How can we help \nlow-wage workers do better? I will talk about that. We have to talk \nabout this.\n  Harvard economist George Borjas, who testified before the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Lawrence Katz, \nalso of Harvard, estimate that the influx of low-skilled, low-wage \nimmigration into our country from 1980 to 2000 has resulted in a 3-\npercent decrease in wages for the average American worker--that is all \nworkers--and has cut wages to native-born high school dropouts--those \nwho have not obtained a high school degree; unfortunately, we have \nquite a number of those in our country--who make up the poorest 10 \npercent of our workforce, by some 8 percent. Eight percent, if you \nfigure that\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\nout on a yearly basis, amounts to $1,200 a year. That is $100 a month.\n\n  Now, for some people in America today, $100 a month is not a lot. But \nif you are making near the minimum wage, $100 a month is a lot of \nmoney.\n  Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the U.S. Business and Industry \nCouncil Educational Foundation, says:\n\n       [T]he most important statistics available show conclusively \n     that, far from easing shortages--\n\n  Shortages of labor--\n\n     illegal immigrants are adding to labor gluts in America. \n     Specifically, wages in sectors highly dependent on illegals, \n     when adjusted for inflation, are either stagnant or have \n     actually fallen.\n\n  Now, he is referring to Labor Department data and information from \nthe Pew Hispanic Center. For example, he cites data from the U.S. \nBureau of Labor Statistics that indicates the following: inflation-\nadjusted wages for the broad Food and Services and Drinking \nEstablishments category--they have a category for that: the broad Food \nand Services and Drinking Establishments category; and they monitor the \nwages for it--between the years 2000 to 2005 fell 1.65 percent.\n  The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that illegal immigrants comprise 17 \npercent of food preparation workers, 20 percent of cooks, and 23 \npercent of dishwashers, about a fifth of those workers; three-fifths, \nfour-fifths being legal native citizens. But contrary to what we have \nbeen told, that you cannot get workers at the wages they are paying, \nand paying fair wages, it looks as though the wages have fallen, which \nis a matter of interest.\n  Inflation-adjusted wages for the food manufacturing industry--the Pew \nHispanic Center estimates that illegal immigrants comprise 14 percent \nof that workforce--fell 2.4 percent between 2000 and 2005.\n  Inflation-adjusted wages for hotel workers--the Pew Hispanic Center \nestimates illegal immigrants make up 10 percent of that workforce--fell \n1 percent from 2000 to 2005.\n  Inflation-adjusted wages in the construction industry--Pew estimates \nthat illegal immigrants make up 12 percent of the workforce there--fell \n1.59 percent between 2000 and 2005.\n  Inflation-adjusted wages in the animal processing and slaughtering \nsubcategory--and Pew estimates that illegal immigrants comprise 27 \npercent of that workforce, the highest percentage--fell 1.41 percent \nbetween 2000 and 2005.\n  So if these numbers are correct--and they come from the objective BLS \nand are supposed to be accurate, and we rely on them for our business \naround here--something is amiss if people say they cannot get workers, \nyet they are getting the work done, and they are paying less in 2005 \nthan they were in 2000.\n  Now, you tell me.\n  Others studying the same issue have found similar trends. According \nto a recent City Journal article by Steven Malanga, a senior fellow at \nthe Manhattan Institute:\n\n     . . . low-wage immigration has produced such a labor surplus \n     that many of these workers are willing to take jobs without \n     benefits and with salaries far below industry norms. . . .\n\n  Well, let me go on. Day laborers--these are people who gather at \ncertain known locations within areas, and they hang out until somebody \ncomes out and hires them--who work in construction in urban areas \n``like New York and Los Angeles . . . sell their labor by the hour or \nthe day, for $7 to $11 an hour . . . far below what full time \nconstruction workers earn.''\n  You see, we want Americans to be able to have a job that has some \npermanency to it, that pays a decent wage, that has retirement \nbenefits, and has health care benefits. But our workers who might be \ninterested in construction--and more are than most people think--are \nhaving to compete against people who will work by the day for $7 and \n$11 an hour and do not demand any benefits.\n  Robert Samuelson, a contributing editor of Newsweek, has written a \ncolumn for the Washington Post since 1977. In his column last spring he \nsummed up the impact of illegal immigration on the unskilled American \nworker this way:\n\n       Poor immigrant workers hurt the wages of unskilled \n     Americans. The only question is how much. Studies suggest a \n     range ``from negligible to an earnings reduction of almost 10 \n     percent,'' according to the [Congressional Budget Office].\n\n  That is a lot: 10 percent. Five percent is a lot.\n  To put this impact into a larger perspective, one might ask how much \nnative workers have lost as a whole due to competition with low-skilled \nimmigrant laborers. Although only a few studies have ever looked at \nthis issue, a 2002 National Bureau of Economic Research paper written \nby Columbia University economics professors Donald R. Davis and David \nE. Weinstein is on point.\n  Using complex methodology, they aggregated the total loss to the U.S. \nnative workers and found that the magnitude of losses for U.S. native \nworkers equates roughly to $72 billion a year, or .8 percent of GDP. \nNow, I don't know if that figure is correct, but the earned income tax \ncredit is just $40 billion a year, and they say it amounts to $72 \nbillion a year. The economics professors at Columbia University also \nsaid immigration is as costly to the United States as all trade \nprotections.\n  When wages are suppressed, people drop out of the workforce. In \naddition to the evidence that low-skilled American workers--and \nparticularly African-American workers--are suffering wage suppression \ndue to the competition they face from illegal alien labor, we also know \ncompetition is causing some Americans to drop out of the labor force.\n  Steven Camorota, last spring, of the Center for Immigration Studies, \nanalyzed the steady decline in the share of less-educated adult natives \nin the workforce between March 2000 and March 2005.\n  Prior to Hurricane Katrina, there were 4 million unemployed natives--\nthose looking for jobs who were unable to find them--with high school \ndegrees or less in the workforce. An additional 19 million natives with \nhigh school degrees or less existed but were not actively looking for \njobs.\n  Between 2000 and 2005, the number of adult immigrants--legal land \nillegal--with only a high school degree or less in the labor force \nincreased by 1.6 million.\n\n  During the same time period, unemployment among high school graduates \nand less educated native Americans increased by nearly 1 million--so \nunemployment among our high school graduates or high school dropouts \nincreased by nearly 1 million--and an additional 1.5 million left the \nworkforce altogether.\n  Although jobs grew in the United States from 2000 to 2005, natives \nonly benefited from 9 percent of the total net job increase. That is an \nimportant factor. Although jobs grew in the U.S. from 2000 to 2005, \nnatives only benefited from 9 percent of that total. The number of \nadult natives holding a job grew by only 303,000, while the number of \nadult immigrants holding a job increased by 2.9 million. So it is \n303,000 compared to 2.9 million among high school graduates or high \nschool dropouts.\n  Steven Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, recently \nexplained:\n\n       [M]any of the unskilled, uneducated workers now journeying \n     here labor . . . in shrinking industries, where they force \n     out native workers, and many others work in industries where \n     the availability of cheap workers has led businesses to \n     suspend investment in new technologies that would make them \n     less labor-intensive. . . . [T]he unemployment rate among \n     native-born ``unskilled workers is high--about 30 percent.''\n\n  The unemployment rate among native-born, unskilled workers is about \n30 percent, I repeat.\n  To me, those numbers do indicate a significant problem. It is a \nproblem we need to talk about as we talk about how to help working \nAmericans get a better wage.\n  Mr. President, I will note a few more points before I wrap up.\n  Professor Richard Freeman--the Herbert S. Ascherman Professor of \nEconomics at Harvard--testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nI participated in that hearing last spring. He said:\n\n       If you're a poor Mexican, your income in the U.S. will be \n     six to eight times what it is in Mexico.\n\n  Robert Samuelson explained in a March 2006 column in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       They're drawn here by wage differences, not labor \n     ``shortages.''\n\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\n\n  American workers, I think it is fair to say, cannot compete with the \nwage gap between their country and other countries. I was in South \nAmerica last May with Senator Specter. We visited Peru, and we saw a \npoll that had just been published in Nicaragua while we were there that \nsaid 60 percent of the people in Nicaragua would come to the United \nStates if they could. I mentioned that to the State Department team \nthere in Peru, and they told me that a poll in Peru had recently shown, \njust about this time last year, that 70 percent of the people in Peru \nwould come to the United States if they could.\n  So I guess what I am saying to my colleagues is, we need an \nimmigration policy that allows immigration and that is consistent with \nour historic values as a nation that welcomes immigrants, but the \nnumbers and the skill sets that they bring ought to be such that they \ndo not depress wages of our lower income people because we cannot \naccept everybody in the world who would like to come here. It is not \nphysically possible to any degree that we could accept that.\n  We have a lottery section that does not have any requirements of \nskills in it. You apply to it if you want to come to America. It allows \nfor 50,000 to be drawn out of a hat each year. And those who are drawn \nget to come to America on a random basis. We had 5 million people, \naccording to Professor Borjas at Harvard, who applied for those 50,000 \nslots. I do not blame people who want to come here. I am not demeaning \nthem. Most of them are good and decent people who want to get ahead. \nBut we have such a higher wage base that we could attract people from \nall over the world in virtually unlimited numbers, and it does have the \nimpact, if allowed to be too great and too concentrated in certain \nindustries, to pull down American wages.\n  While we are thinking about how to increase the wages of American \nworkers, we need to think about that. That is all I am saying. And we \nare going to talk about that if we talk about immigration this year, as \nI expect we will. We can have immigration, but it needs to be done \nright.\n  How do we level the playing field? Let's consider the advice given by \nDr. Barry Chiswick. He is the head of the Department of Economics at \nthe University of Illinois in Chicago. He testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last spring, stating:\n\n       [T]he large increase in low-skilled immigration . . . has \n     had the effect of decreasing the wages and employment \n     opportunities of low-skilled workers who are currently \n     residing in the United States.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Over the past two decades . . . The real earnings of low \n     skilled workers have either stagnated or decreased somewhat.\n       [W]e . . . need to . . . provide greater assistance to low-\n     skilled Americans in their quest for better jobs and higher \n     wages. [O]ne of the best ways we can help them in this regard \n     is by reducing the very substantial competition that they are \n     facing from this very large and uncontrolled low-skilled \n     immigration that is the result of both our legal immigration \n     system and the absence of enforcement of immigration law.\n\n  That is pretty much indisputable. I haven't heard a professor who \nwould dispute that yet, or anybody who can seriously object to those \nnumbers.\n  Professor Harry Holzer, associate dean and professor of public policy \nat Georgetown University, a great university here, also testified at \nthat same hearing. He believes American workers do want jobs currently \nbeing held by illegal laborers.\n  I don't agree with this idea that these are jobs Americans want to \ntake. Americans are not interested in a job that is only going to last \nfor 3 months, that pays the minimum wage and has no health care and no \nretirement benefits. I will say that. And neither do we want them to \ntake those jobs.\n  Professor Holzer believes that absent illegal immigrant competition, \nemployers would raise wages and improve working conditions to attract \nthe American worker:\n\n       I believe that when immigrants are illegal, they do more to \n     undercut the wages of native-born workers, because the \n     playing field isn't level and employers don't have to pay \n     them market wages.\n        . . . [T]here are jobs in industries like construction \n     that I think are more appealing to native-born workers, and \n     many native-born low-income men might be interested in more \n     of those jobs. . . . Absent the immigrants, the employer \n     might need to raise those wages and improve those conditions \n     of work to entice native-born workers into those jobs.\n\n  That is true. That is all I am saying. As we discuss the minimum \nwage--and I am confident somehow we will work our way through this, but \nthere are some amendments and votes that need to be taken--it should be \ndone only as part of a serious evaluation of what is happening to the \nwages of low-skilled workers and middle-class workers. If we do that \nand think it through, we will see we ought to reform the earned income \ntax credit so people can receive that benefit while they work. We will \nconclude we ought to create a savings program every American worker can \nput money into throughout their working career, from the first paycheck \nthey get until the day of their retirement. It would transform the \nretirement years of those people. We have that in our capability.\n  As we craft an immigration policy, we cannot craft that policy in \nsuch a way that it only benefits corporate profits. It must be done in \na way that considers the impact that is occurring on our own low-\nskilled workers. If we do a good lawful system of immigration that is \nin harmony with our history of immigration in America but at the same \ntime provides protection to the least of our American workers, we will \nhave done something worthwhile.\n  Unfortunately, I have to say the bill that passed the Senate last \nyear would have been a disaster. It would have increased legal \nimmigration in this country, skewed mostly to low-skilled workers, by \nalmost three times the current rate. How can that have done anything \nother than hurt our workers?\n  Those are some thoughts. I appreciate the opportunity of sharing \nthem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthat amendment No. 147, which I have offered, which deals with \nincreased fines for employers who hire illegal immigrants, be called \nup. That fine currently is $250. I think that is too low. I ask that \nthat be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I think that is relevant to the issue we are talking about: How to \nhelp people get more take-home pay for their labor. One of the reasons \nthat is not happening to the degree we would like is the large flow of \nillegal labor. One of the problems we have is that enforcement in the \nworkplace is not adequate. Most employers want to do the right thing, \nbut a $250 fine is too low. We will be dealing with that again later \non.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 221 to Amendment No. 157\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 157 and send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 221 to amendment No. 157.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Section 2 of the bill shall take effect one day after date \n     of enactment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to speak a few minutes about what \nwe are doing. I also have several things I would like the American \npeople to see. I have spent a lot of time thinking about the minimum \nwage and kind of the farce of what we are doing here. If we tell people \nwe want them to have a real minimum wage, the debate ought to be about \n$13 an hour. If we, as the Government, are going to tell the States and \nthe employers what they ought to be paying, giving them a real minimum \nwage, then surely they deserve to earn $28,000 a year. That is a \nlivable wage. You can make it on that. The fact that nobody wants to do \nthat and it will be voted down proves they\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\nknow how onerous that would be on the economy. Nobody wants to do that. \nNobody wants to so disrupt wages. But it is OK to do it in a small \namount. That is what we are talking about.\n  The first poster I have shows that 29 States and the District of \nColumbia have a minimum wage that is higher than the Federal minimum \nwage.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Dr. Coburn is such a thoughtful commentator on many \nissues, but he is an expert and has done a lot of work on the health \ncare issue. I know he has some of his own ideas. But one of the ways \nyou could help low-income workers would be to reduce the health care \nburden they pay in terms of health insurance. For example, the \nPresident's proposal of tax deductibility that he made in his State of \nthe Union Address would be a rather sizable benefit to a lot of low-\nincome workers, if it were passed, would it not?\n  Mr. COBURN. It will be a benefit but not to the extent a direct tax \ncredit to them would be. Right now the average American, if you are in \nthe upper income scale, gets $2,700 worth of tax benefit from our \nincome tax code. And if you are on the lower scale, you get $103 worth \nof tax benefit.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is for health insurance deductibility.\n  Mr. COBURN. Under the President's proposal, that would be narrowed. I \nbelieve it ought to be the same for every American. Every American \nought to get the same tax benefit. I also believe every American ought \nto be covered. There ought to be access for anybody with disease. There \nare ways to do that, and I will be introducing a global health care \nbill within the next month that attacks every aspect of health care and \nwhat we need to do about it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wanted to say I am interested in the \nearned income tax credit, immigration, and in savings. The Senator has \nmentioned health care. All of those are ways, apart from mandating a \nsalary or minimum wage increase, to help workers. The bill the \nPresident proposed would not go as far as Senator Coburn would like to \nsee--and I am impressed with his analysis--but it would, in fact, \nprovide a good benefit for working Americans.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator from Alabama is correct.\n  You can see from this chart that 29 States currently have a minimum \nwage higher than the Federal minimum wage, and you can also see from \nthe next chart that 14 other States are in their legislature right now \nconsidering increasing their own minimum wage. One of the things our \nFounders thought and planned and hoped we would stick with is having \nthe States be laboratories of experimentation with respect to our \ndemocracy. So if you have 14 plus 29, you have 43 States out of 50 and \nthe District of Columbia that have already answered this question. We \nare going to go through and answer it for them again.\n  There are a lot of problems associated with this. I want to put up \nanother slide that shows what has happened since 1998 as far as the \nnumber of people on the minimum wage. It is a precipitous decline from \nover 4 million to less than 1.9 million workers presently. You need to \nbreak that down. When you break that down, when we say we want to help \nsingle moms with kids or four-person families, those working at the \nminimum wage, what happens is, when you run the numbers, in many \ninstances we are going to hurt people who are making the minimum wage. \nLet me prove my point.\n  In Oklahoma today, if you are earning the minimum wage, you have \naccess to the following benefits: A State tax credit--I am talking \nabout families with children on the minimum wage, and there are 40,000 \nof those in Oklahoma--a school lunch program, which is federally \nsponsored; temporary assistance to needy families; childcare subsidies; \nMedicaid, which is called SoonerCare in our State; the earned income \ntax credit, which is over $4,400 per year; food stamps; housing \nvouchers; plus what they earn on the minimum wage.\n  What happens is, if you are a family of four in Oklahoma today \nearning the minimum wage, your aftertax net benefits, taking advantage \nof what we are supplying supporting people making the minimum wage, is \n$36,438 per year. The median household income is only $38,000 and that \nis pretax. So the average person receiving the benefits we have offered \nfor people who have less means in Oklahoma today actually has more \nbenefit than the average Oklahoma family. What is going to happen when \nwe pass this minimum wage for that person in Oklahoma? What is going to \nhappen is, on the childcare, they are going to go from $22 a month \ncopay to $95 a month. That is what is going to happen to families in \nOklahoma. TANF, they are going to go from $3,500 a year to $2,600 a \nyear, based on this minimum wage bill. On food stamps, they are going \nto go from $3,588 a year to $2,808 a year. Under this very bill, that \nis what is going to happen to families earning the minimum wage in \nOklahoma. Their housing subsidy is going to go from $4,140 a year to \n$3,096, a 25-percent reduction. Their Medicaid, if they are a family of \nfour, they are not going to qualify for the whole family anymore; only \ntheir children will be qualified. So, in essence, what they are going \nto lose is $4,600 a year in aftertax benefits.\n  Net net, when you think about the median household income in Oklahoma \nbeing $38,000 and they are paying a State income tax of less than 6 \npercent, and an average Federal income tax of about 18 percent, what \nyou are going to see is they are going to lose.\n  In the name of helping them, they are going to lose. The vast \nmajority of the people we want to help, which is not the vast majority \nof the people on minimum wage anywhere in this country--the people who \nwe really want to help the most, not the teenagers or the kids living \nin a family who have a minimum wage job as a first job, but those in \nOklahoma and in 19 other States--you are going to actually decrease \ntheir income with this bill. It is not going to have any effect.\n  Put Massachusetts up there on the chart. The Senator from \nMassachusetts wants Oklahoma to have his minimum wage bill. The median \nhousehold income in Massachusetts is $52,354 a year. The total income \nfor somebody making the Massachusetts minimum wage, they are making \n$45,416 if they take advantage of the benefits available to them in \nMassachusetts. So his State won't be impacted because he is already \nabove the minimum wage which is being proposed in the minimum wage \nbill.\n  How smart is it for us to decide that we want to take away from the \nfamilies of 19 States--those people who we say we really want to help \nbut, in essence, we are going to cut their aftertax income by about \n$1,000, a net/net loss for them? Is that what we intend to do? That is \nthe unexpected consequence of what we are going to do. Nobody is \nconsidering the fact that the 19 States that have lower minimum wages \nwhich will be impacted by this bill--their needy families, single moms \nwith kids, are going to lose under this bill in the name of them \nwinning. It is because we didn't think it out.\n  The reason we didn't think it out is because this isn't about minimum \nwage; this is about wage compression. This is about raising the wages \nof those people above minimum wage. It is not about minimum wage. We \ncome down here and say it is, but it is not. It is designed to raise \nthe wages of anybody under $15 an hour. That is what it is going to do. \nWe know wage compression. If you have 100 people working and the \nhighest is making $12 and the lowest is now making $6, and you say they \nare going to have to make $7.25 or $7.50, what is going to happen to \nthe other wages? They are going to have to be bumped up. The minimum \nwage is no longer designed to protect people as far as their income.\n  You can see it from this chart and you can see it in California--and \nI have it for every State--where the vast majority of the benefits \ndon't come from what we earn in terms of a salaried job; they come from \nthe other benefits the country put in as a social safety net. So in the \nStates in which we would raise the minimum wage that have not done it, \nin 19 States what is going to happen is we are going to hurt the very \npeople we say we want to help.\n  How is it we can do that? Why is it we will do that? We will do it \nbecause there is a very powerful interest group that is behind this \ncalled the labor unions in this country. For every dollar increase in \nlabor rates paid through\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\nthe labor unions, what happens to the union's fees? More money. So is \nit about helping those people who need our help or is there another \nagenda here?\n  I have great respect for Senator Kennedy. He is very eloquent on the \nfloor. But when you see his charts, there are false questions asked. He \nshowed the increase in the level of income in this country since we \nraised the minimum wage. It doesn't consider all of the other things \nthat have happened over the last 20 years that, through productivity \nincreases, have raised wages. Mandating a minimum wage in any market by \nany economist will not increase the market. That is not the reason. It \nlooks good on a chart. But you don't consider all of the other benefits \nand factors that might have considered that. You just say this must \nhave been it because it looks like it. I can show that on anything that \nwe do in the Senate.\n  Here is a chart for New York. The State of New York is another \nexample. The wage per-job average is $51,165. A single mom earning \nminimum wage under New York's level, which is at $7.15 right now, and \ntaking advantage of all of the benefits there, aftertax income is \n$49,000 a year in benefits. I am not saying cut the benefits; I am \nsaying don't do something that will cut the benefits to those people \nyou say you are going to help.\n  It is interesting when you look at this number, knowing that taxes--\nif you look at New York City's tax, you pay a city income tax, a State \nincome tax, and a Federal income tax. Those people making minimum wage \nhave more aftertax income in terms of benefits and salary than the \naverage household in New York City. We have to ask the question, do we \nwant to help people?\n  The Senator from Alabama talked about making sure that the earned \nincome tax credit comes as a part of your wage every month instead of \nat the end of the year. It is a great idea and ought to be something we \nwant to do. I want to show again what is going to happen to families \nearning the minimum wage in Oklahoma. There is a net loss of $232, but \nthat doesn't include the taxes. So the net loss for Oklahoma families \nwho are on minimum wage under the new minimum wage, in essence, will be \nabout $1,200. Is that what we want to do to Oklahoma and 18 other \nStates? I don't think so. We have to take the lid off of this pressure \ncooker. For us to pass a minimum wage that undermines the very people \nwe are saying we want to help does not, in the long run, do anything \nexcept help organized labor, 1; No. 2, it makes certain jobs go away; \nwe know it will, No. 3, send more jobs out of this country.\n  I believe and I hope the Senator from Massachusetts will look at our \ndata. I hope he will try to amend his bill in such a way so that we \nhave either a safe harbor or some other mechanism so the people in \nthese 19 States don't lose the very benefits we say we want to give to \nthem. In fact, that is what will happen if this bill passes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1277-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 4, Sec. 104, 95th Congress, 1st Session (1977)\n\n       (a)(1) There is established a Special Committee on Aging \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``special \n     committee'') which shall consist of nineteen Members. The \n     Members and chairman of the special committee shall be \n     appointed in the same manner and at the same time as the \n     Members and chairman of a standing committee of the Senate. \n     After the date on which the majority and minority Members of \n     the special committee are initially appointed on or affect \n     the effective date of title I of the Committee System \n     Reorganization Amendments of 1977, each time a vacancy occurs \n     in the Membership of the special committee, the number of \n     Members of the special committee shall be reduced by one \n     until the number of Members of the special committee consists \n     of nine Senators.\n       (2) For the purposes of paragraph 1 of rule XXV; paragraphs \n     1, 7(a)(1)-(2), 9, and 10(a) of rule XXVI; and paragraphs \n     1(a)-(d), and 2(a) and (d) of rule XXVII of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate; and the purposes of section 202(I) and \n     (j) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the \n     special committee shall be treated as a standing committee of \n     the Senate.\n       (b)(1) It shall be the duty of the special committee to \n     conduct a continuing study of any and all matters pertaining \n     to problems and opportunities of older people, including, but \n     not limited to, problems and opportunities of maintaining \n     health, of assuring adequate income, of finding employment, \n     of engaging in productive and rewarding activity, of securing \n     proper housing, and when necessary, of obtaining care or \n     assistance.

The chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each Member specifying the matter being polled and the \n     time limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so \n     requests in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held \n     for meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls, if the chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule II.3, the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential.

Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or \n     the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials shall be issued by the chairman, or by any other \n     Member of the committee designated by him. Prior to the \n     issuance of each subpoena, the ranking minority Member, and \n     any other Member so requesting, shall be notified regarding \n     the identity of the person to whom the subpoena will be \n     issued and the nature of the information sought, and its \n     relationship to the investigation.\n       3. Investigative Reports. All reports containing findings \n     or recommendations stemming from committee investigations \n     shall be printed only with the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the committee.\n\n\n                              V.

Counsel:\n       (a) A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be present \n     during his testimony at any public or closed hearing or \n     depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of his \n     rights, provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the \n     government, corporation, or association.\n       (b) A witness is unable for economic reasons to obtain \n     counsel may inform the committee at least 48 hours prior to \n     the witness's appearance, and it will endeavor to obtain \n     volunteer counsel for the witness. Such counsel shall be \n     subject solely to the control of the witness and not the \n     committee. Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       5. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     executive and public hearings. Any witness shall be afforded, \n     upon request, the right to review that portion of such \n     record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony \n     in public or closed session shall be provided to the witness. \n     Upon inspecting his transcript, within a time limit set by \n     the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in \n     testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical \n     errors, and obvious errors of fact, the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such request.\n       6. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his character or \n     adversely affect his reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     committee to testify in his own behalf; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he requests be used \n     for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by the \n     committee. The chairman shall inform the committee of such \n     requests for appearance or cross-examination. If the \n     committee so decides; the requested questions, or paraphrased \n     versions or portions of them, shall be put to the other \n     witness by a Member or by staff.\n       7. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the committee, the minority on the committee shall be \n     entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority \n     Members to the chairman, to call witnesses selected by the \n     minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration during at least one day \n     of the hearing. Such request must be made before the \n     completion of the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to \n     call the minority witnesses, no later than three days before \n     the completion of the hearing.\n       8. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a \n     manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere \n     with the orderly administration of such hearing the chairman \n     or presiding Member of the committee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n\n\n                    vi. depositions and commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness's failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule V.4.\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he may refer the matter to the committee or he may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member \n     of the committee.\n       4. Filing. The committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes, \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule V.6. \n     If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the staff shall \n     note on the transcript the date a copy was provided and the \n     failure to return it. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record to the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the committee clerk. \n     Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the committee regulating their use.\n\n\n                           vii. subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment. The committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     chairman of the full committee and the ranking minority \n     Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3. Rules. A subcommittee shall be governed by the committee \n     rules, except that its quorum for all business shall be one-\n     third of the subcommittee Membership, and for hearings shall \n     be one Member.\n\n\n                             viii. reports\n\n       Committee reports incorporating committee findings and \n     recommendations shall be printed only with the prior approval \n     of the committee, after an adequate period for review and \n     comment. The printing, as committee documents, of materials \n     prepared by staff for informational purposes, or the printing \n     of materials not originating with the committee or staff, \n     shall require prior consultation with the minority staff; \n     these publications shall have the following language printed \n     on the cover of the document: ``Note: This document has been \n     printed for informational purposes. It does not represent\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\n     either findings or recommendations formally adopted by the \n     committee.''\n\n\n                         ix. amendment of rules\n\n       The rules of the committee may be amended or revised at any \n     time, provided that not less than a majority of the committee \n     present so determine at a committee meeting preceded by at \n     least 3 days notice of the amendments or revisions proposed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1280-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Madam President, I regret that commitments in North \nDakota prevented me from voting on the nomination of David H. Petraeus \nto be promoted to the rank of General in the U.S. Army and to be \ncommander of Multinational Forces Iraq.\n  If present, I would have voted in favor of General Petraeus's \nnomination.\n  I believe General Petraeus is well-qualified to command in Iraq. He \nwas unanimously approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee because \nof his leadership skills and his operational experience. And he is \nwidely recognized as one of the military's top experts on \ncounterinsurgency operations.\n  He is an excellent choice to be entrusted with the operational \ncommand and welfare of over 130,000 American servicemembers who are in \nthe middle of a bloody sectarian battle over the future of Iraq. He is \nfamiliar with the situation in that country from his experiences as an \ninfantry division commander during and immediately after the invasion \nof Iraq, and from his tenure as the commander of U.S. efforts to train \nand equip Iraqi security forces. Altogether, he has served 27 months in \nIraq since the war began.\n  I was impressed by the fact that General Petraeus promised to \nregularly update Congress on whether the President's new plan in Iraq \nis working and on how much progress the Iraqi Government is making \ntoward assuming responsibility for security.\n  But my support for General Petraeus's nomination should not be taken \nas support for the President's decision to send additional soldiers and \nmarines to Iraq and to escalate our military involvement there.\n  I am very skeptical that the President's plan to send 21,500 \nadditional troops to Iraq is going to work.\n  I have listened to what President Bush and his advisers have said \nabout the subject, and I listened to what General Petreaus said during \nhis confirmation hearing. But I do not think they have adequately \nexplained away the Senate testimony given less than 2 months ago by \nGeneral Abizaid, the top commander of American troops in Iraq. In \nNovember General Abizaid said:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     corps commander, General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, ``In your professional opinion, if we were to bring \n     in more American troops now, does that add considerably to \n     our ability to achieve success in Iraq?'' And they all said \n     no. The reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It \n     is easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  Has that changed? Has something changed in 2 months? The question for \nus now is: Should American troops be in the middle of that civil war? \nShould we send additional troops to that circumstance? If so, for what \npurpose? And why the change only two months after General Abizaid said \nthe commanders do not believe additional troops will be effective?\n  That issue is going to be debated here in Congress in the coming \nweeks. All of us in that debate want to find the right solution for \nthis country to support our\n\n[[Page S1281]]\n\nsoldiers, make the right choices for them, and make the right judgments \nfor our country's long-term interests. I believe that sending General \nPetreaus to Iraq will help accomplish that. I wish him well and \nGodspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1281-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HELEN FENSKE\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, today I wish to honor Helen \nFenske, the grandmother of environmentalism in my great home State of \nNew Jersey. I join with New Jerseyeans and environmentalists everywhere \nin mourning her passing on January 19, 2007.\n  Helen was truly a pioneer in understanding the importance of \npreserving our environmental resources for future generations. Her \nactivism began in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Port \nAuthority of New York and New Jersey had plans to build a jetport on \nswampy land in Chatham Township, in Morris County, NJ. But not on Helen \nFenske's watch. Self-described as ``the little old lady in sneakers,'' \nshe understood that the swamp was a treasure--an environmentally \nsensitive area--and that a jetport would be an ecological disaster to \nthe region. With dogged determination, Helen Fenske mobilized a group \nof likeminded residents in the Green Village vicinity. In a grassroots \neffort that included raising money, creating awareness, and lobbying to \nretain this environmental resource, Helen Fenske managed to procure \nsubstantial acreage to be donated to the federal government. This \nacreage became the nucleus of the 7500 acre Great Swamp National \nWildlife Refuge--established by Congress in November 1960.\n  The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is, indeed, a treasure and \nwas the first refuge to receive national wilderness recognition--signed \ninto law by President Johnson in 1968. This was the culmination of \nHelen Fenske's efforts to save the Great Swamp. Thanks to Helen's \nperseverance and vision, today, one can walk on a boardwalk through \nvast portions of the swamp to enjoy the natural wildlife that inhabits \nit, including 244 species of birds, mammals such as red fox, coyote, \nbeaver, raccoons, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and many large oak \nand beech trees, and plants such as mountain laurel, mosses, and ferns.\n  But Helen Fenske's legend did not stop with the Great Swamp. She went \non to become an environmental advocate assuming key leadership \npositions in State government, as special assistant to the first \ncommissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, \nRichard Sullivan, and Assistant Commissioner for Natural and Historic \nResources. Her leadership became the inspiration for a myriad of \nconservation efforts, including the battle to save Sunfish Pond along \nthe Appalachian Trail at the Delaware Water Gap. She was additionally \nthe inspiration for the formation of the New Jersey Conservation \nFoundation and was involved with the Association of New Jersey \nEnvironmental Commissions, Patriot's Path, the Hudson River Walkway, \nthe Morris Parks and Land Conservancy, and the preservation of the \nHighlands along with many other efforts.\n  For her groundbreaking efforts as a champion of the environment, \nHelen Fenske was the deserving honoree of numerous awards, including \nthe Marcellus Hartley Dodge Award from the Great Swamp Watershed \nAssociation; a Congressional Citation for her work in saving the Great \nSwamp and the creation of the American Revolution Heritage Corridor; \nthe Achievement Award of the Washington Association; and honorary \ndegrees from Ramapo College and Drew University.\n  Even after she moved to New Hampshire, she remained in touch with her \nNew Jersey roots, always connected to her fight to preserve the Great \nSwamp and its environs. She died in New Hampshire, but left a living \nlegacy in New Jersey. She will be greatly missed, but the legacy of the \n``old lady in sneakers'' has been passed on to a new generation of \nenvironmentalists who have taken on her very important mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1281-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1281-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1281-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1281-S1283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-491.

A bill for the relief of Denes Fulop and Gyorgyi Fulop; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today a private immigration \nrelief bill to provide lawful permanent residence status to Denes and \nGyorgyi Fulop, Hungarian nationals who have lived in California for \nmore than 20 years. The Fulops are the parents of six U.S. citizen \nchildren. Today, they face deportation having exhausted all \nadministrative remedies under our immigration system.\n  The Fulop's story is a compelling one and one which I believe merits \nCongress' consideration for humanitarian relief.\n  The most poignant tragedy to affect this family occurred in May of \n2000, when the Fulops eldest child, Robert ``Bobby'' Fulop, an \naccomplished 15 year-old teenager, died suddenly of a heart aneurism. \nBobby was considered the shining star of his family.\n  That same year their six-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was diagnosed \nwith moderate pulmonary stenosis, a potentially life-threatening heart \ncondition and a frightening situation similar to Bobby's. Not long ago, \nshe successfully underwent heart surgery, but. requires medical \nsupervision to ensure her good health.\n  The Fulop's youngest child, Matthew, was born seven weeks premature. \nHe subsequently underwent several kidney surgeries and is still being \nclosely monitored by physicians.\n  Compounding these tragedies is the fact that today the Fulops face \ndeportation. They face deportation, in part, because in 1995 the family \ntraveled to Hungary and remained there for more than 90 days.\n  Under the pre-1996 immigration law, prior to the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, their stay in Hungary \nwould not have been a factor in their immigration case and they would \nhave been eligible for adjustment of status to lawful permanent \nresidents.\n  Indeed, in 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Fulop applied to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) for permanent resident status. Due to \nlarge backlogs, the INS did not interview them until 1998. By the time \ntheir applications were considered, the new 1996 immigration law had \ntaken effect. Given their one-time 90 day trip outside the United \nStates, they were statutorily ineligible for relief pursuant to the \ncancellation of removal provisions of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct.\n  One cannot help but conclude that had the INS acted on the Fulop's \napplication for relief from deportation in a timelier manner, they \nwould have qualified for suspension of deportation under the pre-1996 \nlaw, given that they were long-term residents of the United States with \nU.S. citizen children and many positive factors in their favor.\n  The irony of this situation is that the Fulops were gone from the \nUnited States for nearly five months in 1995 because they traveled to \nHungary to help Mr. Fulop's brother build his home. Mr. Fulop's brother \nis handicapped and they went to help remodel his home.\n  The Fulops are good and decent people. Mr. Fulop is a masonry \ncontractor and the owner and president of his own construction \ncompany--Sumeg International. He has owned this business for 12 years \nand currently has three full-time employees.\n  The couple is active in their church and community. As Pastor Peter \nPetrovic of the Apostolic Christian Church of San Diego says in his \nletter of support, ``[t]he family is an exceptional asset to their \ncommunity.'' Mrs. Fulop has served as a Sunday school teacher and \nvolunteers regularly at Heritage K-8 Charter School in Escondido. Mrs. \nMorris, a Heritage K-8 Charter School faculty member says in her letter \nof support that Mrs. Fulop is ``. . . a valuable asset to our school \nand community.''\n  This is a tragic situation. Essentially, as happened to many families \nunder the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996, the rules of the game were changed in the middle. When the \nFulops applied for relief from deportation they were eligible for \nsuspension of deportation. By the time the INS got around to their \napplication, nearly three years later, they were no longer eligible and \nin fact suspension of deportation as a form of relief ceased to exist.\n  The Fulops today have been in the United States since the early \n1980s. Most harmful is the effect that their deportation will have on \nthe children, all of whom were born here and who range from three years \nold to 19 years of age. Their eldest, Dennis, is a 4.0 honor student at \nPalomar Community College. His sister, Linda, has a 3.8 grade point \naverage, is an honor student in high school, and is also taking one \nclass at Palomar Community College.\n  It is my hope that Congress sees fit to provide an opportunity for \nthis family to remain together in the United States given their many \nyears here, the profound sadness they have already experienced and the \nharm that would come from their deportation to their six U.S. citizen \nchildren.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the three letters of community support \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Apostolic Christian Church\n\n\n                                                 of San Diego,\n\n                                 Escondido, CA, December 28, 2006.\n     Re The Denes Fulop Family.\n\n       To Whom It May Concern: My family and I have known Denes \n     and Joy Fulop for many year. They have been members in good \n     standing in our church for approximately 20 years. Denes has \n     served the congregation faithfully in many capacities. He was \n     a building committee member during the construction of our \n     church 10 years ago. He also served as church treasurer for \n     four years and Sunday School Superintendent for many years. \n     Presently he is a member on the board of trustees.\n       Joy Fulop was a building sub-committee member during the \n     construction of the church and also served for a few years as \n     a Sunday school teacher. Joy is a devoted and committed \n     homemaker, and a wonderful example of a loving mother and \n     wife. Their three younger children, Elizabeth, Sarah and \n     Abigail are actively involved in Sunday school and in various \n     youth group activities. The two oldest, Denny and Linda, are \n     also active in the church. Linda is currently a Sunday school \n     teacher for 2nd to 5th grade children. Linda and Denny are \n     very diligent and excellent students in High School and \n     College and are outstanding citizens.\n       The family is an exceptional asset to their community. \n     Denes has been self-employed for many years and is a \n     knowledgeable and\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\n     successful contractor. Their family has never depended on any \n     government aid, but rather contributes and shares their \n     blessings with others. Denes, Joy, and their six children are \n     truly an asset to our church and community.\n       Should you have any further questions, please don't \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                   Peter Petrovic,\n     Pastor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 29, 2006.\n       To Whom It May Concern: The purpose of this letter is to \n     describe our relationship with the Fulop family over the five \n     years when they became our neighbors.\n       Dennis Fulop, a contractor, appears to be a very hard \n     working man, carrying out the responsibilities of owning his \n     business plus carrying out responsibilities at home for his \n     wife and six children. I've come to know that Joy, Mrs. \n     Fulop, spends every free minute taking care of the family, \n     home, and involving herself in church and school activities. \n     We have found them to be excellent neighbors, kind, \n     thoughtful, and ready to carry out any favor we may have.\n       The six children have been wonderful to see grow up over \n     the last several years. They excel in school, are well-\n     mannered, church going, involved in church ministry, and very \n     polite on every occasion.\n       Our family finds itself fortunate to have a congenial and \n     honest family living next door. It is rare to find such a \n     quality family.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Elizabeth Brandstater Shaw.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  R. Rimmer Construction Inc.,\n\n                                     Cardiff, CA, January 3, 2007.\n       To Whom It May Concern:\n       The purpose of this letter is to describe my relationship \n     with Dennis Fulop whom I have known for approximately twenty-\n     four years.\n       As a building contractor in the San Diego area I have been \n     fortunate to have worked with Dennis for most of those years. \n     He has constructed nearly all of the foundations for the room \n     additions and new houses that I have built. Dennis has also \n     constructed most of the driveways, sidewalks, retaining \n     walls, fireplaces and masonry on my projects. He has also \n     attended to much of my finish grading, drainage and backhoe \n     construction needs.\n       Dennis has long been an invaluable member of my \n     construction ``team``. He is very knowledgeable in nearly all \n     construction matters. He has always been very reliable and \n     responsible in meeting deadlines and upholding high standards \n     of construction quality.\n       Dennis is also a very successful small business owner. He \n     has his own credit accounts with all of the necessary \n     construction suppliers and to my knowledge has always paid \n     his bills in a timely manner. In fact, I have never been \n     contacted or liened by any of his suppliers to date. Dennis \n     is also very proficient at managing and providing work for \n     his employees.\n       Dennis' wife Joy is a dedicated wife and mother to their \n     six children. She is also actively involved in their church, \n     the Apostolic Christian Church of Escendido.\n       I am thankful to know the Fulops on a personal level as \n     well. They have graciously invited me and my family to \n     several family and holiday festivities over the years. We \n     always look forward to getting together with the Fulops and \n     other members of their church.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ron Rimmer,\n                            President, R. Rimmer Construction Inc.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 417. A bill for the relief of Claudia Marquez Rico; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Claudia \nMarquez Rico, a Mexican national living in Redwood City, CA.\n  Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Claudia was brought to the United States by \nher parents 16 years ago. Claudia was just 6 years old at the time. She \nhas two younger brothers, Jose and Omar, who came to America with her, \nand a sister, Maribel, who was born in California and is a U.S. \nCitizen. America is the only home they know.\n  Six years ago that home was visited by tragedy. As Mr. and Mrs. \nMarquez were driving to work early on the morning of October 4, 2000, \nthey were both killed in a horrible traffic accident when their car \ncollided with a truck on an isolated rural road.\n  The children went to live with their aunt and uncle, Hortencia and \nPatricio Alcala. The Alcalas are a generous and loving couple. They are \nU.S. citizens with two children of their own. They took the Marquez \nchildren in and did all they could to comfort them in their grief. They \nsupervised their schooling, and made sure they received the counseling \nthey needed, too. The family is active in their parish at Buen Pastor \nCatholic Church, and Patricio Alcala serves as a youth soccer coach. In \n2001, the Alcalas were appointed the legal guardians of the Marquez \nchildren.\n  Sadly, the Marquez family received bad legal representation. At the \ntime of their parents' death, Claudia and Jose were minors, and \nqualified for special immigrant juvenile status. This category was \nenacted by Congress to protect children like them from the hardship \nthat would result from deportation under such extraordinary \ncircumstances, when a State court deems them to be dependents due to \nabuse, abandonment or neglect. Today, their younger brother Omar is on \ntrack to lawful permanent residence status as a special immigrant \njuvenile. Unfortunately, the family's previous lawyer failed to secure \nthis relief for Claudia, and she has now reached the age of majority \nwithout having resolved her immigration status.\n  I should note that their former lawyer, Walter Pineda, is currently \nanswering charges on 29 counts of professional incompetence and 5 \ncounts of moral turpitude for mishandling immigration cases and appears \non his way to being disbarred.\n  I am offering legislation on Claudia's behalf because I believe that, \nwithout it, this family would endure an immense and unfair hardship. \nIndeed, without this legislation, this family will not remain a family \nfor much longer.\n  Despite the adversity they encountered, Claudia and Jose finished \nschool and now work together in a pet grooming store in Redwood City, \nwhere Claudia is the store manager. They support themselves, and they \nare dedicated to their community and devoted to their family. In fact, \nlast year Claudia became the legal guardian of her 14-year-old sister \nMaribel, who lives with her and Jose at their home in Redwood City. \nOmar, now 17 years old, continues to live with the Alcalas so as not to \ninterrupt his studies at Aragon High School in San Mateo. Again, \nMaribel is a U.S. citizen, and Omar is eligible for a green card.\n\n  Claudia has no close relatives in Mexico. She has never visited \nMexico, and she was so young when she was brought to America that she \nhas no memories of it. How can we expect her to start a new life there \nnow?\n  It would be a grave injustice to add to this family's misfortune by \ntearing these siblings apart. This is a close family, and they have \ncome to rely on each other heavily in the absence of their deceased \nparents. This bill will prevent the added tragedy of another wrenching \nseparation.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Claudia Rico.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 418, A bill for the relief of Shigeru Yamada; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Shigeru \nYamada, a 24-year-old Japanese national who lives in Chula Vista, CA.\n  I have decided to re-introduce a private bill on his behalf because I \nbelieve that Mr. Yamada represents a model American citizen, for whom \nremoval from this country would represent an unfair hardship. Without \nthis legislation, Mr. Yamada will be forced to return to a country in \nwhich he lacks any linguistic, cultural or family ties.\n  Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two \nsisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. \nYamada's alcoholic father, who had been physically abusive to his \nmother, the children and even his own parents. Since then, he has had \nno contact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive. \nTragically, Mr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother was \nkilled in a car crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13, Mr. Yamada \nspent time living with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to live \nwith a close friend of his late mother.\n  The death of his mother marked more than a personal tragedy for Mr. \nYamada; it also served to impede the process for him to legalize his \nstatus. At the time of her death, Mr. Yamada's family was living \nlegally in the United States. His mother had acquired a student visa \nfor herself and her children qualified as her dependants. Her death \nrevoked his legal status in the United States. In addition, Mr. \nYamada's\n\n[[Page S1287]]\n\nmother was engaged to an American citizen at the time of her death. Had \nshe survived, her son would likely have become an American citizen \nthrough this marriage.\n  Mr. Yamada has exhausted all administrative options under our current \nimmigration system. Throughout high school, he contacted attorneys in \nthe hopes of legalizing his status, but his attempts were unsuccessful. \nUnfortunately, time has run out and, for Mr. Yamada, the only option \navailable to him today is private relief legislation.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for Mr. Yamada to be deported \nfrom the United States and forced to return to Japan.\n  First, since arriving in the United States, Mr. Yamada has lived as a \nmodel American. He graduated with honors from Eastlake High School in \n2000, where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Academically, \nhe earned a number of awards including being named an Outstanding \nEnglish Student his freshman year, an All-American Scholar, and earning \nthe United States National Minority Leadership Award. His teacher and \ncoach, Mr. John describes him as being responsible, hard working, \norganized, honest, caring and very dependable. His role as the Vice-\nPresident of the Associated Student Body his senior year is an \nindication of Mr. Yamada's high level of leadership, as well as, his \npopularity and trustworthiness among his peers. As an athlete, Mr. \nYamada was named the Most Inspirational Player of the Year in Junior \nVarsity baseball and football, as well as, Varsity football. His \nfootball coach, Mr. Jose Mendoza, expressed his admiration by saying \nthat he has seen in Shigeru Yamada the responsibility, dedication and \nloyalty that the average American holds to be virtuous.\n  Second, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as a local volunteer. As \na member of the Eastlake High School Link Crew, he helped freshman find \ntheir way around campus, offered tutoring and mentoring services, and \nset an example of how to be a successful member of the student body. \nAfter graduating from high school, he volunteered his time for four \nyears as the coach of the Eastlake High School Girl's softball team. \nThe former head coach, who has since retired, Dr. Charles Sorge, \ndescribes him as an individual full of integrity who understands that \nas a coach it is important to work as a team player. His level of \ncommitment to the team was further illustrated to Dr. Sorge when he \ndiscovered, halfway through the season, that Mr. Yamada's commute to \nand from practice was two hours long each way. It takes an individual \nwith character to volunteer his time to coach and never bring up the \nissue of how long his commute takes him each day. Dr. Sorge hopes that, \nonce Mr. Yamada legalizes his immigration status, he will be formally \nhired to continue coaching the team.\n  Third, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would be an immense hardship \nfor him and his family here. Mr. Yamada does not speak Japanese. He is \nunaware of the nation's current cultural trends. And, he has no \nimmediate family members that he knows of in Japan. Currently, both of \nhis sisters are in the process of legalizing their immigration status \nin the United States. His older sister is married to a United States \ncitizen and his younger sister is being adopted by a maternal aunt, who \nis a United States citizen. Since as all of his family lives in \nCalifornia, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would serve to split his \nfamily apart and separate him from everyone and everything that he \nknows. His sister contends that her younger brother would be lost if he \nhad to return to live in Japan on his own. It is unlikely that he would \nbe able to find any gainful employment in Japan due to his inability to \nspeak or read the language.\n\n  As a member of the Chula Vista community, Mr. Yamada has \ndistinguished himself as an honorable individual. His teacher, Mr. \nRobert Hughes, describes him as being an upstanding All-American young \nman. Until being picked up during a routine check of riders' \nimmigration status on a city bus, he had never been arrested or \nconvicted of any crime. Mr. Yamada is not, and has never been, a burden \non the State. He has never received any Federal or State assistance.\n  Currently, Mr. Yamada holds sophomore status at Southwestern \nCommunity College. However, he is taking this semester off in order to \nalleviate his financial burdens by working full time. He had hoped to \npursue a career in law enforcement, but his plans have recently changed \ndue to his current immigration status dilemma. Until he obtains \ncitizenship, Mr. Yamada will be prohibited from pursuing a career in \nlaw enforcement. Due to the circumstances, Mr. Yamada has changed his \ncareer goal to that of becoming a high school teacher. Mr. Yamada's \ncommitment to his education is admirable. He could have easily taken a \ndifferent path but, through his own individual fortitude, he has \ndedicated himself to his studies so that he can live a better life.\n  With his hard work and giving attitude, Shigeru Yamada represents the \nideal American citizen. Although born in Japan, he is truly American in \nevery other sense. I ask you to help right a wrong and grant Mr. Yamada \nlawful permanent resident status so that he can continue towards his \nbright future.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Mr. Yamada.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the three letters of community \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Eastlake High School,\n\n                         Chula Vista, California, January 9, 2007.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am more than happy to write this \n     letter on behalf of Shigeru Yamada as he pursues his efforts \n     to stay in the United States. I was Shigeru's counselor while \n     he attended Eastlake High School. During that time he always \n     displayed exemplary behavior, academic focus, and personal \n     determination.\n       Academically Shigeru was a model student. He earned a 3.84 \n     grade point average; he made the National Honor Roll and was \n     nominated to Who's Who Among High School Students for three \n     straight years. Shigeru plans to attend a university to study \n     sports medicine and physical therapy so he has set high goals \n     for himself. He has the ability to not only handle college-\n     level work, but to thrive on the challenge the university \n     will bring. His quiet determination has been an example to \n     his peers and was a joy to his instructors.\n       Shigeru Yamada not only took the most from his high school \n     experience, but he has consistently ``given back'' his \n     talents, time, and effort to serve the school community. He \n     was elected ASB vice-president during his senior year. He \n     demonstrated leadership skills as president of the Inter-Club \n     Council on campus; he mentored incoming ninth-grade students \n     and worked on numerous service projects. In addition to his \n     involvement in student government, Shigeru participated in \n     football, baseball, and wrestling. He was named '''Most \n     Inspirational Player of the Year'' for both his junior \n     varsity baseball and football teams. He was also awarded the \n     J.T. Franks Memorial Award (most inspirational) from the \n     varsity football team. (This award carries a great deal of \n     respect amongst the players as it is named after a teammate \n     who died of cancer.) Shigeru was a role model for our \n     students when he attended our school: He earned good grades; \n     he was an athlete; and he was involved in a variety of \n     additional activities. He is the kind of student that \n     Eastlake High School has been proud to have.\n       A further testimony to Shigeru's character is what he has \n     been doing since graduating. This young man has come back to \n     serve as an assistant football and wrestling coach for our \n     students. He has given his time and energy to working with \n     individual students during the week and on weekends; he has \n     not only advised them on how to improve their athletic \n     skills, but he has also been a wonderful role model and \n     mentor. He is someone to whom the young men can relate, a \n     person whose opinions are valued. I have personally seen \n     Shigeru interact with these boys; the respect he gives them \n     and the respect they give Shigeru is an absolute indication \n     of the positive influence he has in their lives.\n       * * *\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Word & Brown,\n\n                                  San Diego, CA, January 17, 2007.\n     To Whom It May Concern:\n       For over 11 years now Shigeru Yamada has been my best \n     friend. His presence in my life has been a blessing. From the \n     very first moment I met him I knew that he was a special \n     person destined to impact positively everyone's lives around \n     him. His ability to see the silver lining even around the \n     darkest rain cloud is amazing to me. As a student Shigeru was \n     amongst the best and brightest. He was a California \n     Scholarship Federation Scholar every semester, he was Spanish \n     student of the year two years in a row, and he served as \n     Associated Student Body Vice-President his senior year. As an \n     athlete, Shigeru was a varsity letterman in Football, \n     Wrestling,\n\n[[Page S1288]]\n\n     and Track and Field. He also served as a team captain on the \n     Football team. As a member of the community, Shigeru has \n     donated of his time freely coaching the Eastlake High \n     Softball team and Eastlake High football team. His ability to \n     give so much and ask for so little in return is an \n     inspiration to all around him. For the last few years Shigeru \n     has been able to legally work in this country. In those few \n     years Shigeru has risen to the top sales levels at \n     Nordstrom's department store and was even promoted to \n     assistant manager. In every aspect and in every arena in \n     which Shigeru has been in he has always excelled. He \n     exemplifies that which makes this country great; bravery, \n     honesty, hard work. In this time of change and uncertainty \n     people like Shigeru Yamada remind me what it is that makes \n     this country of ours work. His pursuit of life, liberty, and \n     happiness has been a difficult one but he has never stopped \n     believing and working towards that goal. I respectfully \n     request that you once again push for Shigeru Yamada to be \n     granted full legal status in this great country of ours.\n     Pedro Miguel Reyes.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 11, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to you from San Diego, \n     CA on behalf of my friend Shigera Yamada's life-long quest \n     for American citizenship.\n       I have known Shiggy as a fellow associate, as his manager, \n     as a confidante, and most importantly as a friend. Shiggy is \n     kind, honest, funny, giving, and intelligent. He is the type \n     of person who will pick you up no matter how out of his way \n     it is, bring you breakfast when you are sick, or just listen \n     to you when you need to talk.\n       One of the qualities I admire most about Shiggy is his \n     never-ending positive attitude. For the past two years that I \n     have known him, I have never heard him complain about his \n     situation. While going to school, working overtime, and \n     standing in as a father figure for his baby sister, he was \n     always there for me whenever I needed him. He has overcome so \n     many obstacles in his life that have only made him stronger.\n       Shiggy is a model citizen who has worked extremely hard to \n     get to where he is today. I am grateful for the chance to \n     have befriended Shiggy. He is one of the most respectful and \n     professional people I have ever met and had the chance to \n     work with. I know that he does not take a single thing in his \n     life for granted, and will continue to realize his goals \n     through hard work.\n       Our country would be lucky to acquire his high caliber of \n     determination, positive attitude, and perseverance as a \n     citizen. I admire his ability to use the curveballs life \n     throws his way as nothing less than learning experiences, and \n     highly recommend him for United States citizenship.\n       Thank You,\n                                            Sara Chaffee-Standish.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 419. A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria \nElna Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private immigration \nrelief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to \nEsidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana \nArreola and Cindy Jael Arreola, Mexican nationals living in the Fresno \narea of California.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Arreola have lived in the United States for over 20 \nyears. Two of their five children, Nayely, age 20, and Cindy, age 18, \nalso stand to benefit from this legislation. Their other three \nchildren, Roberto, age 15, Daniel, age 11, and Saray, age 9, are United \nStates citizens. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Arreola and their two eldest \nchildren face deportation.\n  The story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  The Arreolas are in this uncertain situation in part because of \ngrievous errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been \ndisbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it \ncompelled an immigration judge to write the Executive Office of \nImmigration Review seeking his disbarment for the disservice he caused \nhis immigration clients.\n  Mr. Arreola has lived in the United States since 1986. He was an \nagricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several \nyears, and as such would have been eligible for permanent residence \nthrough the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) program, had he known \nabout it.\n  Mrs. Arreola was living in the United States at the time she became \npregnant with her daughter Cindy, but returned to Mexico to give birth \nso as to avoid any problems with the Immigration and Naturalization \nService.\n  Given the length of time that the Arreolas had, and have been, in the \nUnited States it is quite likely that they would have qualified for \nrelief from deportation pursuant to the cancellation of removal \nprovisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but for the conduct \nof their previous attorney.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family \nto remain in the United States is the devastating impact their \ndeportation would have on their children--three of whom are U.S. \ncitizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since \nthey were toddlers. For these children, this country is the only \ncountry they really know.\n  Nayely, the oldest, is a junior at Fresno Pacific University. She was \nthe first in her family to graduate from high school and the first to \nattend college. She attends Fresno Pacific University, a regionally \nranked university, on a full tuition scholarship package and works \npart-time in the admissions office. She is majoring in international \nbusiness.\n  At her young age, Nayely has demonstrated a strong commitment to the \nideals of citizenship in her adopted country. She has worked hard to \nachieve her full potential both in her academic endeavors and through \nthe service she provides her community. As the Associate Dean of \nEnrollment Services, Cary Templeton, at Fresno Pacific University \nstates in a letter of support, ``[t]he leaders of Fresno Pacific \nUniversity saw in Nayely, a young person who will become exemplary of \nall that is good in the American dream.''\n  In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual \nDetermination (AVID), a college preparatory program in which students \ncommit to determining their own futures through achieving a college \ndegree. Nayely was also president of the Key Club, a community service \norganization. She helped mentor freshmen and participates in several \nother student organizations in her school. Perhaps the greatest \nhardship to this family, if forced to return to Mexico, will be her \nlost opportunity to realize her dreams and further contribute to her \ncommunity and to this country.\n  It is clear to me that Nayely feels a strong sense of responsibility \nfor her community and country. By all indication, this is the case as \nwell for all of the members of her family.\n  The Arreolas also have other family who are lawful permanent \nresidents of this country or United States citizens. Mrs. Arreola has \nthree brothers who are U.S. citizens and Mr. Arreola has a sister who \nis a U.S. citizen. It is also my understanding that they have no \nimmediate family in Mexico.\n  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any \nproblems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their \ntaxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked \nhard to support themselves. As I previously mentioned, Mr. Arreola was \npreviously employed as a farm worker, but now has his own business \nrepairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to \nenable him to purchase a home for his family.\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have \nintroduced today will enable the Arreolas to continue to make \nsignificant contributions to their community as well as the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill. I \nask unanimous consent that eight letters of community support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  January 2, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Dianne Feinstein. I Maria Esthela Garay would \n     like to let you know that Nayely Arreola was my student at \n     the beginnings of January 1989. It was my pleasure to meet \n     and have her as my student. She was very obedient and nice. \n     Nayely was always a very organized girl, and respected the \n     rules of the class. She also always finished the class work \n     since she was in preschool.

The Arreola Family are very good \n     friends of mine. They participate in the church that I also \n     attend. Isidro Arreola is a very hard workingman and has his \n     own business from home. Mr. and Mrs. Arreola bring up their \n     children a in a good Christian environment. They are a great \n     example in their church and the community. They are elders in \n     their church and are considered leaders. They always go an \n     extra mile than what is asked of them. Their children try \n     very hard in accomplishing their dreams and goals. It is a \n     privilege to know this family and would not hesitate to speak \n     up for them in any situation. This family is very honest and \n     loving.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roquel Garza.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Maria Gonzalez,\n\n                                 Porterville, CA, January 2, 2007.\n     Re Arreola Family.\n       Dear Dianne Feinstein: I have known the Arreola family for \n     5-6 years. I used to work with Maria Elena Arreola and are \n     delighted to have ever met her and her family.\n       This family is a great example to fellow community members. \n     They are a good Christian family that set good examples to \n     others. Isidro Arreola is a very hard working man repairing \n     appliances. We attend the same church and they are leaders in \n     the church. They demonstrate many Godly traditions and \n     beliefs. They are a great family to know and have nearby. \n     Their children are very studious in school and are always \n     eager to become better. We are all very proud of their oldest \n     daughter that attends the University and accomplishes her \n     dreams.\n           Sincerely,\n     Maria Gonzalez.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  January 1, 2007.\n     Re Arreola Family\n\n       Dear Dianne Feinstein: The Arreola Family are very active \n     in their church and Mr. Isidro Arreola is a very hard working \n     man. They do what they can to bring up their children in a \n     positive environment. I can seriously say that they are a \n     very good family wanting the best for their children.

It has been \n     my profound comfort and pleasure to have known this family \n     for many years. I have found them to be bright, well \n     organized, self sufficient people.\n       Seldom have I met a family with more social integrity. \n     Their togetherness, respect and appreciation for one another \n     can not go unnoted.\n       Their degree of civility is not only noticed in their \n     church but in their community and in their institutions of \n     learning. They are gracious, honest people who have, by their \n     own initiative, earned the right to human freedom and \n     dignity.\n       The above statement is based on humanitarian observances \n     and has little to do with the political movements dealing \n     with immigration.\n       I am interested in the wellbeing of the Arreola family in \n     its entirety.\n       I do not believe that it would be prudent for the State of \n     California to make any disruptive moves effecting the life \n     style of the Arreola family.\n       Senator Feinstein, I am asking you to consider the unique \n     role in which this family plays in the wellbeing of the State \n     of California.\n       The family consists of: Mother, MariaElaina, Father, \n     Esidronio, Children, Nayely and Cindy, Children, (already \n     citizens), Roberto, Daniel, Saray.\n           Thank You,\n                                           Mr. Lynn Morgan McLean,\n     Retired Educator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Porterville, CA.\n\n     Ms. Diane Feinstein \n     Regards: Areola Family\n       Dear Ms. Feinstein: Pursuant to the case of the Areola \n     family, I would like to take this opportunity to give my \n     highest and best recommendation on behalf of my family and \n     myself. We had the pleasure of meeting this wonderful family \n     through Christian Services. They have proved to be a very \n     respectful family with strong principles and that of \n     accomplishing many goals that will prepare them for their \n     future.\n       I am a business owner, therefore I am very careful about \n     making any types of recommendations or references on behalf \n     of my family, myself and our family owned business. This \n     family, however, is very special to many, including our \n     congregation and community.\n       Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my letter. \n     If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.\n           Respectfully,\n     Patricia Esquivel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  January 2, 2007.\n       Senator Diane Feinstein Greetings: The present letter I am \n     writing to you is to recommend Nayely Arreola. I know Nayely \n     since she was 8 years old. At that age she was my best \n     student in Sunday school class, always eager to learn God's \n     Word. She was a very smart child and demonstrated good \n     behavior among her fellow students treating them with \n     kindness and respect.\n       As a young lady Nayely developed very fine manners. I \n     always remember her coming out from one of the classrooms at \n     Granite Hills High School were I used to work as custodian, \n     She always greets me with a broad smile and a big hug; not \n     caring if I was sweaty and dirty.\n       Moreover, my husband and I, know her parents very well. We \n     attend the same Christian church regularly, where I am \n     pleased to see Nayely when she is in town. We all have had a \n     good friendship through all these years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Maria Ochoa.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 420. A bill for the relief of Jacqueline W. Coats; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jacqueline \nCoats, a 26-year old widow currently living in San Francisco.\n  Mrs. Coats came to the U.S. in 2001 from Kenya on a student visa to \nstudy Mass Communications at San Jose State University. Her visa status \nlapsed in 2003, and the Department of Homeland Security began \ndeportation proceedings against her.\n  Mrs. Coats married Marlin Coats on April 17, 2006, after dating for \nseveral years. The couple was happily married and planning to start a \nfamily when, on May 13, Mr. Coats tragically died in a heroic attempt \nto save two young boys from drowning.\n  The couple had been on a Mother's Day outing at Ocean Beach with some \nof Mr. Coats' nephews when they heard cries for help. Having worked as \na lifeguard in the past, Mr. Coats instinctively dove into the water. \nThe two children were saved with the help of a rescue crew, but Mr. \nCoats, caught in a riptide, died. Mrs. Coats received a medal honoring \nher husband.\n  Four days before Mr. Coats' death, the couple prepared and signed an \napplication for a green card at their attorney's office. Unfortunately \nthe petition was not filed until after his death, rendering it invalid. \nMrs. Coats currently has a hearing before an immigration judge in San \nFrancisco on August 24, but her attorney has informed my staff that she \nhas no relief available to her and will be ordered deported.\n  Mrs. Coats, devastated by the loss of her husband, is now caught in a \nbattle for her right to stay in America. At a recent news conference \nwith her lawyer, Thip Ark, she explained of her situation, ``I feel \nlike I have nothing to live for. I have nothing to go home to . . . \nI've been here four years . . . It would be like starting a new life.''\n  Ms. Ark explains that Mrs. Coats is extremely close with her late \nhusband's family, with whom she lives in San Leandro, CA. Mrs. Coats \nhas said that her husband's large family has become her own. Ramona \nBurton of San Francisco, one of Marlin Coats' seven brothers and \nsisters explains, ``She spent her first American Christmas with us, her \nfirst American Thanksgiving . . . I can't imagine looking around and \nnot seeing her there. She needs to be there.''\n  The San Francisco and Bay Area community is rallying strong support \nfor Mrs. Coats. The San Francisco chapters of the NAACP, the San \nFrancisco Board of Supervisors, and the San Francisco Police \nDepartment, have all\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\npassed resolutions in support of Mrs. Coats' right to remain in the \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, this \nyoung woman, and the Coats family, will face yet another disorienting \nand heartbreaking tragedy. Mrs. Coats will be deported to Kenya, a \ncountry she has not lived in since she was 21. In her time of grieving, \nshe will be forced to leave her home, her job with AC Transit, her new \nfamily, and everything she has known for the past 5 years.\n  I cannot think of a compelling reason why the United States should \nnot allow this young widow to continue the green card process. Had her \nhusband lived, Mrs. Coats would have filed the papers without \ndifficulty. It was because of her husband's selfless and heroic act \nthat Mrs. Coats must now struggle to remain in the country. As one \nconcerned California constituent wrote to me, ``If ever there was a \ncase where common fairness, morality and decency should reign over \nlegal technicalities, this is it. We, as a country, need to reward \nheroism and good.''\n  I believe that we can reward the late Mr. Coats for his noble actions \nby granting his wife citizenship. It is what he intended for her. It \ncan even be argued that a green card for his wife was one of his dying \nwishes, as the papers were signed just 4 days prior to his death.\n  For these reasons, I offer this private relief immigration bill and \nask my colleagues to support it on behalf of Mrs. Coats.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that two letters of support be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Judge,\n       This woman's husband sacrificed his life to save mine! They \n     didn't get any type of award, or gift instead they got more \n     of a punishment. Marlon Coates died and the wife is now a \n     widow, when they just got married, she deserves some mercy, \n     and a little consideration for her. She should stay in the \n     country, she just got here she has bonded with Marlon's \n     family, she gotten to know everyone. Please let her stay she \n     really deserves it please!!\n       My Name is Chance Goss I'm 11 Love to design and go on \n     roller coasters, paint, do art. I think it means compassion I \n     think its heroic and wonderful. The incident made me think \n     before doing don't!!!\n                                  ____\n\n       Life is a very precious thing. When lost, it is very \n     nostalgic to everyone. Not only is it a tragic thing, but it \n     also affects the people around that are still living. I'm \n     greatly traumatized by this whole quandary.\n       There happens to be a fine line between deaths by a bullet \n     through the head of various thugs than deaths of heroes.\n       They don't hurt the same. People are saved everyday and you \n     must wonder why Marlon? He transpired to be loved by \n     everyone. He was a former lifeguard, and he saw my brother \n     out in the water.\n       A real hero will do what Marlon did. He ran to the bone-\n     chilling river, knowing that he might breathe his last \n     breath. He knew that he might not be able to save him. He \n     knew that might be the last time he saw his wife again.\n       He took this into account and dove into the water.\n       His wife is now crying, because she may face deportation \n     after losing the only love in her life other than God. You \n     must ask yourselves, is this fair? Marlon was her ticket in \n     this country and he has deceased.\n       There should be no question of whether she should stay or \n     not! She will never see him again. But emotionally they are \n     still together, because in my mind, marriage is not until \n     death do us part! His soul is still with her, in her heart, \n     Let me conclude with me saying let her stay!!!\n       With God and Jesus giving you hope,\n       Nate Ewing--Adria's son\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 421. A bill for the relief of Robert Liang and Alice Liang; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Robert Kuan \nLiang and his wife, Chun-Mei ``Alice'' Hsu-Liang, foreign nationals who \nlive in San Bruno, CA.\n  I have decided to offer private relief immigration bills on their \nbehalf because I believe that, without it, this hardworking couple and \ntheir three United States citizen children would endure an immense and \nunfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family may not \nremain a family for much longer.\n  The Liangs are foreign nationals facing deportation on account of \ntheir overstay of visitors visas and the failure of their previous \nattorney to timely file a suspension of deportation application before \nthe immigration laws changed in 1996.\n  Mr. Liang is a foreign national and refugee from Laos. His wife is a \ncitizen of Taiwan. They entered the United States 24 years ago as \ntourists and established residency in the San Bruno, CA. Because they \noverstayed the terms of their temporary visas, they now face \ndeportation from the United States.\n  After living here for so many years, removal from the United States \nwould not come easily or perhaps without tearing this family apart. The \nLiangs have three children born in this country: Wesley, 15 years old, \nBruce, 12 years old, and Eva, 9 years old. Young Wesley suffers from \nasthma and has a history of social and emotional anxiety.\n  The immigration judge who presided over the Liang's case in 1997 \nconcluded that there was no question that the Liang children would be \nadversely impacted if they were required to leave their relatives and \nfriends behind in California to follow their parents to Taiwan, a \ncountry whose language and culture is unfamiliar to them.\n  I can only imagine how much more they would be adversely impacted now \ngiven the passage of 9 more years.\n  The Liangs have filed annual income tax returns; established a \nsuccessful business, Fong Yong Restaurant, in the United States; are \nhomeowners, and are financially successful. Since they arrived in the \nUnited States, they have pursued and, to a degree, achieved the \nAmerican Dream.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Liang's quest to legalize their immigration status began \nin 1993 when they filed for relief from deportation before an \nimmigration judge.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, however, did not act \non their application until nearly 5 years later, in 1997, after which \ntime the immigration laws had significantly changed.\n  According to the immigration judge, had the INS acted on their \napplication for relief from deportation in a timely manner, they would \nhave qualified for suspension of deportation, given that they were \nlong-term residents of this country with U.S. citizen children and \nother positive factors. By the time INS processed their application, \nhowever, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, which changed the requirements for relief \nfrom removal to the Liangs' disadvantage.\n  I supported the changes of the 1996 law, but I believe sometimes \nthere are exceptions which merit special consideration. The Liangs are \nsuch a couple and family. Perhaps what distinguishes this family from \nmany others is that through hard work and perseverance, Mr. Liang has \nachieved a significant degree of success in the United States while \nbattling a severe form of post traumatic stress disorder.\n  According to his psychologist, this disorder stems from the \npersecution he, his family and community experienced in his native \ncountry of Laos during the Vietnam war.\n  Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Mr. Liang was exposed to \nnumerous traumatic experiences, including the murder of his mother by \nthe North Vietnamese and frequent episodes of wartime violence. He also \nroutinely witnessed the brutal persecution and deaths of others in his \nvillage. In 1975, he was granted refugee status in Taiwan.\n  The emotional impact of Mr. Liang's experiences in his war-torn \nnative country has been profound and continues to haunt him. His \npsychologist has also indicated that he suffers from severe clinical \ndepression, which has been exacerbated by the prospect of being \ndeported to Taiwan, where on account of his nationality, he believes he \nand his family would be treated as second-class citizens.\n  Moreover, Mr. Liang believes that the pursuit of further mental \nhealth treatment in Taiwan would only exacerbate the stigma of being an \noutsider in a country whose language he does not speak. Given those \nprospects, he also fears the impact such a stigma would have on the \nwell-being and future of his children.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of the Liangs.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that two letters of community support be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1291]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  January 2, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to ask you to once \n     again introduce a private bill to aid my friends Alice and \n     Robert Liang, who are seeking permanent lawful resident \n     status in the United States.\n       Without your assistance, the Liangs face deportation for \n     overstaying their temporary visas by 24 years. Being forced \n     to leave the United States would devastate their family. \n     Their three minor children, Eva, Bruce and Wesley, are U.S. \n     citizens and know no other home. Robert, a refugee from Laos, \n     suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder that would be \n     exacerbated if he were forced to relocate to Taiwan after \n     building a life here.\n       The Liangs own and run a successful vegetarian Chinese \n     restaurant, Garden Fresh, in Mountain View. They work hard, \n     pay taxes and own their own home in San Bruno. Though they \n     are by no means wealthy, they are generous donors to a \n     variety of charities and are quick to provide food or \n     assistance to anyone who needs help. They are also loving \n     parents and wonderful people who have nearly magically turned \n     hundreds of their customers into a community of friends \n     vitally concerned about their welfare. The fact that so many \n     of their customers are committed to ensuring their future in \n     the U.S. is a testament to the Liangs high character.\n       Two years ago, you told Congress that the extraordinary and \n     unique facts surrounding the Liangs situation merited the \n     introduction of a private bill on their behalf. I hope that \n     you will be similarly supportive once again, and I urge you \n     to continue your efforts to aid this very worthy family.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     June D. Bell.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are honored to write to you in \n     support of the Liang family of San Bruno, California. We have \n     known Robert and Alice for twelve years, and are repeatedly \n     awed by their support of their children and their \n     communities. They are the kind of people that we all wish \n     could surround us: honest, hard-working and extraordinarily \n     generous.\n       Anyone who has enjoyed their restaurants has unknowingly \n     become a part of Alice's family, as a first-timer noted. But \n     it is their service to the community, schools, and anyone in \n     need, that is so extraordinary. For example, on two recent \n     occasions, after the Katrina and Rita hurricanes, and again \n     after the Asian tsunami, Robert and Alice gave every penny \n     received on a full day to the relief efforts. Then on several \n     occasions, they have taken food and solace to hospitalized \n     customers (including me), giving up their free day. And for \n     years, Robert and Alice have provided food for a local public \n     school, at cost.\n       This kindness comes from a man who still suffers the \n     effects of his childhood during the war years in southeast \n     Asia, and a woman who grew up on a small farm in rural \n     Taiwan. They are therefore driven to provide a better life \n     for their American-born children.\n       We ask that you submit and guide to passage a Private Bill \n     that would permit this wonderful family to stay together in \n     our country, thereby enhancing not just the five of them, but \n     all of us who are touched by them. All five members of the \n     Liang family should be allowed to stay together in this \n     country and call themselves American.\n           Sincerely,\n     W. Cameron Caswell, Jr.,\n     Barbara Anne Maas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 422. A bill to authorize any alien who has been issued a valid \nmachine-readable biometric border crossing identification card to be \ntemporarily admitted into the United States upon successfully \ncompleting a background check; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Secure \nBorder Crossing Card Entry Act of 2007. This bill allows certain \ntravelers who seek to enter the U.S. temporarily and have already \nundergone rigorous security screening prior to entry and at the border, \nto enter our country and remain for up to 6 months.\n  We all agree that comprehensive immigration reform is a top priority \nthis year--not only for the administration but also for Congress. I \nhave stated that no effort on immigration reform can succeed without \nenhanced border security and worksite enforcement. We have been working \nhard to ramp up our border and interior enforcement efforts. Just last \nyear, Congress dedicated approximately $1.3 billion in last years \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill targeted at enhanced border \nsecurity. I am pleased that the President and Secretary Chertoff have \nmade border security a top priority this year as well.\n  Strong border security, however, must be balanced against policies \nthat facilitate legitimate trade and travel to the U.S. The security of \nour Nation is always paramount. But we also must ensure that the U.S. \nremains an economic leader and a welcoming nation for visitors who seek \nto enjoy the many business and recreational benefits that the U.S. has \nto offer.\n  We have in place now a program that allows visitors who possess a \nmachine-readable border crossing card, also known as the ``laser \nvisa,'' to enter this country for up to 30 days. The laser visa is \nissued by the State Department to Mexican nationals, but only after \nthey have been screened and determined not to be a security risk or \ninadmissible to the U.S. Laser visa holders are screened again when \nthey come to our borders and are inspected by an immigration inspector.\n  Canadian visitors, on the other hand, are not required to get a laser \nvisa from the State Department prior to seeking to enter the U.S. \nCanadian visitors also can remain in the U.S. for up to 6 months \ninitially. I see no reason that we should treat citizens and nationals \nof our northern neighbor differently from our southern neighbor.\n  The goal of this bill is to treat all citizens and nationals of our \nnorthern and southern neighbors seeking to temporarily visit the U.S. \nthe same--allowing them to temporarily visit or conduct business in the \nU.S. for up to 6 months. And, because laser visa holders must undergo \nbackground checks before they are issued their secure travel documents, \nthis policy change would not conflict with our country's goal of \nimproving border security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Webb, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 423. A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2007, the \nrates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \nand the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nsurvivors of certain disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, as chairman of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I introduce the Veterans Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 2007. This measure would direct the Secretary \nof Veterans' Affairs to increase, effective December 1, 2007, the rates \nof veterans' compensation to keep pace with the rising cost-of-living \nin this country. The rate adjustment is equal to that provided on an \nannual basis to Social Security recipients and is based on the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index. Several of my colleagues on \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, including Ranking Member, Larry \nCraig, and Senators Rockefeller, Murray, Sanders, Brown, Webb, and \nEnsign join me in introducing this important legislation.\n  Congress regularly enacts an annual cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, \nfor veterans' compensation in order to ensure that inflation does not \nerode the purchasing power of the veterans and their families who \ndepend upon this income to meet their daily needs. This past year \nCongress passed, and the President signed into law, Public Law 109-361, \nwhich resulted in a COLA increase of 3.3 percent for 2007.\n  It is important that we view veterans compensation, including the \nannual COLA, and indeed all benefits earned by veterans, as a \ncontinuing cost of war. It is clear that the ongoing conflicts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan will continue to result in injuries and disabilities \nthat will yield an increase in claims for compensation. Studies by VA \nindicate that the most significant predictor of new claims activity is \nthe size of the active force. More than 1 million servicemembers have \ndeployed in support of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. And, \naccording to the Department of Defense, as of today there have been \n24,216 reported casualties during these operations. This number, \nhowever, does not take into account conditions that develop over the \ncourse of a war, including musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore VA can \nexpect a significant increase in the number of new claims for \ncompensation as a result of these ongoing conflicts.\n  The COLA affects, among other benefits, veterans' disability \ncompensation\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\nand dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and \nchildren. Many of these more than 3 million recipients of those \nbenefits depend upon these tax-free payments not only to provide for \ntheir own basic needs, but those of their spouses, children and parents \nas well. Without an annual COLA increase, these veterans and their \nfamilies would see the value of their hard-earned benefits slowly \ndiminish, and we, as a Congress, would be in dereliction of our duty to \nensure that those who sacrificed so much for this country receive the \nbenefits and services to which they are entitled.\n  Disbursement of disability compensation to our Nation's veterans \nconstitutes one of the core missions of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. It is a necessary measure of gratitude afforded to those \nveterans whose lives were irrevocably altered by their service to this \ncountry.\n  I urge our colleagues to support passage of this COLA increase. I \nalso ask our colleagues for their continued support for our Nation's \nveterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 425. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe resources eligible for the renewable energy credit to kinetic \nhydropower, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nfurther our Nation's energy independence, and provide for sustainable \nelectricity generation. This bill, which is cosponsored by my colleague \nfrom Oregon Senator Wyden, will make facilities that generate \nelectricity using kinetic hydropower eligible for the production tax \ncredit under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  As with many emerging renewable technologies, wave and tidal energy \nare more costly than traditional generation using fossil fuels. Yet, \nfor our environment and our energy security, we must provide incentives \nthat will encourage the development and commercialization of these \nresources.\n  Under this bill, kinetic hydropower is defined as: ocean free flowing \nwater derived from flows from tidal currents, ocean currents, waves, or \nestuary currents; ocean thermal energy; or free flowing water in \nrivers, lakes, man-made channels, or streams.\n  These innovative technologies are renewable, non-polluting resources \nthat can help meet our Nation's growing demand for electricity. In \nOregon, it would be possible to produce and transmit over two hundred \nmegawatts of wave energy without any upgrades to the existing \ntransmission system. Already numerous preliminary permits have been \nfiled at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for wave energy \nfacilities off the Oregon coast. Due to the increasing interest in this \nform of energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission even held a \nconference in December 2006 to assess the types of wave and tidal \ntechnologies that developers are pursuing.\n  These facilities would be virtually invisible from shore, and could \nprovide predictable generation that could be easily integrated with \nother electricity resources. In addition, according to a January 2005 \nreport issued by the Electric Power Research Institute, ``with proper \nsiting, converting ocean wave energy to electricity is believed to be \none of the most environmentally benign ways to generate electricity.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and to \nprovide this production tax credit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that all funds collected from the tariff on \nimports of ethanol be invested in the research, development, and \ndeployment of biofuels, especially cellulosic ethanol produced from \nbiomass feedstocks; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \n``Biofuels Investment Trust Fund Act'' because I believe it is \nlegislation that can help America progress towards a more secure energy \nfuture; I believe it is a small piece to the puzzle that is our energy \npolicy. The Biofuels Investment Trust Fund Act seeks to take a simple, \ncommon sense step down the path we in this country need to take to \nimprove our energy security. The Act would direct that all money \ncollected by the Federal Government pursuant to the tariff on imported \nethanol be invested in the research, development and deployment of \nbiofuels--especially biofuels like cellulosic ethanol that can be \nproduced from biomass feedstocks.\n  There are some who advocate removing the ethanol tariff but I believe \nthat it is currently unwise to do so. We are in the early stages of \ntrying to build a renewable fuels industry that will eventually allow \nethanol and other biofuels to be a real alternative to the fuels we \ncurrently derive from oil. The tariff is an important part of that \nbecause it helps the nascent ethanol industry and it ensures that we \nare not providing subsidies to ethanol produced in other nations.\n  It seems to me, however, that the money collected from this tariff \ncan be put to better, more productive uses than merely deposited in the \ngeneral fund. And, it would seem, that using these funds to help build \nour domestic ethanol production would be the wisest use of the money. \nTherefore, I propose that the tariff funds be collected in a specific \ntrust fund and only be used for investment in biofuels research, \ndevelopment and deployment. Moreover, I propose that those funds be \nmore specifically invested in the next generation of ethanol \nproduction--cellulosic ethanol produced from biomass feedstocks. These \nfunds can be used in any of a number of ways to help offset the \nsubstantial costs inherent in starting an entire industry--like one for \ncellulosic ethanol--from scratch and in the face of volatile \ncommodities and energy markets.\n  Our Nation faces a serious crisis brought on by our energy \nconsumption and, most importantly, by our reliance on foreign sources \nof oil. As a Nebraskan, my focus has been on the role agriculture can \nplay in the development of alternative sources of energy and I am \nconvinced that American agriculture is positioned to supply the nation \nwith an abundant source of clean, high-quality energy that will reduce \nour destructive reliance on foreign oil.\n  I also believe that biofuels production can be the catalyst for a new \nwave of American innovation as a part of the continuing search for \nbetter energy solutions. The virtue in producing cleaner, more \nsustainable fuels derived from our own fields rather than extracted \nfrom distant lands could help spur new technologies, new jobs and new \ngrowth in our national economy.\n  We in Nebraska know the value of ethanol. We know the benefits it \nholds for the environment and our farmers and we know that it is \ncritical in lessening our dependence on foreign oil.\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\nWe also know that the ethanol industry creates jobs--nearly 1 in 4 jobs \nin Nebraska are agriculture related and new ethanol plants are opening \nacross the State.\n  I believe that a national emphasis on biofuels production represents \nan important investment in the proud tradition of the American farmer, \nAmerican ingenuity and American productivity. It's a win-win-win \nsituation--a win for farmers, a win for agriculture and win for \nnational security.\n  There is not an area of the country that does not have some \nagriculture product that can be used as an alternative energy source \nwhether it's corn in Nebraska, forestry wastes in the Northeast and \nNorthwest, or sugar cane in Hawaii, Louisiana and Florida; or whether \nit is biomass energy crops that can be grown throughout the country.\n  In conclusion, I am proud to introduce the Biofuels Investment Trust \nFund Act with the hope that it will be part of the solution to our \nenergy problems. The money we deposit in this Biofuels Trust Fund will \nhelp grow our biofuels industry and through that investment we will \nimprove our national energy security, as well as boosting the economies \nin agriculture and our rural communities.\n  I request that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 44) commending the University of \n     Nebraska-Lincoln women's volleyball team for winning the \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association Division 1 Women's \n     Volleyball Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, today I wish to \ncongratulate the No. 1 volleyball team in America: the University of \nNebraska Cornhuskers Women's Volleyball Team.\n  The Cornhuskers won their third national title with a 3-1 victory \nover Stanford University on December 16, 2006. Previously, Nebraska \ncaptured National Collegiate Athletic Association's Women's Division I \nVolleyball Championships in 1995 and 2000.\n  The win moved Nebraska into a tie for second place on the list of \nall-time NCAA Volleyball Championships among all schools. The title was \nalso the second for the Huskers under Coach John Cook, who led Nebraska \nto the 2000 title in his first season as Nebraska's head coach.\n  Nebraska ended its 2006 season with a 33-1 record. The team's .971 \nwinning percentage led the Nation and was the second-best mark in \nschool history. The Huskers also became just the third team in NCAA \nhistory to be ranked No. 1 for the entire season.\n  In addition, the Cornhuskers are the first team outside of the \nPacific Ten Conference to win a national title in women's volleyball \nsince Nebraska's last title in 2000. After finishing runner-up last \nyear, Nebraska became just the third volleyball team to ever win the \nNational Championship season after losing in the NCAA's final match. \nPennsylvania State University, Penn State, and the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles, UCLA, are the only other schools to \naccomplish such a feat.\n  Attendance at the championship match, played at the Qwest Center in \nOmaha, NE, totaled 17,209, an all-time collegiate volleyball record. \nThe total attendance for the entire championship session of 34,222 also \nset an NCAA record. The previous record was 23,978 set during the 1998 \nChampionships in Madison, WI.\n  On their way to winning the national title, several Huskers collected \nprestigious individual honors as well. Nebraska's 6-foot, 5-inch junior \nright-side hitter, Sarah Pavan, led the way, winning the American \nVolleyball Coaches Association's, AVCA, Division I National Player of \nthe Year award and the 2006-2007 Honda Sports Award for volleyball. \nPavan became the fourth Husker to win each award. Along with Pavan, \nsophomore outside hitter Jordan Larson was named an AVCA First Team \nAll-American, while junior middle blocker Tracy Stalls was a second-\nteam selection and redshirt freshman setter Rachel Holloway was a \nthird-team honoree.\n  It is a tremendous accomplishment to win a National Championship, and \nthe University of Nebraska's Women's Volleyball Team is to be commended \nfor its excellence and for the pride it has instilled in all \nNebraskans.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 44) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the University of Nebraska-Lincoln women's \n     volleyball team (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Huskers'') won the 2006 National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association (NCAA) Division I Women's Volleyball National \n     Championship at the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska, on \n     December 16, 2006;\n       Whereas Husker junior Sarah Pavan was chosen as the \n     Nation's top collegiate female volleyball player, winning the \n     2006-07 Honda Sports Award for volleyball;\n       Whereas Sarah Pavan was named the ESPN Magazine Academic \n     All-American of the Year, becoming the University of \n     Nebraska's 234th Academic All-American and the university's \n     29th Academic All-American in volleyball;\n       Whereas the University of Nebraska leads the Nation in the \n     number of players named Academic All-Americans;\n       Whereas the Huskers completed the 2006 season with a record \n     of 33-1;\n       Whereas Husker head coach John Cook has led the team to 3 \n     national championships;\n       Whereas the Huskers made their sixth appearance in the NCAA \n     finals;\n       Whereas the 2006 Huskers are only the third team in the \n     history of the NCAA to lead the American Volleyball Coaches \n     Association poll for an entire season;\n       Whereas the entire Husker volleyball team should be \n     commended for its determination, work ethic, attitude, and \n     heart;\n       Whereas the University of Nebraska is building an \n     impressive legacy of excellence in its volleyball program; \n     and\n       Whereas the University of Nebraska volleyball players have \n     brought great honor to themselves, their families, their \n     university, and the State of Nebraska: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the University of Nebraska-Lincoln women's \n     volleyball team for winning the 2006 National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association Division I Women's Volleyball National \n     Championship; and\n       (2) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, \n     students, and staff whose hard work and dedication made \n     winning the Championship possible.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/29/senate-section/article/S1297-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
