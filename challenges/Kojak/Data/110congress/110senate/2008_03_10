Mr. President, in an hour we are starting the budget. Under \nthe law that governs what we do, there is 50 hours of debate on this \nmatter. It is one of the few items in the Senate that has a time \ncertain. The good news is that we have Senators Conrad and Gregg who \nwill be managing this. They are two experts on money within this body. \nThey work extremely well together. They disagree on a number of issues \nin the budget, but they approach it in a gentlemanly fashion. They are, \nin my estimation, two of the finest Senators this body has ever had. As \nfar as matters relating to money, they are, in my years of service here \nin the Senate, really outstanding. They are friends. They are \nadversaries. They do it in a way that should make the Senate and the \ncountry proud. That is the good news.\n  The bad news is that other than the time limit on this budget, there \nare a lot of changes we talk about needing to make, and we have for \nyears, but we haven't made them, which means we come to a point where \nwe have what is called the vote-athon, which means Senators have an \nunlimited number of opportunities to offer amendments. Until the Chair \nrules that it is a dilatory tactic, that can go on for a long period of \ntime.\n  I have explained to the Republican leader--we talked at some length \non one occasion on the telephone--that we are going to finish this bill \nthis week. The question is, we would like to do it on Thursday. It is \nmy understanding that all the Presidentials will be here on Thursday. \nThey will be here on Friday if we don't finish this bill on Thursday. \nThey will be here on Saturday if we don't finish the bill on Friday. I \nhope we can work toward finishing this bill sometime Thursday. It\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nis my recollection that we did it last year on Thursday. That is what \nwe are facing. As a result, we will work to see if we can have a \nprocess that is fair and gives people the opportunity to offer the \namendments they believe are important.\n  There are a number of issues we know. I think Senators Gregg and \nConrad will agree there are probably four main issues that are going to \nbe extremely controversial in the budget this year. We will work toward \nhaving a time that we can complete that.\n  This week marks the 75th anniversary of President Franklin \nRoosevelt's first fireside chat. In his first fireside chat on March \n12, 1933, President Roosevelt reassured the American people that \ndespite the fear and uncertainty of a banking crisis and a deeply \ntroubled economy, working people--or, in his words, ``average \ncitizens''--would be just fine.\n  He said:\n\n       You . . . must have faith; you must not be stampeded by \n     rumors or guesses.\n       Let us unite in banishing fear. We have provided the \n     machinery to restore our financial system, and it is up to \n     you to support and make it work. It is your problem, my \n     friends, your problem no less than mine. Together we cannot \n     fail.\n\n  President Roosevelt was right. With President Roosevelt's leadership \nand the grit and determination of the American people, our country not \nonly survived the Great Depression but embraced a new era of \nprosperity. That success was due in no small part to President \nRoosevelt's understanding that working Americans built our country and \nworking Americans were critical to our continued prosperity.\n  Seven years ago, President George Bush inherited a budget surplus for \nthe year of more than $200 billion, the result of a responsible Clinton \nadministration economic policy. These surpluses were projected to \ncontinue for the foreseeable future.\n  Now 7 years into the Bush administration, we find that tax breaks for \nbig business and the superwealthy have combined with $12 billion per \nmonth war in Iraq and cuts to investments in our workforce and \ninfrastructure to create a budget deficit of more than $400 billion and \na national debt that has grown by $3 trillion. The result: an economy \nthat is failing millions of American families.\n  President Bush said last week that he doesn't believe America is \nheaded toward a recession. You have to hunt hard to find an economist \nwho would agree with him. The question is no longer are we headed for a \nrecession but how long and how deep it will be.\n  For the second month in a row, the American economy lost jobs--22,000 \nin January, 63,000 in February. Who bore the worst of this job loss? \nPeople who work in the manufacturing industry, people who work in \nconstruction, people who build homes. It is not manufacturing that lost \njobs; it is not construction that lost jobs; it is the people who work \nin those industries that cause those industries to be deemed as losing \njobs.\n  In 7 years of Bush economics, oil is up to an alltime high. Today, \nthe last I looked, it was over $107 a barrel. Gas prices are double \nwhat they were when the President took office, and they are climbing. \nThe average gallon of gasoline in America now is about $3.20 a gallon. \nThe highest gasoline is in San Francisco; the lowest is in Casper, WY. \nThe cost of college is up by some 60 percent since President Bush took \noffice. Health care costs are up 80 percent since President Bush took \noffice. Has anything gone down? Yes. Annual household income is down by \n$1,000.\n  Who has prospered from 7 years of Bush economics? At parties and \nprivate meetings, President Bush's CEO friends and oil buddies must be \ntelling him the economy is doing great, because they are doing really \nwell. Exxon, for example, made the highest net profit of any company in \nthe history of the country. It is no wonder the President doesn't see a \nrecession coming, because the people he deals with are doing just fine. \nLook at the enormous compensation packages earned by CEOs of companies \nthat have been failures: Contrywide, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch. These \ncompensation packages were in the hundreds of millions of dollars for \ncompanies that were failing, even as their industry has spiraled \ndownward and the consumers they serve have suffered. The middle class \nhas not done so well. They have been forgotten. They have been left \nbehind.\n  After 7 years of fiscal irresponsibility, consider what President \nBush wants to do next. His budget calls for spending $51 billion to \nhand out more tax breaks for Americans with incomes of greater than $1 \nmillion. That works out that each of these millionaires will get \n$125,000--all to a fortunate few who need help the least. With such \ngenerosity for those doing the best, one would think the President \nwould take care of those struggling the most. But that is not the case.\n  On the housing crisis, for example, the proposal we have put forward \ncalls for five simple things. Transparency--if you are going to buy a \nhome, have it so that people understand the terms of the deal. It is \nvery simple. Jack Reed pushed that. CDBG money to go to local \ngovernments to buy foreclosed properties. Local governments are crying \nfor these moneys. Revenue bonds would allow the law to be changed. \nInstead of revenue bonds to buy new homes, you could buy foreclosed or \nused homes. And then the loss carryforward that is so important for the \nhomebuilding industry--the money you have made in the past could be \noffset with the money that has been lost in recent years. Finally, the \nbankruptcy provision--we have talked a lot about it here--to allow \npeople to have the bankruptcy court take a look at their loans and see \nif they can readjust the loans.\n  The President pays for his tax giveaways to the wealthy in part by \nproposing deep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid--that is a fact--while \nunderfunding everything from terrorism prevention to veterans \neducation. That is not just irresponsible fiscal policy. Many believe, \nas I met with a group of religious leaders last week, that it is \nimmoral fiscal policy.\n  This week, we are proposing a budget that abandons Bush economics, \nlowers taxes for the middle class, creates new jobs, and turns our \nstruggling economy around. This requires both immediate help and long-\nterm solutions. In short, our budget calls for further steps to \nstimulate growth and address the housing crisis. It sets aside $35 \nbillion for measures such as extending unemployment insurance, \nproviding home heating and nutrition assistance, and rebuilding our \ncrumbling roads and bridges. Everyone should know that for every \nbillion dollars we spend in developing roads, bridges, dams, highways, \nwater systems, sewer systems, we create 47,500 high-paying jobs. We \nhelp families avoid losing their homes in our budget to foreclosure, a \nmeasure that has been blocked by Republican filibuster.\n  For the long-term, our budget calls for meaningful investments in \nenergy, education, and infrastructure. These investments will create \njobs, provide Americans with new tools to succeed, increase \nproductivity, improve our environment, and help ensure a strong and \ngrowing economy. These are not just wishes or dreams. We were able to \naccomplish that. The last years of the Clinton administration, we were \nspending less money than we were taking in. We were actually paying \ndown the debt.\n  The budget we are working on this week also rejects the Bush \nadministration's deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and will expand \nhealth care coverage for children. It would make America safer by \nembracing our troops and veterans and rejecting the administration's \nplan to underfund antiterrorism and anticrime initiatives.\n  In stark contrast to the President's continued fiscal \nirresponsibility, our budget would restore fiscal discipline. It would \nmaintain strong pay-as-you-go rules, which were in effect in the \nClinton years, which really worked. The budget would be fully balanced \nin 3 years.\n  Our bipartisan budget sets a path toward a stronger economic future. \nWe can make it even stronger by passing an amendment that will be \noffered by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nBaucus of Montana. Several colleagues will join in that. The Baucus \namendment would use projected surpluses to cut taxes on the middle \nclass--extending marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, and the \n10-percent tax bracket. The amendment also reforms the estate tax to \nprotect small businesses and family farms and includes other tax cuts \nas well.\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\n  Democrats believe in cutting taxes--not for chief executive officers \nof these big companies, not for oil men, but for middle-class families \nwho need help the most.\n  Mr. President, I have already talked about the two men who are going \nto manage this bill: Chairman Conrad and ranking member Judd Gregg. \nThey really do good work. Now it is up to the full Senate to follow \nSenator Conrad's lead, and that of Senator Judd Gregg, to move forward \nand get a budget that can be the blueprint for what we do the rest of \nthis Congress.\n  I look forward to an open, productive budget debate this week. I hope \nthat with the kind of steely resolve President Roosevelt showed, we can \nput the failed Bush economic policies behind us and pass a fair, \nresponsible budget that makes America stronger, safer, and more \nprosperous.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1787-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. REID.

His name is Ron Tschetter--a \nwonderful man who was approved overwhelmingly not that long ago by the \nfull Senate.\n  The Peace Corps is one of the programs that is so good for this \ncountry and the world. We have a little over 8,000 Peace Corps \nvolunteers. We should have twice as many. The President said a couple \nyears ago he was going to double the Peace Corps from 7,000 to 14,000. \nThat has not happened. He has increased it by a few hundred, and that \nis very, very important. From Nevada, we have 22 Peace Corps volunteers \nout of the 8,000. They are from all over the world.\n  As I have had the good fortune of being able to travel as a \nrepresentative of our country around the world over the last several \ndecades, every place I go, I visit with Peace Corps volunteers because \nthere is no group of individuals that does more for our country in \nsetting good, high-quality standards than the Peace Corps volunteers. \nThey do great work, and I am very proud of them.\n  These Peace Corps volunteers, when they are interviewed, are not \nDemocrats or Republicans, they are Americans, and they do great public \nservice.

Mr. President, last week our friends on the other side \npulled back the curtain on their budget proposal, and taxpayers all \nacross America groaned. It really was not very pretty. The Democrats \npropose to increase discretionary spending above the $1 trillion mark \nfor the first time ever. To pay for it, they want to increase taxes by \na lot--the largest tax hike in history.\n  The timing, of course, could not be worse. At a time when Americans \nare seeing record gas prices, falling home values, and higher health \ncare and tuition costs, the other side sees higher taxes and more \nspending. Rather than offer a plan to address the concerns of the day, \nthey offer a plan to make those costs harder to meet inside the limits \nof a family budget. At a time of heightened economic worry, our \nfriends' plan for America is for families to keep less of their money \nand they insist that Government spend more.\n  The effect of all this on U.S. families would be crushing. Under the \nDemocratic budget, the average American family would see their annual \ntax bill go up by $2,300 a year. Nearly 20 million seniors would see \ntheir taxes go up by more than $2,000 a year. And 8 million low-income \nworkers would be added to the tax roles.\n  At a time of increased economic concern, Democrats want the average \nAmerican family to have $2,300 less for the family budget under their \nplan. That is enough money to pay for an entire year's worth of gas for \ntwo cars. It is about what the average American family with two kids \nspends on health care in 9 months. It is also enough to buy 8 months' \nworth of groceries.\n  The average American family would suffer a lot under this plan. \nConsider a family in Kentucky that is just starting to think about \ncollege for a new baby. If that family took the $2,300 Democrats are \nasking for in new taxes and invested it each year in a tax-free college \nsavings account, they would have nearly $75,000 for college by the time \nthat child was ready to attend school.\n  This budget is not the answer Americans have been looking for. It is \na cliche. When faced with a challenge, Democrats always answer with a \nsimple three-word response: tax and spend. And this year is certainly \nno different.\n  American families and their children are the ones who will lose out \nunder this tax-and-spend plan. Democrats promise to pay for everything \nbut make families pay instead. They promised middle-class tax relief \nlast year but did nothing to enact it. They promise to reduce the debt \nbut increase it instead. And they promise to address long-term \nentitlement spending but only make the problem worse with higher taxes \nand more spending.\n  Over the last 25 years, Republican economic policies have lifted tens \nof millions of working families into the middle class. We did it \nthrough lower taxes, controlled spending, and keeping our defenses \nstrong. Democrats know these policies worked. That is why, as we began \nthis Congress, many Democrats assured voters they would not raise taxes \non working-class and middle-class voters. Well, this budget certainly \nfell short of that mark.\n  The proposed tax hike the Democrats sent down last week is four times \nbigger than the one in 1993 that even President Clinton said was too \nbig for Americans and, ultimately, even for him. How can Democrats \nthink the American people will accept this one? Do they think Americans \nwant to see the gains of the last 6 years washed away by a budget that \nreinstates every tax we have lowered or repealed over that period?\n\n  Budget week is always a clarifying time of year on Capitol Hill. What \nthe other side's budget makes clear once again is that our friends on \nthe other side are more concerned about growing the size and scope of \nWashington spending, while we want to grow the family's budget. At a \ntime of great economic uncertainty, Americans expect more from \nGovernment than a $1.2 trillion tax hike and billions of dollars in new \nspending.\n  This budget spends more than $775 billion from the Social Security \nsurplus. It increases gross debt by more than $2 trillion. It increases \nthe deficit by almost $400 billion. And it completely ignores the \nquestion of where we are going to get the money to pay for $66 trillion \nin promised entitlements--this despite the fact that the Democratic \nchairman of the Budget Committee has explicitly said we need to reform \nentitlement programs.\n  Republicans made a pledge last year to fight tax increases and to \nrein in spending. We stuck by that pledge last year. In these difficult \neconomic times, we will certainly stick by it this year. With this \nbudget, Democrats want to spend more from Washington and raise your \ntaxes to pay for it. I, for one, will vote to allow families to keep \nmore of what they earn so they can decide how to spend it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1787-4", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1787-S1788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Corporal Gary Brent Coleman\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nsoldier who gave his life in defense of his country. CPL Gary Brent \nColeman of Pikeville, KY, perished on November 21, 2003, in Balad, \nIraq, when his vehicle overturned mid-chase during combat operations. \nHe was 24 years old.\n  The memorial service for Corporal Coleman was so large it filled the \nauditorium of his alma mater, Pikeville High School. Brent, as he was \nknown, had been a local hero for his prowess on the football field. He \nbecame an even greater hero by stepping forward in a time of war.\n  Friends, family members and fellow soldiers spoke, one after another, \non the effect Brent had had in their lives. When it was over, Brent's \nfather, Gary Keene Coleman, said, ``I was . . . proud that Brent had \nmade that type of an impact on so many people. But I would rather for \nhim to be here.''\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n  For his bravery in uniform, Corporal Coleman received many medals, \nawards and decorations, including the Army Achievement Medal, the Army \nCommendation Medal, the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star Medal.\n  Brent was born in Pikeville, in eastern Kentucky, and spent the \nmajority of his life in the area. From a young age he was not afraid to \nspeak his mind. When Brent was about six or seven, he and his family \nwent to the circus. They had lions there, and the lion tamer was \ndirecting them with his whip.\n  But young Brent thought the lion tamer was using the whip on the \nlions--and that despite their sharp claws and teeth, they needed a \nsmall boy to come to their aid. ``Stop that right now!'' he yelled to \nthe lion tamer. The whole circus audience laughed at Brent's display of \ncompassion and bravery.\n  Brent loved sports, and grew up playing T-Ball, baseball, and \nfootball. Once when Brent and his cousin Ben were both 12 years old, \nBrent showed Ben how to hold the football close to his chest. Ben took \nthe ball and ran, Brent tackled him, and I guess Ben was holding the \nball a little too tightly--it broke his shoulder and his rib.\n  Gary took Brent and his brother, Jason, to the Super Bowl every year. \nBrent's favorite team was the Detroit Lions, and star running back \nBarry Sanders was his role model. Brent, Gary, and Jason would fly to \nwherever the big game was and stay for the weekend; they never missed a \nSuper Bowl.\n  Football was more than just a game to watch for Brent, it was his \npassion, and he excelled at it. At Pikeville High School, Brent was an \nall-county running back for the Pikeville Panthers. He was named \noffensive player of the year at the start of his senior year, in 1996, \nand he is still the leading rusher and scorer in the school's history.\n  The Kentucky High School Athletic Association recognizes Brent for \nholding these records: 8th overall in career yards rushing, tenth \noverall in career touchdowns, and 11th overall in career points scored.\n  ``Brent was idolized by the students and their parents,'' says Eddie \nColeman, Brent's uncle. ``He was a local hero before he was the real \nhero.''\n  With so much talent came an appropriate nickname. Brent's teammates \ncalled him ``Rocket,'' because he could find a hole and plow right \nthrough it.\n  Footage from a local television station shows Brent earned yet \nanother nickname--``Stumpy.'' ``I guess because I'm short and fat,'' a \ngrinning Brent said to the TV reporter.\n  ``He didn't lack for confidence,'' his father Gary tells us. ``Brent \nwas someone with compassion, always trying to do good, always trying to \ndo the right thing, and he had a competitive personality.''\n  Everyone around him could see Brent was special, and that did not \nchange when Brent joined the Army. After attending Marshall University \nin Huntington, WV, for 2 years, he enlisted on July 11, 2001, and \nunderwent basic training at the U.S. Army Armor Center at Fort Knox, \nKY. He graduated Basic in the top five overall.\n  Brent was then assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 68th Armor \nRegiment, 4th Infantry Division, based out of Fort Carson, CO. Upon \ngraduating basic training, he told his family, ``I know I can make it \non my own.''\n  Brent saw service to his country as a way of life. ``He was going to \nmake a career out of it, and I encouraged him to,'' says Gary. Brent \nheld several positions on the M1A1 Abrams tank, including gunner and \nloader, and he eventually became a tank commander.\n  Stationed in Colorado Springs, Brent met a special woman there, and \nBrent and Kirsten Sinley Coleman became husband and wife. They married \nin March, 3 weeks before Brent deployed to Iraq.\n  The star running back and tank commander who had already acquired a \nfew nicknames soon picked up another from his fellow soldiers: \n``Hollywood.'' I will let SSG Jason Gallegos, who served with Brent, \nexplain why.\n  Brent ``was about five-foot-five and weighed about 175 pounds,'' \nStaff Sergeant Gallegos says. ``His body was short in stature, but he \nwas pure muscle with about maybe eight to nine percent body fat.''\n  ``He looked like an action figure, a poster child of what a United \nStates soldier looks like. . . . The reason behind the nickname was \nbecause Corporal Coleman worked out hard everyday here for two to three \nhours a day.\n  ``Then whenever he got the opportunity, he would go outside our \nbunker into the sun in just his PT shorts, place mirrors around him, \nput on his shades and throw on some music and tan. It was like he was a \nmovie star.''\n  Brent was well liked by his fellow soldiers; and not just because of \nfunny stories like these. He was liked and respected because he always \ngave his best, and encouraged others to do the same.\n  ``He would always volunteer for the tough missions,'' Staff Sergeant \nGallegos says. `` `Be smart and be aggressive,' he would say, because \nhe felt if you're passive then you not only endanger yourself, but also \nyour soldiers. . . . He was there for anybody, no matter what platoon, \nwhat day of the week, or what time of day.''\n  At Brent's funeral, his sergeant told the Coleman family, ``Brent was \n24 and they get a lot of 18-year-olds. Brent would always volunteer to \ntake the young ones' places to protect them.''\n  ``He served his country. He never complained. He was made for the \nmilitary, physically and mentally,'' Brent's father, Gary, says. ``He \nsaid he had a job to do.''\n  Mr. President, I had the honor of meeting Gary Coleman in 2005, and I \npresented him with an American flag flown over this Capitol. Neither \nthat flag nor the words we say here today can make up for what the \nColeman family has lost. But they are the very least we can do to honor \nBrent's memory.\n  We are thinking today of Brent's loved ones, including his wife \nKirsten Sinley Coleman; his mother Janie Adkins Johnson; his father \nGary Keene Coleman; his brother Jason Byron Coleman; his grandmother \nRuby Coleman Damron; and many other family members and friends.\n  Mr. President, today, March 10, is Brent's birthday. It is a day to \ncelebrate Brent's life, and I thought an appropriate day for me to \nspeak on how he lived, and what he lived for.\n  To the Coleman family who have lost a husband, brother, and son, I \nwant to say this: CPL Gary Brent Coleman left this world a hero. And on \nbehalf of a grateful Nation, the U.S. Senate honors his life of \nsacrifice and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1788-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the last several days, we have learned \nsome surprising things about the Air Force's decision to award a $40 \nbillion contract to the European company, Airbus.\n  The Air Force wants Airbus, which is headquartered in Toulouse, \nFrance, to supply our next generation of aerial refueling tankers. It \nchose Airbus over the American company, Boeing, which has been making \nthose tankers for the last 50 years.\n  I have made it clear over the past several days that I think this \ndecision is shortsighted and dangerous. But today, even more questions \nhave been raised about the process the Air Force followed to make this \ndecision. So I want to take the opportunity this afternoon to walk \nthrough the impact I believe the Air Force decision will have because I \nthink we need to take a good hard look at whether we as Members of the \nSenate think this contract should be finalized.\n  First, we need to be very cautious about any decision that awards the \nright to build a critical part of our military air technology to a \ncompany\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\nthat is controlled by a foreign government. What happens if that \ngovernment disagrees with us on foreign policy? What if it decides it \nwants to slow down our military capacity? Do we want another country to \nhave that kind of control?\n  The Air Force, of course, did not take that into consideration. They \nsaid they didn't have to. I think this case is a perfect example of how \nmisguided that idea is.\n  Airbus is owned by the European Aeronautic Defense and Space \nCompany--EADS--which in turn is controlled by several nations. Among \nthem are countries which have not always agreed with the United States \non foreign policy. They include Russia, which has a 5-percent stake, \nand the United Arab Emirates, which controls 7.5 percent of EADS.\n  Now, EADS has already demonstrated it is willing to bend the rules if \nit can help the company make money. I have talked extensively on the \nfloor of the Senate about their attempts to sell military helicopters \nand planes to Iran and to Venezuela. But now we are opening the doors \nto a key piece of our military defense to them.\n  America's global military strength is built on our ability to use our \nmilitary might anywhere in the world at a moment's notice. Aerial \ntankers are the linchpin of our air power because they allow the U.S. \nAir Force to stretch across the globe. Until now, the technology that \npowered these critical planes rested in the hands of Boeing and its \nAmerican workforce that has been building them for more than 50 years.\n  Until now, our tankers have been built by manufacturers, designers, \nand engineers who are bound by law from selling technology to countries \nthat sponsor terrorism. But as a result of this contract, we are \nallowing EADS to take over a cornerstone of our military technology, \nand we are actually paying them to do it. In fact, I argue that \ndecision was a $40 billion investment in the military research budget \nof EADS and Airbus.\n  The Air Force has said it wasn't their responsibility to take our \nsecurity or our industry into account. Well, I say to my colleagues: \nCongress must--we must--be more forward-looking than that.\n  Secondly, I question why the Air Force was not required to take the \neconomic impact into consideration when it awarded this contract. If \nBoeing had won this contract, it would have created 44,000 U.S. jobs. \nBut it is far from clear what kind of an investment Airbus and its \npartner, Northrop Grumman, plan to make in the United States.\n  Our economy is hurting. We are nearing a recession, if we aren't \nalready there. Families across the country are struggling to get by, in \npart because their factory jobs have been moved overseas. Workers \nacross this country are frustrated, and they are angry that at a time \nsuch as this, their Government is saying it wants to take American tax \ndollars--our tax dollars--and give that money to a foreign company to \nbuild planes for our military.\n  We have more reason for concern because for decades Europe provided \nsubsidies, their subsidies, to prop up Airbus and EADS. Airbus, they \nhave said, is a jobs program that has led to tens of thousands of \nlayoffs in the United States, and EADS has made little secret of its \ndesire to dismantle the American aerospace industry.\n  Our Government, in fact, is concerned enough about these practices \nthat we now have a WTO case against the EU over this. Yet here we are, \nlast week our Government awarded Airbus this $40 billion contract \nanyway. That should give us a great deal of pause because EADS is \nalready looking to build on the toehold that contract gives them into \nour aerospace industry.\n  In fact, a report in a leading French news service today says the \nexecutive president of EADS--Airbus--wants to build on the company's \nsuccess with the tanker contract and propose to the EADS board ``two \ntakeover projects in the fields of defense, security, or services.''\n  And he said: ``One of them at least should be in the United States.''\n  That brings me to my final point this afternoon. Why didn't the Air \nForce consider these obvious questions about national security and \nabout economic security? Well, the Los Angeles Times today suggests an \nanswer. They report on the front page of their paper today that EADS \nand its partner, Northrop Grumman, may have played a role in narrowing \nthe scope of what the Air Force looked at. In fact, the Times reports \nthat Northrop executives ensured that the Air Force wouldn't ask the \ncompetitors how Government subsidies would help pay for the design and \ndevelopment of the tanker--the subject of the very WTO dispute I just \nmentioned.\n  According to that article, Northrop made threats in order to shape \nthe criteria the Air Force followed.\n  The Times reports:\n\n       Northrop threatened at one point to pull out of the \n     competition if the Air Force didn't change the way the \n     aircraft would be evaluated.\n\n  So did the Air Force pull a bait and switch with this contract? Did \nit unfairly change the process to benefit EADS?\n  I believe there are many serious questions about this selection \nprocess. As U.S. Senators, it is our job to consider the future of our \nnational security and our defense. I believe we need open and honest \nanswers to those questions before this contract is finalized. In fact, \nI think we ought to demand the answers. Our economy and our aerospace \nindustry are suffering, and we are at war across the globe. We have to \nget this right. Our future depends on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1789-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1789-S1791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about three issues that \nI think are vitally important for our national security. First, there \nis this matter of terrorist surveillance and our national security.\n  This body passed the bipartisan FISA Act bill overwhelmingly--more \nthan 2 to 1--several days before the Protect America Act was to expire. \nThe Director of National Intelligence has told us how important this \nbill is because without it, intelligence gaps likely will reopen, \nputting the safety of America--those of us in the United States--and \nour troops on the battlefield at risk. Yet the House Speaker refuses to \nallow a vote on the Senate's bill, even though a majority of House \nMembers support its passage. If you vote, that means something. If you \nwin, you win; if you lose, you lose. But the leadership in the House \napparently thinks those rules don't apply to the FISA debate.\n  Even though the Speaker failed to pass a 21-day extension of the \nexisting law in her own body, the leadership has acted as though the \nPAA deadline was extended. There has been no action.\n  So what is the House going to do this week? Well, the Speaker has \nsignaled that the House will vote on overriding the President's veto of \nthe 2008 intelligence authorization bill, even though she knows there \nare not enough votes to override the vote. Why? Because apparently, the \nHouse leadership has decided it is more important to make a political \nstatement about interrogation techniques than to give the intelligence \ncommunity the tools it needs to conduct surveillance of foreign \nintelligence.\n  The IC--the intelligence community--needs these tools and authorities \nthat are provided in the bill we passed. They are working tirelessly to \nprotect us from real and constant terrorist threats, and they should \nnot have to wait any longer for the House to pass that measure.\n  Secondly, let me talk about Korea briefly. I just came from an \nAppropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing with General Bell, our \ncommanding general in Korea. He told us that not just a brave new wind \nbut a typhoon has blown through South Korea, and the previous \ngovernment that was in many ways anti-American was totally willing to \naccommodate North Korea in all of its efforts, which included building \nmissiles and nuclear weapons, and rebuff the United States.\n  Well, the people of Korea had enough, and they overwhelmingly elected \na new President, President Lee Myung-bak, who ran on a platform of \nrevitalizing the economy, making any actions with North Korea \nreciprocal, and improving their alliance with the U.S. position. The \ncandidate who came in second agreed with him on these issues. The \nprevious leadership candidate got single digits.\n  The most important things we can do are to increase our trade and our \nmilitary assistance to South Korea. South\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\nKorea is already our largest importer for military equipment, and they \nlive in a very dangerous part of the world. They are right next door to \nChina and close to bordering on Russia, just across the straits from \nJapan, and they are potentially--they have been and they will be our \nmost important ally. But we have given higher foreign military sales \nstatus to three former Soviet Union States and five countries from the \nWarsaw Pact, none of which are as good friends as South Korea.\n  I have filed a bill, S. 1846, the United States-Republic of Korea \nDefense Cooperation and Improvement Act of 2007, that would give them \nthe status of NATO plus 3, so we could continue to expand on our vital \ndefense trade with them. He says this is his top priority. We are \nalready cooperating with them. There is new cooperation. There is an \nopportunity to build an even stronger ally in the region to help keep \nthat region safe, peaceful, and secure.\n  Secondarily, for Korea, we also need to approve the United States-\nKorea Free Trade Agreement. Free trade is one of the best ways we have \nof assuring that other countries get the development they need, we can \ndevelop the friendship we have and improve our economy and theirs. A \nKorea-United States trade agreement would give lower tariff barriers, \nand get rid of many of them, to keep our agriculture, machine goods, \nand high-tech goods from going into South Korea. We need to do that.\n  But there are political objections. That brings me to the third \nimportant point: Colombia. Colombia has pending with the United States \na United States-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. As I have just said, \ntrade and commercial ties are one of the most effective arrows in our \nquiver of smart power. In Colombia, it is an affirmation of support to \nour friends. They are our strongest ally on an increasingly left-\nleaning continent--another area where they are our best friends in a \ndangerous area.\n  The administration of the President of Colombia, President Uribe, \nfinds itself surrounded by states determined to undermine Colombia's \nburgeoning democracy. The states around them provide safe haven to \ninsurgent terrorist groups, allowing them freedom to maneuver in border \nareas, and they even provide monetary support for drug and terror \nactivities against President Uribe's government in Colombia. If we are \nserious, as we must be, about maintaining peace, security, and \nstability in Latin America, the northern part of Latin America, we must \nwork with them.\n  Free trade will not only expand our economic and commercial ties, but \nit will strengthen the critical cultural ties and strategic alliances, \nand that will lead to a more peaceful and stable world.\n  At a time when America's image is suffering in the world and our \neconomy at home is slumping, we should be helping our friends and \nallies and expanding our export opportunities to create jobs here.\n  If the Democratic leadership in Congress is so concerned about \nimproving America's image abroad and helping our slumping economy, why \ndon't we start by helping our friends? We can do that by opening up \nmarkets for exports. Friends like Colombia and Korea are fighting \nterrorism, embracing America's values. It is a solid security rock for \nus to build upon.\n  In Colombia, the interdiction of two high-value targets--senior \nterror planners and former operators--is a testimony to the Uribe \nadministration's commitment to ending terror in his country. It is \nimportant to remember that the terrorist group FARC currently holds \nmore than 700 political and military prisoners. Three of them are \nAmericans. Yet our Democratic colleagues, through all their rhetoric, \nseem to care more about improving our image with rogue regimes such as \nSyria and Iran than helping our friends in places such as Colombia and \nKorea. Their rejection of the free-trade agreements damages our \nstrategic alliances and says to the world that the United States is \nclosed for business. And it does so at a time when we need to be open \nfor business, open for better ties.\n  So why, in light of the economic and strategic benefits of the \nColombia FTA, are the Democrats determined to delay and deny these \nbenefits? Why, through their actions, are they emboldening Venezuelan \nleftist Hugo Chavez and undercutting the President of Colombia, who is \na friend? President Uribe has done more to reduce violence in Colombia \nthan any modern leader in Bogota, including crimes against labor \nunionists. He has pushed back Marxist guerrillas of the Revolutionary \nArmed Forces of Colombia, FARC, and the National Liberation Army, the \nELN. He has reduced crime and substantially improved Colombia's \nsecurity and economic situations, with official statistics showing \nmurders plummeting by as much as 50 percent and kidnappings by as much \nas 75 percent.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal, which I will submit later, is entitled \n``Delaying and Denying.'' They sum it up like this:\n\n       What is it about Democrats and Hugo Chavez? Even as the \n     Venezuelan strongman was threatening war last week against \n     Colombia, Congress was threatening to hand him a huge \n     strategic victory by spurning Colombia's free trade overtures \n     to the U.S.\n       This isn't the first time Democrats have come to Mr. \n     Chavez's aid, but it would be the most destructive. The \n     Venezuelan is engaged in a high-stakes competition over the \n     political and economic direction of Latin America. He wants \n     the region to follow his path of ever greater state control \n     of the economy, while assisting U.S. enemies wherever he can. \n     He's already won converts in Bolivia and Ecuador, and he came \n     far too close for American comfort in Mexico's election last \n     year.\n       Meanwhile, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is embracing \n     greater economic and political freedom. He has bravely \n     assisted the U.S. fight against narco-traffickers, and he now \n     wants to link his country more closely to America with a free \n     trade accord. As a strategic matter, to reject Colombia's \n     offer now would tell everyone in Latin America that it is far \n     more dangerous to trust America than it is to trash it.\n\n  Mr. President, continuing to deny and delay Colombia TPA will be a \ngreat disadvantage to America's economy, damage our reputation in \nColombia and throughout Latin America, undercut a key ally in President \nUribe, and further embolden anti-American dictators like Hugo Chavez, \nultimately resulting in a less secure and stable Latin America.\n  Mr. President, I call upon and urge my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to let us bring up for a vote and pass the Korean free-\ntrade agreement and the Colombia free-trade agreement. Not only will \nthat benefit us economically, it will strengthen the U.S. image \nthroughout the world and help build a stable, strategic ally in \nColombia that can stop the threat of more regimes committed to the \nMarxism that Cuba so famously demonstrated, which brought destruction \nand hardship to the people of Cuba.\n  These are important foreign policy matters. One leader in the \nmajority on the other side of the body said: Well, politically, we \ncannot do it. Politically, we cannot help those who help us? \nPolitically, we cannot pass a bill that will keep our country safer by \npassing the FISA bill? Politically, we cannot help an ally such as \nSouth Korea, which is in a very strategic position? And politically, we \ncannot help Colombia, which is fighting narcotraffickers as well as the \nefforts by Hugo Chavez for spreading a Marxist regime and the \ntotalitarian government which impoverishes and denies rights to his \ncitizens?\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides to make these matters a serious concern and see if we can do the \njob for which we were elected--to help keep our country safe and \nsecure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the \nWall Street Journal of today, March 10, 2008, called ``The Chavez \nDemocrats'' be printed in the Record, along with a similar and very \ncompelling article on the op-ed page of the Washington Post, by Jackson \nDiehl, called ``The FARC's Guardian Angel,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 10, 2008]\n\n                          The Chavez Democrats\n\n       What is it about Democrats and Hugo Chavez? Even as the \n     Venezuelan strongman was threatening war last week against \n     Colombia, Congress was threatening to hand him a huge \n     strategic victory by spurning Colombia's free trade overtures \n     to the U.S.\n       This isn't the first time Democrats have come to Mr. \n     Chavez's aid, but it would be the most destructive. The \n     Venezuelan is engaged in a high-stakes competition over the \n     political and economic direction of Latin America. He wants \n     the region to follow his path of\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n     ever greater state control of the economy, while assisting \n     U.S. enemies wherever he can. He's already won converts in \n     Bolivia and Ecuador, and he came far too close for American \n     comfort in Mexico's election last year.\n       Meanwhile, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is embracing \n     greater economic and political freedom. He has bravely \n     assisted the U.S. fight against narco-traffickers, and he now \n     wants to link his country more closely to America with a \n     free-trade accord. As a strategic matter, to reject \n     Colombia's offer now would tell everyone in Latin America \n     that it is far more dangerous to trust America than it is to \n     trash it.\n       Yet Democrats on Capitol Hill are doing their best to help \n     Mr. Chavez prevail against Mr. Uribe. Even as Mr. Chavez was \n     doing his war dance, Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus was \n     warning the White House not to send the Colombia deal to the \n     Hill for a vote without the permission of Democratic leaders. \n     He was seconded by Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel, \n     who told Congress Daily that ``they don't have the votes for \n     it, it's not going to come on the floor,'' adding that ``what \n     they [the White House] don't understand it's not the facts on \n     the ground, it's the politics that's in the air.''\n       Mr. Rangel is right about the politics. No matter what U.S. \n     strategic interests may be in Colombia, this is an election \n     year in America. And Democrats don't want to upset their \n     union and anti-trade allies. The problem is that the time \n     available to pass anything this year is growing short. The \n     closer the election gets, the more leverage protectionists \n     have to run out the clock on the Bush Presidency. The deal \n     has the support of a bipartisan majority in the Senate, and \n     probably also in the House. Sooner or later the White House \n     will have to force the issue.\n       Our guess is that Messrs. Baucus and Rangel understand the \n     stakes and privately favor the accord. The bottleneck is \n     Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is refusing to allow a vote under \n     pressure from her left-wing Members. These Democrats deride \n     any link between Hugo Chavez and trade as a ``scare tactic,'' \n     as if greater economic prosperity had no political \n     consequences. ``President Bush's recent fear-mongering on \n     trade shows just how desperate he is to deliver one final \n     victory for multinational corporations,'' declared Illinois \n     Democrat Phil Hare, who is one of Ms. Pelosi's main trade \n     policy deputies.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2008]\n\n                       The FARC's Guardian Angel\n\n                           (By Jackson Diehl)\n\n       Latin American nations and the Bush administration spent \n     the past week loudly arguing over what censure, if any, \n     Colombia should face for a bombing raid that killed one of \n     the top leaders of the FARC terrorist group at a jungle camp \n     in Ecuador. More quietly, they are just beginning to consider \n     a far more serious and potentially explosive question: What \n     to do about the revelation that Venezuelan President Hugo \n     Chavez forged a strategic alliance with the FARC aimed at \n     Colombia's democratic government.\n       First reports of the documents recovered from laptops at \n     the FARC camp spoke of promises by Chavez to deliver up to \n     $300 million to a group renowned for kidnapping, drug \n     trafficking and massacres of civilians; they also showed that \n     Ecuadoran President Rafel Correa was prepared to remove from \n     his own army officers who objected to the FARC's Ecuadoran \n     bases.\n       But in their totality, the hundreds of pages of documents \n     so far made public by Colombia paint an even more chilling \n     picture. The raid appears to have preempted a breathtakingly \n     ambitious ``strategic plan'' agreed on by Chavez and the FARC \n     with the initial goal of gaining international recognition \n     for a movement designated a terrorist organization by both \n     the United States and Europe. Chavez then intended to force \n     Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to negotiate a political \n     settlement with the FARC, and to promote a candidate allied \n     with Chavez and the FARC to take power from Uribe.\n       All this is laid out in a series of three e-mails sent in \n     February to the FARC's top leaders by Ivan Marquez and \n     Rodrigo Granda, envoys who held a series of secret meetings \n     with Chavez. Judging from the memos, Chavez did most of the \n     talking: He outlines a five-stage plan for undermining \n     Uribe's government, beginning with the release of several of \n     the scores of hostages the FARC is holding.\n       The first e-mail, dated Feb. 8, discusses the money: It \n     says that Chavez, whom they call ``angel,'' ``has the first \n     50 [million] available and has a plan to get us the remaining \n     200 in the course of the year.'' Chavez proposed sending the \n     first ``packet'' of money ``through the black market in order \n     to avoid problems.'' He said more could be arranged by giving \n     the FARC a quota of petroleum to sell abroad or gasoline to \n     retail in Colombia or Venezuela.\n       Chavez then got to the plans that most interested him. He \n     wanted the FARC to propose collecting all of its hostages in \n     the open, possibly in Venezuela, for a proposed exchange for \n     500 FARC prisoners in Colombian jails. Chavez said he would \n     travel to the area for a meeting with the FARC's top leader, \n     Manuel Marulanda, and said the presidents of Ecuador, \n     Nicaragua and Bolivia would accompany him. Meanwhile, Chavez \n     said he would set up a new diplomatic group, composed of \n     those countries and the FARC, plus Mexico, Brazil and \n     Argentina, for the purpose of recognizing the FARC as a \n     legitimate ``belligerent'' in Colombia and forcing Uribe into \n     releasing its prisoners.\n       In ``the early morning hours,'' the FARC envoys recounted \n     in a Feb. 9 e-mail, Chavez reached the subject of whether the \n     release of Ingrid Betancourt, a former Colombian presidential \n     candidate who is the FARC's best-known hostage, would \n     complicate his plan to back a pro-FARC alternative to Uribe. \n     ``He invites the FARC to parcipate in a few sessions of \n     analysis he has laid out for following the Colombian \n     political situation,'' the e-mail concluded.\n       Assuming these documents are authentic--and it's hard to \n     believe that the cerebral and calculating Uribe would \n     knowingly hand over forgeries to the world media and the \n     Organization of American States--both the Bush administration \n     and Latin Amerian governments will have fateful decisions to \n     make about Chavez. His reported actions are, first of all, a \n     violation of UN. Security Council Resolution 1373, passed in \n     September 2001, which prohibits all states from providing \n     financing or havens to terrorist organizations. More \n     directly, the Colombian evidence would be more than enough to \n     justify a State Department decision to cite Venezuela as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism. Once cited, Venezuela would be \n     subject to a number of automatic sanctions, some of which \n     could complicate its continuing export of oil to the United \n     States. A cutoff would temporarily inconvenience Americans--\n     and cripple Venezuela, which could have trouble selling its \n     heavy oil in other markets.\n       For now, the Bush administration appears anxious to avoid \n     this kind of confrontation. U.S. intelligence agencies are \n     analyzing the Colombian evidence; officials say they will \n     share any conclusions with key Latin American governments. \n     Yet those governments have mostly shrunk from confronting \n     Chavez in the past, and some have quietly urged Bush to take \n     him on. If the president decides to ignore clear evidence \n     that Venezuela has funded and conspired with an officially \n     designated terrorist organization, he will flout what has \n     been his first principle since Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the concurrent budget resolution, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 70) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2009 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2008 and 2010 through 2013.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to be informed when I have \nused 45 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so inform the \nSenator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we come to the floor with a budget \nresolution that came out of the committee last week. I think it is \nimportant to set the stage in recognition of the fiscal condition of \nthe country as we present this budget.\n  We have seen a dramatic deterioration in the budget situation under \nthis President. As we all know, he inherited a budget that was in \nsurplus; in fact, a budget that was estimated to have a future of \nsurpluses so large that the head of the Federal Reserve said we were in \ndanger of paying off the Federal debt. That is a danger I would like to \nhave.\n  The President then took us on a fiscal course that has produced four \nof the five largest deficits in our history. In fact, it may turn out \nto be five of the largest deficits in our history, depending on how \nevents unfold this year.\n  We can see in the previous years we were having budget surpluses, and \nthen the President took us into deficit and deepened those deficits \nuntil we reached a record deficit in 2004 of $413\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nbillion. Now we see those levels being challenged in this year and \nperhaps next as well.\n  The result of these massive deficits is this President has built a \nwall of debt that is unprecedented. When President Bush came into \noffice in 2000, the debt at the end of his first year--we do not hold \nhim responsible for his first year because he is working on the budget \nhe inherited--the debt stood at $5.8 trillion. At the end of last year, \nthe debt had reached over $9 trillion. And by the end of 2009, which \nwill be for the 8 years for which he is responsible, we will see the \ndebt will have risen to over $10 trillion. This President will almost \nhave doubled the debt of the United States in just 8 years.\n  Not only will he have almost doubled the debt of the country, the \ngross debt, all of the money we owe, but he will also have more than \ndoubled what we owe to foreign nations. It took 42 Presidents, all the \nPresidents pictured here, 224 years to run up a $1 trillion of U.S. \ndebt held abroad. This President has more than doubled that amount--\nmuch more than doubled that amount--in just 7 years. The result of that \nis we now owe Japan almost $600 billion. We owe China almost $500 \nbillion. We owe the United Kingdom over $150 billion. We owe the oil \nexporters almost $140 billion, and so it goes.\n  That is a warning sign to all of us about the fiscal condition of our \ncountry. The long-term projections are sobering as well. Partly as a \nresult of this tremendous buildup of debt, the value of the dollar has \nshrunk rather dramatically. This chart shows the dollar against the \nEuro. It has gone down 40 percent since 2002. Anybody who has traveled \nhas seen that in what they buy abroad. We see it in the prices of goods \nthat are being imported. We also see it in terms of the kinds of \nreactions we are getting in the marketplace to further American \nindebtedness. We are hearing warnings from people who are saying: \nUnited States, you have to get your fiscal house in order. You cannot \nkeep running up these massive debts and deficits.\n  We see that during this period of the Bush administration that \neconomic growth has lagged previous recoveries. We have gone back and \nlooked at all of the major recoveries since World War II. There have \nbeen nine previous recoveries. At the same point in the business cycle, \nthe economy had typically grown at an average pace of 3.4 percent a \nyear during those previous recoveries.\n  Look at what is happening here. In this recovery, the average GDP \ngrowth is only 2.5 percent, well short of what we have seen at the same \npoint in previous economic cycles.\n  Now we have a new element to consider, and that is a housing slump \nwith new home building falling dramatically. We have seen this pattern \nwhich comes to us from the Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce. \nThis is monthly data through January 2008. These are housing starts in \nmillions of units, and we can see that housing starts have plunged, and \nplunged dramatically. We also have word that inventories of unsold \nhomes are growing, and growing dramatically; that foreclosures are \nrunning at a very alarming rate. And all of this signals trouble in the \neconomy.\n  There are other indicators as well. If we look at business investment \nin this economic period versus what we have seen in the nine previous \nrecoveries since World War II, that growth of business investment is \nlagging in this business cycle by 52 percent. That should tell us there \nis something amiss in the economic policy of this administration. \nSomething is not working. Certainly by comparison with previous \nbusiness cycles, the nine significant business cycles since World War \nII, this one is showing much more weakness than the previous nine.\n  That is also true in job creation. If we look at the nine previous \nbusiness cycles--that is the dotted red line on this chart, and this \nbusiness cycle is the black line--we are now 9.6 million private sector \njobs short of the typical business cycle, going all the way back to \nWorld War II.\n  There are a lot of alarm bells that are ringing, warning signs to \nwhich we need to pay attention and need to respond to in a budget. We \nhave seen real median household income decline by almost $1,000 under \nPresident Bush, from $49,163 in 2000 to just over $48,000 in 2006, the \nlast year for which we have complete statistics.\n  Mr. President, these numbers cry out for a response. And the first \nway that we respond is in a budget because the budget sets the policy \npriorities for the coming year. And we have attempted to do that in \nthis budget by emphasizing strengthening the economy and creating jobs \nby doing the following: investing in energy, education, and \ninfrastructure.\n  Those are the top three priorities to help strengthen the economy. \nInvest in energy. Why? To reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We are \nnow spending $1 billion a day buying foreign oil. How much better off \nwould our country be, how much stronger would the economy be if we were \ngenerating our own energy rather than importing it from around the \nworld?\n  So part of this budget is designed to reduce our dependence on \nforeign energy and to strengthen our education and our job training \nbecause if we are not the best educated and best trained, we are not \ngoing to command the strongest economy for very long.\n  Also, to build our infrastructure. We all remember the incredible \nsight of the 35-W bridge collapsing last year. I think we all recognize \nthat our airports, our rail lines, our highways and bridges need \nserious investment if we are going to be competitive globally.\n  We also need to expand health coverage for our children, provide tax \ncuts for the middle class, and restore fiscal responsibility by \nbalancing the budget in 4 years and maintaining balance in the fifth.\n  Mr. President, we also want to make America safer by supporting the \ntroops, by providing for veterans health care, by protecting the \nhomeland, and rejecting the President's cuts in law enforcement. For \nexample, he eliminates the COPS Program. He cuts first responders' \ngrants by 78 percent. We don't think that makes sense, and we reject \nthose cuts in this budget.\n  Mr. President, we now anticipate that economic growth is going to \nslow sharply in this year. We can see it all around us--more job \nlayoffs announced today, dramatic slowing of the economy. Economists \ntoday are saying they believe our country is already in recession. Of \ncourse, we will not know for several months, but it has all the \nappearance of a reduction in economic growth. The Congressional Budget \nOffice is forecasting for this year an economic growth of only 1.6 \npercent, down from the 2.5 percent pace over the course of 2007 and 2.6 \npercent in 2006.\n  And, by the way, these were already weak economic growth numbers. \n2006 was weak, 2007 was weak, and CBO is expecting even weaker growth \nin 2008. So in this budget resolution we provide for a second stimulus \npackage. We have already had one stimulus package to try to increase \naggregate demand in the economy, to give a lift. We believe it is \nprudent to provide the room in the budget for a second stimulus \npackage, some $35 billion of standby authority, so if this economy does \ncontinue to shed jobs and to weaken that we are prepared to respond and \nprepared to respond in these ways:\n  Housing relief. We have legislation on the floor now to provide \nrelief for what is happening in the housing market. That package is a \n$16 billion or $17 billion package that could be accommodated in this \n$35 billion of standby stimulus relief.\n  Also, we may need to extend unemployment insurance and provide for \nadditional funding for food stamps or perhaps State fiscal relief. We \nknow 21 of the States are increasingly in difficult financial straits, \nso we may need to extend some relief to them.\n  This budget also provides room for additional funding for low-income \nheating assistance and the WIC Program, the women, infant, and \nchildren's feeding program, and/or infrastructure spending in 2008.\n  When we did the last stimulus program, we asked the agencies of the \nGovernment if they had construction projects that were ready to go--\nwhere the engineering has been done, the design has been done, the land \nacquisition is finished--and all they need is money to begin \nconstruction and to begin hiring people. And they told us, yes, they do \nhave projects like that. So we have provided for taking up some of \nthose projects as part of the stimulus package.\n  Why? Because we know in road building, highway construction, and \nbridge\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nconstruction that for every $1 billion, there are about 45,000 jobs \ncreated. And, Mr. President, we think it is very important that standby \nauthority be ready to go if indeed this economy weakens further.\n  We also provide for tax relief in this budget resolution: the \nalternative minimum tax. If something is not done, it will affect 20 \nmillion more American families this year--the alternative minimum tax. \nSo we provide an additional year's relief from that levy.\n  We also provide the energy tax incentives necessary to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, education tax incentives to make college \nmore affordable for American families, and we provide the stimulus \npackage, where I previously described some of the provisions, and they \nhelp the housing industry. Our tax provisions would fit in that $35 \nbillion package; for example, extending net operating loss provisions \nto home building companies so they aren't buffeted by further write-\ndowns of their assets at the worst possible time.\n  And, of course, the important tax extenders, those permanent \nprovisions that are about to expire that provide for the research and \ndevelopment credit, the wind energy credit, and the like, those are \nprovided for in this budget resolution as well.\n  The first amendment that will be offered to this budget will be to \nextend the middle-class tax provisions previously enacted. Those \nprovisions are about to expire, and we want to extend them. Those are \nthe marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, and the 10-percent \nbracket. There is room in this budget to extend them all and still \nbalance the budget in 4 years.\n  There is also room in this budget for estate tax reform along the \nlines of what we advocated last year. As you know, we faced this \nunusual situation where the exemption per person, the $3.5 million next \nyear but the year after, in 2010, there will be no estate tax. In 2011, \nthe estate tax comes back with only $1 million per person exemptions. \nSo we provide the continuation of the $3.5 million exemption per person \nand have that indexed for inflation.\n  Mr. President, there is not an American family who doesn't know what \nis happening to gas prices. I was just talking to my staff this morning \nabout what they are experiencing. One of my staff--who was caught up in \na horrendous traffic jam yesterday coming from Baltimore and took 2\\1/\n2\\ hours to get here--filled up, and it cost $3.18 a gallon. I filled \nup the other day, and it was over $3.20 a gallon. There are some \nprojections now that gas is going to go to $4 a gallon. Look what is \nhappening just since 2001 when gas was less than $1.50. It has more \nthan doubled in just those 7 years, and we see it continuing to jump. I \nam told oil prices today are also rising on world markets. There was \nsome speculation that oil might reach $108 a barrel today on the world \nmarket.\n  So to address this continuing problem of energy dependence, we are \nproposing in this budget to invest in energy, to create green jobs, to \nreduce our dependence on foreign energy, to strengthen our economy, and \nto help with high home heating costs. We have to do that a package of \nenergy tax incentives of over $13 billion, $3.5 billion over the \nPresident's budget in discretionary funding for energy, and an energy \nreserve fund for investing in clean energy and the environment.\n  We all know there are global climate change initiatives coming before \nCongress. If any of those are adopted, we are going to need a reserve \nfund like this to prepare for it.\n  Education is also a great challenge to us. We see from the National \nScience Foundation a chart that compares what is happening to \nbachelor's degrees in engineering in the thousands in China versus what \nis happening here. You can see we are pretty well flat, with about \n75,000 engineers a year being produced. But look what has happened in \nChina. China is now up to a rate of producing more than 350,000 \nengineers a year. That should serve as another alarm to us because we \nknow engineering is critical to economic growth. And if you are \nproducing many more engineers, you are laying the foundation for \nstronger economic growth in the years ahead.\n  I chose that as just one example. We know there are many others where \nwe face global competition for doing the best job of educating our \nyoung people. So this budget resolution invests in education. It does \nit to generate economic growth and jobs, to prepare the workforce to \ncompete in the global economy, and to make college more affordable and \nto improve student achievement.\n  We seek to do that by providing some $13 billion in education tax \ncuts, some $5.7 billion in funding over the President's budget in \ndiscretionary money for the Department of Education and Head Start, and \na $2 billion education reserve fund for school construction and higher \neducation reauthorization.\n  But it doesn't end with energy and education, Mr. President. It also \nextends to the challenges in infrastructure. We all remember this very \nstriking picture from last year when the bridge on 35-W collapsed \nbetween Minneapolis and St. Paul. That is a bridge I traveled over many \ntimes when my wife was in medical school at the University of \nMinnesota, and I think all of us, our hearts went out to those people. \nImagine the horror of driving home from work and having the bridge fall \nout from under you. We know there were lives lost and people injured. \nThat should not happen. That should not happen anywhere in America. It \nshouldn't happen anywhere in the world.\n  Mr. President, we know there are deficiencies in the infrastructure \nfunding for highways, for bridges, for airports, and for rail, and all \nof those are going to have to be strengthened and improved. This budget \nbegins the process. It begins the process by creating a reserve fund to \nallow for major infrastructure legislation.\n  We have had a group of the country's business leaders come to us and \ntell us they have a plan they think could generate a multiplier effect \nin terms of matching public sector investment with private sector \ninvestment to build infrastructure in this country. We have created a \nreserve fund to allow for the adoption of such legislation if the \ncommittees of jurisdiction proceed, and if they pay for it, if they \nprovide offsets for it.\n  We also provide $3.9 billion more than the President for key \ndiscretionary transportation accounts in 2009, and we provide another \n$6.5 billion to fully fund highways, fully fund transit, increase \nfunding for airport improvement, and fund ready-to-go infrastructure \nprojects.\n  Those are projects that are ready to be built; they only lack the \nmoney. We also fix the highway trust fund shortfall that exists. I \nthink that is roughly $1.4 billion that needs to be dealt with.\n  We not only have challenges and opportunities in education and energy \nand infrastructure, but we also have them in health care. We can see \nthe number of uninsured children in our country has jumped by 700,000 \njust in the year 2006. We went from 8.7 million uninsured children to \n9.4 million. So this budget seeks to make wise and careful investment \nthere to improve health care, to expand coverage, to increase health \nresearch, and to promote food and drug safety. We do that by again \nproviding for a reserve fund that will allow the $35 billion children's \nhealth insurance compromise that was adopted last year but vetoed by \nthe President to once again proceed this year.\n  We also provided $4.4 billion over the President's budget in \ndiscretionary funding for health and a reserve fund to address the cut \nin Medicare physician payments and make other improvements to Medicare. \nWe know the doctors of the country are scheduled for a very sharp cut \nin Medicare payments. I think that is rejected here virtually \nuniversally. But we have to do something about it. We provided a \nreserve fund to address that, so later this year Congress will be able \nto act.\n  The budget resolution also provides $3.2 billion above the \nPresident's for our veterans. We know that veterans funding in the \nPresident's budget is $44.9 billion. We have provided $48.2 billion in \nfunding for our veterans. This is focused on veteran health care, \nprimarily in terms of veterans because we all recognize that is an area \nin which we simply must do better if we are going to keep the \ncommitment that was made to our veterans.\n  In terms of war funding and defense funding, we match the President's \nrequest. He has asked for $2.9 trillion over the next 5 years, and we \nmatched\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\nthat amount in this budget--$2.9 trillion.\n  The budget also provides $2.3 billion more than the President's \nbudget for law enforcement and first responders. This is an area which \nI find utterly inexplicable in the President's budget. President Bush \nsent this Congress a budget that eliminates the COPS Program--\neliminated it. He did not just cut it, he eliminated it. The COPS \nProgram has put 100,000 police officers on the streets in this country, \nput over 250 police officers on the street in my State of North Dakota. \nWhy the President would eliminate the COPS Program eludes me.\n  He has also proposed cutting the first responder grants; that is for \nemergency medical personnel, that is for our firefighters and our other \nfirst responders. He has proposed cutting these grants 78 percent. We \nhave rejected those cuts in this budget at a cost of $2.3 billion.\n  While we have restored funding in certain key priority areas and made \ntargeted investments in reducing our energy dependence and promoting \neducation and in building our infrastructure, we have also sought to be \nfiscally responsible by balancing the budget by the fourth year and \nmaintaining balance in the fifth.\n  Those are the numbers that are in the budget resolution, but this is \nbefore we extend the middle-class tax cuts. When we extend the middle-\nclass tax cuts, these numbers will drop dramatically, but we will still \nbe in surplus, we will still be balancing by 2012, by the fourth year, \nand be maintaining balance in the fifth. But we do think it is \ncritically important to extend the middle-class tax cuts and to reform \nthe estate tax, which previous legislation has left in a chaotic state, \nI think would be a fair way to say it.\n  We also, under this budget resolution, bring down the debt as a share \nof gross domestic product each and every year. Again, this is before \nthe amendment to extend the middle-class tax cuts, but you will see the \nsame pattern after we extend the middle-class tax cuts--the debt as a \nshare of GDP going down each and every year of the 5 years--because we \nthink that is critically important for the long-term economic health of \nthe country.\n  This is a comparison of spending under the resolution and the \nPresident's budget. The red line is the President's spending line, the \ngreen line is ours. You can see there is very little difference. That \nis a difference of 2.1 percent in overall spending over the 5 years. So \nwe do have some additional spending to meet these priorities in \neducation and energy and infrastructure and reducing the cuts the \nPresident proposed for law enforcement, weatherization, and other \npriorities.\n  Spending as a share of GDP under the resolution goes down each and \nevery year, from 20.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 19 percent of GDP in \n2013, applying the spending discipline that I think is necessary, that \nI think most of us would say is necessary if we are going to address \nthese problems of deficit and debt. The first thing we have to do is \nbring down the deficit, and this budget seeks to do that.\n  We also, for this year, for 2009--this shows the overall spending \ndifference for this year. I have showed the spending comparison for 5 \nyears showing that we are spending 2.2 percent more, but I think it is \nalso important to look at 2009, the first year of this 5-year budget, \non overall spending. We are spending 1 percent more than the \nPresident--1 percent more.\n  Some say: Well, you should not spend more than the President did. But \nthe problem is, he had cuts that I do not think are broadly embraced by \nthe American people. I do not think they think we should eliminate the \nCOPS Program. I do not think they think we should eliminate \nweatherization. I do not think they believe we should cut the grants to \nfirst responders, our emergency personnel, by 78 percent. I do not \nthink the American people think we should fail to invest in reducing \nour dependence on foreign energy. I do not think that is what the \nAmerican people want. I do not think they believe we should continue to \ndramatically underfund infrastructure, which leads to bridges \ncollapsing in our country. So we have spent more than the President--in \ntotal for 2009, 1 percent more. That 1 percent will go to those high-\npriority areas of energy, education, and infrastructure.\n  On the revenue side, this is the comparison when the middle-class tax \ncuts are extended. We will have 2.6 percent more revenue than in the \nPresident's budget--2.6 percent more revenue than in the President's \nbudget.\n  Now, this shows that difference in revenue. The President's budget \nhas $15.2 trillion over the 5 years, and our budget is $15.6 trillion--\na 2.6-percent difference. Because we have more revenue, of course, we \nhave the ability to fund in those high-priority areas but still balance \nthe budget in the fourth year and maintain balance in the fifth. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the President's budget \ndoes balance in the fourth year but then promptly falls back out of \nbalance in the fifth year. Our budget not only balances by the fourth \nyear but stays in balance in the fifth.\n  Now, this is where we get into the question of, Well, how do you come \nup with 2.6 percent more revenue than the President has? I believe you \ncan come up with the 2.6-percent more revenue than the President has by \nlooking at three areas: the tax gap--that is the difference between \nwhat is owed and what is paid. The Internal Revenue Service tells us \nthat for 2001 the tax gap was over $300 billion; that is, the vast \nmajority of us pay what we owe, but some do not. Before we ask for a \ntax increase from anyone, I think we ought to go to those who are not \npaying what they owe. Now, I think that is the first thing we ought to \ndo before we ask for a tax increase from anyone.\n  But it is not just the tax gap, it is also those offshore tax havens \nthat are proliferating and costing us a lot of money. There is a report \nfrom the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations from February of last \nyear. This is what they said:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year, including $40 to $70 billion from individuals and \n     another $30 billion from corporations engaging in offshore \n     tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add tens of billions of \n     dollars more.\n\n  Shame on us for allowing this kind of abuse to occur. Let me say, \nthere have been some in this Chamber who have made a serious effort to \nclose this kind of scam down, and I would be the first to recognize the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley of Iowa, who \nhas been very serious about going after not only abusive tax shelters \nbut offshore tax havens.\n  Here is an example of what is going on. There is a little five-story \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands called Ugland House, a nice little \nbuilding; 12,748 companies call it home. Mr. President, 12,748 \ncompanies say they are doing business out of this little five-story \nbuilding. Can you imagine having 12,000 companies conducting business \nout of that little building? Of course they are not conducting \nbusiness; the only business they are conducting is monkey business \nbecause what they are doing is cheating all of the rest of us who pay \nour taxes. They are engaged in very ambitious tax scams and tax schemes \nto avoid paying what they owe in this country.\n  Here is a picture of a building that was in the Boston Globe. Let's \nput up the Boston Globe story. This was a building that is also in the \nCayman Islands where shell companies allowed KBR to avoid Medicare and \nSocial Security deductions.\n  This story says:\n\n       Kellogg, Brown and Root, the nation's top Iraq war \n     contractor, and until last year a subsidiary of Halliburton, \n     has avoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring workers through \n     shell companies based in this tropical tax haven.\n\n  So what they were doing is hiring people paid for by American \ntaxpayers, hiring them for contracts, and they were running them \nthrough these shell operations down in the Cayman Islands, and by doing \nthat they were avoiding paying their Medicare and Social Security taxes \nto this country and saved hundreds of millions of dollars, according to \nthis story in the Boston Globe from March 6 of this year. This is just \ndays ago that this story appeared.\n  They point out:\n\n       More than 21,000 people working for KBR in Iraq, including \n     10,000 Americans, are listed as employees of two companies \n     that exist in a computer file on the fourth floor of a \n     building on a palm-studded boulevard here in the Caribbean. \n     Neither company has an office or phone number in the Cayman \n     Islands.\n\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\n\n  They do not even have a phone number. They do not even have a real \noffice. What they have is a scam. This is the kind of scam we ought to \nshut down.\n  Here is the building, a very nice building. On the fourth floor of \nthis building, apparently 21,000 people are supposedly employed, at \nleast for the purpose of records.\n  Now, it does not stop there. This is a story from late last month in \nthe New York Times:\n\n       U.S. among countries investigating tax evasion.\n\n  This is in Liechtenstein. I have never been to Liechtenstein. I am \nsure it is a lovely place. But the Internal Revenue Service says:\n\n       It was beginning enforcement action against more than 100 \n     U.S. taxpayers on suspicion of evading taxes through \n     investments in Liechtenstein.\n\n  They have the Deputy Director of the Center for Tax Policy and \nAdministration at the OECD saying Liechtenstein is the tip of the \niceberg. Indeed, it is.\n  This kind of scam is going on down in the Cayman Islands, going on in \nLiechtenstein, going on in other tax haven places, but it is also \nhappening with abusive tax shelters. Last year, I showed pictures of \nEuropean sewer systems. People might ask: What does a European sewer \nsystem have to do with revenue in the United States? It turns out it \nhas a lot to do with it because it turns out U.S. companies are buying \nEuropean sewer systems. Later on in this debate I will show a picture \nof one of those. It may not be the most welcome picture on the Senate \nfloor, of a European sewer system, but, nonetheless, this is part of an \nincredible scam that is going on in which U.S. companies buy European \nsewer systems, write them off on their books in the United States for \ntax purposes, and lease them back to the European cities that built \nthem in the first place. That should not be allowed. That is not fair \nto the rest of us who pay what we owe.\n  Last year, when we went after some of these scams, the President \nthreatened a veto. He said that would be a tax increase. I guess it \nwould be a tax increase on those who are getting away without paying \nwhat they fairly owe, but I don't consider it a tax increase to make \npeople pay what they already owe. I don't consider it a tax increase to \nshut down a tax scam. I don't consider it a tax increase to shut down \nthese abusive tax shelters.\n  We tried to codify economic substance, prohibiting transactions with \nno economic rationale, done solely to evade taxes. We tried to shut \ndown schemes to lease foreign subway and sewer systems and depreciate \nassets. We tried to end deferral of offshore compensation by hedge fund \nmanagers trying to evade current taxation. We tried to expand broker \nreporting. We tried to tax people who use expatriation to evade taxes. \nOver and over the President said: No, I will have to veto because that \nwould be a tax increase.\n  I think the President has it entirely wrong. Those are not tax \nincreases. Those are just making those folks pay what the rest of us \nare already paying.\n  In this budget we provide a number of enforcement mechanisms to try \nto help restore some fiscal discipline. We have discretionary caps for \n2008 and 2009. We maintain a strong pay-go rule. We have a point of \norder against long-term deficit increases. We allow reconciliation for \ndeficit reduction only, and we have a point of order against mandatory \nspending on an appropriations bill. These are important enforcement \nmechanisms that ought to be part of any budget resolution. They are \npart of ours. I hope they are adopted by my colleagues.\n  Finally, this budget resolution has provisions addressing long-term \nchallenges. More daunting than any of our short-term problems is where \nthis is all headed. We can't pay our bills now; that is, before the \nbaby boomers retire. What is going to happen then? What is going to \nhappen to the commitments that have been made in Social Security and \nMedicare? What is going to happen with this tremendous imbalance \nbetween spending and revenue? We have offered these three elements as \npart of an approach, understanding that the larger plan to deal with \nour fiscal problems is going to have to come in some sort of special \nprocess, a process that Senator Gregg and I have offered our colleagues \nto create a task force with 16 Members--eight Democrats, eight \nRepublicans--and ask them to come back with a plan as to how to deal \nwith long-term imbalances.\n  In this resolution, we have comparative effectiveness reserve fund \nand cap adjustment to deal with health care. One of the things we know \nis that lots of different health modalities are being used across the \ncountry to address illness. Some of them work and some don't. We have \nto know which ones work.\n  Second, we have program integrity initiatives to crack down on waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Social Security and Medicare. In fact, I received a \nletter from the Secretary of Health, Secretary Leavitt, thanking us for \nthe program integrity funds that we have included so that he can \ncontinue his important investigations to shut down these Medicare fraud \noperations that he found in Florida and other parts of the country last \nyear and that he is continuing to crackdown on.\n  He found a circumstance in which you go to these strip malls, and \nhalf of the offices in the strip malls are front organizations \ncollecting Medicare payments. You go to the door and nobody is there \nduring the day, during work time. They are just billing mills. They are \nsending out Medicare bills. Goodness knows if any service is actually \nbeing extended or not. But these are scams that are operating that need \nto be shut down.\n  We also have a point of order against long-term deficit increases \nwhich is important to any strategy to contain burgeoning deficits and \ndebt.\n  Before yielding the floor, I want to ask our colleagues for their \ncooperation. This is going to be an especially challenging budget. The \nnumbers are very close on the two sides. We have two Presidential \ncandidates on this side. They have a Presidential candidate on the \nother side. We know they may not be here for all of the deliberations. \nThat means we are going to have to coordinate and cooperate. We also \nhave a Member on our side who is ill. That means we will have a special \nchallenge getting the budget done this year, but we must do it. We must \nget it done. I will be asking for all of our colleagues' cooperation as \nwe proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the chairman spoke about his budget. For \nSenator Gregg, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I would like \nto start this debate on the Republican side. Since we are on the budget \nresolution, Senator Gregg would usually open debate for our side of the \naisle. He wanted to take the lead today but has a necessary conflict in \nhis schedule. He asked me to substitute, and I am pleased to do so. \nSenator Gregg will be here tomorrow to give what is normally the \nopening statement by the senior member of the Budget Committee on the \nRepublican side.\n  I am going to first talk about the process and recent history of the \nSenate budget resolutions. Almost all of the revenue side of the budget \nis Finance Committee jurisdiction. Most of the spending side of the \nbudget is also Finance Committee jurisdiction. For those of us who sit \non the Finance Committee, we need to pay very careful attention to the \nbudget. Chairman Conrad, along with Senator Wyden of Oregon and Senator \nStabenow of Michigan, are all Finance Committee Democrats. This \nSenator, along with Senators Bunning, Crapo, and Ensign are all Finance \nCommittee Republicans.\n  When I was Finance chairman for part of the year 2001 and all of the \nyears 2003 through 2006, there was coordination regarding the fiscal \nresources and fiscal demands on the Finance Committee. That \ncoordination occurred with respect to revenue levels, spending levels, \nand reconciliation instructions. Did we always agree over those years? \nThe answer is no. Did we compromise when we had disagreements? The \nanswer is most often yes. We did have some different priorities, but we \nworked through those differences during this committee's budget \nprocess. We came up with compromises that largely held together. I \nmight add, those compromises and the levels regarding revenue spending \nand reconciliation instructions were in sync with the administration. \nMy point is that we hashed out the fiscal differences in the Budget \nCommittee and\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\non the Senate floor. The committee and floor debate, amendment votes, \nboth pro and con, made a very real difference. The product of that \nprocess, the budget resolution that we will vote on as the last vote \nprobably this week, the product made a real difference.\n  Those budget resolutions, though not perfect, provided me, while I \nwas chairman of the Finance Committee, with the budget resources to \ndeal with the policy demands on the Finance Committee. Most often, I \nused these resources to guide the Finance Committee, usually in a \nbipartisan manner, to deal with short-term, midterm, and even long-term \nproblems. Last year was different. After the people spoke in the \nNovember 2006 elections, control of the Senate changed from Republican \nto Democrat, and the budget resolution was basically a Democratic \nresolution.\n  This year we see some repetition of last year's dramatically \ndifferent fiscal path. As with the rest of the Budget Committee \nRepublicans, I learned about this resolution for the first time when \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee put the markup document before the \ncommittee. Committee Democrats were consulted extensively, along with \nthe Democratic caucus. Most of the Republicans' knowledge prior to \nmarkup was derived from what we read in the press. I don't say this to \nbe critical of the Democratic leadership. It is unfortunate but perhaps \nnecessary that budgets are usually partisan documents. So I would say, \nwith all due respect to the chairman, the chairman's mark was developed \nexclusively by Democrats in a partisan fashion.\n  Republicans, during committee markup, used that markup to educate \nourselves, others on the other side, and the public. We asked \nquestions. I pursued questions about how this budget deals with the \nresources and demands that fall on Senator Baucus and me in our \nrespective roles as chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee. We offered a relatively small number of amendments. Most \nwere defeated; some accepted.\n  On reforming farm program payment limits, I am pleased to say Senator \nAllard's amendment prevailed on a rollcall vote. That amendment \nimproved this resolution, though not enough to gain the support of \nSenator Allard, this Senator, or any other Republicans.\n  Before I discuss the substance of the budget, I want to start off by \ncomplementing the chairman of the committee and his staff. They \nconducted the markup in a professional manner. The Democratic and \nRepublican members have sharp, well-intentioned reasons for coming down \nin different places on the budget resolution. We were able to debate \nthose differences in a full and fair manner.\n  I know if Senator Gregg were here speaking today, he would make these \npoints as well. We are at the Senate floor stage of the budget on \nprocess. What I would like to do is step back and take a look at the \nbudget from three vantage points. It is kind of like we farmers do \nbefore planting season. We look at the condition of the soil and \nprospects of various crops. The first vantage point will be looking at \nwhat the budget purports to do. From this angle, I am going to look at \nwhat the Democratic leadership says the budget is designed to do and \nwhether those purposes make sense from a fiscal standpoint. The second \nvantage point will be looking at how well the budget carries out its \nstated purpose. The third vantage point will be looking at what the \nreconciliation would mean for the Senate. I will address the \nreconciliation in a separate speech later. I believe I will wait until \ntomorrow to do that.\n  Let's start off with the first question: What does the Democratic \nleadership say this budget is designed to do? Then, after stating what \nthey say it does, we need to look at the fiscal consequences of that \npolicy.\n  The budget's proponents claim it is all about fiscal responsibility. \nThere are two basic parts to the Federal ledger: the revenue part and \nthe spending part. If we spend more than we take in, then the Treasury \nsells more debt. This has been the pattern of much of the post-World \nWar II period. If we spend less than we take in, then the Treasury buys \nback debt.\n  When we look at this budget over the short term, it contains a \nmaterial increase in spending. Over the next fiscal year, the \ndiscretionary spending rises by 9 percent over last year's spending.\n  Now, how many Americans got a 9-percent raise? How many American \nfamilies raised their discretionary household spending by 9 percent? On \nthe spending side of the ledger, spending, then, goes up, and I say \nfairly dramatically. You would think proponents of fiscal \nresponsibility would be looking at spending cuts, not 9 percent \nincreases.\n  It is a different story on the other side of the ledger, the revenue \nside. Let me start off with one smidgeon of good news on the revenue \nside in this budget resolution. The alternative minimum tax patch \nexpired the first day of this year. If that patch is not addressed, 25 \nmillion families, most of them middle-income families, would pay an \naverage of at least $2,000 in AMT this year. The chairman reduced the \nrevenue baseline by $62 billion, which is a revenue loss from extending \nthat patch. All middle-income Americans ought to thank the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee--and I thank him on the Senate floor right now--\nfor that provision.\n  Unfortunately, for years beyond 2008, pay-go still applies, so there \nis a big Senate hurdle built into this budget to patching the \nalternative minimum tax in years beyond 2008.\n  The rest of current law expired or expiring tax relief provisions \nwill need to be offset with other tax increases. There are also several \nbipartisan tax bills that would require offsetting tax increases under \nthis budget. That is a very large tax increase over the next fiscal \nyear. My staff calculates that tax increase to be roughly $150 billion.\n  The definition of ``fiscal responsibility'' under this budget, over \nthe fiscal year, is higher spending of $22 billion and higher taxes of \n$150 billion. Is that a legitimate fiscal goal? Is that the notion of \nfiscal responsibility the American people were looking for when they \nturned congressional power over to the Democrats in November 2006? Did \nwe in Congress misread those results? Did the people really want us to \nincrease spending and to raise taxes?\n  Now, that is not what I am hearing from back home. What I heard from \nfolks across Iowa was: Rein in spending. Live within your means.\n  It seems to me if you are going to assume the mantle of fiscal \ndiscipline, you ought to treat a dollar of new tax relief the same as a \ndollar of new spending.\n  What do I mean by ``new spending?'' I mean spending above the \nCongressional Budget Office baseline. And what do I mean by ``new tax \nrelief?'' I mean new tax policy that loses revenue. I do not mean \nextension of existing tax policy.\n  We see the same pattern over the 5-year period of this budget. Over 5 \nyears, the tax hike and the spending increases grow exponentially. On \nthe spending side, discretionary spending grows by $211 billion. When \nyou throw in the special reserve funds, you can add another $300 \nbillion in new spending on top of that.\n  Over the 5 years, the budget assumes a dramatic tax increase--at \nleast $1.2 trillion. In 2011, the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 \nand 2003 will expire. Some folks will call these provisions the Bush \ntax cuts. It is true President Bush signed both bills, but the \nbipartisan compromises occurred in the Finance Committee. In 2011, \nPresident Bush will have been gone from office by more than 2 years. He \nwill probably be hanging around his ranch in Crawford, TX. You can call \nthis package of tax relief for virtually every American the Bush tax \ncuts, but for the taxpayer, if we let them expire, it will be a big tax \nincrease, and it will be a big tax increase that will happen without \neven a vote of Congress.\n  So I have a couple charts in the Chamber. The charts use the analogy \nof a brick wall to show the ugly tax increases Americans are going to \nface.\n  On this chart, you see a family of four. That is the average American \nfamily. Here is the husband, his wife, and two children. The family \nmakes $50,000 a year in income. That is right about the national median \nhousehold income today. For example, the Census Bureau stated, for \n2006, the national median household income was $48,200.\n  Under the Democratic leadership's budget, this family will face a tax \nincrease of $2,300 per year. You see the figure $2,300 for that family \nof four. That is a loss in their paycheck of about $200 per month. It \nis a hit on\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\ntheir yearly budget of $2,300. Where I am from, the Midwest--or \nanyplace in this country, I will bet--that is still a lot of money.\n\n  Now, I have another example. This next chart has the same brick wall \nbut a different family: a single mom with two kids. Here we have a \nperson earning about $30,000 a year. In 2011, under this budget, she \nand her family run straight into that brick wall--that brick tax wall. \nThat is a brick wall of about $1,100 per year of taxes. That is almost \n$100 a month out of this family's budget.\n  So when you hear folks rail against the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax \nrelief plans, you will hear a lot of talk about millionaires, you will \nhear a lot of talk about the death tax, but you will not hear the \ncritics talk about these two families--a family of four: husband, wife, \nand two children; or a single mother with two children. You will not \nhear these critics--almost all of whom voted against these two tax \nbills--consider these two families.\n  Now, those on the other side will point to the Baucus amendment that \nwill be upcoming--at least we have heard about the Baucus amendment--as \nthe answer to the tax increases that I have pointed out. Isn't it \nironic that my friend, our chairman, my partner from the 2001 tax \nrelief bill, and several other tax relief bills, is the author of this \nkey amendment?\n  The Senator from Montana, my friend, Mr. Baucus, took a lot of heat \nfor working with me in a bipartisan fashion in 2001. He took a lot of \nheat from people in his caucus, quite frankly. Many on the other side \nwho fought him and that bill were also denying tax increases in last \nyear's budget. So they now turn to his amendment--this upcoming \namendment--as they did last year, to try to deflect the tax increase \ncharge because there is a real charge in what is in this budget. If \nsomething is not done to stop tax increases, they are going to happen \nautomatically. And don't let anybody tell me something cannot be done \nabout it.\n  At Budget markup, we were told the Baucus amendment would contain \nenough revenue room--$323 billion--to accommodate extension of several \ncomponents of the bipartisan tax relief plans that go back to 2001. We \nwere told the 10-percent bracket, the marriage penalty, the child tax \ncredit, and some death tax relief would be covered.\n  There were provisions that were not intended to be covered. The \nexcluded provisions were the lower rates for capital gains and \ndividends and other marginal rate reductions.\n  Now, some on the other side will describe this excluded group--\nexcluded from the Baucus amendment--as top-rate taxpayers and other \nhigh-income people. Now, I hope you will not believe it. The facts are \notherwise.\n  Low-income folks, including millions of seniors, pay no tax on their \ndividend or capital gains income. If this budget stands, even with \nSenator Baucus's amendment, millions of these low-income taxpayers, \nespecially senior citizens, will pay a 10-percent rate on capital gains \nand could pay as high as a 15-percent rate on dividends.\n  I have a couple charts to show how wide the dividend and capital \ngains tax increases would be. The chart that is up now deals with just \ndividends. It shows the number of taxpayers claiming dividend income. \nNationally, over 24 million families and individuals reported dividend \nincome--24 million Americans. There are 24 million Americans, all of \nwhom you are not going to call filthy rich. Very few of them you are \ngoing to call filthy rich.\n  In my State of Iowa, for instance, over 299,000 families and \nindividuals claimed dividend income on their returns. Now, there are \nnot 299,000 millionaire families or even 299,000 people in Iowa you can \ncall filthy rich.\n  As to capital gains, you can see the numbers not only for my State of \nIowa, but you can see the numbers for all the other States in the \nUnited States. You can see them for the entire United States up there \non the chart. Nationally, we are talking about over 9 million families \nand individuals. In Iowa, we are talking about 127,000 families and \nindividuals when it comes to capital gains.\n  I want to emphasize, I went from dividends to capital gains. The \nchart has changed to tell you what there is in each of the respective \nStates on capital gains.\n  There are many marginal rates, other than the top rate, that would \nrise if this budget stands, even with the Baucus amendment. The 25-\npercent rate, which for 2007 starts at $31,850 for singles and $63,700 \nfor married couples, would rise 3 percentage points to 28 percent. The \n28-percent rate, which for 2007 starts at $77,100 for singles and \n$128,500 for married couples, would rise 3 percentage points to 31 \npercent. The 33-percent rate, which for 2007 starts at $160,850 for \nsingles and $198,850 for married couples, would go up to 36 \npercent. The top rate would rise from the current 35 percent level to \n39.6 percent.\n\n  To sum up, even with the Baucus amendment--even with the Baucus \namendment added to this budget, there would be marginal rate increases \non millions of taxpayers, and not millions of millionaire taxpayers. \nThose marginal rate increases would go up, whether it is the 28 percent \nto 31 percent or the 33 percent to 36 percent or what have you. Those \nmarginal rate increases would reach taxpayers with incomes as low as \n$31,850 for singles and $63,700 for married couples, and these people \nare not filthy rich.\n  Now, what I just described is accurate only if the Democratic \nleadership intends to follow the letter and spirit of the Baucus \namendment. If you look at last year's track record, the House neutered \nthe effect of the amendment in the conference agreement. They created a \nRube Goldberg type of mechanism to impede the amendment. Of course, \nafter the budget conference report was agreed to, all talk and action \naround the amendment ceased. So I wouldn't put much stock in the \nfollowthrough on the Baucus amendment, and things can only get worse \nfor middle-income taxpayers beyond that point.\n  This budget asks a lot of the taxpaying population--about $1.2 \ntrillion worth of a lot being asked of taxpayers. That is a big chunk \non the revenues ledger. Compare that to what is going on on the \nspending side of the ledger. The answer is $211 billion more spending \non the discretionary side. Nothing is proposed to rein in any \nentitlement spending. If the definition of fiscal responsibility is \nhigher spending, no entitlement savings, and dramatically higher taxes, \nthen this budget is fiscally responsible. Keep in mind that while \nramping up $1.2 trillion on the taxpayers, the budget spends $775 \nbillion of the Social Security surplus and grows the gross Federal debt \nby $2 trillion.\n  For those on our side, this budget is not fiscally responsible. We \ndon't agree that the definition of fiscal responsibility is higher \nspending, no entitlement savings, and dramatically higher taxes. For \nthose of us on the Republican side of the aisle, you can't solve all \nfiscal problems just on the tax side of the ledger.\n  Now I wish to go to the second part of my discussion and annualize \nthe tax side of the budget. I am looking at how this budget will carry \nout its objectives.\n  Let's take a look at the short term. By the short term, I am \nreferring to the fiscal year of the budget, and this chart here is for \nthe fiscal year. This is the first fiscal year. That is the first \nfiscal year out of five fiscal years.\n  A lot of people from farm country get their water from wells. When \nthe well water is low, you can either dig it deeper, cut back water \nuse, or pay to have the water trucked in. This well shows the extra \ndemands on the revenue side of the budget. That is the bucket: $152 \nbillion. These demands reflect the extenders for this year and next \nyear. The bucket contains next year's AMT patch because under this \nbudget, that has to be offset. The bucket also covers pending \nbipartisan tax legislation, and that is bipartisan because it is \ngenerally agreed that we ought to do some of this tax legislation. All \nof these items are listed on the chart for my colleagues to add up.\n  The water in the well represents known, specified, and scored \nrevenue-raising proposals supported by the Senate Democratic caucus. \nIncluded are $35 billion in Finance Committee-approved offsets and $29 \nbillion that has been approved elsewhere. That total, then, is the $61 \nbillion you see at the bottom of the well.\n  When you net the offsets against the demands, you find an offset \nshortfall of $91 billion. Somehow, you have to find a way to fill up \nthat well if you are\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\ngoing to offset everything where there is a bipartisan agreement of \nwhat ought to be offset. The upshot of the analysis in this chart is \nthat known offsets cover only about 40 percent of the revenue needed to \ncarry out pending time-sensitive tax legislation that there is a great \ndeal of bipartisan support for and bipartisan agreement that it ought \nto pass and some of it ought to be passing very shortly.\n  Now, some on the other side will probably respond with three \ncounterpoints, so I want to anticipate that--not that I am going to \nstop them from responding. The first will be that the committee tax \nstaffs will find the additional $91 billion that is needed to fill up \nthe well. The second will be a claim that offshore shelter activity is \na vast, easily tapped revenue source. The third counterpoint will be \nthat closing the tax gap can yield the necessary revenue.\n  As far as those three points are concerned, in the preceding \npresentation by the chairman of the committee, my colleagues heard some \nof these points expressed already.\n  On the first point, I would refer everyone to the track record of the \ntax staffs to the period 2001 to 2006. During that period, I chaired \nfor 4\\1/2\\ years and Senator Baucus chaired for 1\\1/2\\ years. During \nthat period, we changed the tax shelter rules and closed numerous \ncorporate loopholes. If you don't believe me, then just go down and ask \nthe K Street crowd of highly paid lobbyists who defended or fought \nevery one of those. During that 6-year period, an active Finance \nCommittee tax staff was able to achieve $51 billion in enacted revenue \nraisers. That figure should give everyone some perspective of what is \ndoable. It is very hard to find that revenue.\n\n  Now, some on the other side will argue for my second point that the \noffshore activities will produce up to $100 billion a year. The \nanecdote alluded to usually referred to fraudulent activities. Of \ncourse, tax fraud is a crime now. Perhaps we could continue to make \nprogress on this front with more enforcement, but the figures bandied \naround have no Joint Tax or Treasury scoring that I am aware of.\n  I will expand on this point in a separate discussion later on in this \nweek when we have some more debate on it. But it is tough to get the \nrevenue that is alluded to in the speeches we are going to hear this \nweek.\n  The third counterpoint is that the tax gap will yield a readily \navailable, easily tapped revenue source. As a preliminary matter, let \nme say that the tax gap is a serious tax policy and a serious \nadministration issue. I have devoted a lot of time and energy to \nclosing the gap over the last few years, as the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Baucus, is doing in his recent chairmanship.\n  Unfortunately, as IRS officials have told us in several hearings, the \ntax gap number currently estimated to be $250 billion net annually is \nnot the same thing as a revenue estimate. They have cautioned us to be \ncareful about designing tax gap closure measures that are driven by \nunrealistic revenue targets in unrealistic timeframes.\n  When we went through the tax gap discussion last year, these points \nwere disputed by some on the other side. With a Senate Democratic \nmajority in place for over a year, we may have a bit of a yardstick to \nuse to see just how much revenue can come in. Let's take a look at the \nclaims on tax gap revenue and how we have done.\n  We have three charts that I hope will help us understand. The first \nchart is the tax gap reality check. My colleagues can see it here. We \nsee some big numbers. This chart takes the form of an inverted pyramid, \nas my colleagues can see. At the top of the chart is gross tax gap. \nThat is what appeared in the budget resolution markup document, the \nlast year that the IRS testified that the improvements in collections \nhave brought the tax gap down by $55 billion to a net tax gap of $290 \nbillion.\n  As we work our way down the inverted pyramid, we go to the tax gap \nproposals. There are two categories. The first is the Treasury tax gap \nstrategy set of proposals. On an annualized basis, these proposals \nraised $3.6 billion per year.\n  Some of these proposals have proved controversial on both sides of \nthe aisle. Many are complicated and wide-ranging and may need further \nwork. It is not by accident that they are still a work in progress.\n  The second set of proposals comes from the Joint Tax Committee's \nwhite book. This pamphlet, requested by Senator Baucus and me--and we \nrequested this a few years ago--was published in late January 2005. A \nnote of caution is in order about the chart's figures. The $44 billion \nannualized figure includes many tax expenditure reform proposals. Some \ntax gap proponents have strongly opposed the mixing of these proposals \nwith pure tax gap proposals. I will speak in more detail about these \nproposals as we go on in this week's debate. If one were to delete the \ntax expenditure reform proposals from this figure, it would drop \nconsiderably.\n  For purposes of this exercise, I am going to use the full set of \nJoint Tax proposals. If we do that and add them to the Treasury \nproposal, we come away with roughly $44 billion per year in tax gap-\nrelated proposals.\n  As a side note, a couple of recently enacted tax gap proposals have \nrun into rough sledding with the new majority. The first proposal is \nfrom the 2005 Joint Tax book. It deals with withholding on contractor \npayments enacted in 2006. Ways and Means Democrats are seeking to delay \nit. In addition, many House and Senate Democrats are insisting on \nrepealing another tax gap measure, this one dating from 2004, providing \nsupplementary private debt collectors. If enacted, the Joint Tax scores \nthat proposal as actually losing revenue.\n  As we work our way further down the inverted pyramid that I call the \ntax gap reality check, we total up enacted tax gap provisions. During \nthe fiscal year of the new majority, we find $572 million of enacted \ntax gap provisions. The enacted provisions represent two-tenths of 1 \npercent of that great big, gigantic figure that we call tax gaps--just \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent. Now, that ought to give anybody pause when you \nare putting this year's budget together and you are anticipating a lot \nof money coming in from this source. What experience we have had hasn't \nproduced a lot of revenue.\n\n  Let's look at the demands on the tax gap revenue in this budget. We \nhave another chart. It totals up the proposed uses of the tax gap \nrevenue. This chart is in the shape of a pyramid--the way a pyramid \nought to be, not upside down.\n  Listed in the first category is annualized tax relief and spending \ndemands in the budget that are assumed to be offset by, and among other \nthings, this tax gap revenue. You can see that they total $314 billion \nper year. I have accounted for the Baucus amendment's annualized impact \nof $65 billion. So the net demand on the annual tax gap is about $249 \nbillion. If you have been following the charts and the arithmetic, you \ncan see that the budget uses almost all of the tax gap revenue, up to \nabout 85 percent.\n  Keep in mind that the track record is that only $572 million of tax \ngap raisers were enacted last year. To give you perspective, you can \nlook at the ratio of demands on tax gap revenue to the revenue raised \nfrom enacted provisions. That is what this chart does. The ratio is 435 \nto 1. There are $435 of proposed tax gap uses in the budget for every \n$1 of enacted tax gap revenue.\n  When you look over these numbers, it should lead to a healthy \nskepticism of using tax gap revenue as some sort of instant revenue \nsource to accommodate all the spending this budget proposes to do. We \nought to listen to the career statistics of income folks over at the \nInternal Revenue Service. When they tell us not to treat the tax gap \nnumber like a revenue estimate, they are on pretty solid ground. It \ndoesn't mean we should not be aggressive about the tax gap. We should. \nBut the thirst for quick-and-dirty revenue raisers should not drive the \nstrategy for dealing with this important problem.\n  I wish to step back and summarize the last two major points.\n  The first point is that this budget does represent the priorities of \nthe Democratic leadership. It is put forward with the stated objective \nof achieving fiscal responsibility. The budget dramatically raises \ntaxes, increases spending considerably above the already generous \nbaseline, and does nothing about entitlements. Most experts agree that \nentitlement spending, left unchecked, will cannibalize the\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\nrest of the budget. From the perspective of the Republican caucus, this \nfiscal blueprint is not fiscal responsibility.\n  The second point is that an examination of the budget, even from the \nperspective of its own proponents, shows that it doesn't work. There is \ntoo much pressure on the revenue raising. We have raised revenue from \nclosing corporate loopholes. We have raised revenue from anti-tax \nshelter measures. I am proud of the Finance Committee's track record in \nthat regard. We have enacted $51 billion in loophole closers and \nantishelter measures for the period of 2001 to 2006. There are not, \nhowever, enough loophole closers to offset the time-sensitive tax \nlegislation we face in the first fiscal year of this budget. We have, \nlikewise, found revenue in policing offshore shelters and other \nactivities, but it fits under the umbrella of loophole closers and \nother tax shelter oversight.\n  Finally, the tax gap is an important problem that needs to be \ntackled, but targeting revenue from closing the tax gap needs to be \nmore realistic than it is in this document. This budget anticipates \nrevenue that is incredibly out of line with our track record of \nbringing in money from the tax gap, as worthy as closing the tax gap \nis. There has to be a reality check between what is out there and what \npeople at the IRS say we can collect, and they are much more aggressive \nat that because of the leadership of Senator Baucus. But will it bring \nin the revenue? We have shown that it will not, based upon the practice \nwe have had.\n  When you step back from the differences across the aisle on this \nbudget, you probably won't be surprised to find similar differences \namong the Presidential candidates of the two parties.\n  Generally, the candidates on the other side have proposed to take \nheavily from the taxpayer under the guise of fiscal responsibility. \nThis is true when they are talking about ending the bipartisan tax \nrelief plans of 2001 and 2003. It is true when they are talking about \nthe same loophole closers for a myriad number of expansions of existing \nentitlements or creating new ones. Nowhere is there discussion of \nreining in spending. So the tax side of the Federal ledger is the only \nroute to fiscal responsibility from the perspective of the candidates \non the other side.\n  I want to give one telling example. I have a chart here that shows \nthe revenue from the key revenue raisers from one of our colleagues on \nthe other side. That proposal would repeal the bipartisan tax relief \nplans for taxpayers earning above $250,000 a year. This proposal raises \n$226 billion over 5 years and 10 years. A key fact is that the source \nof that revenue peters out over the next few years because under \ncurrent law the tax relief sunsets at the end of 2010. You can see it \nright there. Let the tax laws work the way they want them to work, and \nthe revenue doesn't come in.\n\n  Like the Democratic leadership's budget, the candidates on the other \nside oversubscribe the revenue sources from proposals that are popular \nwith the Democratic base. The deficiency can only be made up in three \nways: One, the undefined sources of revenue would need to be tapped. \nTaxpayers should rightly be worried about that revenue. Secondly, the \nproposed spending plan would need to be abandoned or curtailed. There \nis not much history on that side for doing that, taking that avenue. \nThird, add to the deficit for the cost of the new programs. \nUnfortunately, this avenue has been taken far too many times--by both \npolitical parties, I am sorry to say.\n  We will hear a lot of criticism of our candidate, Senator McCain, \nfrom those on the other side. They will argue, like the President's \nbudget, that a continuation of current-law levels of taxation ``costs'' \nthe Federal Government too much revenue. They will argue that the \nspending increases they propose are more important than the restrained \nlevels of the President's budget. They will argue that, despite the \nrecord tax hikes in their budget, entitlement reform is a matter for \nanother day.\n  I have a chart that I believe helps set the basis of this larger \ndebate. It shows the glidepath for revenue under current law. It shows \nthat trend in the post-World War II context. You will see revenues \naverage about 18.3 percent of the economy. That is the dotted line \nacross there, so for those years since 1968 until now. And what we \npropose would be a continuation of that policy; we have averaged, with \nwhat the Federal Government is taking in from all sorts of taxes and \nFederal Government levies, about 18.3 percent of gross national \nproduct. That means that 535 Members of Congress are going to decide \nhow to spend 18.3 percent of the total economy of our country and that \nthe taxpayers are going to spend the other 81.7 percent. You will also \nsee that the state of the economy affects revenues more than anything \nelse. There are dips when we have been in recession and peaks when \ngrowth was high.\n  Our side cares about keeping the revenue line at a reasonable level. \nWe don't see the merits of an imperative behind a growing role for \nGovernment in the economy. I say that because a 40-year history of \nabout 18 to 19 percent of the total economy being used by the Federal \nGovernment has been a level that has not been so high that the public \nhas revolted against it. They might revolt at times, when it gets way \nhigh and we have tax decreases to bring it back down. Also, I think you \ncan say that at that level of taxation, it hasn't been harmful to the \neconomy. As you have seen each generation during this period of time, \nthey have lived better than the generation before. Our economy has done \nwell.\n  When you argue about 18.3 percent being the right figure, often the \nother side disagrees. If they don't disagree directly, their policies \nhelp us draw a different conclusion about whether they agree or \ndisagree. They impliedly or explicitly reject our premise that the size \nof Government needs to be kept in check.\n  We have another chart. It is a copy of an editorial, dated October \n22, 2007, from the New York Times. I suppose that is pretty small print \nfor the public to read. The lead-off paragraph says it best:\n\n       President Bush considers himself a champion tax cutter, but \n     all the leading Republican Presidential candidates are eager \n     to outdo him. Their zeal is misguided. This country's meager \n     tax take puts its economic prospects at risk and leaves the \n     Government ill equipped to face the challenges from \n     globalization.\n\n  The bottom line of the editorial directly states the view behind this \nbudget and the position of the Democratic candidates for President. \nFrom this perspective, the historical level of taxation is not \nappropriate as a measure.\n  The New York Times implies that the Federal Government must grow as a \npercentage of our economy by at least 5 to 8 percentage points. If we \nwere to follow the path suggested by the New York Times, the \nGovernment's share of our economy would grow by one-third. The \nDemocratic leadership's budget takes some big steps down that path. So \ndo the campaign proposals of the Democratic Presidential candidates.\n  Our Republican conference takes a different view. America is a \nleading market economy. American prosperity and economic strength, in \nour view, is derived from a vigorous private sector that provides all \nAmericans the opportunity to work hard, save, and invest more of their \nmoney. A growing economy is the best policy objective. It makes fiscal \nsense as well.\n  I have one more chart to back up the point that it makes fiscal \nsense. My last chart shows that despite criticisms to the contrary, the \nbipartisan tax relief plan drove revenue back up after the economic \nshocks we suffered in the early part of this decade because of a \nrecession and because of 9/11.\n  I am referring to the stock market bubble, corporate scandals, and 9/\n11 terror attacks--all those events that were detrimental to this \neconomy of ours and yet it bounced back. The revenue outperformed \nCongressional Budget projections by a significant margin, and all one \nhas to do is look at what CBO said would happen, the blue line, and \nlook at the red line of what actually happened.\n  People on our side, including our Presidential candidate, do not take \nthis significant data lightly. We believe the bias ought to be against \ngrowing Government, not the other way around; another way of saying--\ndisabusing people who say that the way to bring more money in is to \nraise tax rates and if you lower tax rates, you bring a decline to \nrevenue in the Federal Treasury. Not so. This chart shows that we can \nreduce tax rates, we can\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\nenhance the entrepreneurship of the average American, particularly the \nsmall businesspeople in this country who create at least 70 percent of \nthe jobs that are created, and we can expand revenue coming into the \nFederal Treasury. That is what, on this side of the aisle, we propose \nto do. Are we equipped to do it? The history of 2001 through 2006 is \nenough evidence for me and most Americans that it can be done and that \nwe did it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to say, while I \ndisagree with some of the observations of the Senator from Iowa, I have \nenormous respect for him. He has earned that respect by the way he \nconducts himself as a Senator. While we have policy disagreements, I \nhave absolutely no disagreement or question about his motive because he \nhas proved to me repeatedly that he is trying to do the very best for \nthis country, as am I.\n  I want to go back to some basic facts. We heard the Senator talk \nabout a 9-percent increase in spending that is in this budget. I don't \nknow how they came up with that calculation, but there is no 9 percent \nincrease in spending in this budget. If you look at the spending that \nis in this resolution over 5 years and compare it to the President's \nbudget, it is 2.1 percent more. That is total spending. That is over 5 \nyears. If we look at just the next year, 2009, the Bush budget calls \nfor $3.04 trillion of spending. We call for $3.08 trillion. That is a \ndifference of 1 percent. That is total spending.\n  I think what the Senator's staff has done is to look at one small \npart of Federal spending, just nondefense domestic discretionary \nspending, which is about one-sixth or one-seventh of the budget. But if \nwe look at total spending, there is a 1-percent difference total \nspending for 2009. OK? The difference between our President's budget \nand our budget is 1 percent--1 percent. That is a fact.\n  On the comparison of revenues, the President's revenue line we see is \nthe red line, ours is the green line. What is the difference? The \ndifference is over 5 years, the President calls for $15.2 trillion of \nrevenue; we call for $15.4 trillion. That is a difference of 2.6 \npercent.\n  I believe this revenue can be achieved without any tax increase. I \nbelieve that. Why do I believe that? Because of the three things I \nmentioned before. The tax gap--the Senator put up a chart that shows \nwhat the tax gap was in 2001. The net tax gap in 2001 was $290 billion.\n  The Senator correctly says very little has been done in the last year \nto do anything about it. In fact, very little has been done over the \nlast 10 years to do anything about it. My belief is the tax gap has \ndone nothing but grow from 2001. So it is not $290 billion a year \nanymore. I believe over 5 years the tax gap is probably in the range of \n$2 trillion. I say this as a former tax administrator of my State, a \nformer chairman of the Multistate Tax Commission. I believe the tax gap \nover 5 years is likely to be $2 trillion. But it doesn't stop there.\n  I put up what the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations says is \nthe loss to the tax havens. They say $100 billion a year without any \ngrowth over 5 years, that would be $500 billion. So with the tax gap \nand the tax havens, that is $2.5 trillion over 5 years. Then abusive \ntax shelters over the 5 years, I believe, based on the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations' work, is another $200 billion. That is \na total of $2.7 trillion of leakage over 5 years in the revenue \nsystem--$2.7 trillion. If we got 15 percent of it, 1-5--15 percent of \nit, $1 in every $7 in the tax gap, the tax havens, the abusive tax \nshelters, $1 in every $7--we can't do that? If we can't do that, then \nthe Revenue Commissioner ought to be replaced and all the rest of us \nought to be replaced if we have designed a tax system that has that \nmuch leakage in it, in which the vast majority of us pay what we owe \nbut we are letting a bunch of scoundrels escape? Shame on us. That is \nexactly what our own Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has told \nus.\n  All this talk about, well, we are going to have a trillion dollars of \ntax increases--let's look at the record. Let's go to the record. What \nhas this Congress, controlled by Democrats, done? It has cut taxes $194 \nbillion so far, with $7 billion of revenue raisers and loophole closers \nenacted for that period.\n  I say to my colleagues, these are just the facts. What is most of \nthis? Most of this is the stimulus package we just passed. Most of it \nwas bipartisan. The reference was to Democratic control of the House \nand the Senate, $194 billion of tax cuts and $7 billion of revenue \nraisers. That has been the record of this Democratic Congress: $194 \nbillion of tax cuts and $7 billion of revenue raisers. That is not a \nprojection, that is not sitting around conjuring up how we can make the \nother side look as bad as we can make it, that is a fact of what has \nbeen done.\n  The other side talks about the miracle of the tax cuts producing more \nrevenue. We don't need to look at a projection there either. Let's just \nlook at the record.\n  In 2000, the tax base of the United States was $2.03 trillion. Now, \nadjusted for inflation, it is $2.05 trillion. The revenue base of the \ncountry has basically been static for 8 years. The spending, most of it \ncontrolled by our colleagues on the other side because they were in \ncharge until last year, has gone up 50 percent. Again, we don't have to \nlook at some projection or some guess or some economists' estimates. \nLet's just look at what happened on the record: revenue flat, spending \nup substantially when our colleagues controlled everything, the House, \nthe Senate, the White House. What happened to the debt? The debt \nexploded. This is not a projection, this is not guessing ahead, this is \nwhat is happening. And my friends across the aisle controlled \neverything--they controlled the Senate, they controlled the House, they \ncontrolled the White House--and here is their record. The debt \nexploded, not some projection, not some guesstimate of the future. That \nis what has happened. The revenue was flat, the spending went up \ndramatically, went up about 50 percent, and the debt exploded as a \nresult. That is not a projection, that is not a claim, that is a fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the \ndistinguished chairman. The Senator from North Dakota disputed the 9 \npercent increase I cited with respect to the discretionary spending.\n  Here's how the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee \nreached that figure:\n  1. Take the increase in the President's budget--6.5 percent over last \nyear.\n  2. Add the amount of $22 billion the budget assumes over that \nrequest.\n  3. These additions in discretionary are not offset.\n  4. Add the two together and you arrive at a 9 percent increase in \ndiscretionary.\n  5. I said a 9 percent increase in discretionary and I reconfirmed the \nfigure with our Budget Committee staff.\n  As to the tax gap figure of $290 billion, I say to the chairman, that \nis the figure that is derived from career statisticians at the IRS \nstatistics of income--``SOI''--Division. I will reiterate that these \nstatisticians have cautioned us to not treat that figure like a revenue \nestimate.\n  I reiterate my recognition of the tax gap problem. I am pleased that \nChairman Baucus has made this a top priority. I have been his teammate \nin that regard and will continue to be. All I would say is be careful \nabout realism about the revenue we can raise and its timeframe. My \ninverted pyramid chart is a yardstick of that realism.\n  We should close the gap, but the revenue raised is what it is.\n  I am pleased that the distinguished chairman agreed that 15 percent \nis the knowable tax gap-related offsets in terms of scored proposals. I \nwould caution everyone that the $44 billion annualized figures is the \nceling on the tax-gap related offsets. I will discuss this data in more \ndetail as the debate proceeds.\n  The distinguished chairman's final point was that revenues have been \nflat since 2001. In fact, 2000 was an anomaly. The stock market had not \nburst and the chairman knows capital gains and other nonwithheld \nrevenue pushed that number up.\n  We had a triple whammy hit to the economy in the next year, 2001. The \nstock market bubble burst, the corporate scandals rocked Wall Street \nand\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nwhacked main street businesses, and the terrorist attacks occurred.\n  Because the economny was rocked, revenues dropped for 2001 and 2002. \nRevenues steadily came back after the economic growth plan of 2003 was \nput in place. Any review of the revenue baseline data would confirm \nwhat I have said.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Akaka is here. He would like to \nspeak on the budget. I will give him time off the resolution. How much \ntime does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Four minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I provide 5 minutes off the resolution to the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Mr. Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to commend Budget Committee chairman \nKent Conrad for his fine work on this budget resolution. It will lower \nour taxes and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Americans. \nIn addition, I am very pleased this budget resolution honors our \nNation's veterans by providing the necessary funds for our wounded \nwarriors. Funding for our veterans is very important, and I wish to \nspeak about this again at a later time.\n  The resolution passed by the Budget Committee last Thursday will \nbalance our Federal budget by 2012 and fund programs that are critical \nto the health and safety of Americans. It provides tax relief to \nmiddle-income Americans, honors our fighting men and women in the Armed \nForces, shows respect for our wounded and disabled veterans, and \nensures the continued safety and security of our Nation.\n  By focusing on the real needs of Americans and reviving our slowing \neconomy, the budget resolution seeks to restore balance--balance to our \nfinances and balance to our priorities for America. The budget \nresolution increases funding for veterans health care and children's \nhealth care. It provides a substantial increase above the President's \nbudget for education and Head Start. It promotes greater efficiency and \nrenewable energy programs. It extends middle-class tax cuts, such as \nmarriage penalty relief and the child tax credit, and it brings more \nmiddle-class Americans into a 10-percent tax bracket. The budget \nresolution also invests in building and repairing roads, bridges, \nharbors, airports, and schools because we recognize our economic \nsuccess depends on public infrastructure investment.\n  As Chairman Conrad has noted, this budget is only a first step, but \nit is an important step to reach our goal of long-term fiscal security. \nI am prepared to join Chairman Conrad in this important mission to \nbalance our budget, restore our military readiness, honor our \ncommitment to troops and veterans, and enhance our national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the same. It is time that we provide a \nreal future for our children and our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his \nkind remarks. I also thank him for the enormous contribution he made to \nthe work of the Budget Committee, especially with respect to funding \nfor veterans affairs, and specifically veterans health care. One of the \nthings I am most proud about in this budget is we are showing a $3.2 \nbillion increase over what the President requested for veterans health \ncare because I think the vast majority of us recognize the \nextraordinary ongoing need for improvements to veterans health care. \nOur veterans have made an enormous commitment to this country, and we \nmust keep our commitment to them.\n  Last year, as the Chair will recall, the budget contained the largest \nincrease for veterans health care in our history. This year we have \nanother significant increase that largely parallels the budget proposed \nby the veterans organizations themselves in recognition of the \nextraordinary need that exists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield whatever time Senator Alexander might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Chair please let me know when I have \ncompleted 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I first commend the Senators from North \nDakota and Iowa for the way they conduct this debate. This is always a \nmodel for how the Senate ought to work. Sometimes toward the end of the \ndebate it is not but at least at the beginning it is. What we are \nsupposed to do is act like grownups, deal with big issues, base our \narguments on principle, and come to results. We often are able to do \nthat, and these two Senators are among the leaders in helping to make \nthat happen.\n  This is a week during which we talk about the Federal budget. I want \nto talk more about the family budget because what we do with the \nFederal budget makes a big difference to the family budget.\n  We know this week in homes in Tennessee, Iowa, and across America \npeople are talking about their family budgets. They're worried about \nwhether there will be enough money at the end of the month to pay the \ntaxes that will be due in April and about whether there will be enough \nmoney to pay gasoline costs that are $3.50 a gallon or higher in some \nparts of the country. They are worried about whether there will be \nenough money to afford a reasonable health insurance plan and whether \nthe homes so many Americans have been able to buy will maintain their \nvalue. They are worried about whether we are going to be able to keep \nour advantage and brainpower here in America so we can keep our jobs \nfrom going overseas. They are worried about whether our schools are \ngoing to be good enough to help our children have good jobs. Those \nworking in small businesses are worried about the cost of runaway \nlawsuits. Women who are pregnant in rural areas are worried about \nhaving to drive 60 or 80 miles to a doctor because the high cost of \nmedical malpractice insurance has run the OB/GYN doctors out of the \nrural areas. Women must go to the big cities and they have to drive \nlong distances to have their babies.\n  Those who work with the capital markets--and there are tens of \nmillions of Americans who do--want to revive those capital markets. \nThose who are sitting in traffic jams want us to meet our obligations \nto build roads, bridges, railroads, and airports. We want simpler \ntaxes. We would like to have less Government. All of these ideas would \naffect the family budget. We must maintain a good balance in \nmanagement-labor relations, for example, by not getting rid of the \nsecret ballot in labor relations or keeping the right-to-work law. \nThose are all important issues. I saw in my State of Tennessee that \nhaving a right-to-work law helped to attract the auto industry. Now, a \nthird of our manufacturing jobs are auto jobs and our family incomes \nhave gone up.\n  So let me talk for just a moment about what Republicans want to do to \nhelp balance the Federal budget.\n  So the question is whether we will adopt the Democratic budget which, \naccording to evidence presented by the Republican leaders of the Budget \nand Finance Committees, would raise taxes, raise spending, raise debt, \nand wreck the Federal budget or whether we will adopt the Republican \npro-growth plan which keeps taxes low, which lowers energy costs, which \nhelps make it possible for every American family to have health \ninsurance without the government choosing the doctor.\n  I wish to talk about the other picture that taking the Republican \npro-growth plan to help balance the family budget instead of the \nDemocratic budget for more taxes, more spending, and more debt.\n  Traditionally, this budget week when we talk about the Federal budget \nis usually a week in which we are so awash in a blizzard of charts and \nspeeches, abstractions, and competing statistics that it is very \ndifficult to make much sense out of the whole discussion. What I am \nsuggesting is not very hard to make such sense out of--it is a debate \nwe hear quite a bit.\n  In December, when we debated the Energy bill, we on this side were \nwilling to join with many Democrats and pass a fuel efficiency \nstandard. This is one of the best things this Congress has done to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil, thereby reducing our use of oil\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\nand helping to stabilize the price of gasoline. But, first, we had to \nstop an effort from the other side to add $20 billion in taxes.\n  Earlier this year, most of us on this side joined with most on the \nother side to pass an economic stimulus plan. But, first, we had to \nreject $40 billion in more spending that the other side wanted to add \nto the proposal.\n  My point is that more spending is not a new argument and that the \nother side would propose more spending, more taxes, and more debt, and \nthis side of the aisle would say, let's have less of that. There is \nanother part to the story on the Republican side of the aisle and \nexactly what we would do to help balance the family budget.\n  Over this week, we will be hearing proposals to lower or to keep \ntaxes low. There are a variety of proposals to do that. One would be to \nlower corporate tax rates from 35 to 25 percent. That would help keep \njobs in America. That helps the family budget. One would be to index \ncapital gains for inflation. That would help keep jobs in America. That \nhelps the family budget. I would like to see us make permanent the \nexpensing provisions that we passed in the stimulus package. That would \nhelp keep small businesses healthy in this country and create new jobs. \nThose incomes would increase family incomes, and that would help the \nfamily budget.\n  We would like to lower energy costs as well and bring some common \nsense to the discussion about energy. That would mean, from our point \nof view, more nuclear power because that is the cleanest power. If we \nare really serious about climate change in this generation and about \ncleaning up the sulfur and the nitrogen and the mercury, we need to \nremember 66 percent of all the clean energy we produce in America is \nproduced by nuclear power. Instead of wasting dollars by spending, for \nexample, $11 billion to subsidize more large wind turbines, we could \nspend the money to encourage the building of nuclear power. We could \nencourage reprocessing of nuclear waste which would reduce by 95 \npercent the amount of that waste and storing it, thus making it easier \nfor nuclear power.\n  More oil would increase the supply of oil and reduce the price of \noil. Simple economics tells us that. Most of us on this side of the \naisle are ready to give States the option to drill for oil and gas off \nthe coast of America. You can do that at a distance. It can't be seen \nand it can be done safely. Then a significant amount of the royalties \nfrom the revenue from that can be taken into the State, put in a trust \nfund, which could either lower taxes or protect the coastal areas or \ncould be spent to improve the higher education system.\n  The State of Virginia has said it wants to do this. Most of us on \nthis side of the aisle, the Republican side of the aisle, say, why not? \nAnd why not take some of the royalties as well and devote them to \nconservation purposes, as Senator Domenici and Senator Salazar on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle led us to do in the 2005 Energy bill.\n  I would like to see us take some of the money that we are spending \nand use it to give incentives to utilities to increase incentives for \nusing electricity in the off-peak hours. To put that in plain English, \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority uses about 27,000 megawatts of \nelectricity on any given day, a typical day, on the average. But at \nnight, it has 7,000 or 8,000 megawatts it doesn't use. So if we had \nways to plug in hybrid cars at night, we wouldn't have to spend money \nfor new plants and could lower the cost of electricity, improve the \nquality of the air, and deal with climate change at the same time.\n  That is all part of the Republican plan. Not just Republican ideas, \nbut the Republican plan, which we hope is so compelling that it \nattracts Democratic support to help balance the family budget.\n  On the Republican side of the aisle, we want to make sure every \nAmerican has health insurance without the Government choosing the \ndoctor. We have a variety of proposals for doing this. We want to \nintegrate the idea of every American having access to health insurance \nwith two words: private sector. We believe we can do that, and do that \nin a way that lowers the cost of health care and makes a basic health \ncare plan available to every American.\n  One way, of course, to lower the costs of health care would be, as I \nmentioned a little earlier, to stop runaway lawsuits that are driving \nup the costs of medical malpractice lawsuits and causing OB/GYN doctors \nto leave rural areas. We have pregnant women in Tennessee who drive 60 \nor 80 miles to Memphis for their prenatal health care or to have their \nbabies because the OB/GYN doctors' health care costs--their medical \nmalpractice costs--are so high because of unnecessary lawsuits that \nthey have left town and gone to some other place.\n  We could enact a small business health insurance plan, which has \nsignificant support on both sides of the aisle, but we haven't been \nable to get it through the Congress yet. It would help an estimated 1 \nmillion more Americans to have health insurance at a lower cost.\n  These are some of the ideas we on this side of the aisle believe \nwould make a difference in helping the family budget. Most Americans \nare concerned today about the values of their homes. There are a number \nof proposals that would simply add billions of dollars in spending as a \nway of approaching the housing slowdown. However, we would like to see \nproposals like that of Senator Isakson of Georgia that would adopt an \nidea--similar to what the government had in the 1970s--to give a $5,000 \ntax credit to home buyers who buy newly constructed or homes that are \nbeing foreclosed. This would bring back into the marketplace those who \nwould buy foreclosed homes or new homes. Another idea, which I believe \nthere is substantial agreement with on both sides of the aisle, is to \nincrease the amount of money that would be available to State housing \nagencies to help refinance subprime mortgages or mortgages that are now \nheaded to foreclosure or in foreclosure.\n\n  In terms of education, I know for a fact if you want a stronger \neconomy and higher family incomes, you have to have a focus on \neducation. Better schools, better colleges, and better universities \nmean better jobs. And that doesn't always mean more spending. For \nexample, giving parents more choices of schools, particularly low-\nincome parents, with the idea of a Pell grant for kids would be one way \nof helping hard-working American families make sure their children have \na chance to attend a good school.\n  Another way to make sure there are good schools is to pay outstanding \nteachers more money for teaching well. This weekend, there was a story \nin the New York Times about a charter school in New York City where \nteachers are being paid $125,000 a year. And the manager of the school \nsaid: I would rather have a classroom with 30 kids and the very best \nteacher, rather than a classroom with 20 students and an average \nteacher.\n  I agree with that, Mr. President. So let's double the amount of money \nwe would spend for the teachers' incentive fund, enacted in No Child \nLeft Behind, which would give to State and local governments funds to \nexperiment with programs that reward outstanding teaching and \noutstanding school leadership by paying those individuals more.\n  We have strong agreement about the America COMPETES Act. We \nunderstand that since World War II America's technological advances \nhave been the source of its growth. Using some of the funding we have \nin this budget to have a sufficient amount of funding to give 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion low-income children an opportunity to take advanced placement \ntests, to hire math and science teachers according to the America \nCOMPETES Act, and to put us on a path of double funding for the \nphysical sciences are things that would be part of a Republican pro-\ngrowth plan to help balance the family budget.\n  As we begin this debate on the budget, what we are likely to see are \ntwo very different visions of America's future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator has used 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So again, the question is whether we will adopt the \nDemocratic budget which would raise taxes, raise spending, raise debt, \nand\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\nwreck the Federal budget or whether we will adopt the Republican pro-\ngrowth plan. Will we make room for the Republican pro-growth plan which \nwould begin to keep taxes low, which would begin to lower energy costs, \nwhich would help make it possible for every American family to have \nhealth insurance without the Government choosing the doctor, which \nwould stimulate home buying, which would make more room for science, \nwhich would adjust our spending so we are able to reward outstanding \nteachers and give parents more choices of good schools. This is a \ndifferent picture of how we can move ahead in this country.\n  We hear a lot of talk about change. A real change would be to stop \nmore taxes. Stop excessive spending. Stop more debt. And focus more \nattention on the family budget. Have a Federal budget that emphasizes \nlower taxes, lower energy costs, lower health insurance costs, \nstimulating home buying, more for science and more for better schools. \nThat's really the way to create better jobs.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, Senator Menendez, who is a very valuable \nmember of the Budget Committee, as is the occupant of the Chair, is \nhere and is available for his opening remarks.\n  How much time would the Senator desire?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If the Chair could, I think about 20, 25 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield such time as the Senator may consume.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New Jersey, who is truly an \noutstanding member of the Budget Committee. He has made an incredibly \nvaluable contribution there, and I very much appreciate the leadership \nhe has brought to the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the distinguished chairman for his kind words. \nI particularly thank him for his leadership in structuring a budget \nthat I am convinced, unlike the President's budget, speaks to the \nshared values of the American people, speaks to the priorities that our \nNation needs to pursue, meets the challenges our country has, and \nultimately goes to the very heart of turning this economy in a much \ndifferent direction so that it can work for working families.\n  Under his leadership, we have a budget that I am proud to support on \nthe floor of the Senate. And whether you live in the East or West or \nNorth or South, I think Americans will find this budget, as they become \nmore fully aware of it, is one that has the integrity, the honesty, as \nwell as the purposes to meet the challenges. The chairman deserves \nenormous credit for working with all Members on both sides to try to \nachieve those goals, and I appreciate his leadership.\n  Madam President, this week in the Senate, we are fighting for the \neconomic future of America. This is the week that we put together on \nthe floor of the Senate the Federal Government's budget. And that \nbudget is more than just a balance sheet of revenues and expenditures, \nit is a balance sheet of priorities and values. The lines of numbers \ncome together to form a bigger picture, laying out a vision of where we \nplan to lead the Nation.\n  Every year, when we make the budget, we look at where our country \nstands, at how we can improve the lives of the American people, and \nwhat we can do to make sound investments that brighten the future of \ngenerations to come.\n  It is a responsibility that we cannot afford to take lightly. When we \ncreate a budget, we have to answer some fundamental questions: What are \nthe most important problems we face as a nation? What are the \nchallenges of middle-class working families? How do we meet those \nchallenges?\n  Several weeks ago, President Bush gave us his answer. And his answer \nwas, there is nothing wrong with America that cannot be fixed by giving \naway more tax breaks to the wealthy, giving away more subsidies to big \noil companies, continuing the war in Iraq, and never admitting what it \ncosts.\n  The President is fighting to keep taxes low for the wealthy and wants \nto make it up by charging veterans more for their health care. \nApparently, that is the answer some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are giving as well. They agree with the President the \nAmerican people should cover their eyes, pretend their problems do not \nexist, that everything magically will work itself out.\n  I believe a vote for the President's budget is a vote for the status \nquo. It is a vote for the way things are going in America in terms of \nthis economy.\n  The Democrats see things quite differently. Here is what we see: Our \neconomy is continuously weakening, and tens of thousands of people are \nlosing their jobs. The price we pay for health care is spiking through \nthe roof, while the value of our homes is falling through the floor. \nBaby boomers worry about whether they are going to be able to retire \nwith dignity, and senior Americans are worried that the strong base of \nSocial Security could crumble right under them. Our climate is in \ncrisis, and our attachment to an umbilical cord of foreign oil means \nour entire way of life hangs by a liquid thread.\n  The Government is going into debt to the tune of more than $10 \nbillion per month to finance a war in Iraq that has not made any of us \nsafer, while local police and fire departments are getting squeezed for \nfunds, and crime in our neighborhoods is on the rise.\n  If you have worked in Newark all your life and just lost your job, we \nhear you. If you are scared to walk through your neighborhood in Camden \nbecause there is violence on the streets, we hear you. If your family \nmay be in danger of losing your home in Trenton or Long Branch or North \nArlington; if you are teaching at a school with a budget stretched as \nfar as it can go in Hamilton, Plainfield, or Asbury Park; if your \ncommute to work just keeps getting more frustrating in Cherry Hill; if \nevery day you drive by a barren industrial site that is not being \nredeveloped in Penns Grove or Paulsboro; if it is a struggle to pay \nyour college tuition in New Brunswick or pay your heating bill in Toms \nRiver or pay your health care costs in Edison, Democrats understand \nwhat people--certainly I do--all across America are going through.\n  None of us can stand and pretend one budget can be the magic bullet \nthat makes all of these problems disappear. One year is not enough time \nfor that. One year cannot undo 7 years of the Bush administration's \nmismanagement that turned a record surplus into a soaring deficit. And \n1 year cannot undo 5 years of a war in Iraq that has claimed thousands \nof American lives and incinerated more than a half trillion dollars \nthat we could have used to make American lives better.\n  In one budget we cannot fully fund all of the programs that deserve \nour support or give the tax relief we want to middle-class working \nfamilies, not under this administration. But this year, we can set the \nwheels in motion of the long and indispensable process of change. We \ncan develop a plan to meet the challenges we face head on, and we can \nstart to move our country forward.\n  This is exactly what the Senate Democratic budget does. Here is the \nvision our budget puts forth for our Nation, a nation that is more \nprosperous, with more affordable health care, on the path to energy \nindependence, a nation of safer neighborhoods, better schools, a nation \nof which we can all be proud.\n  Above all, our budget is designed to get our economy growing, get our \neconomy growing and moving again. That is the first and foremost \npriority of this budget. The Bush budget, supported by many of our \nRepublican colleagues, creates jobs in China, while the Democratic \nbudget creates good-paying jobs in America. The Democratic budget \nfocuses on rebuilding our infrastructure, expanding incentives for \ngreen initiatives and industries, and investing in math, science, and \nengineering and technology so American businesses can create and keep \nthe best jobs here in America.\n  Our budget puts the family budget first. It provides middle-class tax \nrelief by extending the marriage penalty relief, a child tax credit, a \npatch for the alternative minimum tax that will protect millions of \nmiddle-class families from paying higher taxes next year; it works to \nmake college more affordable by extending a tuition tax credit; and it \nsupports job training programs that will prepare the workforce for the \n21st century.\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n  This budget moves us down the road to energy independence. It helps \ncreate a highly skilled workforce and green-collar jobs. I am proud of \nthe push for funding for energy efficiency and conservation block \ngrants, a provision I authored in our last Energy bill to provide \ncities with support for projects that foster more efficient use of \nenergy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  We all know oil and natural gas prices are sky high, the sea levels \nare rising, along with the temperature. So this program is a key part \nof our strategy to meet those challenges.\n  The Democratic budget recognizes we cannot think about national \nsecurity without thinking about hometown security. While our resources \nare being drained day after day on the streets of Baghdad and Mosul, we \nare struggling to protect high-risk targets on the streets of our own \nneighborhoods.\n  We know our police departments are just a phone call away during an \nemergency. Our brave men and women in law enforcement have dedicated \nthemselves to serving and protecting our communities. So it is \nunbelievable to me that the Bush administration has reduced or \neliminated nearly every major anticrime program over the course of the \nlast 7 years, especially since crime and violence have been on the rise \nin the country, according to the FBI reports.\n  Crime is going up, violent crime is going up, and the Bush \nadministration's cuts to the most essential public safety programs, the \nvery essence of homeland security, go down. What should be going up is \ngoing down. What should be going down is going up. How can we expect \nlaw enforcement to carry out their responsibilities and respond in a \nmoment's notice when the Federal Government is backing out of its \nresponsibility to support law enforcement?\n  People in my home State of New Jersey remember on September 11 that \nit was not the Federal Government that provided the immediate response, \nit was the local police, the firefighters and emergency management and \nmedical units from our hometowns. Yet in the years after September 11, \nthe administration has left our local communities to shoulder far too \nmuch of the financial burden. Our budget, however, will ensure that \nfirst responders across the Nation will get the resources they need.\n  I was proud to work with Chairman Conrad to ensure that homeland \nsecurity grants that our communities rely on most were protected in \nthis budget. The Democratic budget restores more than $2 billion in \nmisguided cuts the President made to State homeland security grants, to \nport security, interoperable communications, rail and transit security.\n  Our budget will ensure that States facing threats from high-risk \ntargets or densely populated areas, communities that are near ports, \nchemical plants, airports, cities with mass transit or rail systems, \nwill not be shortchanged. By restoring more than $750 million in grants \nto firefighters, we will also ensure that our fire departments can buy \nnew equipment or ensure that our fire stations are fully staffed. \nUnlike the President, we will keep our commitment to fulfilling the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and we will keep our commitment \nto our first responders.\n  We more than double the funding for the Byrne/JAG Program that many \nlocal law enforcement officials across the country consider the most \nsuccessful crime prevention program in recent history. I am proud to \nhave introduced the amendment that was passed unanimously in the Budget \nCommittee setting aside a minimum of $520 million to fund it. I am \ngoing to ensure that we continue to support this vital program.\n  We have also included language to help the FBI cut down its massive \nbacklog in evaluating immigration applications for those who follow our \nrules to legally enter the country. Cutting down this backlog is \nessential if the FBI is going to be able to quickly separate those who \nhave come to pursue the American dream versus those who may have come \nto destroy it.\n  Our budget puts a priority on making health care more affordable and \nmore accessible to all Americans. We have worked to create a reserve \nfund to block President Bush's unilateral changes to Medicaid that \nwould severely reduce Federal health care funds to States for low-\nincome families. This was the very essence of the social safety net \nthat we as a society should be judged by.\n  The reserve fund would also help protect New Jersey's FamilyCare \nProgram from the President's Draconian cuts to children's health \ncoverage scheduled for this summer. We have included support for other \nlegislation, and this budget includes funding for the Patient Navigator \nProgram, which I worked hard to have passed into law. If patients are \nhaving trouble figuring out the complicated health care system we are \nin, but they do not know how to get early screening or do not know \nabout options for follow-up treatment, patient navigators make sure \nsomeone is there to help them.\n  Our budget also keeps our commitment to our schools, our teachers, \nand our students. I am proud that our budget provides the largest \nincrease for elementary and secondary education in 6 years. Instead of \ntaking money away from our schools while asking them to do more, our \nbudget will fund programs that provide enrichment and opportunity to \nour students.\n  We do not just say education is a priority, we put our money where \nour values are by providing $3 billion more than the President for No \nChild Left Behind, and $8.8 billion more than the President for \neducation and training overall.\n  We soundly reject the President's proposal to freeze education \nfunding and eliminate 48 programs in the Department of Education, \nincluding education technology, mentoring, reading programs, and \nvocational education. Instead of pretending our young people are not \nfacing severe hardships when it comes to paying for college, our budget \nmakes the needed investments in grants and scholarships for college and \nallows for an increase in the Pell grant maximum next year. That is the \nsupport our young people deserve, and under this budget that is the \nsupport they are going to get.\n  I have often said, as someone who grew up poor in a tenement in Union \nCity, NJ, the first one in my family to go to college, that would never \nhave happened but for the power of the Federal Government being able to \nprovide me grants and loans. That power gave me the educational \nopportunity and foundation that allowed me to be the junior Senator \nfrom New Jersey. The reality is, that should be a birthright for every \nyoung person in our country who is willing to work hard and give \nsomething back to their Nation.\n  This budget meets that battle. Let me close by saying our debate over \nthe budget is a debate over the direction of the economy, the \nfulfillment of our shared values, and the direction of our country. The \nPresident and those who support him are offering the same old ideas \nthat got us into this mess in the first place, ideas that have weakened \nthe economy and hurt the middle class.\n  If you ask for more of the same, it seems to me, you get more of the \nsame. Those who are happy with the economy that we are in would be \nhappy with the President's budget. Those who are languishing, and that \nis the overwhelming majority of American families in this country, \nunder the President's economic policies, the reality is they want to \nsee change. That change is represented in the Democratic budget.\n  Democrats have a fiscally responsible plan to get our economy moving \nagain and strengthen our national security. The budget we are putting \nforth cuts taxes for the middle class, creates a half million new jobs \nin America, and we do all of this while working toward the balanced \nbudget and paying down debt.\n  It is a plan that puts forth a basic idea about what America should \nbe. This should be a country where anyone willing to work hard can get \nan education and a job, a country where everyone has access to services \nthat can keep them healthy, a country where a lifetime of hard work \nguarantees the right to retire with dignity, a country that knows its \npast and cares about its future.\n  Let's invest in that future. Let's pass this budget. Let's begin the \nhard work of making that vision a reality and changing economic \ncircumstances for families. That is what this debate is all about. That \nis what the Democratic budget is all about. That is why I am proud to \nhave voted for it in committee, proud to stand on the floor to\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\ndefend it, and proud to support Senator Conrad in his efforts in that \nregard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I note that my friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, is here. I thought I would begin by \nquoting something he said which I think sets the tone for the \ndiscussion of the budget. I believe it was during a March 4, 2007, \ninterview on ``60 Minutes'' when the distinguished chairman said:\n\n       I believe, first of all, that we need more revenue.\n\n  Now I won't pretend that I know the exact context in which this \nstatement was made, but it is not the first time I have heard \nDemocratic colleagues say we need more revenue. In one of our informal \nmeetings, colleagues said: We will need a much bigger revenue stream \nwhen the next President is elected. That individual was presuming it \nwould be a Democratic President.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me say, very clearly, to set the record straight, as \nan Independent, we need more revenue. We have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world. We have people who are \nhungry. We have mothers who can't afford childcare. Yes, sir, we need \nmore revenue. We should ask the wealthiest people in this country to \nhelp us come up with the revenue.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to have the Senator from Vermont confirm that on \nthe other side of the aisle there is a belief that the U.S. Government \nneeds more revenue.\n  I would actually put it the other way around. Especially in times of \neconomic difficulties--and I think we all agree that our economy is not \nin great shape right now; there is a discussion that we may even be in \nor very close to a recession--of course, the worst thing to do during \nthat period is to give the Federal Government more revenue, to take \nmore revenue out of the pockets of taxpayers, average Americans who \nhave to pay attention to their own budgets.\n  As a matter of fact, our problem is not the lack of Federal revenues. \nWe are collecting more money now at the Federal Government level than \nthe historic average over the last 40 years. I hardly think the Federal \nGovernment needs more revenue. I argue, instead, that our families need \nto keep more of the hard-earned revenue that is a result of the efforts \nof their families in working hard every day.\n  It is true that because many on the Democratic side of the aisle have \nplans to spend more money, as my distinguished colleague from Vermont \nis suggesting, they therefore see a need to take money from taxpayers' \npockets so that we in Washington, in our infinite wisdom, can make \ndecisions about how that money should be spent. I think that is the \nwrong prescription virtually any time but certainly at a time when we \nmay be heading into a recession.\n  It at least is the case that our Democratic friends in their budget \nwould raise taxes in some cases--not all but in some cases--to pay for \nthis additional spending they believe should occur. As with last year's \nbudget, which would have increased taxes by $900 billion, this year the \nbudget would increase taxes by $1.2 trillion--the biggest tax hike in \nthe history of the United States.\n  Once again, there is a suggestion out there that we can soak the rich \nand nobody else will have to bear the burden. The top 1 percent would \npay something like $25 billion in taxes; that is the amount we could \nexpect from this budget in 2009. Of course, that wouldn't begin to take \ncare of the spending proposals that have been added up on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  Every time we try to target the rich in order to collect a lot of \nmoney to pay for spending in Washington, we end up hitting everybody \nelse. The best example of that is the alternative minimum tax, the AMT. \nOriginally, this tax was designed to ensure that millionaires would \nalways pay some taxes, that they could not avoid tax liability by \ntaking advantage of writeoffs and deductions and credits and other \nprovisions of the Tax Code that anybody is entitled to take advantage \nof, if those provisions meant that you could write off or offset your \nincome with losses or deductions and therefore there is no tax \nliability. We said: No, that is not right. The AMT will come into play \nat that point so everybody has to pay some taxes. It seemed like a good \nidea at the time.\n  What has happened in the meantime, we all know, because it has not \nbeen indexed for inflation, we now this year had something like 23 \nmillion taxpayers subject to that kind of alternative minimum tax \nliability, something people on both sides of the aisle have sought to \navoid. We don't want to tax everybody. We don't want to hit the middle \nclass, let alone other taxpayers. But it is a good example of how, when \nwe try to aim at the rich, we end up somehow always managing to hit the \npoor or the middle class. That is the same thing here.\n  In the budget, there is a suggestion that we are only going to hit \nthe rich. There are problems with that: No. 1, it is not true, as I \nwill point out; secondly, you wouldn't begin to get the kind of revenue \nour colleagues say they need in order to engage in the spending \nprograms the budget calls for.\n  I have a couple other examples. The energy and education tax \nincentives in this budget must be paid for by other tax increases. The \nsame applies to the middle-class tax relief promised and any AMT relief \nafter 2008. I remember because I chaired the subcommittee of the \nFinance Committee that has jurisdiction over the IRS. I heard a lot \nabout tax gap collection. So we held a hearing. We said: How much money \ncould we really collect by enforcing revenue collections? Everybody \nowes these taxes. If we just collected the money, how much could we \nexpect to get? The experts said: Actually, not very much. You would \nspend more than you would end up collecting in many cases because it is \nnot a matter of just going out and collecting a due debt but, rather, \nforcing the kind of bookkeeping on various kinds of small businesses \nthat would probably put most of them out of business if they were \nreally to keep the kinds of records that would enable us to collect the \nkinds of taxes that we suggest maybe they owe. So this business of \nrecouping a portion of the tax gap and using that to pay for these \nspending programs is one that does not have the support of those who \nhave testified before the Finance Committee.\n  The bottom line is, we are not going to be able to collect the kinds \nof revenues and the increased taxes called for here in order to pay for \nspending programs the Democrats have identified.\n  Finally, there is talk about a so-called reserve fund. This is an \ninteresting concept. It is sort of, well, there is going to be money \nout there because we promise we will put money in it, so we can afford \nto therefore raise spending in anticipation that we will put money in \nthis reserve fund. The amount of reserve funds included in the 2008 \nbudget have now grown this year, representing up to $300 billion in new \ntaxes and spending. As I said, that looks good on paper, but it doesn't \ncome about in reality.\n\n  I will get to a final point in a minute about collecting revenues and \nwhat that has to do with the death tax, but let me deal with a couple \nother items before I talk about that.\n  The ranking member of the Budget Committee has noted something that \nstarted last year, and it certainly is included in this year's budget. \nThat is the fact that budget enforcement mechanisms which were put into \nthe budget last year amid great fanfare about how we are not going to \nhave sham budgets; we are going to have pay-go--whenever we spend, we \nwill make sure we collect it in advance--it turns out that has been \nwaived more times than it has been abided by. With the budgetary \nsleights of hand that were put in place last year, we find that the \nsame things roll over into the budget this year, with the result that, \nagain, we have greater debt that is not really going to be paid for, \nnotwithstanding what the budget seems to suggest.\n  The House budget included reconciliation instructions to pay for a 1-\nyear extension of the AMT patch by presumably raising taxes on oil and \ngas companies, taxing private equity, and codifying the so-called \neconomic substance doctrine. The Senate committee did not include \nreconciliation instructions in the Senate budget resolution, I presume \nbecause of the conclusion that at\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\nthe end of the last year, the AMT did not need to be paid for.\n  Obviously, there is an understanding in this caucus that those who \noppose higher taxes on oil and gas--there are those who oppose higher \ntaxes on oil and gas and oppose taxes on private equity, and it would \nbe a very difficult thing to get such a bill passed in the Senate. But \nno one should be surprised that the same reconciliation instructions \ncould very well magically appear in the Senate after a conference in \norder to get around Republican opposition to higher taxes. That is why \nyou have heard many Republicans predict that when the conference report \nis concluded on this budget--if, indeed, a budget is passed--and it \ncomes back here to the Senate, we are going to see some things that \nnever would have been in the bill at this point in time and which I \nhope my colleagues would recognize and would oppose at that time.\n  I said I would get to the matter of whom this budget really hurts. We \nin the past have tried to focus on the rich, and we always end up \nhurting other people. Who are some of the other folks who would suffer \nunder this budget? They include families, seniors, people with low \nincomes, small businesses--in other words, just about every group in \nthis country we really don't want to hit with higher taxes. But when \nthe current tax rates expire at the end of 2010 and the Democratic \nbudget permits the rates to go back up to where they were before, the \nso-called Bush tax cuts, we are going to see 116 million taxpayers \nstart sending more of their paychecks to Washington, DC.\n  The poor Federal Government needs more revenue, as my colleague said \nearlier. For the 7.8 million taxpayers taken off the rolls, if the \ncurrent tax policies are allowed to expire, 7.8 million families who \ncurrently don't pay any income taxes because of the way we constructed \nthe 2003 tax cuts would be put back on the rolls again. So there you \nhave people in the lower income brackets--7.8 million taxpayers we took \noff the rolls--who would come back as taxpayers under the Democratic \nbudget. Families, 43 million working families with children would see \ntheir taxes raised by an average of $2,300 in the year 2011 on average. \nTake a security guard earning $50,000, with a wife and two kids. He \nwould see his taxes go up by $2,300 in 2011. Take a widowed teacher's \naide with two kids. Her taxes will go up by $1,100 in 2011. That may \nnot seem like a lot of money here in Washington, but it is a lot of \nmoney for a family working hard to make ends meet, worrying each month \nabout where they will get the money to do all the things they need to \ndo.\n  We tend to think in this body and in the Congress generally not in \nterms of millions anymore or even hundreds of millions but in billions \nof dollars. In fact, trillions are starting to creep into our lexicon. \nWe need to get back to focus on what families are really concerned \nabout. One thousand there, $2,000 there, $4,000 there ends up being a \nlot of money to these families.\n  Who else is going to get hit? Senior citizens, 18 million senior \ncitizens will see their taxes rise by an average of $2,200 under this \nbudget. So every Democrat who proudly casts a vote in favor of this \nbudget, understand, this budget assumes that seniors will have an \naverage tax increase in 2011 of $2,200. An elderly couple with $40,000 \nin income, if the Democrats roll back our current tax policy, a couple \nover age 65 at $40,000 in income will see their taxes go up by $2,200 \nin 2011. Eighteen million seniors will see their taxes increase if the \ncurrent tax rates are not extended, which is not the case under the \nDemocratic bill. Seniors especially benefit from reasonable capital \ngains and dividends tax rates because frequently they have small \ninvestments. They are part of a teacher's pension or some other fund \nthat pays them dividends. Thirty percent of taxpaying seniors claim \ncapital gains. More than 50 percent of taxpaying seniors claim \nindividual dividends which would, of course, increase their tax \nliability under the Democratic budget.\n  We talk about small businesses. Small businesses are the engine of \nour economy. They provide more employment opportunities than all of the \nbig businesses combined. Yet they pay the income tax rate at the \nhighest level, which is the level of the ``rich.'' So whenever \nDemocrats talk about taxing the rich, understand their shotgun also \nincludes all of the small businesses because that is the rate they pay. \nSo in the tax world, small businesses are the same thing as high-income \nindividuals. Is that whom we want to harm, especially at a time when \nour economy, being in jeopardy as it is, has to rely upon the jobs \ncreated by small businesses? Seventy-five percent of all individual \nreturns in the top 1 percent of income include business income. In \nfact, 83 percent of all individual returns above $1 million included \nbusiness income. Think about that. That means that the bulk of the \npeople who are reporting income in this category include business \nincome.\n  Small businesses pay 54 percent of all individual income taxes. This \nis one of the worst things about the Democratic budget--not just for \nthe lack of equity, not just because it hurts individuals, but because \nit has a devastating impact on our economy at this critical time.\n  If tax rates are allowed to rise to their pre-2001 levels, 27 million \nsmall businesses will see their tax bill increased by over $4,000. I \nwill repeat it: 27 million small businesses will see their tax bill \nincrease by over $4,000.\n  I might just note parenthetically, there is a direct correlation, by \nthe way, between high taxes and high unemployment. In the United \nStates, we have had relatively low taxes because of the Bush tax cuts. \nWe collect about 34 percent of revenues as a percent of GDP; in fact, \n34.2 percent. Our unemployment rate is 4.8 percent. In the European \nUnion, the tax rates are more than 10 percent above that. They collect \n45.4 percent of revenues as a percent of their GDP, and their \nunemployment rate is almost 8 percent. It is 7.9 percent right at this \nmoment. So if we want higher unemployment, then raise taxes. It is a \npretty sure way to get there.\n  Let me conclude by discussing briefly what this budget does with \nrespect to the death tax because this has been a matter of particular \nconcern to me. I have talked to Chairman Baucus about this matter.\n  In the Finance Committee, I offered an amendment to reform the death \ntax. In exchange for my agreeing to lay the amendment aside because the \nother side did not want to vote on it, the chairman agreed to hold \nhearings with the goal of trying to report out a death tax reform \nproposal sometime this spring. He has now advised me that is not going \nto happen. We will have the hearing, but we will not have a markup to \nput out a bill. That is very disappointing. Yet the budget actually \nassumes that such a bill will pass.\n  The budget, as I understand it, has a provision for an amendment of \nthe death tax for so-called death tax reform. It is not very good \nreform because it would freeze the rate at 45 percent, which is a very \nhigh rate of taxation. It would set the exemption level at $3.5 \nmillion, which is not bad, but it could be better.\n  I have a better idea about what real reform would look like. What I \nwould like to do is to set the exempted amount at $5 million per \nperson, index that for inflation, and put the top death tax rate at no \nmore than 35 percent. I think it ought to be closer to 25 percent, but \nin the spirit of trying to reach a compromise, I will propose we at \nleast have it no higher than 35 percent. This would protect almost \n120,000 families, family businesses, and family farms from having to \npay the death tax each and every year. And it would promote continued \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  It is interesting to me that the United States has the third highest \nestate tax rate in the world and is 37 percent above the international \naverage. Twenty-four nations have no estate tax. There are only two \ncountries that have rates higher than ours. Ours would be at 45 percent \nunder the Democrat budget. In France it is only 40 percent. The average \nis about 13 percent.\n  One of the reasons other countries do not have this kind of tax at \nthe time of death is because of the amount of money that people will \nspend to try to avoid it. It has been estimated, as a matter of fact, \nthat there is almost an equal amount of money spent each year in an \neffort to try to avoid payment of the tax as there is paying the tax \nitself. And by ``trying to avoid it,'' I mean hiring lawyers and \naccountants and buying insurance policies, all of\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nwhich cost a lot of money. But due to some extent----\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me conclude my point on this, though I do appreciate the \nintercession of my colleague earlier, acknowledging that folks on his \nside of the aisle would like to see a lot more revenue because of the \nspending they would like to accomplish.\n  Let me finish this point about the death tax.\n  The U.S. Treasury estimates that the estate tax reduces bequests by \n14 percent. Individuals are either choosing to save less or rely \nheavily on estate planning, which is a large deadweight loss to the \neconomy. The death tax costs more money to comply with than it raises \nin revenue. As I said before, there is a direct correlation between the \ntwo.\n  Economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell estimated the amount spent \non avoiding the death tax is approximately equal to the amount \ncollected. The IRS estimates it takes about 38 hours to complete form \n706, the Federal estate tax return. Estate planning for businesses can \nrange from $5,000 to $250,000 for family limited partnerships and up to \n$1 million for closely held businesses. Fifty-two percent of the \nestates that filed a return were required to incur sizable legal, \naccounting, and other professional expenses even though they owed no \ntax.\n  So my point about the death tax is that almost no one thinks it is \nfair. Almost everybody acknowledges it should be reformed. We have \ntried year after year to reform it. We have not been able to get the \nnecessary votes to accomplish that, though virtually every Republican \nhas supported reform.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee assured us we would work toward \nthe goal of getting a bill this year but now says there will not be a \ngoal, and as to the ``reform'' in the budget, it turns out to be very \nlittle reform at all. In fact, it was the same ``reform'' we passed \nlast year as part of the budget. As everybody knows, the budget is not \nlaw. The budget is a goal, and we did not follow up on that goal. When \nI tried to do so, I was asked to back off for a future commitment, that \nwe would try to work on it this year. Now we are told we are not going \nto do it this year.\n  So let's just understand that what we would be doing in passing a \nbudget that theoretically has a proposal for death tax reform is not \nserious. We are not going to have death tax reform.\n  For those who vote for the amendment which will be offered here to \nsuggest there will be death tax reform, understand that if you do not \nfollow it up with real action to pass a bill that reforms the death \ntax, then this is nothing more than an unkept promise.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as they think about this, to recognize we \nwill be held accountable. We now have a year of experience following \nthe Democratic budget that was passed last year, and we see all of the \nunfulfilled commitments that were made in that budget now. Since the \nbudget tracks so carefully this year what we did last year, one has to \nask the same questions: Is it going to be the same this year where on \nthe death tax, for example, we are not able to get relief? As I said, I \nwill propose an amendment that I think takes a little bit better stab \nat death tax relief. I would hope we could get support as we have from \nsome of our Democratic colleagues on that to demonstrate we want to do \nsomething substantive this year on that subject rather than simply put \nit in the budget and claim we have done something when, in fact, \neverybody knows that just putting it in the budget does not actually \nchange anything.\n  Let me close, Madam President, by saying--I will be happy to yield, \nbut I will be happy to stop and let my colleague from Vermont just go \nahead, if he would like to do that--I want to acknowledge the hard work \nof the chairman of the Budget Committee, who is here. I know he is very \nmuch committed to trying his very best. But at a time when, as he \nacknowledged, many folks on his side of the aisle think the Federal \nGovernment needs more revenue, we are just in a debate in which we have \nto agree to disagree. He always does so in an amiable way, and I \nrespect that.\n  But I just believe it is the American taxpayer who deserves more \nrevenue, not the U.S. Government. Therefore, reluctantly, I will be \nopposing this budget in the form it is in and hope we can make \nsubstantial changes to it in a true spirit of bipartisanship.\n  I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator began by quoting me about \nthe need for more revenue and was kind enough to indicate he did not \nknow the context of it. I just thought I would provide the context \nbecause this was a ``60 Minutes'' program interview, and they were \nasking me in the context of the Comptroller General of the United \nStates warning the American people we are on an utterly unsustainable \nfiscal course because the debt is soaring before the baby boomers \nretire, and that we face a very serious consequence if we do not deal \nwith it.\n  So one question put to me was:\n\n       Do you think taxes ought to be raised?\n\n  Senator Conrad:\n\n       I believe, first of all, we need more revenue.\n\n  The next sentence, which the Senator did not provide:\n\n       We need to be tough on spending.\n\n  And the next sentence after that also the Senator did not provide:\n\n       And we need to reform the entitlement programs. We need to \n     do all of it.\n\n  Let me say, I am not alone in that view. The ranking Republican on \nthe Budget Committee said this at a hearing on our long-term fiscal \nchallenges. This is the Republican ranking member:\n\n        . . . [W]e also know revenues are going to have to go up, \n     if you're going to maintain a stable economy and a productive \n     economy, because of the simple fact that you're going to have \n     to have this huge generation that has to be paid for.\n\n  So the Senator's reference to my quote was in the context of dealing \nwith the enormous imbalance between the revenues of this Government and \nthe expenditures of this Government. My response was, yes, you are \ngoing to have to do something about revenue. Yes, you are going to have \nto be tough on spending, and you are going to have to reform the \nentitlement programs.\n  I also said in this interview, none of which aired, that the first \nplace to look for revenue is not a tax increase. The first place to \nlook for revenue is to go after the tax gap, the difference between \nwhat is owed and what is paid, to go after these offshore tax havens \nand abusive tax shelters. That was the context within which I said it.\n  Now, let me just indicate why this matters.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, might I just ask the Senator to yield for 1 \nsecond?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I specifically indicated that I did not know the context.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Because I respect the Senator so much and was sure he would \ntell us what the context was, No. 1.\n  No. 2, I certainly agree with the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee on both of the subsequent two comments: one, that we \nshould reduce spending, and, two, that we should have entitlement \nreform.\n  I would only make the point that I do not see a lot of reduced \nspending and entitlement reform in the budget, but perhaps the chairman \ncould go on and discuss that as well.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I would say to him, \nI do not believe entitlement reform is ever going to happen--long-term \nentitlement reform--in a 5-year budget resolution. I think the only way \nwe are going to get entitlement reform is a bipartisan effort, and that \nis what Senator Gregg, the ranking Republican, and I have offered, \nwhich is a task force of 16 members, equally divided, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to come up with a long-term plan.\n  I would be very candid. I think the truth is, it is going to require \nmore revenue. Again, I would say before any tax increase, the first \nplace I would look are these places where people are not paying what \nthey legitimately owe when the vast majority of us do.\n  Now, I must say, I used to be a tax commissioner. I was the elected \ntax commissioner of my State. I was chairman for several terms of the \nMultistate Tax Commission. Senator Dorgan and I are probably the only \nones who have\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\naudited the books and records of companies and individuals.\n  I can tell you, there is loads of money out there. One reason I was \nelected to the U.S. Senate is I found for my State lots of money that \nwas not being paid over to the State of North Dakota because people \nwere fudging. Large companies were fudging. Senator Dorgan and I in \npart made our reputations by going after them and very successfully \ncollecting money from taxpayers who were not paying what they \nlegitimately owed.\n  I could go through chapter and verse of what I found as I examined \nthe books and records of major companies. I have shown some of it on \nthe floor of the Senate: a little five-story building in the Cayman \nIslands that claims it is the home of 12,600 companies. Now, they are \nnot doing business out of that little building in the Cayman Islands. \nThey are doing monkey business. They are avoiding their taxes.\n  I showed earlier another building in the Cayman Islands: a five-story \nbuilding we now know is being used by one company alone to dodge \nhundreds of millions of taxes they owe to the United States. That is \nnot right.\n  I would also say with respect to the tax cuts that have been promoted \nby this administration, overwhelmingly they have gone to the wealthiest \namong us. Here, in 2007, those earning over $1 million a year on \naverage got a tax break of almost $120,000 a year. I do not think that \nis right. I have wealthy friends, as I think probably all of us in this \nChamber do, who have said to me: I don't need it. I don't need that \n$120,000 tax cut. I am much more worried about the debt that is being \nsent to our kids.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Conrad). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has just left \nthe floor, unfortunately. But I did want to make two points. He has \nreferred to something called the death tax, which is what we call the \nestate tax, which was developed by President Teddy Roosevelt way back \nwhen. What he forgot to mention is that this estate tax--and as I \nunderstand it, the Senator from Arizona, if he had all of his wish \nfulfilled would repeal the estate tax completely--benefits only the \nwealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of the population.\n  So for all of the concerns about the onerous impact of the estate \ntax, it benefits three-tenths of 1 percent. Mr. President, 99.7 percent \nof the families will not benefit at all from the repeal of the estate \ntax.\n  The second point is, if the estate tax were completely repealed, the \nestimate is over a 20-year period it would add about $1 trillion to our \ndebt--$1 trillion--which, like the war in Iraq, is simply not paid for.\n  So when people talk about fiscal responsibility, I find it a little \nbit hard to understand how they could dump another $1 trillion into our \nnational debt, which benefits only the top three-tenths of 1 percent of \nthe population, which means it will be the middle class and working \nfamilies who are obliged to have to pay that off over many years. \nSometimes when our friends on the Republican side talk about fiscal \nresponsibility, I am not quite sure where they are coming from.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, by the way, for sitting in for me, and \nas soon as I finish, I will take the chair.\n  However, I wish to say a budget--and the budget we are debating right \nnow on the floor of the Senate--is not just numbers. A budget is about \nthe values of our country and the priorities of our country. Within \nthat context, it is important to understand what, in fact, is going on \nin America right now.\n  The simple reality is, the middle class is collapsing. Everybody who \ngets into their car in the morning and pays $3.20 for a gallon of gas, \nthen goes to work and finds that they are paying a lot more for their \nhealth insurance than they used to, understands they don't have a \npension when at one time they were promised a pension, understands that \nover 8 million Americans since Bush has been President have lost their \nhealth insurance.\n  The middle class is in collapse. Wages are going down for tens of \nmillions of Americans.\n  During the Bush administration, private sector job growth has \naveraged less than 50,000 per month compared with over 220,000 under \nthe Clinton administration. Since President Bush has been in office, \nfrom 2001, nearly 5 million more Americans have slipped into poverty. \nMedian household income for working-age families is down by $2,500. \nEight and a half million Americans lost their health insurance. Three \nmillion lost their pensions. The annual trade deficit has more than \ndoubled, and over 3 million good-paying manufacturing jobs have been \nlost. The price of gas at the pump and home heating oil has more than \ndoubled, while ExxonMobile made $40 billion in profits last year--more \nthan any company in the history of the world. The personal savings rate \nrecently dipped below zero--something that hasn't happened since the \nGreat Depression. Home foreclosures, of course, are now the highest on \nrecord, turning the American dream of home ownership into an American \nnightmare for millions.\n  The reason I raise these issues is, it is important to put the debate \nover the budget in a general context. This is not some abstraction. \nThis is not some academic exercise. We are talking about the priorities \nof the American people within the context of what is really happening \nto the middle-class and working families.\n  I found it interesting that my good friend from Arizona talked about \nthe European Union and tried to compare the United States in terms of \ntax policy to other countries. Well, let me also compare the United \nStates to some other countries.\n  Today, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of \nany major country on Earth. We have the highest infant mortality rate \nof any major country on Earth. We have the highest overall poverty rate \nof any major country on Earth. We have the largest gap between the rich \nand the poor, the most people behind bars, and we are the only country \nin the industrialized world not to have a national health care program.\n  Now, I wonder if my friends who get up and talk about the European \nUnion might on occasion mention the kind of health care systems that \nexist in every single one of those countries, which guarantees health \ncare to all of their people. Try to describe the types of parental \nleave programs that exist when families have a baby. Americans could \nnot understand the extent to which those countries are ahead of us in \nterms of family values.\n  So while the middle class in this country declines, while poverty \nincreases, while we have the highest infant mortality rate of any other \ncountry, while 17,000 Americans die because they don't have any health \ninsurance, there is another reality in American society today, a \nreality that we should also be talking about, and that is the \nwealthiest people in this country have never had it so good since the \n1920s.\n  According to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the \nwealthiest 400 Americans increased by $290 billion last year. Four \nhundred families, $290 billion increase last year, to $1.54 trillion. \nIn addition, the top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent.\n  Sometimes my Republican friends talk about averages and so forth. \nThat is not the reality. If you look at the American economy as one \nwould look at a football game or a baseball game, the important \nquestion to ask is, who is winning and who is losing? Well, let me be \nvery clear. The middle class is losing. Working families are losing. \nThe people on top have never had it so good since the 1920s. They are \nwinning, and they are winning big time. To ignore that reality is to \nignore what is happening in American society.\n\n  The question then becomes, given that reality, where do we go from \nhere? What we do know is the President has given us his answer. The \nPresident has brought forth a budget. He has told us that in his \nbudget, we don't have enough money to meet the health care needs of \nthis country. So at a time when our health care system is \ndisintegrating, the President has decided we cannot adequately fund the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and that we should cut Medicare and \nMedicaid by more than $600 billion over the next decade. Think about \nit. The health care system is disintegrating, more and more people \nuninsured, more and more people having higher deductibles and \ncopayments. The President's response: Let's make a terrible situation \neven worse.\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\n  The President has said in his budget that we need to reduce the \nnumber of children receiving childcare by 200,000 kids. Any mother, any \nparent understands that our current childcare situation in America \ntoday is an absolute disaster. We say to single moms, go out and work, \nbut we forget to ask what are those moms supposed to do with their 2-\nyear-olds or their 3-year-olds? Should we leave them home alone in the \napartment or should we provide quality childcare for them?\n  Well, in Vermont and all over this country, it is increasingly \ndifficult for families to secure quality, affordable childcare, and the \nPresident's brilliant response is, let's cut the number of children \nreceiving childcare assistance by 200,000.\n  My friend from Arizona said: Are there some people who want to spend \nmore money? And I said: Yes, I do. I do not want the children in this \ncountry to have the dubious distinction of having the highest rate of \npoverty of any major country on Earth, and I would hope that every \nMember of the Senate would be deeply humiliated and embarrassed about \nthat reality taking place within this country.\n  There is a housing crisis all over America--in Vermont and all over \nAmerica--and I am not just talking about foreclosures. I am talking \nabout the needs of working families to find safe and affordable \nhousing. The President's response in the middle of this crisis is, \nlet's provide 100,000 fewer section 8 housing vouchers to low-income \nfamilies.\n  The President, in his budget, has said there is not enough money for \nspecial education. We made a promise to school districts all over \nAmerica decades ago. We said: If you mainstream kids--which I think is \na great idea--we will pick up the very high cost of special education. \nThat was the promise. Today, in Vermont and all over America, more and \nmore kids are coming in with special ed needs. School districts are \npaying outrageously high property taxes to accommodate those kids. I \nthink it is time to keep the promise we made to school districts and \nadequately fund special education. Yes, I think we should do that.\n  I think we should adequately fund Head Start so all of the families \nin America who want their kids to get a decent start so they are not \nbehind when they enter the first grade have that opportunity. But \nsomehow, in the midst of not funding the needs of our kids, as well as \nnot funding housing, not funding LIHEAP, not funding virtually every \nneed of low- and middle-income families, the President does have some \nmoney available. If you are rich, the President has money available for \nyou. The President believes we have enough money to provide $812 \nbillion in tax cuts for households earning more than $1 million per \nyear over the next decade--not for our children, not for the homeless, \nnot for the hungry, but for people who are earning over $1 million a \nyear.\n  That is an absurd and obscene sense of priorities. Fortunately, while \nthe budget resolution we will be debating this week is not perfect, it \nis a vast improvement over the President's budget. I thank the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Conrad, for his hard work in giving us that \nbudget. Instead of cutting back on the educational needs of this \ncountry, this budget resolution provides $5.4 billion more than the \nPresident's request for education, including the largest increase for \nelementary and secondary education programs since 2002. Instead of \ncutting back on the needs of our veterans--which has long been the \nhistory of the Bush administration--this budget resolution provides a \n$3.2 billion increase over the President's budget for our veterans. \nInstead of ignoring the urgent need to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil and fossil fuels, this budget resolution provides $8.45 billion to \ninvest in clean energy, creating millions of good-paying, green-collar \njobs and energy efficiency.\n  Instead of cutting back on our Nation's enormous infrastructure \nneeds--can you imagine the engineers, civil engineers, telling us we \nhave over $1 trillion in unmet infrastructure needs, and this White \nHouse is refusing to even acknowledge the severity of the problem and \nis asking the cities and towns that are hard pressed to come up with \nthe money?\n  This budget resolution provides almost $9 billion more than the \nPresident for our roads, bridges, highways, sewers, and clean water \nimprovement. It is not enough, but it is a step forward. I think over \nthe long term, we can do even better than that. We have made progress \nin this budget, and we can do better.\n  One area to which I will be paying particular attention is our \nchildren. It is not acceptable to me, as I said earlier, that we have \nthe highest rate of childhood poverty among our children. Where are all \nof those people who keep talking about family values? How do they \ncontinue to ignore the reality that, by far, we have the highest rate \nof childhood poverty of any major country? Nearly one out of every five \nchildren in this country lives in poverty. That is not a family value; \nthat is a national disgrace.\n  What happens to these kids when they become adults? Many of them will \ndo well, but many of them will not. My colleagues may have recently \nseen an article in many of the papers talking about the fact that the \nUnited States has more people behind bars, at great expense--great \nexpense for States and for the Federal Government--than any other \ncountry; more than China in total numbers. I happen to believe there is \na correlation between the fact that we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty and kids who drop off the wagon when they are young--\nthey drop out of society, they do drugs, they do destructive activity, \nthey end up in jail, and we spend $50,000 to keep them in jail--rather \nthan providing the childcare and educational opportunities they need.\n  In my opinion, there are three major trends in American society that \nwe should be addressing in this budget process. First, the fact that \nthe United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth and \nincome of any major country, and the gap between the very rich and \neveryone else is growing wider.\n  Second, as I mentioned earlier, we have the highest rate of childhood \npoverty. Third--and I know the Presiding Officer has made this point \nover and over again--we have a $9.2 trillion national debt, which is \nsoaring to $10 trillion; that under the Bush administration we have \nseen a $3 trillion increase in the national debt. This is a debt that \nis unsustainable economically, and it is a debt that is immoral because \nwe are simply piling it up and leaving it to our kids and our \ngrandchildren.\n  I think those are some of the trends in American society that we \nshould be dealing with in this budget. This week, I will be offering an \namendment which is being cosponsored by Senators Durbin, Mikulski and \nBoxer, which is a very simple amendment. It doesn't go as far as I \npersonally would like it to go, but it is a step forward perhaps in \nchanging the nature of the debate that we have on the floor of the \nSenate. It puts the needs of our kids, working families, persons with \ndisabilities, and senior citizens on fixed incomes ahead of the wealthy \nfew. That is what it does.\n  Specifically, this amendment would restore the top income tax bracket \nto 39.6 percent for households earning more than $1 million per year.\n  That is the only group of people impacted, households earning more \nthan $1 million a year. That is three-tenths of 1 percent of our \npopulation. We use that revenue to address the urgent unmet needs of \nour kids, dealing with job creation and deficit reduction.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, restoring the top income tax \nbracket for people making more than $1 million to what it was in 2000, \nbefore the Bush tax breaks for the wealthy, would increase revenue by \n$32.5 billion over the next 3 years, including $10.8 billion in fiscal \nyear 2009 alone.\n  We have a choice in the Senate. We can give $32.5 billion to the top \nthree-tenths of 1 percent, or people making at least $1 million a year, \nincluding billionaires, or else we can do something else with this \nmoney. Let me suggest we should do something else. Let me suggest that \nat a time when all of the Presidential candidates are talking about \nchange, change, change, when the American people want to move our \ncountry in a new direction, maybe the Senate can begin that journey of \ntaking this Nation in a new way that is more equitable, more fair, and \nbegins to address longstanding social needs.\n  Here is the option: $32.5 billion more in tax relief for millionaires \nand billionaires--and I suspect that many of\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\nour friends on the Republican side think that is a great idea--or there \nis another option. It is $10 billion over a 3-year period to go into \nthe program of special ed. This will not only allow school districts \nthe opportunity to better educate kids with special ed needs, it will \nalso lower property taxes and local taxes. Most importantly, it will \nkeep the promise that was made to school districts all over this \ncountry.\n  The Federal Government made a promise that it would fund 40 percent \nof the cost of special ed. Unfortunately, today we are about at 17 \npercent. If you want to raise our credibility, let's keep the promise \nwe made to school districts all over America and take care of some of \nour most vulnerable kids. So $10 billion goes to that.\n  Then this amendment would also increase Head Start by $5 billion over \nthe next 3 years. Every study indicates that Head Start works. It gives \nkids, who otherwise don't have the intellectual and emotional \nenvironment, the chance to do well when they get to school. It is a \ngood investment. It is better to invest $5 billion in Head Start than \nit would be in jails.\n  This amendment would provide a $4 billion increase for the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant Program so that working families all over this \ncountry will have a fair shot at trying to find affordable childcare.\n  This amendment puts a $3.5 billion increase into the Food Stamp \nProgram. In my view, hunger in America is not something we should be \nabout. This will take us a small step toward addressing hunger.\n  This amendment would put $4 billion into the LIHEAP program because \nnobody in America should go cold in the winter or die of heat exposure \nwhen the temperature gets to 120 and they don't have an air \nconditioner.\n  This amendment would also provide $3 billion for school construction, \nand it would create good-paying jobs in the process and make sure our \nkids have good schools in which to learn.\n  Also, this amendment would reduce the deficit by $3 billion. So that \nis what we do. We reduce the deficit, protect our children, and protect \nthe most vulnerable people. That is one option. Or we give another $32 \nbillion in tax relief to people who don't need it. I think the choice \nis pretty clear. I hope this amendment will receive widespread support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, I thank our colleague from Vermont, who is \npassionate and cares very deeply about people in the country, about \ntheir future, and about the children. I could not agree more with him \nabout what has been the underfunding of a very important investment, \nand that is special education.\n  The Federal Government was supposed to pay 40 percent of special \neducation and has never, I believe, gotten over 18 or 19 percent. So I \nthank the Senator for the amendment he will offer later.\n  I thank the Budget Committee chairman also who is someone who does \nsuch an extraordinary job on a daily basis on such a wide range of \nissues. There is no one more committed to the long-term fiscal health \nof the country, no one more committed to getting our priorities right, \nno one who works more effectively across the aisle to bring people \ntogether to do the right thing. So I thank our distinguished colleague, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, for all of his incredible \nleadership and pointing us in the right direction and creating a budget \nresolution that I am proud of.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan, who is \nan incredibly valuable member of the Budget Committee, and also \nincredibly important member of the Finance Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee. We are able to serve on three committees \ntogether, and that is rare around here. My admiration for her grows \nevery day. In terms of her leadership, we could not have produced a \nbudget resolution as responsible as this one, nor one that embraces the \nneeds of the American people and their values as closely as this one \nwithout the leadership of the Senator from Michigan. I wanted to tell \nher how much I appreciate that.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator. That means a lot.\n  Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes because I expect to \nhave multiple opportunities in which to participate and talk about \nvarious parts of the budget resolution that I believe reflect the \nvalues and priorities of the American people. That is what budgets are. \nThat is what our own individual budgets are.\n  When we look at our checkbooks and where we spend our money, we hope \nit reflects the values we want to project. Sometimes it does and \nsometimes it doesn't in my own budget, my own checkbook. But the \nreality is, that is our job in terms of the Federal budget and where we \ninvest that makes sense for American families.\n  I have to say that listening to colleagues tonight, as I had the \nopportunity to preside--colleagues on the other side of the aisle--I \nheard more of the same, unfortunately, that we have seen for the last 8 \nyears. Six of those eight years have been dominated by colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, by a Republican President and a Republican \nCongress. Unfortunately, in my mind, when we talk about what they are \ngoing to propose, in totality what we see is more debt. We see more tax \ncuts for the wealthiest among us, more spending in Iraq and, at the \nsame time, we see less investment in America. That is exactly the \nopposite of what we ought to be doing.\n  Our budget changes that. It focuses on balancing the budget by 2012 \nand 2013. It provides middle-class tax cuts so we can make sure the \nfolks who are trying to hold things together--everybody talks about \nmiddle-class families and middle-class people being squeezed, seeing \ngas prices and health care and childcare costs go up. Yet the reality \nis, unfortunately, the budget put forward by the President doesn't help \nthem at all. I am proud to say we have a budget that, in fact, invests \nin America. I want to speak to one piece of that.\n  Last year, we set up three main priorities for our budget, and I was \nvery proud of those--one to fully fund veterans health care and make \nsure we are keeping the promises to the veterans of America. We did it \nlast year, and we are doing it again this year. We will continue, as \nlong as we are in the majority, to make sure that is the case. We want \nto make sure people have the opportunity to go to college. We passed \nthe largest package since the GI bill after World War II. No. 3 was \nchildren's health insurance, which we passed on a bipartisan basis. It \nwas an extraordinary effort. We actually had the votes to overturn a \nPresidential veto and could not do that in the House of \nRepresentatives. We added 10 million children to the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, which gives them the opportunity to make sure their \nchildren have health insurance.\n  This year, we continue those things, but we have three more items we \nhave picked. Mr. President, just to be simple, what I would say is our \npriorities are jobs, jobs, jobs. I can tell you, coming from the great \nState of Michigan, that is certainly what we want our focus to be on. \nWe are talking about middle-income families who are struggling. And the \nbest stimulus that you can possibly give somebody is a good-paying job \nso they can pay their bills, take care of their family, send their kids \nto college, and be able to have the American dream. I am very proud of \nthe fact that our budget focuses on three priorities: jobs, jobs, jobs. \nHow?\n  We have three pieces in our budget. We focus on green-collar jobs. I \nam very proud of the fact that the initiative I put forward is \nincorporated. The Presiding Officer is passionate about pieces of this \nlegislation as well. We know there is a new economy. We know that \nalternative energy and moving forward in ways that will address global \nwarming and stop our dependence on foreign oil can create jobs as well. \nSo we have a major new initiative in this bill for green-collar jobs.\n  Secondly, jobs rebuilding America--water projects, sewers, roads, \nbridges. We are at a point in our country where we have an aging \ninfrastructure. A lot of we baby boomers are aging but at the same time \nso is the infrastructure around us. The great thing about investing and \nrebuilding America is that these are not jobs you can outsource to \nanother country; these are jobs right\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\nhere in America--good-paying jobs. That is our second priority.\n  Our third priority is to continue our focus on education and job \ntraining. We know we need to refocus on job training and on those who \nlost jobs because of trade by fully funding trade adjustment assistance \nfor people to go back to school and gain new opportunities.\n  Mr. President, we are saying jobs, jobs, jobs. I want to focus \nspecifically on the piece in which I have been most involved. This is \nvery exciting. We passed an energy bill last year with a number of \nprograms in it that were not funded but that were great ideas. This \nyear, we come back and say let's make those things a reality in this \nbudget.\n  Energy efficiency and conservation: Providing over $1.1 billion for \nState and local communities to not only focus on energy efficiency and \nconservation but buildings and weatherization. There is a huge amount \nof energy savings to be had by focusing in this area. It also creates \nlots and lots of jobs. It will put people to work weatherizing \nbuildings and focusing on energy efficiency.\n  Advanced batteries: For us to go where we want to go in terms of new \nalternative fuel vehicles, it involves focusing on advanced battery \ntechnology. We are doing that but not nearly as fast as other \ncountries. In the American budget last year, there was $22 million. Yet \nyou can look over to China, Japan, and South Korea where hundreds of \nmillions of dollars are being spent. As a result of that, we see very \ntangible things happening. When Ford Motor Company came forward with \nthe first Ford Escape hybrid, an American SUV hybrid, unfortunately, \neven though the brain power came from here and the engineering came \nfrom here, the battery came from Japan because we weren't making them \nhere.\n  We don't want to change from dependence on foreign oil to a \ndependence on foreign technology. So investing in the future in battery \ntechnology is incredibly important, not only for vehicles but battery \nstorage is critical for such things as winds turbines, solar, and other \nareas where we need to be able to move forward with alternative energy. \nBattery storage is critical. I am proud that we put forward for the \nfirst time an aggressive investment in innovation and production here \nat home.\n  Retooling older plants. As we have new standards for fuel efficiency \ncoming into play, we want to make sure we are retooling our old plants \nto keep American jobs here, biofuel production and access, meaning \ninfrastructure. I come from a State where we are growing the biofuels \nand making the automobiles. If you cannot drive up to the service \nstation and fuel with E-85 or biofuel, it is not going to matter in the \nend.\n  So being able to have that infrastructure and investment in \ninfrastructure is absolutely critical. Finally, a green job training \nprogram to refocus on those jobs we know are there for the future. \nAgain, the Presiding Officer has been a passionate advocate, and I know \nhe believes strongly that jobs and energy and focusing on global \nwarming and jobs can go together, and that is what this does. This says \nwe are going to take this first step to focus on the American people.\n  What I will say again, as we go forward, there are many items that \nare in this budget that are very important. But what I am very proud of \nis the fact that we have put forward a budget resolution with three \nvery simple priorities: jobs, jobs, jobs. And that is right where the \nAmerican people are. People want American jobs where they can care for \ntheir families, they can have the dignity of work, they can have good \nwages and be able to have an American dream. This budget resolution is \nlaser-focused on that priority.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to spend a few minutes tonight \non some observations. My hope is over the next couple of days to \noutline something that has never been done on the Senate floor before, \nand that is to discuss where we as a body fail. We are all the time \ntelling the American people what we do great or how bad the other side \nis, but rarely do we take a look at ourselves and say: What is going \non? What are the problems we face?\n  I had a great weekend this weekend in Oklahoma. Part of Oklahoma got \nsnow, part of it had 65 degrees and Sun and no wind. But I had some \nexperiences I want to share because I think they are pertinent and also \npoignant to the issue we are discussing.\n  I also note I have been listening to the debate all afternoon, and \nthe debate is nothing but finger-pointing--one budget, the other \nbudget, how bad somebody is, what somebody didn't do, what somebody \nwants to do. It strikes me that as I reflect on the people whom I saw \nthis weekend and their hopes and dreams, most of this debate does not \nhave anything to do with them. Most of this debate has to do with us, \nwhich is exactly the opposite reason of why we were sent here. What we \nhave heard is a partisan debate, partisanship based on parties, not \npartisanship based on principles, not partisanship based on children, \nnot partisanship based on the future, but who can twang it, who can \nmanipulate it, who can create doubt and undermine someone else's \nposition.\n  I traveled to Oklahoma City. My brother has been in the hospital for \n16 days. He had a major operation called Whipple--it takes a long time \nto get over it--for pancreatic carcinoma. That is what they do the \noperation for. He has four kids and four grandkids and one on the way. \nI got to thinking, as he lay there with an NG tube in him and a feeding \ntube through his jejunum, what would he like for his kids? What would \nhe like for us to be talking about for the future? Down the hall were a \nwhole lot of other people just like him. He is 61 years old. He is not \nthinking about himself as he lays there in the hospital. He is thinking \nabout what is the future for his grandkids.\n  I visited with one of my longest term friends this weekend. He is not \nthinking about himself right now. He is thinking about his grandkids. \nHe has one and one on the way, going to be delivered this next weekend. \nHe didn't mention one thing about himself. He mentioned about what the \nfuture was for his kids.\n  I think about the ladies whom I saw this morning in my medical office \nabout to have babies. Their hopes and their dreams are about the \ngeneration that is to come, about how this miracle birth is going to \ntake place over the next couple of weeks for both these ladies. One is \nnamed Natalie and one is named Brooke; one is a first-time mom, the \nother is a second-time mom. The things they are looking forward to with \ntheir children are totally dependent on whether we act as adults in \nthis body.\n  I have just been struck at how far off the mark we are.\n  I think Kent Conrad is a great guy. I looked at what he did last \nyear. He is a pretty fiscally conservative guy. Kent sponsored less \nthan $20 billion worth of new spending over the next 5 years, total \nsponsorships. Many times in the last 3 or 4 years, we have had debates \nabout how we handle the problems. The differences between us are not \nthat great. What guides us, though, and what is destroying our country, \nI fear, is the fact that we are putting political parties and the \nbenefits of the political budget ahead of the best interests of our \nkids.\n  One of the things I hope to do tomorrow is to outline for the \nAmerican public and this body everything I found in the last 3 years in \nterms of waste on an annualized basis. I want my colleagues to hear \nthat again. Everything I have found in terms of waste where we do not \ndo it right, where we are wasting taxpayers' dollars every year, and I \ncan conservatively, just on what I found and I can fully document--I \nwant you to understand that, Mr. President; it is not Tom Coburn's \nopinion, it is the opinion of the GAO, the CBO, oversight committees, \nand other committees of Congress that are documenting what I am about \nto share.\n\n  What I am going to share tomorrow is how we fail because we are \ntalking about a budget today--I told Kent Conrad, I am not out to game \nhis budget. It will spend more money. That is not a whole lot different \nfrom what we have been doing. But how dare we spend another penny when \nI can document, and none of my colleagues can refute, $366 billion a \nyear of waste or fraud, $366 billion a year. Let me explain what that \nmeans to the average consumer.\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\n  If you are at home today and you are in the 25-percent tax bracket in \nterms of income tax, what that means is that about 9 percent of the \nmoney you pay, we blow. So that is one-third, that is 9 out of the 28 \npercent, one-third of all the money you pay to the Federal Government, \nnot counting your Social Security and Medicare taxes, but of your \nincome taxes, one-third of it, we blow.\n  The interesting thing is that not since 1995 has the Congress done \nany rescission spending. Let me explain what that is. That is the \nCongress looks at our budget and says: Are there any areas where we can \nsave money, where we are not doing well, where we can be more \nefficient, where we can improve things? We haven't had a rescission \npackage since 1995. That is 13 years that we have not had a rescission \npackage. There are lots of reasons for that, none of them good. It does \nnot matter which party is in control. There has not been a rescission \npackage for 13 years. So it is not about parties. It is not about \ngaming somebody because somebody is a Democrat or somebody is a \nRepublican. Our problems in our Nation today are much more serious than \npartisanship. They are much greater than the beneficial effects of \nwinning an election based on how you can make somebody else look lousy.\n  One of the important things I hope will come out as we go through \nthis in the next couple of days is whether we really care about what is \ngoing to happen. We can look at the stock market--it has weak knees \ntoday; look at the price of commodities--it is rising. There is no \nsecret we are in a time of economic weakness. Depression is described \nas two quarters successively. We are probably there. Nobody knows. \nNobody has a crystal ball to know that. But the fact is, it is what we \nare leaving right now for these two, Brooke and Natalie's children who \nare going to be born in the next 3 weeks. What do we leave them? We are \nleaving them a gift, and the gift is debtor's prison.\n  Let me say that again. I don't say that lightly. We are leaving them \na gift. According to the Government Accountability Office, if you are \nborn tomorrow, you inherit $400,000 of unfunded liabilities. Does \nanybody know anybody who is working and struggling and making a middle-\nclass income or even an upper income who is going to be able to afford \nthat amount? Just paying the interest on it is $28,000 a year, and you \nhave to absorb that by the time you get old enough to work. So we are \ntalking about another $6,000 worth of interest before they start paying \noff any principal. So, in essence, the heritage through our \nincompetence, our bickering, our partisanship because we have to show \nsomebody up, the heritage is every kid who is born, by the time they \nget a chance to work, is going to be accumulating about $1 million \nworth of debt. The question we have to ask ourselves is, What happens \nto them? What happens to the dream of a Brooke or a Natalie and their \nchildren? What is going to happen to them?\n  We are about this far from losing the triple-A credit rating on our \ncountry, on our bonds. At the same time, we see that in the last 8 \nyears, the price of gold relative to the dollar is fourfold. What does \nthat tell us? Is there a shortage of gold? No. Is there a fourfold \nincrease in the demand for gold for industrial uses? No. It is a flight \nto safety because many people in the world do not believe we are going \nto be able to pay back the $79 trillion of unfunded liabilities we have \nleft.\n  So as we come to a budget for the United States and we pass one--\nwhich we will, probably--we do it absent the light of looking at $360 \nbillion-plus that is wasted every year--$360 billion. People might say: \nWhat is that? It is pretty easy. How about Medicare fraud, $80 billion \na year. How about Medicare improper payments? We pay people when they \ndo not deserve to be paid--not fraud, just incompetency--$10 billion a \nyear. There is $90 billion in one program. There is nothing in this \nbudget that fixes that situation. There was nothing in the Republican \nbudgets that fixed that. Why not? I know the answer to why not. The \nanswer to why not is because we were too busy making political games, \npolitical strokes. We were too busy being partisan. The time for \npartisanship in our country is past. We may not believe that, but \nhistory is going to show it.\n  David Walker, the Comptroller General of the United States, one of \nthe fairest, most openminded men I believe I have ever met in my life, \non Wednesday is leaving that position. Why is he doing that? He has a \nguaranteed job until 2012, a great job, head of an agency that really \nis stellar in what it does in its performance. Why is he leaving that \nposition? Because he is scared to death for our country because nobody \nis listening in positions of power. Nobody is paying attention to the \nunsustainable course on which we find ourselves. We are not. We haven't \nin the budget. We didn't in our budget. We are not. We don't on the \nsupplementals that come through here to ``fund the war'' because we \nload up $20 billion to $30 billion more debt right on top of our kids.\n\n  We hear all these false numbers. Yes, I said false. The budget \nnumbers are games. The President's numbers about the deficit are wrong. \nThe Budget Committee's numbers about the deficit are wrong. They are \nnot realistic. They do not take into account the fact that we are going \nto steal about $170 billion worth of Social Security money this year--I \nthink $163 billion is the accurate number. We are going to write an \nIOU, and then we are not going to tell the American public that we \nincreased the debt another $163 billion. We are just going to pass that \nalong to our kids.\n  I have some little things for you to think about as we outline this. \nThere is $2.5 billion a year in Social Security disability fraud. There \nis another $1 billion in improper payments. Think about this. Just $2.5 \nbillion. Just $2.5 billion. Just 2,500 millions. Just 2,500 millions or \n2,500,000 thousands. They are pretty hard numbers to get our hands on.\n  So anyhow, in the next few days, I am going to list out one by one, I \nam going to go through everything we have seen in the last 3 years that \ncontinues daily in this Federal Government that this body won't attack. \nWhen we offer amendments in this body, they are either accepted so they \ncan be thrown out in conference when they actually do something, such \nas the census amendment that was in the Senate. We are now going to be \nasked for about $2 billion more for the census even though we have been \nsaying all along there was a problem there. We ignored it, the House \nconferees with the Senate conferees ignored it, and now we are going to \nspend $2 billion more.\n  What we are going to do is outline thoroughly what just one office, \njust one Senate office, has found over 3 years, and it is all going to \nbe fully documented, with footnotes, so you can see exactly where it \ncame from. It is going to be indisputable.\n  Now ask yourself, if you are an American out there struggling to pay \nyour gas and things are not looking great for the next 6 months for \nyou, what would you think if all the Senators did that and we really \ndid get rid of all the waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal \nGovernment, or at least a meaningful component of it, and that we \nreally probably could cut $600 billion out of our budget, which would \nmean we could either--if you wanted a bigger Government, you could do \nmore, or if you wanted to pay fewer taxes, you could pay less? But most \nimportantly, we could live up to the heritage that is ours, which is \ncreating an opportunity for our children and our grandchildren in the \nfuture.\n  I am convinced that Americans aren't really asking for higher taxes. \nWhat they are asking for is smart spending, hard work by us to make \nsure what we spend is worth it. What they are asking for is no more \nearmarks. That is what 85 percent of them are asking for. And they are \nasking for no more bridges to nowhere and what it symbolizes in terms \nof excess, in terms of a lack of common sense or a lack of caring. I \ndon't know which it is, but the fact is, we are on a collision course \nthat is going to undermine the future of this country.\n  Will Durant, a historian, said that democracies never fail and are \nnever collapsed from without until they have moral decay that causes \nthe collapse from within. When we are spending the money of our \ngrandchildren today and not doing anything about the waste we have in \nour budget, the question has to be asked: Are we already there? Have we \nalready risen to the point where the political class, the political \nelites care so much about their positions--both\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\nparties--that they are willing to throw the future of the next two \ngenerations of this great country under the bus?\n  The next year is critical for this Nation, as we see what happened \ntoday in the stock market, another lower earnings, as we see consumer \nconfidence decline. Wouldn't it be nice if the Senate stood up to the \nchallenge that is facing this country and did so without the first \npartisan word about parties and said: Let's fix it. Let's fix it.\n  I have had an ongoing study since I have been in Government to ask \nFederal employees this question, and I have never had a different \nanswer. And the question is this: If you are a Federal employee, no \nmatter where you work, what branch you work in, or what you do, if you \nhad to, tomorrow, for the sake of our future, become 5 percent more \nefficient--in other words, not spend $1 out of $20--could you do it? Do \nyou realize I have asked that question thousands of times, and I have \nnever been told no. I have never been told no.\n  Well, if that is the case, why aren't we doing it, when we are going \nto have a $607 billion deficit? We are going to be at $10 trillion of \ndebt at the end of this year. That is real debt. That doesn't talk \nabout unfunded liabilities, which are $79 trillion. So we have $10 \ntrillion worth of debt, $79 trillion under infinity, of unfunded \nliabilities, and we don't talk about that.\n\n  How is it that we find ourselves allowing such things as the military \nto continue to hang on to buildings they do not want to the tune of $2 \nbillion to $3 billion a year just in maintenance costs? How is it that \nwe have $18 billion worth of buildings we don't want but we can't sell \nbecause of the roadblocks we have put in the way to be able to sell \nthem? How is it that the Pentagon pays performance bonuses of $8 \nbillion a year to companies that don't meet the requirements of \nperformance bonuses? How is it that we are allowing that to continue to \nhappen? We have known of that for 3 years. Why is it happening?\n  By the way, what is the big stir right now? The big stir is Boeing \ndidn't get the contract and Lockheed--or EADS did. Nobody is asking the \nright question on that. It doesn't matter who got the contract. It is a \ncost-plus contract. If we don't know what we want in a refueling tanker \nnow after 8 years of studying it, we are never going to know. So a $35 \nbillion contract is going to become a $45 billion contract, just like \nall the rest of them. Instead, we ought to be insisting, if you are \ndoing business with the Federal Government and making money, you ought \nto take some risk. There ought to be no more cost-plus contracts on \nprocurements like that. There ought to be none. Whoever has that \ncontract ought to take part of the risk for the American people because \nthey are having a great benefit in terms of the profits they are going \nto make.\n  So we have a lot in front of us. What is $350 billion in annual \nwaste? What does that mean? Here is what it means. It means $3,000 for \nevery family. That is what we are wasting. Three thousand dollars for \nevery family in this country we are blowing, that we are throwing away \nbecause we care more about partisanship than we do the future. We care \nmore about making the executive branch look bad than we do the future. \nWe care more about our earmarks than we do the future.\n  There is a legitimate role for the Federal Government to have the \nSenate and the House direct spending. That is not the dispute. But the \nway you do it best is through oversight, not through earmarking. The \nway you do it best is to know exactly what is happening rather than \nearmarking it. The gateway drug to overspending since 1998 has been \nearmarks because when you earmark, you don't vote against bills. What \nhappens is, the next time you earmark, the committee chairman comes up \nto you and says: You didn't vote for my bill last time. Sorry, I can't \nfill a thing. So we have this almost extortion-like process whereas \nearmarks are granted to you if you vote for a bill. You are not even \nlooking at the total bill, you are looking at the earmarks.\n  Do our children deserve better? Are they worth our sacrifice? Is it \nreally worth it for us to not necessarily get what we want if we can \nsecure the future? I am having trouble knowing whether this body really \nbelieves that. We have outlined to appropriations committees, everybody \nhas been sent a report of everything we have found in the last 3 years, \nand it has been essentially ignored because we are too interested in \nmaking sure we beat the path to looking good at home.\n  When you take an oath to be a U.S. Senator--and I don't think this is \nsaid often enough--there is nothing in that oath that says anything \nabout your State. I am not here to represent the vital interests of \nOklahoma. I was elected by Oklahomans to represent the vital interests \nof this country. And when I get confused about where my loyalties lie, \nour country suffers, and that is exactly what is happening to us right \nnow.\n  We have gone from 600 earmarks in 1998 to a high of 14,870, almost \n12,000 last year. What is going on? Where is the common sense? People \nfrom Vermont to Oklahoma to California to New Mexico to Montana, they \nknow better. So the special interests of the few are being advantaged \nwhile we sacrifice those that come after us. Now, that is a firm \nindictment. But you can't continue to waste $360 billion a year, ignore \noversight, not do anything about it, and then puff up and say--\nRepublican and Democrat--I am going to pass a budget and I am never \ngoing to look at any of that.\n  Well, that is exactly what my party has done. That is exactly what \nthe party in charge today is doing. We are ignoring the very real fact \nthat this Government needs hands-on management, it needs aggressive \noversight, and it needs this $360 billion worth of waste eliminated in \nthis budget. And if we pass this budget or any other budget--whether my \nparty offered one or not, even the President's budget--if we pass any \nbudget that doesn't take this into account, what we are doing is \nspitting all over the hopes and dreams of the youngest Americans in our \ncountry. We are saying: You don't count. We got ours, you will have to \nworry about getting yours. We will take, you will have to give. And, \noh, by the way, we are sorry there is not going to be enough resources \nleft for you to have a college education or to own a home or for us to \ndefend ourselves or for you to have health care like many of us are \ngoing to have as we wander off at 65, knowing that you are going to be \nworking hard through increased payroll taxes just to pay for the \npromises that we couldn't make efficient and that we overpromised.\n  So, Mr. President, I know I have carried on some tonight, but I think \nour problems are much more severe than what our behavior would deem. I \nthink the degree of difficulty we find ourselves in today is directly \nattributable to our lack of courage.\n  We are more interested in not offending somebody than we are securing \nour kids' and grandkids' future. That is not something I want to be \naccused of. So I will take the ridicule of this body for being ``Doctor \nNo,'' for saying: We are not going to spend more money on new things, \nwe are not going to have more programs until we can pay for the \nprograms we have.\n  And if it takes one person saying: I am not going to agree to pass \nbills under unanimous consent, I am not going to agree to not have the \nopportunity to amend them, then so be it.\n  The $3,000 per family per year is enough to make a difference, a big \ndifference, in their future. I think Brooke's and Natalie's babies are \nworth it. I do not know about you all. I am ready to give up something. \nMost of all, I am willing to give up my seat in the Senate for doing \nwhat I think is right in the long term for our country.\n  If I do what is politically expedient and win reelection, what good \nis it if I have not fixed the very real problems that are facing our \ncountry? It is time for a gut check in this country. It is time for the \nAmerican people to look at you, us, and say: Are you really doing for \nus, or are you really doing for you? My accusation is too often we do \nfor us and not for the generations to come.\n  I will be back to outline in detail where this $360 million--billion; \nlet me make sure everyone understands--$360 billion worth of waste, \nfraud, and abuse occurs every year in our budget, and we have done \nnothing. Let me say it again: We have done nothing about it.\n  How dare we talk about raising taxes. How dare we talk about anything \nexcept doing the business that should be at hand, which is being good \nstewards of our children's future.\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 2736, Section \n202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2008 introduced with my \ncolleague Senator Charles Schumer. The HUD section 202 Supportive \nHousing for the Elderly Program is the only program that provides \ncapital grants to nonprofit community organizations for the development \nof supportive housing and rental assistance exclusively for low-income \nseniors. This program provides supportive services coupled with housing \nto allow seniors to remain safely in their homes and age in place. \nAccess to supportive services reduces the occurrence of costly nursing \nhome stays and helps save both seniors and the Federal Government \nmoney.\n  There are over 300,000 seniors living in 6,000 section 202 \ndevelopments across the country. Unfortunately, the program is far from \nmeeting the growing demand. Approximately 730,000 additional senior \nhousing units will be needed by 2020 to address the future housing \nneeds of low-income seniors. Currently, there are 10 seniors vying for \neach unit that becomes available. This leaves many seniors waiting \nyears before finding a home. To complicate matters, we are losing older \nsection 202 properties in exchange for high priced condominiums and \napartments. As a result, many seniors currently participating in the \nprogram could end up homeless.\n  Congress should act now to plan appropriately for the increased \ndemand that will exist for housing in the coming years and ensure that \nseniors can find safe, affordable housing. Accordingly, I am pleased to \njoin Senator Schumer in introducing the section 202 Supportive Housing \nfor the Elderly Act of 2008. Our legislation would help promote the \nconstruction of new senior housing facilities as well as preserve and \nimprove upon existing facilities. The legislation would also support \nthe conversion of existing facilities into assisted living facilities \nthat provide a wide variety of additional supportive health and social \nservices. Under current law, these processes are time consuming, \nbureaucratic, and far too often require waivers and special permission \nfrom HUD to complete. This legislation also provides priority \nconsideration for our homeless seniors seeking a place to call their \nown. With this legislation, we hope to reduce current impediments and \nincrease the availability of affordable and supportive housing for our \nnations most vulnerable seniors.\n  I want to thank the American Association of Homes and Services for \nthe Aging as well as the Wisconsin Association of Homes and Services \nfor the Aging for being champions of this legislation and for working \nwith us to develop a comprehensive bill that will help meet the growing \nneed for senior housing in this Nation.\n  Senior citizens deserve to have housing that will help them maintain \ntheir independence. They do not deserve to end up homeless with no \nwhere to turn because they are stuck on long waiting lists. This Nation \nmust do a better job at helping Americans have a place to call home \nduring their golden years. I hope my colleagues will join me in my \neffort to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1814-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on February 28, 2008 we ratified the Andean \nTrade Preference Act, ATPA. Historically, these preferences have been \ndecisive in encouraging both development and liberalization in a key \nregion. Renewing them is an important step in our relations with the \nregion, but we should also be realistic, and sophisticated, in our \nexpectations for what these preferences can accomplish. As we look at \nwhere each of the four Andean nations stands today, we see that they \nare at very different stages of development, politically and \neconomically, so the preferences will impact each country differently.\n  Peru has made commendable strides in its economic liberalization \nprocess while remaining a trustworthy counterpart on many nontrade \nmatters. Earlier this year we cemented our relationship through \nratification of a Free Trade Agreement, FTA. As we go through the FTA \nimplementation process, preferences are still necessary to minimize \ndisruption to current commercial flows between the United States and \nPeru.\n  Colombia has made outstanding progress politically and economically. \nDuring the past 6 years, Colombia's economic growth, one of the fastest \nin Latin America, has helped usher in a new era of unprecedented \nstability for that country--kidnappings, once rampant, have dropped \nsharply, down nearly 90 percent since 1999; and the once sky-high \nmurder rate has plummeted to its lowest in almost 20 years. The FTA \nsigned between our two countries includes environmental standards as \nwell as worker protections and safeguards similar to the trade pact \nwith Peru, which enjoyed bipartisan support.\n  Colombia's own private sector unions have endorsed the agreement. An \nextension on the Andean Trade Preference Act is crucial given that the \nColombia FTA has not been ratified by the Congress, and would help \nleverage our considerable aid commitment, ensuring Colombia remains on \nits path to becoming a secure and prosperous nation.\n  Our trade preferences for Bolivia and Ecuador are important because \nboth countries have elected leaders whose record and rhetoric cast \nserious doubt on their commitment to market-based economic policies. \nFor this reason, it is important for the United States to maintain a \nstrong relationship with the constructive forces in these countries. We \nwant to encourage those who are working for economic liberalization and \nreforms that promote foreign investment and the creation of jobs. We \nwant to support those who are pursuing policies that will improve \nsocial and economic development in health and education and advance the \nwelfare for the less fortunate. It is in these countries where the \neffect of greater, and not lesser, engagement will yield the highest \nlong term benefits.\n  The ability to benefit from trade preferences is difficult in an \nenvironment in which the rule of law is coming under severe attack. \nBoth countries are facing challenges on this front, with weakened \njustice systems that struggle to uphold the law. In this regard, an \nenvironment that supports free economic exchange and accountable \ngovernance is weakened by the inability of these governments to \nimplement the law.\n  Both Bolivia and Ecuador have much to gain by focusing on \nstrengthening and depoliticizing the rule of law. Without an \nimprovement on the legal front in these countries, the potential for \nthese trade preferences to serve as development tools is limited.\n  It is my hope that 10 months from now, when we again address the \nissue of preferences for the Andean countries, we will be well into the \nimplementation of FTAs with Peru and Colombia and at the same time \nwitnessing an improved commitment in Ecuador and Bolivia to the reforms \nthat are essential to getting the most out of trade preference \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1814-4", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1814-S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On the night of February 22, 2008, 17-year-old Simmie Lewis Williams, \nJr., was gunned down in his hometown of Fort Lauderdale, FL. The \nshooting occurred on a stretch of road known by police to be frequented \nby transvestites. Simmie, openly gay, had been dressed as a woman the \nnight of his murder. He was known for being soft-spoken and kind. \nWitnesses say that Simmie became engaged in a heated argument with two \nmen dressed in dark clothing before the shots were fired. Simmie's \nmother buried her son a week later. The funeral was, in part, paid for \nby members of the local gay community. Police are considering the \nmurder as a bias-motivated crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1815-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       CONGRATULATING JOSHUA KORS\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, our outlook on life and the effect \nwe have on others is largely dependent upon how we respond to our life \nexperiences. We can choose to make a difference in our world, or sit \nback and let others blaze trails. As I get older, I am more and more \nconvinced that these choices have little to do with our physical \ncapabilities or the circumstances of our upbringing. I meet people who \nhave overcome seemingly monumental challenges and live to make a \ndifference in the lives of others. In the same manner, I meet those \nwith observably few challenges who are content to sit on the sidelines. \nA most remarkable example of someone who has responded to the \ncircumstances and events in his life by choosing to make a difference \nin the lives of others is Idahoan Kelly Buckland, president of the \nNational Council for Independent Living and an extraordinary advocate \nfor people with disabilities.\n  Kelly grew up on a farm outside of Rexburg, ID. When he was 15, he \nbecame a quadriplegic as a result of a diving accident. Kelly has \nrecalled that, upon returning home after a year of hospitalization, he \nbecame deeply depressed. But with the encouragement of his parents who, \namong other things, rigged up farm equipment so that Kelly could \ncontinue doing what he had done before the accident, Kelly began to \nrecover from his depression. Recalling the people that helped him and \nothers during his hospitalization, Kelly made a choice that would \nchange his life and the lives of many others over the years: he chose \nto use his many gifts and talents to help those in need.\n  Kelly obtained a bachelor's degree in social work from Boise State \nUniversity. He graduated summa cum laude with a master's degree in \nrehabilitation counseling from Drake University. He was exposed to the \nlegislative process early in his career and realized that he had an \ninterest and a gift for public policy. In the 1980s, Kelly was \ninstrumental in the initial effort to install curb cuts in the city \nsidewalks in Burley, ID, to help with wheelchair accessibility. Kelly's \nadvocacy then turned to the State, where he was able to help change \nIdaho State law to provide protections for parents with disabilities. \nIdaho State law now prohibits the removal of a child from a home or the \ndenial of visitations solely because of a parent's disability. Idaho \nwas the first State in the Nation to pass equal child custody rights \nfor parents with disabilities in all areas of child custody.\n  As the executive director of the Idaho State Independent Living \nCouncil, Kelly made it his priority to fight for equal rights and equal \nprotection under the law for those with disabilities, especially in \nareas of fair housing and healthcare. His outreach and advocacy has \ngone beyond just the State level as well--Kelly has testified before \nCongress on issues facing individuals with disabilities in his capacity \nas president of the National Independent Living Council.\n  Kelly has received several local and national awards. In 2000, he \nreceived the University of Idaho's President's Medallion. Kelly was \nhonored with the 2005 Hewlett-Packard Company Award for Distinguished \nLeadership in Human Rights and, in 2007, Kelly was honored at the \nKennedy Center with induction into the Spinal Cord Injury Hall of Fame \nfor significant contributions to quality of life and advancements \ntoward a better future for all individuals with spinal cord injury or \ndisease.\n  One of Kelly's profound strengths is unique ability to perceive and \nappreciate the position of others, and to help others understand his \npoint of view in a respectful, honest manner. He is highly skilled at \nhelping those who may perceive themselves in opposition to one another \nreach a place where they can meet and find a common middle ground. \nDespite his many accomplishments, Kelly is exceedingly humble, \npreferring to give credit to others for many of the successes in which \nhe's been instrumental. He has observed that we all have something we \nperceive as a hindrance to our own success, but it is our \nresponsibility to acknowledge perceived limitations and move forward \nrather than devote time and energy in focusing on what we think our \nparticular limitations prevent us from doing.\n  Kelly has devoted his time and energy to ensuring that those who have \nexperienced legal, occupational and personal difficulties as a result \nof their disabilities have a voice in changing our laws to ensure true \nindependence for all. His own words echo his convictions: ``I want to \ninsure that no one need be institutionalized because there are \ninadequate community services. I want freedom to be a reality for \neveryone.''\n  Kelly Buckland is a voice of compassion, inspiration and reason and \nit is my distinct honor to recognize him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1815-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1815-S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING VICTORIA WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. KOHL.

Instead, she dedicated herself to work on behalf of others in \nher community. As a job coach for people with disabilities, Ms. \nWilliams is doing her ``dream job,'' and helping those with whom she \nworks achieve their own dreams.

Mr. President, I recently visited Birch Run High \nSchool in Michigan to learn about its biodiesel project. This project \nis an innovative, forward-thinking endeavor, and I am proud that young \npeople in Michigan are making strides to understand and begin to solve \nsome of our Nation's most pressing concerns.\n  The biodiesel project was initiated in the second semester of the \n2007-2008 school year at Birch Run by Mrs. Jan Pollard, a chemistry \nteacher at the school. Mrs. Pollard was instrumental in helping the \nschool secure the funding necessary to establish this project by \napproaching officials associated with the Watershed Initiative \nNetwork--WIN--grant program. She wrote and submitted a proposal for \n$10,000 to WIN, which was ultimately approved.\n  The biodiesel project is a part of a comprehensive effort that \nincludes a greenhouse and a bee keeping component. The students \ncurrently working on the biodiesel project include Ross Fredenburg, the \nteam leader; Derek Bentley; Ryan Johnson; and Dillon Fredenburg, the \napprentice leader for the 2008-2009 school year. These students have \ncompleted all the construction work, installed the necessary equipment, \nand run the project, including all manufacturing and testing of the \nbiodiesel fuel. They obtain, at no cost, used vegetable oil from the \nschool and from local restaurants to convert to biodiesel fuel. The \nproject has produced approximately 200 gallons of biodiesel fuel thus \nfar. By next year, the school expects to be able to provide biodiesel \nfuel for its entire 26-bus fleet.\n  This exciting project has the support of many in the community, \nincluding Birch Run School Superintendent Wayne Wright, Birch Run \nPrincipal Mike Baszler and members of the Birch Run School Board. Mrs. \nPollard and her students have tirelessly worked on the many aspects of \nthis project. And, most importantly, these students have been provided \nan excellent opportunity to pursue practical and timely solutions that \nwill benefit the school, the environment, and their community.\n  Indeed, these young people have embarked on an important endeavor. As \na Nation, we must increase the diversity of our energy sources and \nenhance our Nation's energy independence. Biodiesel provides a part of \nthe solution to our energy needs. It has the potential to improve our \nNation's energy independence in the near term by replacing some of the \noil we import from abroad with homegrown, sustainable biofuels. \nUtilizing this fuel source could reduce our impact on the environment \nand slow changes to our climate that will otherwise threaten our \nfuture. With this new technology, we could dramatically reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions and help create jobs as well as spur our economy.\n  I know my colleagues will share my enthusiasm in recognizing everyone \naffiliated with the biodiesel project at Birch Run High School. I look \nforward to hearing about their many successes in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1816-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LOCATING BOB LEVINSON\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, 1 year ago yesterday, a \nman who had spent more than 28 years serving the United States of \nAmerica, a dedicated husband and father and constituent of mine, \ndisappeared from Kish Island, in the Persian Gulf. I rise today to \nremind this body of the plight of this missing person and the suffering \nof his family.\n  On March 8, 2007, Bob Levinson, a retired veteran of both the FBI and \nDEA, arrived in Kish--an Iranian resort island that does not require a \nvisa to visit. From what we know, he checked into his hotel, checked \nout on March 9th, got into a taxi, and then vanished.\n  I have worked closely with the State Department and the Swiss \nGovernment to lodge a number of requests for information with the \nIranian Government. Unfortunately, Iran claims it has no information on \nthe welfare or whereabouts of Mr. Levinson.\n  Last December, Bob's wife Christine traveled to Iran and visited Kish \non a factfinding mission. Although she did not find any proof of his \nwhereabouts, she came away with the strong belief that Bob is alive.\n  Mr. President, I have worked closely with the administration to try \nto ascertain what exactly happened to Mr. Levinson. Today, just one day \nafter the anniversary of his disappearance, I ask my colleagues to \nremember this American citizen, whose whereabouts are still unknown, \nand to urge the U.S. Government to do everything in its power to locate \nand bring him home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1816-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:29 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled joint resolution:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to grant \njurisdiction to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \nto review compliance of the schedule of ratings for disabilities under \nsection 1151 of that title with statutory requirements applicable to \nentitlement to disability compensation under chapter 11 of that title, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the proposed Veterans' \nRating Schedule Review Act. This legislation would remove a barrier to \nlegal redress faced by veterans who believe that a provision of the VA \nSchedule for Rating Disabilities--the Rating Schedule--does not comply \nwith a law passed by Congress. The amount of compensation veterans with \nservice-connected conditions receive is based on a disability rating, \nwhich VA assigns to these conditions. VA uses its rating schedule to \ndetermine which rating to assign to a veteran's particular condition. \nUnder current law, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has \njurisdiction to consider only Constitutional challenges to the rating \nschedule. When legislation was passed providing for judicial review, \nreview of the rating schedule was specifically prohibited as part of a \nfinal compromise.\n  This legislation would expand the jurisdiction of the court to \ninclude cases where a provision of the rating schedule or the absence \nof a rating for a condition mandated by statute is challenged. Under \nthe proposed change, aspects of the VA rating schedule that appear to \nviolate requirements of law set forth in chapter 11 of title 38, United \nStates Code, would be subject to the court's jurisdiction.\n  I expect VA to comply with all laws passed by Congress in developing \nand revising the rating schedule. However, justice to our Nation's \nveterans requires a forum in which the rating\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\nschedule can be challenged when someone believes that a statute passed \nby Congress to provide compensation for the service-disabled is being \nviolated.\n  Veterans seeking to challenge the denial of benefits based on the \nrating schedule's lack of consistency with other laws are subject to \nrejection by the court due to the prohibition in current law. The \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held, in Wanner \nv. Principi, 370 F.3d 1124, 2004, that the language in current law \n``removes from the Veterans Court's jurisdiction all review involving \nthe content of the rating schedules and the Secretary's actions in \nadopting or revising them.''\n  One example of the kind of case that would be affected by the change \nto the law is VA's lack of action in response to legislation enacted in \n2002 which allows veterans who qualify for compensation due to the loss \nof hearing in both ears to receive special ``paired organ'' benefits. \nIn the years since that law was passed, many veterans serving in Iraq \nhave suffered hearing loss after being exposed to Improvised Explosive \nDevice blasts. However, VA has yet to issue regulations to amend the \nrating schedule, as required by the law. Under the current state of the \nlaw, no one could bring a legal challenge to that failure to act.\n  I note that the exception to the ban on review of the rating schedule \nproposed in this bill is a limited one. The bill would not allow for a \nwholesale assault on the rating schedule. It would merely provide \njudicial review of cases where compliance with a law passed by Congress \nis challenged.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure, so that veterans \nseeking justice may have an appropriate forum to challenge the VA's \ncompliance with governing statutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 477\n\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis can impact men and women of all \n     ages;\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis affects men and women of all \n     races and ethnicities;\n       Whereas approximately 400,000 Americans live with multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       Whereas approximately 2,500,000 people worldwide have been \n     diagnosed with multiple sclerosis;\n       Whereas approximately 200 people a week are diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis;\n       Whereas over 400 cases of childhood multiple sclerosis have \n     been identified in medical journals since 1980 and it is \n     estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and \n     adolescents are affected;\n       Whereas the exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still \n     unknown;\n       Whereas the symptoms of multiple sclerosis are \n     unpredictable and vary from person to person;\n       Whereas there is no laboratory test available for multiple \n     sclerosis;\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis is not genetic, contagious, or \n     directly inherited, but studies show there are genetic \n     factors that indicate certain individuals are susceptible to \n     the disease;\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis symptoms occur when an immune \n     system attack affects the myelin, destroying it and replacing \n     it with scar tissue and severing nerve fibers interfering \n     with the transmission of nerve signals;\n       Whereas in rare cases multiple sclerosis is so progressive \n     it is fatal;\n       Whereas there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis; and\n       Whereas March 2008 is recognized as National Multiple \n     Sclerosis Education and Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Multiple \n     Sclerosis Education and Awareness Month;\n       (2) invites the chief executive officers of the States, \n     territories, and possessions of the United States to issue \n     proclamations designating March 2008 as National Multiple \n     Sclerosis Education and Awareness Month and recognizing the \n     goals and ideals of National Multiple Sclerosis Education and \n     Awareness Month;\n       (3) commends the efforts of the States, territories, and \n     possessions of the United States, localities, non-profit \n     organizations, businesses, and other entities and the people \n     of the United States who support the goals and ideals of \n     National Multiple Sclerosis Education and Awareness Month;\n       (4) recognizes and reaffirms our Nation's commitment to \n     combating multiple sclerosis by promoting awareness about its \n     causes and risks and by promoting new education programs, \n     supporting research, and expanding access to medical \n     treatment; and\n       (5) recognizes all Americans living with multiple \n     sclerosis, expresses gratitude to their family members and \n     friends who are a source of love and encouragement to them, \n     and salutes the health care professionals and medical \n     researchers who provide assistance to those so afflicted and \n     continue to work to find cures and improve treatments.\n\n  Mr. President, I offer today, along with my colleague Senator Snowe, \nthis resolution supporting the goals and ideals National Multiple \nSclerosis Education and Awareness Month. I am pleased to introduce this \nresolution which recognizes and reaffirms our commitment to combating \nmultiple sclerosis by promoting awareness about its causes and risks \nand by promoting new education programs, supporting research and \nexpanding access to medical treatment. It is also my hope that this \nresolution that Senator Snowe and I offer today will help us to more \nconsciously recognize all Americans living with multiple sclerosis. We \nare grateful to their family members and friends who are a source of \nlove and encouragement to them and we salute the health care \nprofessionals and medical researchers who provide assistance to those \nwith MS and who continue to work to find cures and improve treatments.\n  We know a lot about MS but unfortunately there is still a great deal \nwe do not know. We know it can strike males and females of all ages, \nraces and ethnicities. Today, approximately 400,000 Americans live with \nthis disease and about 2.5 million people have been diagnosed \nworldwide. Every week, another 200 people are diagnosed and it is \nestimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents have \nMS.\n  The exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still unknown and its \nsymptoms are unpredictable, varying from person to person. We have no \nlaboratory test that will tell us if someone has multiple sclerosis. \nThis disease is not genetic, contagious, or directly inherited, but \nstudies show there are genetic factors that indicate certain \nindividuals are susceptible to the disease.\n  Multiple sclerosis symptoms occur when an immune system attack \naffects the myelin, destroying it and replacing it with scar tissue and \nsevering nerve fibers, thus interfering with the transmission of nerve \nsignals. There is as yet no known cure for multiple sclerosis. MS can \nbe an especially devastating disease as it is often diagnosed in young \nadults who are just setting out on their own, beginning their personal \nand professional lives. While MS is not a fatal disease, it is a \nnoncurable, sometimes progressive disease that can affect every aspect \nof life.\n  Because MS is an unpredictable disease, it presents those suffering \nfrom it with many uncertainties about the future. For instance, one \nyoung constituent of mine suffering from MS confided that she felt \nlimited in choosing a career, feeling that she needed to find an \noccupation that could accommodate any potential disabilities. In \nconsidering employment offers, she not\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nonly had to consider the merits of the job itself, but also had to \nfactor in finding employment with someone who provided adequate \ninsurance coverage and leave policies, and was also willing to \naccommodate situations like the need for flexible work schedules and \nadaptive equipment.\n  MS can also complicate decisions about personal relationships, \nmarriage, and child bearing. Since MS affects twice as many women as \nmen, young women with MS often struggle with the decision of whether or \nnot to have children who could potentially inherit the disease. In \nmaking such decisions, they also have to consider options for caring \nfor those children in the event that MS leaves them impaired or \ndisabled.\n  Because many of the symptoms of MS--like fatigue, pain, vision \nproblems, and numbness of extremities--are ``invisible'' to others, \npeople often don't realize the extent to which the disease affects \nthose who suffer from it.\n  For those suffering from MS, some of the most important steps they \ncan take are to seek prompt treatment with a physician qualified to \naddress MS, consider beginning therapy with one of the FDA approved \ndisease modifying drugs, and develop a supportive network of family and \nfriends.\n  The most important thing that we in Congress can do for those who \nhave MS is recognize the scope of this illness, which we are doing \nthrough this resolution, and resolve to find ways to improve treatments \nfor those suffering from this devastating disease, and ultimately, \nresolve to help find a cure. With this resolution, I also invite the \nchief executive officers of the States, territories and possessions of \nthe U.S. to issue proclamations designating National Multiple Sclerosis \nEducation and Awareness Month.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 478--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF ``WORLD WATER \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 478\n\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly, via \n     resolution, has designated March 22 of each year as World \n     Water Day;\n       Whereas a person needs 4 to 5 liters of water per day to \n     survive;\n       Whereas a person can live weeks without food, but only days \n     without water;\n       Whereas every 15 seconds a child dies from a water-borne \n     disease;\n       Whereas, for children under age 5, water-borne diseases are \n     the leading cause of death;\n       Whereas millions of women and children spend several hours \n     a day collecting water from distant, often polluted sources;\n       Whereas every dollar spent on water and sanitation saves on \n     average $9 in costs averted and productivity gained;\n       Whereas, at any given time, \\1/2\\ of the world's hospital \n     beds are occupied by patients suffering from a water-borne \n     disease;\n       Whereas 88 percent of all diseases are caused by unsafe \n     drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene;\n       Whereas 1,100,000,000 (1 in 6) people lack access to an \n     improved water supply;\n       Whereas 2,600,000,000 people in the world lack access to \n     improved sanitation;\n       Whereas the global celebration of World Water Day is an \n     initiative that grew out of the 1992 United Nations \n     Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro;\n       Whereas the participants in the 2002 World Summit on \n     Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, including the United \n     States, agreed to the Plan of Implementation which included \n     an agreement to work to reduce by \\1/2\\ from the baseline \n     year 1990 ``the proportion of people who are unable to reach \n     or to afford safe drinking water'', ``and the proportion of \n     people without access to basic sanitation'' by 2015; and\n       Whereas Congress passed and the President signed into law \n     the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (Public \n     Law 109-121), which was intended to ``elevate the role of \n     water and sanitation policy in the development of U.S. \n     foreign policy and improve the effectiveness of U.S. official \n     programs'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of ideals of ``World Water Day'';\n       (2) urges an increased effort and the investment of greater \n     resources by the Department of State, the United States \n     Agency for International Development, and all relevant \n     Federal departments and agencies toward providing sustainable \n     and equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation \n     for the poor and the very poor; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate activities that promote awareness \n     of the importance of access to clean water.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nsupporting the ideals and goals of World Water Day. I am pleased to \nhave my colleague Senator John Kerry joining me in this cause by \nserving as the co-sponsor of this resolution.\n  March 22 was established as World Water Day by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly to promote awareness of the importance of access to \nclean water and improved sanitation. Over 1 billion people lack access \nto an improved water supply and 2.6 billion people lack access to \nimproved sanitation.\n  Activities are planned internationally to further the goals and \nideals of World Water Day. In many cities across the United States, \nUNICEF is sponsoring the Tap Project. Restaurants will offer patrons \nthe opportunity to add at least $1 to their checks during the week of \nMarch 16. Each dollar donated will result in a child receiving clean \nwater for 40 days. Thee are currently 16 featured cities, including \nPortland, OR, and Boston MA.\n  In 2000, the United Nations member States adopted eight millennium \ndevelopment goals as a basis for working cooperatively. To ensure \nenvironmental stability, one of the goals established is to reduce by \nhalf the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe \ndrinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. While some progress has \nbeen made, much more remains to be done. The United Nation's 2007 \nMillennium Development Goals Report reveals that we are on pace to miss \nthe 2015 target for access to basic sanitation by over 600 million.\n  Each day millions of women and girls spend hours traveling miles to \ntransport water to their homes. In many cases, the source is polluted. \nAt any given time, half of the world's hospital beds are occupied by \npatients suffering from waterborne diseases. These diseases are the \nleading cause of death for children under 5.\n  The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 set a goal of \nproviding equal and affordable access to clean and safe water and \nsanitation in developing countries. This access has long been \nrecognized by the U.S. as a contributing factor to our foreign policy \ninterests. More importantly, access to clean and safe water is basic \nhuman right.\n  We urge our colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/10/senate-section/article/S1821-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4147.
