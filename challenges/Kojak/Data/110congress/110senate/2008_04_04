ELECTION TO ACCELERATE AMT AND R AND D CREDITS IN \n                   LIEU OF BONUS DEPRECIATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 168(k), as amended by this Act, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Election to accelerate amt and r and d credits in \n     lieu of bonus depreciation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--If a corporation which is an eligible

December 31, \n     2007, in taxable years ending after such date.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the chairman of the Finance Committee \nhas voiced concern about the original revenue loss associated with our \namendment, which is bipartisan, with several members of the Finance \nCommittee as sponsors. Senator Stabenow and I have worked very hard \nwith Finance Committee staff and the Joint Committee on Taxation to \nbring the revenue estimate down. We managed to cut it by two-thirds to \nabout $1.3 billion over 10 years. I am pleased Senator Baucus finds it \nacceptable and now supports my amendment.\n  I would now like to turn the floor over to Senator Stabenow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, let me say, part of this recovery is to \nsupport those businesses currently not making a profit but that want to \ncontinue to invest in America and American jobs. That is the piece we \naddress in this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and his staff and Senator Grassley for working \nvery closely with us to get this to a point where it is supported by \nthem.\n  Thank you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, under the rules, technically someone on \nthe minority side would manage the time, theoretically, in opposition \nto this amendment. I do not see anyone here. Not to be too formal about \nthis, I will speak anyway.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio, as well as the Senator from Michigan, \nfor working out this amendment. Very basically, they have a very good \npoint; namely, that many businesses, particularly in some parts of the \ncountry, are not able to take full advantage of bonus depreciation or \nso-called 179 expensing. That is because these are companies that have \nno profits. They do not have the ability to take advantage of these \ndepreciation write-downs.\n  So they have come up with an amendment to address that problem. The \nfirst version was a bit expensive. We have worked very closely together \nwith the Senators, as well as with the Joint Committee on Tax, to find \nthe proper amount that makes some sense, and it has been tailored down \nto about $1.3 billion. That is the modification which was sent to the \ndesk by the Senator from Ohio. I think that is a proper amount. I think \nit is very helpful and ought to help these companies in these very \nstressed parts of our country that very much need the benefit of this \nprovision. So I accept the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nthose words of support.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

emergency needs \n     pursuant to section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Mississippi \nwishes to speak on our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nyielding me an opportunity to speak. This is an example of how those in \nGovernment can work together to help citizens who have been \ndisadvantaged by a storm, where Members can work together in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  The Senator from Louisiana will be able to explain briefly the base \namendment she offered. I simply want to thank her for agreeing to \nincorporate two very important amendments into hers. One is with regard \nto the bonus depreciation piece of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act, known \nin shorthand as the GO-Zone. Because of bureaucratic delays, and \nbecause of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina, people who wish to take \nthe opportunity of the GO-Zone bonus depreciation have not been able to \ncommence construction. The Wicker-Cochran amendment, which the Senator \nhas agreed to incorporate into her amendment, would move the \ncommencement date of GO-Zone construction.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has also graciously agreed to add a \nBrownback-Roberts amendment that will help the small town of \nGreensburg, KS, which was completely devastated in a storm recently. I \nurge all Senators to vote in favor of this simple change in the date on \nbonus depreciation.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that this \namendment violates section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, pursuant to section 204 of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 21, I move to waive that section of the \nconcurrent resolution for the purpose of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN: I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from New York \n(Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), the Senator \nfrom North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), \nthe Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), the Senator from West Virginia \n(Mr. Rockefeller), and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: The Senator \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Allard), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the \nSenator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the Senator from Texas (Mr. \nCornyn), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``yea.'' The Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) would \nhave voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 74, nays 5, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 92 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--74\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--5\n\n     Barrasso\n     Corker\n     DeMint\n     Gregg\n     Kyl\n\n                             NOT VOTING--21\n\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Rockefeller\n     Specter\n     Tester\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 74, the nays are 5. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to and the point of order is moot.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4389), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Dodd is going to be here, as will \nSenator Baucus, for offering of amendments. It is my understanding \nthere are a number of tax related amendments that will be offered. \nSenator Ensign, Senator Bill Nelson, and Senator Snowe have amendments.\n  For the benefit of Members, I wish to lay out generally what the plan \nis for next week. We will have no votes on Monday. That has been long \nscheduled. The Republican leader and I will work out what is going to \nhappen on Tuesday. There are a couple alternatives. I discussed it \nbriefly this morning.\n  I have a cloture motion waiting to file. Whether we do that or not, I \nwill consult with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nKentucky. What we might try to work out is having a finite list of \namendments and have a time certain to complete work on this bill on \nTuesday sometime.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield for \nan observation, I agree it would be appropriate filing a cloture \nmotion. We can vitiate it later if we get there without that. I think \nit would help us get to the end of the trail, a point at which both of \nus would like to finish up, which will hopefully be Tuesday or \nWednesday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend's advice and will \nfollow it.\n  I will also say this about next week. We can work Tuesday, and we can \nwork Wednesday. Thursday the Pope will be in Washington, DC, and will \nsay a mass. It is my understanding that mass will begin at 10 a.m. \nThere will be a lot of traffic problems. There are a huge number of \npeople expected to be at that mass, so we will have a window so Members \nand staff who wish to attend the mass will be able to do so. It will \nnot be for all day, but I assume we will all work with those who know \nthe\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\nschedule better. We will have a window on Thursday, but we will have to \nwork into Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening on other issues.\n  On Friday, there is a long-scheduled Senate Democratic retreat in \nRichmond, VA.\n  That is the general view of next week.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe the mass is the Thursday after.\n  Mr. REID. It is not next week?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. We are trying to make life easy. The Pope would like \nto make life easier for the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I had a couple of my Catholic friends come to me today and \nsay: We have to have some time off. That is a week from Thursday. That \nis like an eternity in the Senate. Everybody is going to have to work \nall day Thursday, I hate to break the bad news to you. I guess I have \nsaid enough.\n  We will work with everyone's schedule so it is compatible with the \nPope's a week from Thursday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a number of Senators wish to speak and \noffer amendments. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ensign be \nrecognized for 5 minutes and then I be allowed to follow him; following \nhim, Senator Nelson of Florida recognized for 5 minutes and I be \nallowed to follow him. We will lock those two in at this point. There \nmay be others throughout the day.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Reserving the right to object, I would like to be added \nas a cosponsor with Senator Nelson on his amendment. I ask that I be \nrecognized for 5 minutes after Senator Nelson.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is on the Bill Nelson of Florida amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I would like to ask the \nSenator from Montana if I could be recognized following the Senator \nfrom Nevada to offer an amendment to his amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, could I be added after \nthe Senator from Tennessee?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. To clarify, the Senator from Tennessee objects to the \nwind power part, and he wants to offer a second-degree amendment. He \nwants to make sure he is in order for a second-degree amendment to our \namendment is all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, may I follow after that \ndebate is completed?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. A better procedure is not to line up second degrees \nbecause nobody's second-degree rights are ever denied anyway on any \namendment. That is automatic. For example, when Senator Ensign's \namendment is offered, if somebody wants to offer a second-degree \namendment, that is certainly in order. The unanimous consent request \nwould not preclude someone from offering a second-degree amendment. The \nSenator always has that right.\n\n  I don't want to get in the position of getting UCs for one second-\ndegree amendment or another at this point, especially when, I say to my \ngood friend from Tennessee, it is not necessary in any way. He will be \nfully protected when the amendment of the Senator from Nevada is up. He \nis protected to offer a second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. I wish to make sure I am fully \nprotected and another Senator does not get ahead of me in terms of a \nsecond-degree amendment. Is that the assurance I am receiving from the \nSenator?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is absolutely this Senator's understanding, and I \nwill protect that Senator's right as best I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request pending.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, may I inquire of whoever \nwill be managing the next amendment how long they will go forward with \nthe discussion on this amendment? I would like to be added to the list \nafter it is all over for 5 minutes to present a wholly different \namendment. It does not have anything to do with this issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, so the Senator from Louisiana does not \nhave an amendment?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I do have an amendment that I would like to offer on a \ncompletely different subject and sometime today.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Not to the housing bill?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. To the housing bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Later on today.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Later on today.\n  Mr. DODD. I am going to be here all afternoon. So anyone who wants to \noffer amendments, I will be here to consider any amendments and debate \nanytime they want. We are not going anywhere. We have no more votes. We \ncertainly are offering amendments.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am trying to get a timeframe as to when I might be \nable to do that so I can plan my day.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As far as this Senator is concerned, it is fine if this \nSenator is added.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. To add a clarification, we were only going to talk for 5 \nminutes, 5 minutes, and the next people 5 minutes, 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So I will be in line to offer an amendment at 10:30 \na.m.?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the offering of the three amendments, the Senator from \nLouisiana be recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, may I say to the \nSenator from Montana, I would like to follow the Senator from Nevada \nfor 5 minutes for the purpose of offering a second-degree amendment, if \nhe can show me that courtesy.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as far as I am concerned, that is \nperfectly OK with me.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the initial request of \nthe Senator from Montana? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4419 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     provide for the limited continuation of clean energy \n     production incentives and incentives to improve energy \n     efficiency in order to prevent a downturn in these sectors \n     that would result from a lapse in the tax law.)\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside and I be allowed to call up amendment No. 4419.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mr. \n     Thune, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 4419 \n     to amendment No. 4387.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCantwell and Thune be added as cosponsors to the amendment. I am sure \nthere will be others who will want to be added as cosponsors to this \namendment. Since Senator Cantwell and I introduced the freestanding \nbill yesterday, we already have 28 of our colleagues who have become \ncosponsors. Additionally, we expect many more of our colleagues will be \nadded as cosponsors to the bill and will also want to be added as \ncosponsors to this amendment.\n  Briefly, I wish to share my time with the Senator from Washington, \nwho has shown great leadership on this issue. The amendment we are \nproposing deals with renewables. We know this country has an energy \nproblem. We are too dependent on foreign sources of energy. Too much of \nour energy byproducts are polluting the environment, and there are \nconcerns about climate change around the world. And this amendment \naddresses both of those concerns, as well as being a stimulant to the \neconomy. There are over 100,000 jobs that we protected with this \namendment. We are talking about solar power, geothermal, wind energy \nand biomass.\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\nThere are many different renewables that are going to help within this \namendment. Additionally, at a time when our country is at war in places \nwhere we are spending over $100 per barrel of oil, we are spending \nhundreds of billions of dollars from our economy to support people who \nare not necessarily friendly to the United States. It is very important \nthat we as a Senate, act now on this amendment in order to help the \nUnited States become less dependent on foreign sources of energy as \nwell as clean up our environment. It is a national security concern, it \nis an economic concern, and it is an environmental concern.\n\n  I am very pleased to introduce this amendment today so we can vote on \nit next week. I think it is very critical that this be part of the \npackage, and that is why it needs to be done as soon as possible. Some \nmay ask why there is such an urgency. Well, because a lot of this type \nof energy production takes a long time to develop. We do not have a lot \nof time to set the financing of these projects. We have been told by a \nlot of industries that if there isn't stability, a lot of these \nindustries are going to go away. We need to be encouraging renewable \nenergy development.\n  Mr. President, I yield a couple of minutes to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Washington, who is the lead sponsor of the bill we introduced \nyesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding me some of \nhis time.\n  This has been a big priority on this side of the aisle, to get clean \nenergy tax credits so we can continue to stimulate investment in wind \nand solar and energy efficiency, and a variety of others--fuel cells, \nbiomass, geothermal, and the list goes on and on. This is the fourth \ntime we have tried to get to this legislation. Three other times we \nhave come within one vote, so we are here today with more bipartisan \nsupport for a proposed solution.\n  My colleagues and the chairman of the Finance Committee have worked \nvery hard on this legislation in general, on the concept of trying to \npush forward these tax credits, but we are at a critical point. In \nfact, I have said to my colleagues that Rome is burning; that is, we \nare at the precipice now of projects actually getting canceled. Having \nbeen in business, I know what it is like to have your first quarter \nearnings report and then have to show some forward advancement to your \ninvestors about your projects. That is where we are. And because we \naren't giving certainty in the Tax Code to these investors, they are \ngoing to start canceling projects.\n  So we cannot wait another month, another 2 months to get about this \ntax. If we want to give certainty to the markets to continue to invest \nin alternative energy to take some of the pressure off of the rising \ncost of energy, now is the time to act. So I hope my colleagues will \nthink about the bipartisan nature of the amendment. We have failed \nthree times and have come one vote short to try to help our own \neconomies in our States and in our country by saving this investment \ncycle. Give the predictability so we can keep 100,000 jobs working, so \nwe can get renewable energy produced and invested in during 2008, and \nso we can have the production of CO2-reducing energy supply \nand get that going now.\n  I could say to my colleagues that we are almost at a point where the \nUnited States is so far behind what other countries are doing that we \nare not even going to be able to claim we are leading in this area if \nwe do not get about the task. So if the votes are here, let's start \nvoting to say renewable energy and its ability to stimulate the economy \nis a priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor after one brief \ncomment to once again thank the great leadership of the Senator from \nWashington. I look forward to all of our colleagues joining us on this \nvote in a bipartisan way next week.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4429 to Amendment No. 4419\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4429 to amendment No. 4419.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment not be read further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide a longer extension of the renewable energy \n production tax credit and to encourage all emerging renewable sources \n                of electricity, and for other purposes)\n\n       Beginning on page 2, line 14, strike all through page 6, \n     line 13, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 811.

Mr. President, I believe the amendment I offer on \nbehalf of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and myself would improve \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nWashington.\n  As I listened to them talking, their concern is for emerging \ntechnologies, for businesses that are trying to develop emerging \ntechnologies to have time to plan, and so they offer a 1-year extension \nof the production tax credit, which gives a 1 cent per kilowatt hour \ntax credit to most emerging technologies producing electricity for \ncommercial sales. Some renewable electricity sources receive a larger 2 \ncents per kilowatt hour credit. I would propose, along with Senator \nKyl, that we make it a 2-year extension for emerging technologies.\n  The way we would pay for that so it would not be any more expensive \nthan the proposal they have offered is to do with wind what we have \nalready done with solar: take it off the list of 2-cent-per-kilowatt-\nhour technologies and put it on the 1-cent list. In other words, we \nwould be creating a 2-year extension of the production tax credit for \nrenewable technologies. We would be treating wind the same way we treat \nopen-loop biomass, small irrigation power, landfill gas, trash \ncombustion, qualified hydropower, and wave and tidal facilities. They \nall would receive 1 cent per kilowatt hour.\n  I think it makes much more common sense today, if we want to \nencourage emerging technologies, to treat them the same, especially \nbecause wind has had a preferential treatment since 1992. What has \nhappened, Mr. President, is wind has gobbled up most of the money that \nhas been spent through the production tax credit, and very little has \ngone to any of the other technologies. The taxpayer has spent an \nenormous amount of money to build large wind turbines in this country.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, we are committed to \nspending another $11.5 billion over the next 10 years for wind power \nalone, even though wind power produces less than 1 percent of all of \nour electricity and less than 3 percent of our clean electricity. \nNuclear power produces nearly 70 percent of our clean electricity; that \nis, no nitrogen, no sulfur, no mercury, and no carbon for those \nconcerned about climate change. If we were subsidizing nuclear power at \nthe same rate we subsidize wind power for clean energy, we would be \nspending $300 billion or $400 billion over the next 10 years for \nnuclear power. So wind has been gobbling up the available money for \nrenewable energies, and making it difficult to identify appropriate \noffsets to pay for long-term extensions of this renewable electricity \ntax credit.\n  We have spent an extraordinary amount of money on wind. Wind has \nalready proven that where the wind blows, it works. It is competitive. \nAnd where it does not blow, it is not competitive. In the Southeastern \nUnited States, for example, there is one wind farm. Because of the \ngenerous wind subsidies, this wind farm on the top of a lovely \nmountain, Buffalo Mountain in Tennessee, last August, in the middle of \na drought when we were all sweating and turning up our air \nconditioners, was operating 10 percent of the time. It makes no sense \nto pay big subsidies to people in Chicago to build wind farms in places \nwhere the wind doesn't blow. So what we are suggesting, Senator Kyl and \nI, is to let us take the available money and let us extend for 2 years \nthe production tax credit, and let us let some of it go to open-loop \nbiomass, more to small irrigation power, more to landfill gas and trash \ncombustion, and qualified hydropower and wave and tidal power, and it \nwould also go for wind. It means the wind part of the tax credit would \nbe for 2 years and wind would still receive about $1 billion of the $6 \nbillion or $7 billion that the Ensign-Cantwell amendment would consume.\n  So I ask my friends to seriously consider this not as an unfriendly \namendment to renewable energy but as a friendly amendment. I have met \nwith a lot of people who say we desperately need some certainty in \nbusiness. Well, 2 years is twice as much certainty as 1 year, and there \nis no reason at this stage of development of energy why wind, which is \nwell proven where the wind blows, and which has been subsidized so \nheavily since 1992, should continue to be subsidized at the expense of \ncertainty in our tax policy and at the expense of all of the other \nrenewable energies.\n  So in summary, Mr. President--and I will have more to say about this \nnext week--we believe the Alexander-Kyl amendment would improve the \nEnsign-Cantwell amendment by doubling the time the production tax \ncredit is available to emerging renewable technologies. And the way we \nwould pay for it is to treat wind the same way we treat open-loop \nbiomass, small irrigation power, landfill gas, trash combustion, \nqualified hydropower, and wave and tidal power. They would be treated \nthe same, and they would be given a chance over 2 years to flourish \nrather than 1 year.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to address the underlying \nEnsign amendment. I think most Members of this body believe very \nstrongly we need to be much more self-sufficient in the production of \nenergy. We are way too reliant on OPEC. We have made several attempts \nin this Congress in the last several months to try to pass tax \nincentive provisions to accomplish that objective. They have not been \nsuccessful, for various reasons. Some because they are paid for, and \npeople don't like to pay for this, and others because it was not paid \nfor.\n  For example, last February we passed an energy tax incentive package \nvery similar to the Ensign package, which was not paid for, and that \ndid not survive. So we are in a difficult position. I agree with the \nimpetus of Senator Cantwell and Senator Ensign, but we also know the \nother body is probably not as friendly toward passing this because it \nis not paid for--not as friendly as this body.\n  We hope the President signs this package. I am not terribly sanguine \nthat will happen, but nevertheless let's at least try to see if the \nother body will in fact adopt it. This is a housing bill; it is not an \nenergy bill. We want to get a housing bill passed very quickly, and now \nthat we have an energy provision in it, that is a bit problematic as to \nwhether we are going to get the housing bill passed as it is, \nespecially when the energy provisions are not paid for.\n  The Finance Committee has other options to pass this package. All \nSenators on the committee know what we have been working on. I am \ncommitted to getting these tax incentives passed this year. They are so \nimportant, so vitally important, for reasons everyone has mentioned. \nAnd, in fact, I am even more worried about it than probably some other \nSenators. I am as worried as the Senator from Washington about getting \nthis passed. So I am committed to finding a way. If this approach is \nnot successful, I am committed to finding a way, to finding a \nsuccessful approach so these energy provisions are in fact enacted into \nlaw this year.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I underscore the point the Senator from \nMontana has just made, and I say this in the same spirit in which he \nhas expressed his remarks. This is a housing bill. We have 8,000 people \na day in foreclosure--8,000. Just as we started this debate, 24,000 of \nour fellow citizens have lost their homes--24,000 people lost their \nhomes.\n  Now, I agree energy independence is critically important. But this \nisn't a Christmas tree. There are ways of doing these energy bills in \nother matters. I was under the impression we wanted to get a housing \nbill out that could make a difference in people's lives.\n  Why are we taking up matters that run the risk of tying this up for \nweeks on end in a conference with the House on matters they disagree \nwith, that are not paid for, that may get a Presidential veto, and as a \nresult we watch even more people lose their homes? It is a housing \nbill. It is a housing bill.\n  So with all due respect to the authors of this amendment, I am going \nto oppose every one of them from here on out so we can get this bill \ndone. We have more to do. This is not an all-inclusive bill. A lot more \nneeds to be done. We are, frankly, not doing\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nenough for people in foreclosure, in my view, and I have made that \nspeech for a year now on this matter. We have finally gotten to a point \nwhere we have come together in a bipartisan fashion to deal with \nhousing, and all of a sudden I find myself dealing with every other \nissue in creation because we haven't had bills that have moved along \nfor whatever reason.\n  But we shouldn't make people who are losing their homes, with our \neconomy suffering, pay the price because we haven't dealt with these \nother issues. This is housing. The Senator from Montana is absolutely \ncorrect, and I intend to stand with him. We may lose. I hope we don't \nbecause we run the risk of having this one effort to make a difference \non housing fall apart.\n  With all due respect to the authors of this legislation, and I agree \nwith all of them on the substance, this is not the place and time for \nthis issue. We need to deal with housing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4423 To Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, because this is the Mortgage \nForeclosure Prevention Act, just what the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee has brought up, let's remind ourselves what is the underlying \nbill. The State of this Senator has the second highest number of \nforeclosures in the country.

Mr. President, under current law, you can \ninvade your retirement fund, your 401(k) fund, in order to purchase a \nhome without paying the 10-percent penalty. What this amendment says \nis, if home ownership and keeping people in their homes is an important \nvalue in America, and they are about to have their home taken away \nbecause of this foreclosure crisis, then it seems to me we would want \nto amend the law to allow them to take money out of their retirement \nfund in order to forestall the foreclosure and stay in their homes.\n  That is what this amendment does. It allows someone to withdraw up to \n$25,000 from their retirement fund without paying the 10-percent \npenalty. That has to be used for the purpose of foreclosure prevention \npurposes; that is like paying on the principal or interest payments; \nthat is like a refinancing or a mortgage modification.\n  To make sure people do not abuse this, we are limiting it to a 2-year \nperiod and we are additionally going to say, the money you bring out to \nhelp you so you do not go into foreclosure, if you put that money back \ninto your retirement fund within 3 years, you are not going to have to \npay the income tax on it. So it is a direct, tailored amendment to try \nto help people accomplish what the underlying goal is, which is to \nprevent foreclosures.\n  I am joined by my colleague from Minnesota, who wants to speak on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Florida to \nspeak on behalf of our amendment No. 4423. I start by thanking, first, \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, and ranking member \nSenator Shelby, for bringing us to this point. People are losing their \nhomes. I hear it. We all heard it when we went back over Easter break. \nFor Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby to come together in a bipartisan \nway and give us an opportunity to do what this Senate is going to be \ndoing, I express my deep appreciation; also to Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, the chair and the ranking member, for working with us \non this amendment. It is one of those things that goes to the heart of \nwhat we are trying to do today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Martinez be added \nas a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, during our travels back home to housing \ntownhall forums during the course of this last year, we are all meeting \nmore and more folks who are in very desperate straits, trying to keep \ntheir home. Minnesota ranks No. 2 in the number of subprime mortgages \nin for closure. Minnesota--who would have thought? That is the reality. \nIt is across the country. I was in a forum at St. Cloud, in the central \npart of my State. I met a nurse named Terri Ross, a woman who had two \njobs, bought a house which was in need of repair. She had a pretty good \nmortgage, low interest rate, and wanted actually to quit one job to go \nback to school. She wanted to improve herself, improve her life, add to \nher education. She met with the mortgage broker. He said: Have I got a \ndeal for you. We can get you a mortgage and it will be at a low rate. \nDon't worry about the fact--I am not sure she even knew it was going to \npop up in a few years. Don't worry about it because property values are \nrising and there will be more equity in your house. She put the money \nin the house, did the mortgage. When all was said and done, she found \nherself in the situation where the value of the house was less than the \nvalue of the additions. She had lost one job. She now had one job, her \nincome was in half. She is in big trouble.\n  Here is a woman who worked all her life, put aside some money for \nretirement. What she did is she tapped into that and then she paid a \npenalty on it, trying to save her home. That was what she had. The \nproblem is, across the Nation, people are now looking to use their \nretirement savings to save their homes and they get hit hard with a 10-\npercent early withdrawal penalty.\n  There was an article in USA Today. They ran a piece entitled \n``401(K)s Tapped to Save Homes.'' The article focuses on this problem. \nAmericans are being slammed with taxes and penalties as they try to \nkeep their homes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks this \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COLEMAN. These are the stories my friend from Florida and I have \nbeen exchanging. We have personal accounts that do stretch from the \nGulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. These are the reasons we were called \nto take up this commonsense cause. We want to work on this legislation \nthat Senator Nelson and I believe is one more way we can responsibly \nhelp homeowners, to temporarily waive this 10-percent penalty for \nwithdrawals up to $25,000. Our amendment would also waive ordinary \nincome taxes, as the Senator from Florida indicated, if the homeowner \npays back the withdrawal within 3 years of making it, so homeowners are \nprovided with a strong incentive to make their retirement savings whole \nagain.\n  This is not a silver bullet--I don't know if there is a silver bullet \nin terms of the crisis we are dealing with--but it helps those whom we \nwant to help, homeowners who are in big trouble. In doing so, this \ntemporary relief can prevent an unnecessary foreclosure from happening, \none which hurts not only the family but hurts the entire community. \nWhen houses are foreclosed and vacant, it affects everyone in the \nsurrounding area. It affects the neighborhoods. As a former mayor, I \nlooked at neighborhoods we built up in my time as mayor and I believe \nthe same neighborhoods are being torn down by the crisis we are facing.\n  This bill is about homeowners helping themselves. While the 10-\npercent penalty is well intentioned and we do not want people to be \nusing retirement savings during their working years, times such as this \nrequire us to recognize that sometimes such rules need to be flexible \nin order to serve a greater good. Both on a home ownership level and \ncommunity level, I believe it makes sense to enable those who can to \nkeep their homes. Ultimately it is up to the homeowner to decide \nwhether it makes financial sense to turn to their retirement savings to \nkeep their homes.\n  At least for those who decide to do so, we should not penalize them \nfor trying to keep a roof over their heads and wanting to remain part \nof the community they have called home.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense and much needed \nrelief.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                            [From USA Today]\n\n                      401(K)s Tapped To Save Homes\n\n                          (By Christine Dugas)\n\n       Struggling to save their homes from foreclosure, more \n     Americans are raiding their 401(k) retirement accounts to pay \n     their bills--and getting slammed with taxes and penalties in \n     the process, according to retirement plan administrators.\n       Rather than borrow money from their 401(k) accounts, which \n     would have to be paid back, a growing number of beleaguered \n     families have been cashing out, plan administrators say.\n       This is happening even as borrowing from 401(k) accounts \n     remains fairly flat. Fewer still are borrowing from 401(k) \n     plans to buy homes. By contrast, new figures from plan \n     administrators show the number of 401(k) ``hardship \n     withdrawals'' is up in early 2008 compared with the same \n     period last year.\n       The main reason? The need to stave off foreclosure or \n     eviction.\n       Consider Tamara Campbell, who raided her 401(k) after her \n     husband was laid off from his job as an occupational \n     technician, and they\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\n     fell behind on their mortgage for several months. ``If I \n     hadn't done that, we would have been foreclosed on last \n     year,'' says Campbell, who lives in a Denver suburb.\n       Such hardship withdrawals began rising last year and, by \n     January this year, had exceeded January 2007 levels. During \n     the first month of the year, as the economic slowdown \n     tightened pressure on mortgage holders, hardship withdrawals \n     rose 23 percent at plans that Merrill Lynch (MER) administers \n     compared with the same period in 2007, says Kevin Crain, \n     managing director of the Merrill Lynch Retirement Group.\n       The 401(k) withdrawals are rising mainly because people \n     such as Campbell and her husband want to save their homes. \n     Merrill Lynch found that the primary reason for the rise in \n     hardship withdrawals was to prevent foreclosure or eviction, \n     based on its sampling of applications filed in January.\n       Likewise, in the first month of the year, compared with \n     January 2007, Great-West Retirement Services saw a 20 percent \n     increase in hardship withdrawals to save a home. And \n     Principal Financial (PFG) reports that in January it received \n     245 calls from participants who inquired about 401(k) \n     withdrawals to prevent a foreclosure or eviction, up \n     dramatically from 45 similar calls it received in January \n     2007.\n       For workers, the consequences can be severe. About 85 \n     percent of employers bar employees from making 401(k) \n     contributions for six months after taking a hardship \n     withdrawal, says Pamela Hess, director of retirement research \n     at Hewitt Associates (HEW). Worse, employees who pull money \n     out of tax-deferred 401(k) plans before age 59\\1/2\\ generally \n     must pay a 10 percent penalty on top of the taxes owed.\n       A 401(k) loan imposes no such punishment. ``But let's face \n     it: If your problem is paying bills, and if you take out a \n     loan, then you just add another bill to pay,'' says Nevin \n     Adams of PlanSponsor.com, which monitors the 401(k) industry.\n       As Campbell considers whether to make another withdrawal, \n     she notes, ``It's not the kind of thing you want to use your \n     401(k) for. And if I keep doing this, I'm not going to have \n     any retirement savings.''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to close with a couple \nof sentences. As the chairman of the Banking Committee can so well \ninstruct us, for most Americans, their home is their most valuable \nasset. We ought to be adopting policy, through enacting law, that \nallows them to be able to stay in their own home and to use every tool \navailable to stay in that home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleague from \nFlorida and the Senator from Minnesota for their work on this effort, \nhaving been involved years ago in the creation of Individual Retirement \nAccounts going back to the early 1980s, recognizing the value of \nencouraging people to set aside hard-earned income for retirement, for \nhealth care, for education as the motivation. Let me mention one \nconcern I have while both Senators are on the floor, and I don't \nquestion at all the motivations behind it. There is nothing in this \namendment that would require a writedown. What we are trying to do is \nget the lenders to write down the size of these mortgages, to work out \ndifferent arrangements so the borrower could afford the mortgage.\n  What concerns me here is, while we are using this retirement income \nor these savings accounts to help meet these obligations, there is no \ncommensurate responsibility on the part of the lender to try to reduce \nthe cost. At the end of 2 years you may end up at exactly the same \nlevel. The money goes into the pockets of the lender, but at the end of \nthe 2 years we are still faced with the size mortgage we had before, \nand the homeowner is in the same position they are in today.\n  I don't have any quick idea here for you to tie this together to see \nif we can't incentivize that lender on that mortgage to also write down \nthe cost of part of that or to restructure it in a way so that person \nfacing foreclosure would be able to handle this. These moneys would be \nof tremendous help to them. But if you don't do anything about the size \nof the mortgage or conditions of it, all you have done is kicked the \ncan down the road for 2 years and then also watch that retirement \nincome get exhausted. You can put it back in, but it seems to be \ndefeating the very purpose of trying to get workouts.\n  We started a year ago with the stakeholders and set up a set of \nprinciples for writedowns. Unfortunately, according to Moody's, only 1 \npercent of the lending institutions have done that in a year--\ntragically, in my view. We would be in a very different position had \nthey done otherwise. So I am very suspicious about their willingness to \ndo this, and merely providing additional resources to them coming out \nof people's hard-earned money, although you have a good idea putting \nmoney back in. I would like to find a way to incentivize the lender so \nthe people can use these resources to stay in the home. That is merely \nan idea to consider in the next couple of days as we go forward.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, frankly, I think this is a good \ndiscussion. There is merit for both, for those who want to amend the \nlaw so IRAs can be used to help people finance their homes, but I also \nthink the Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, makes a very good point. We don't want to let the lenders \noff the hook either.\n  From a tax perspective, we in the Finance Committee believe--I can \nspeak for myself anyway--that the purpose of this amendment is close \nenough to the nature of the purpose of the IRAs and the savings \nvehicles in the first place to warrant an exception that will last for \n2 years because, after all, a home is pretty close to retirement. \nPeople should be saving for retirement in these retirement programs. If \nsaving their home means dipping into their retirement savings, then I \nthink that would be appropriate, as to avoiding the 10-percent penalty. \nAlso it is in effect for only 2 years, so from a tax perspective I \nthink it is appropriate. However, I think the chairman of the banking \ncommittees makes an excellent point and I would join with the Senator \nto see if he can find some way to incentivize lenders to do what they \nshould be doing, at least with respect to the principal on a lot of \nthese mortgage loans.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Can we \nthen create some ideas between our respective staffs--yours, Finance; \nthe Banking Committee; ours individually--and see if we can come up \nwith something to address the issue?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think we should. I will devote my staff to that effort.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. If the Senator will yield, I also understand the concern \nraised by the chairman of the Banking Committee. I will be pleased to \nwork with the chairman and my colleagues. I ask the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I think one of the things he did address, a piece of \nissue, had to do with the tax consequences. If a mortgage was $150,000 \nand it was taken down to $100,000 by agreement, in the past that \n$50,000 was a taxable gain. I believe recently--again, this little \npiece--we took that building block and said: Hey, if you knock it down \nto $100,000, that $50,000 is no longer a taxable gain; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. All these pieces fit together. Again, there is no silver \nbullet at the end, but if we can come closer to addressing the full \nrange of concerns, I think that would be positive. I think we already \nmoved, with the leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee, to \naddress that one piece. This is another piece. It is your home, your \nfuture, and clearly there is more work to be done.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. Earlier, when the Senator from \nMinnesota talked about silver bullets I was smiling because it is my \nview there are never silver bullets. It is always a major effort to \nfind lots of different pieces, different steps to address the \ndifficulties.\n  The occupant of the chair might remember this. There is a famous \njournalist, H.L. Mencken, of Baltimore, who said: For every complicated \nproblem there is a simple solution--and it doesn't work.\n  I guess that is true of this situation, too.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, what is the unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is to be \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to add to the unanimous \nconsent agreement: If I could let my colleague go before me and then I \ncould speak whenever he is finished or at 11 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Reserving the right to object, I will not. I am in the \nqueue as well. I want to make sure I know where I am. I understand now \nI will follow Senator Thune.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4419\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, regarding renewable energy.\n  As much as I appreciate the fact, as the Senator from Connecticut has \npointed out, that this is a housing bill and there is a mortgage crisis \nout there that needs to be addressed, I would also argue, first of all, \nthat, this being the Senate, we oftentimes consider amendments to bills \nthat are not necessarily related to the underlying base bill, and \nsecondly, that there probably is not an issue that impacts the folks I \nrepresent in South Dakota any more than does the high cost of energy.\n  Now, granted, as you travel across the country--and this is true in \nmy State, as I think it is in every State--people are following closely \nwhat is happening with the subprime mortgage crisis, and the Senate and \nthe Congress are reacting to that with the legislation that is \ncurrently on the floor. But if you look at it in the context of the \nbroader economy and what is impacting the pocketbooks of Americans \nevery single day--and certainly of South Dakotans--there is no question \nthat high energy prices are impacting the lives of everyone I represent \nin South Dakota. We are a very energy-dependent State, and we travel \nlong distances; we are a farm economy, so those inputs are very \nimportant to our economic well-being. We are a cold-weather State, and \nso electricity is in very high demand, both during the cold-weather \nseason but also during the hot-weather season.\n  It seems to me that if we are going to address the economic issues \nthat affect this country right now, we cannot do that without taking a \nhard look at what we can do to make energy more affordable to people in \nthis country. So I would argue to my colleagues who have made the point \nthat this is, in fact, a housing bill that, notwithstanding that is the \nbasic focus of this bill, when we look at addressing the economy, I \nthink in the broader context this is what this whole discussion is \nabout: how can we bring relief to hard-working people who are \nstruggling with the economic pains created by the housing crisis, by \nhigh energy prices, by high health care costs. Those are all factors \nthat impact the pocketbooks of everyday Americans. So I think the \ndiscussion of this renewable energy extender amendment is perfectly \nappropriate in the context of this debate.\n  I would also say, with respect to the Senator from Montana, who has \nworked very hard, along with the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, on an \nenergy package that would extend many of the tax incentives that are in \nplace for renewable energy, we have had that legislation now on the \nfloor of the Senate several different times and have been unable to \nreach that magic 60-vote threshold that is necessary to end a \nfilibuster and to move forward with the legislation. So I would argue \nthat every opportunity we have, we need to move forward with this \ndebate about energy and what we are going to do to lessen our \ndependence on foreign sources of energy to make energy more affordable \nto more Americans. So I think it fits perfectly within the context of \nthis debate.\n  I would also say, with regard to some of the extenders that will \nimpact those that relate to energy production in my part of the world, \nI am particularly interested in the wind energy production tax credit, \nthe 2-cent-per-kilowatt credit that applies to wind, and I have talked \nto investors who are looking at wind energy projects across this \ncountry and who are prepared to invest capital to build wind energy \nproduction but cannot deal with the uncertainty that exists with regard \nto Federal policy. The wind energy production tax credit expires at the \nend of this year, and if we do not do something in the very near \nfuture, those who are looking at making investments--that investment \ncapital is going to dry up. We cannot afford to have that happen at a \ntime when we have an increasing and growing demand for energy across \nthis country.\n  We are trying to look at the whole issue of greenhouse gas emissions \nand carbon emissions and find new renewable forms of energy that will \nhelp address our energy needs in a clean, environmentally friendly way. \nWe cannot afford to allow these tax incentives for renewable energy \nproduction to lapse at the very time that there is investment sitting \nthere on the sidelines waiting to invest in wind energy production and \nsolar energy production, but with the lack of certainty that exists \ntoday because of the pending expiration of these production tax \ncredits, that investment very well could end up staying on the \nsidelines and not be made. That would be a very tragic outcome, I would \nargue, for our country.\n  So I would hope that every opportunity we have here in the Senate--\nand frankly there will not be that many opportunities, regrettably, \nthis year on legislation that actually is going to pass here in the \nSenate to which to attach these types of amendments. The Senator from \nMontana has said there will be a tax extender bill moving later. I hope \nhe is right. I hope we have a window down the road to get addressed \nsome of these tax measures that are expiring. But if, in fact, that \ndoes not happen or if it happens later in the year, sometime in the \nsummer, we are going to miss a lot of opportunity, a lot of capital \ninvestment in wind energy and other types of renewable energy \nproduction that we otherwise would get if we had some certainty with \nregard to what the policy is going to be.\n\n  So, again, as much as there are jurisdictional objections being \nraised by the Senator from Connecticut with regard to this bill being a \nhousing bill, the Senator from Montana regarding the need to do this \nlater on a piece of legislation that might be a tax bill moving through \nthe Finance Committee and ultimately out to the floor, I would simply \nmake the case to my colleagues that timing is important. Timing really \nis critical with respect to whether we are going to continue to have \nincentives in place, economic incentives for investment in renewable \nenergy. Frankly, based on the conversations I have had with those who \nare looking at making those types of capital investments in wind energy \nand other forms of renewable energy production, they are very concerned \nthat Congress has yet to act.\n  I would much rather see a multiyear extension of the production tax \ncredit for wind, and some of the other renewable energy tax credits, \nthan doing this for 1 year because I do not think that provides the \nlong-term certainty that is necessary. But I would much rather have a \n1-year extension than face the prospect of this production tax credit \nexpiring at the end of this year and us not addressing it and seeing a \nwhole lot of capital investment that otherwise would be made in these \nareas of production stay on the sidelines and us continue to go down \nthis path of increasing dependance on foreign sources of energy, \ngrowing demand for energy here in the United States, and a need to \nlessen the greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere and us doing \nnothing about that. So my fear is that if we do not act now, perhaps \nthis thing gets punted down the road, perhaps it does not get addressed \nthis year, in which case the production tax credit would expire. That \nwould be a tragic outcome, a tragic result for this country and for the \ngoals we have when it comes to renewable energy.\n  I would simply say to my colleagues who are going to hear objections \nraised on procedural grounds about dealing with these production tax \ncredits in the context of this particular bill that we need to look at \nthe broader picture. We have an energy crisis in this country. We have \nthose who want to invest in renewable energy products that would help \naddress that, that would meet all of the goals I mentioned about clean \nenergy, about lessening our dependence upon foreign energy.\n  Frankly, the argument that was made by my colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Alexander, with regard to wind energy being more of a \nlocalized, regional issue, that is predominately true. But so is oil \nproduction. There are lots of parts of the country that do not have \ncertain energy sources. Yet we all rely upon all of those energy \nsources for our energy needs in this country. We happen to have an \nabundance of wind in the upper Midwest which I think has been \nunderutilized, but it has the potential to meet the energy needs of \npeople not just in South\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nDakota or North Dakota or Nebraska or Iowa or Minnesota but all across \nthe country. We need to be making the investments in those types of \nenergy sources, and we need to have the policies in place that would \ncreate the economic incentives for that to happen.\n  I hope that in spite of the objections that will be raised on some \nprocedural grounds to moving forward, that absent action to date and \nhaving seen in the past--looking historically at what has happened to \nthis wind energy production tax credit over time, since 1992 when it \nwas originally enacted, every time it comes to where it is about to \nexpire or does expire--you will see this peak investment when it is in \nplace. When it comes to where it is running out, the investment falls \noff, tails off; it expires, gets put back in place, and it takes off \nagain. We need to even that out so we don't have these peaks and \nvalleys, that we have consistent policies in place that will provide \nthe certainty and the necessary incentives for those who want to invest \nin these types of energy sources to be able to do.\n  So I hope we will pass the Ensign amendment and put it on this bill. \nThe objection has been raised that this could derail the housing bill. \nFrankly, the House has voted not on one occasion but on several \noccasions already for these very same renewable energy tax credits, and \nI suspect that they would welcome the opportunity to have that vote \nagain in the House of Representatives. I hope it will be part of this \npackage because it does address the fundamental issue when it comes to \nour broader economy; that is, the high cost of energy that is plaguing \nand harming and impacting the pocketbooks of every single American.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we have this vote, which I assume will be \nearly next week, to vote yes for the Ensign amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EXCLUSION FOR AMOUNTS RECEIVED UNDER QUALIFIED \n                   GROUP LEGAL SERVICES PLANS RESTORED, EXTENDED, \n                   AND MODIFIED.\n\n       (a) Removal of Dollar Limitation.--Section 120(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exclusion by \n     employee for contributions and legal services provided by \n     employer) is amended by striking the last sentence.\n       (b) Real Estate Matters Emphasized.--Section 120(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to requirements) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Benefits.--The plan shall provide, at a minimum, \n     legal services for real estate matters relating to family or \n     personal residences, including document review of real estate \n     sales, purchases, closings, mortgages, and foreclosures.''.\n       (c) Extension.--Section 120(e) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Application.--This section and section 501(c)(20) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2007, and before January 1, 2010.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2007.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is a \nvery important amendment because we are all here because we are \nconcerned about the crisis that exists in the mortgage industry and \ncertainly in home ownership, but, more importantly, we want to prevent \nit from happening again. We want to make sure we are providing \ninformation to home buyers and others, counseling them in a way that \nreally makes a difference. The amendment I am offering today will \nencourage our employers to provide group legal services benefits with \nan emphasis on real estate counseling for their employees.\n  Group legal services plans have been around since the 1970s and are \nintended to do exactly what the Center for Responsible Lending says \nshould be one of our very top priorities in this effort to deal with \nthe housing crisis. We should be encouraging and incentivizing \npreventative legal services.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues understand how important this \nbenefit is for our Nation's employees, particularly employees in rural \nareas and low-income areas where access to lawyers might be scarce. We \nshould be giving the average American homeowner access to legal advice \nso that she or he can feel confident in the mortgages they are getting \ninto and so that when, God forbid, things do go wrong, they can receive \nadvice about what their rights and responsibilities are in dealing with \nforeclosures and what options are available to them in dealing with \nthis crisis.\n  Section 120 of the Internal Revenue Code has lapsed. That section of \nthe code was intended to provide a tax incentive so that our employers \nwould offer group legal services plans to their employees. Since it has \nlapsed, virtually no new group legal benefit plans have been created \nand many employers are dropping those that do exist.\n  We should be encouraging these plans because they provide our working \nAmericans with access to the legal advice they need, that they deserve, \nand that they often cannot access. Those legal services would provide a \nreview of mortgage documents, would work with lenders to modify the \nloans and would create forbearance agreements, would assist in the \nrestructuring of loans, and would provide counsel in foreclosure \nlitigation when that is needed. These are all complex transactions that \nrequire significant legal counsel, and my amendment will help ensure \nthat America's homeowners, particularly those who are hard-working \nAmerican families, and those home buyers, can get that much needed \nadvice. We have provided this advice and certainly these services, as I \nmentioned earlier, since the 1970s through this benefit where employers \ncan actually pool their resources in providing this type of advice and \nservice to their employees.\n  I wish to thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this \nimportant amendment. Many of us have worked on a separate bill, and we \nthink this is absolutely an appropriate and a proper place to put this \nincentive. But Senator Smith, Senator Kerry, Senator Stabenow, Senator \nLevin, Senator Schumer, and Senator Kennedy are all cosponsors of our \namendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent now to add Senator Snowe \nas a cosponsor, who is also a cosponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I also want to say a very big thanks to all of the \ngroups that have endorsed this amendment: the American Bar Association, \nthe American Prepaid Legal Services Institute, the International Union, \nthe UAW, the AFSCME, and the Laborers. All of these groups have \nrecognized how important it is to be able to provide these legal \nservices to hard-working American families.\n  Particularly at a time when they may be affected in their home \nownership or in the difficulties and challenges they face in the \nproblems that exist in the mortgage industry right now, this is a \ncritical component of the assistance we can provide them. To have let \nit lapse and to see that it virtually no longer exists is something we \ncan correct. I hope we will with this amendment.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time, and I also say a special \nthanks to my chairman, Chairman Baucus, and Ranking Member Grassley, \nwho have worked with us on this issue, along with Chairman Dodd and \nRanking Member Shelby, who have done such a tremendous job in \norganizing and putting together, in an expeditious way, the effort we \nhave to address these issues that working families are facing.\n  So I thank them and their staff for working with us, and we look \nforward to being able to move our amendment. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nsupport of such an important amendment, a vehicle as well as a \ncomponent that we already know works because we have had it in this \ncountry for quite some time in providing legal services to working \nAmerican families. We want to continue to see that happen.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4433 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to \nlay aside the pending amendment and call up an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for Ms. Snowe, proposes an \namendment numbered 4433 to amendment No. 4387.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify the increase in volume cap for housing bonds in \n                                 2008)\n\n       On page 70, strike lines 14 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) Increase for 2008.--In the case of calendar year \n     2008, the State ceiling for each State shall be increased by \n     an amount equal to the greater of--\n       ``(i) $10,000,000,000 multiplied by a fraction--\n\n       ``(I) the numerator of which is the population of such \n     State, and\n       ``(II) the denominator of which is the total population of \n     all States, or\n\n       ``(ii) the amount determined under subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Minimum amount.--The amount determined under this \n     subparagraph is--\n       ``(i) in the case of a State (other than a possession), \n     $90,300,606, and\n       ``(ii) in the case of a possession of the United States \n     with a population less than the least populous State (other \n     than a possession), the product of--\n\n       ``(I) a fraction the numerator of which is $90,300,606 and \n     the denominator of which is population of the least populous \n     State (other than a possession), and\n       ``(II) the population of such possession.\n\n       In the case of any possession of the United States not \n     described in clause (ii), the amount determined under this \n     subparagraph shall be zero.\n       ``(C) Set aside.--\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Snowe is offering \nwith several other colleagues is an amendment that focuses on what we \npassed and maybe what we did not quite notice. The Finance Committee \npassed an important provision that would provide an additional $10 \nbillion in mortgage revenue bonds for first-time home buyers and at-\nrisk borrowers. This is something we have been trying to do, and we \nhave had much leadership in the Senate on this issue.\n  Under present law, however, mortgage revenue bonds are allocated with \na small State set-aside. The $10 billion in the current package is \nallocated only based on State populations. As we know, the economic \ndownturn and housing collapse do not necessarily correspond to the \npopulation of States.\n  Those of us who come from smaller States recognize that and also \nrecognize the benefits that have been provided in the underlying law \nthat exists in that small State set-aside.\n  The Snowe amendment adds enough additional bonds so large States will \nstill receive their due under the allocation of the $10 billion by \npopulation, but small and rural States also receive their allocation \nbased on a small State set-aside under the current law.\n  I think it is an important point we have noticed in terms of what the \nunderlying law does and has done effectively and making sure we \nincorporate that into what we do moving forward in the legislation we \nhave.\n  This amendment only costs about $134 million, but it means an awful \nlot for small and rural States in order to make sure they have equity \nin being able to access the resources their homeowners need and their \nStates can provide through those revenue bonds.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this fair and reasonable amendment \nwhich will be a good addition to the mortgage revenue bond provision in \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4404 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and call up amendment No. 4404.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       (Purpose: To amend the provisions relating to qualified \n     mortgage bonds to include relief for persons in areas \n     affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma)\n       Beginning on page 68, strike line 22 and all that follows \n     through line 4 on page 69 and and insert the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding the requirements of \n     subsection (i)(1), the proceeds of a qualified mortgage issue \n     may be used to refinance a mortgage which--\n       ``(i) was originally financed by the mortgagor through a \n     qualified subprime loan, or\n       ``(ii) is a mortgage on a residence--\n\n       ``(I) located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (as defined in \n     section 1400M(1)) and damaged or rendered uninhabitable by \n     reason of Hurricane Katrina,\n       ``(II) located in the Rita GO Zone (as defined in section \n     1400M(3)) and damaged or rendered uninhabitable by reason of \n     Hurricane Rita, or\n       ``(III) located in the Wilma GO Zone (as defined in section \n     1400M(5)) and damaged or rendered uninhabitable by reason of \n     Hurricane Wilma.\n\n       On page 72, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       (c) Waiver of 3-Year Requirement for Homes Damaged by \n     Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.--Paragraph (2) of \n     section 143(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (C), \n     by inserting ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (D), and by \n     inserting after subparagraph (D) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(E) in the case of bonds issued after the date of the \n     enactment of this subparagraph and before January 1, 2011, \n     financing with respect to the purchase of any residence--\n       ``(i) located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (as defined in \n     section 1400M(1)) and damaged or rendered uninhabitable by \n     reason of Hurricane Katrina,\n       ``(ii) located in the Rita GO Zone (as defined in section \n     1400M(3)) and damaged or rendered uninhabitable by reason of \n     Hurricane Rita, or\n       ``(iii) located in the Wilma GO Zone (as defined in section \n     1400M(5)) and damaged or rendered uninhabitable by reason of \n     Hurricane Wilma,''.\n       On page 72, line 11, strike ``(c)'' and insert ``(d)''.\n       On page 73, line 19, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the support earlier today \nof an amendment that I, Senator Cochran, Senator Vitter, and Senator \nWicker brought forward for the people of the gulf coast--thousands and \nthousands and thousands of homeowners, responsible homeowners, \nhomeowners who did not exploit opportunities for fancy-dancy mortgages, \nhomeowners who took just the regular standard mortgages, who had \nactually paid their mortgages off, and kept insurance their whole life. \nThen, in 2005, two storms hit the gulf coast and literally wiped out \nthe net worth--literally, a great deal of the net worth--of hundreds of \nthousands of families on the gulf coast.\n  The reason I continue to come to the Senate floor is because the \nStafford Act, which would normally come, if you would, to the rescue of \npeople in our country in this situation, is wholly inadequate for \neither the initial recovery or the long-term rebuilding. It is not just \nwhat Mary Landrieu says, the Senator from Louisiana. It is what \nSecretary Chertoff testified before our committee last week. I am going \nto submit his actual quote for the Record. It is what Chief Paulson of \nFEMA said yesterday, testifying before the committee. It is what the \ninspector general of the Homeland Security Department said yesterday \ntestifying before our committee.\n  So this is my dilemma as a Senator from a State that has had an \nunprecedented disaster. I would have been happy to receive the Stafford \nAct and just make it work for us. But since it is not working for us, I \nam kind of inventing things as we go along, trying to take appropriate \nand responsible advantage of other bills that come along that actually \nmight be appropriate for our situation.\n  I am trying not to ask for too much but only what we need. But since \nthe structure we have is not applicable, I have no choice. So I have \nbeen waiting for a year and a half to get a housing bill on the Senate \nfloor so we could make some of these changes. I appreciate my \ncolleagues being understanding and supportive, and everybody has been \njust terrific.\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\n  As I said earlier this week, we have had some terrible situations in \nDetroit, in California, in Las Vegas, in Sacramento, thousands and \nthousands in San Bernardino, CA. But as I said, some of these \nhomeowners could have gotten themselves in trouble. They might have \ndone things they should not have done. I do not know. Maybe some people \nwere victims of fraud. That will be worked out, I hope, through some of \nthe legislation we are passing.\n  But the reason I pull this chart up is to say that even in the worst \narea in the country right now for foreclosures, which is Detroit, \nDearborn, MI, with 42,000 homes--these are official numbers--only 4.9 \npercent of the houses in this whole area are basically in foreclosure \nor for which there is a threatening pending foreclosure.\n  I bring this contrast to show you that down on the gulf coast, those \nnumbers are dwarfed by what Katrina and Rita and the subsequent levee \nbreaks did to our homeowners. In St. Bernard Parish, almost 55 \npercent--not 4 percent, not 10 percent, not 20 percent but 54 percent \nof the homes in St. Bernard Parish--had damage exceeding 30,000. Some \nof these homes were only worth $50,000. Some were worth $350,000. But \nthey are basically completely damaged.\n  In fact, the sheriff and the parish president told me that there were \nonly five homes undamaged in the whole parish after Katrina and Rita--\nafter those waters went down--5 out of the 67,000 people who live in \nthis parish.\n  For Cameron Parish, almost 50 percent of their households have had \ncompletely devastating damage to their homes.\n  So, if you can, picture a place that does not have just a spattering \nof houses and weeds and emptiness but places that have blocks and \nblocks and miles and miles of homes that are empty and gutted with the \nwindows and doors open and the families gone. People are struggling to \ncome back with a very inadequate Federal framework right now to help \nthem.\n  I know we have sent down a lot of community development block grant \nmoney. After a lot of contortions that everybody went through, we \nfinally crafted a plan to give each of these homeowners, if they \nqualified--they had to prove they owned the land; they had to prove \nthey paid taxes; they had to prove they were actually the right \nhomeowner--we gave them a grant, no more than $150,000. The average is \nabout $60,000 for Mississippi and Louisiana. Our plans are similar but \nnot the same.\n  But you can imagine the problem with a family who owned their house \noutright, they had no mortgage. It was worth $350,000 or $400,000 or \n$500,000, and the most grant they could possibly get is $150,000.\n  So we are far away from trying to make people whole. Why should we \ntry to make them whole? Again, it is nothing they did. They did not \ncause the hurricane. Some of them did not even live in floodplains. \nSome of the families did not have flood insurance because they were \ntold by their mortgage holder and their bankers they did not need it. \nThey were told by the Federal Government they did not need it.\n  So my amendment is an attempt to help these homeowners by not adding \na penny to the underlying bill, which is a wonderful thing--that we do \nnot have to add any money to the underlying bill because I know we are \ntrying to keep the cost of all this down. But all my amendment would do \nwould be to allow there to be a third reason that bonds could be issued \nat the State level.\n  In the underlying bill, the first reason, which is a good reason, is \nto allow first-time home buyers to buy some of the homes that have been \nforeclosed on that are sitting empty in neighborhoods. So what a good \nway to kind of get these homes back in circulation, to allow first-time \nhome buyers with limited incomes--it is $65,000 in my State. I am not \nsure what it is in everybody else's State, but that would be a lot of \nfamilies with teachers, firefighters, nurses, et cetera. They are not \nvery wealthy but not poor middle-class families. These families could \ncome in and buy some of these homes. That is a great idea.\n  I used to be the State treasurer. I issued these bonds. It works. It \nis a happy thing when people can buy a home. The underlying bill also \nallows these bonds to be issued to build more multifamily dwellings. \nThis is a desperate need in Louisiana because while we spend a lot of \ntime talking about our homeowners who have lost homes, we had over 60 \npercent of the population in New Orleans, maybe between 50 and 60 \npercent who were not even homeowners. They were renters. Some of them \nwere very wealthy renters. They chose to live in nice places, but a lot \nof the people in New Orleans--my hometown--were poor, and they could \nnot afford a home, so they were renting. Their places have been \ndestroyed, and we now have a growing homeless population of historic \nproportions.\n  So the provision in the underlying bill that gives the opportunity to \nissue bonds to build multifamily dwellings is great. We can build for \nthe elderly, who really need affordable housing in the country. I also \nbelieve the underlying provision allows for the building of places, \nrentals for the disabled, which is also a growing need.\n  But what my amendment simply says is, there will be a third option \nfor these bonds, and it will help to refinance homes that have been \ndestroyed along the gulf coast in basically the storms of 2005. That is \nwhat the current amendment says.\n  But let me say that I am very open to modify my amendment, if the \nleadership wants to do that, to allow the use of these bonds to go to \nbasically any home that was destroyed by a disaster in the whole \ncountry. I think it would be a very good use of these bonds because, as \nI said, there is not a lot of help outside of just general insurance \nthat helps people to rebuild. If people have insurance, fine; they can \nrebuild their home from insurance proceeds. But many people who had \ntheir houses destroyed by tornadoes or flash floods or hurricanes or \nearthquakes were not required to have insurance by the current law, and \nif they already paid off their mortgage, even if they were required to \nhave insurance, they weren't required to after they paid off their \nmortgage; so a disaster hits and there is no way.\n\n  This is not a grant. This is not a giveaway. It is an opportunity to \nprovide mortgage lending for people who may want to buy some of these \nhomes that have been destroyed. They are not foreclosed homes; they \nwere destroyed and owned basically now by, in our case, Government \nentities that are trying to recirculate these properties back into the \nhousing market.\n  So that is basically what my amendment does. I hope we will have an \nopportunity, of course, as the day goes on, to maybe speak about it \nmore or to have a vote on it next week, whenever the Senate decides to \nproceed.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut. As I was saying before he came \nin, the amendment I am offering now adds no cost to the underlying \nbill. It takes the mortgage provision piece and makes it applicable for \ntrying to help with homes that were destroyed in a disaster. Right now, \nwe are trying to help with homes that were destroyed, if you will, by a \nforeclosure situation. We are also hoping to build multifamily housing, \nwhich is great.\n  All we are asking for with this amendment is to basically add a third \nvoluntary--not mandatory but voluntary on the part of the States if \nthey want to include disaster, without adding any additional expense to \nthe bill.\n  So I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I hope we will take up this \namendment whenever we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the Senator from Louisiana leaves, \nfirst of all, let me commend her generally. All of us at one time or \nanother have faced natural disasters in our State, but I can't recall \nanything, at least in recent memory, that would compare to what the \nGulf State have suffered and particularly what the State of Louisiana \nhas suffered. I know some may say: Well, every time there is a bill up, \nthat Senator from Louisiana has an amendment to help her folks in \nLouisiana. That is how it ought to be. They are very fortunate indeed \nto have a fighter such as Mary Landrieu in their corner.\n  As she said, this wasn't any disaster. This was devastating. For \nthose of us who have been there, as I was, and as one who has been \nthere on several occasions since then, it still is stunning to me to go \ndown and see the devastation still exists. In most disasters,\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\nwithin weeks or months after the occurrence, it is amazing how \nrecuperative areas are; however, despite the Herculean efforts of many \nin her State and others, the devastation still persists.\n  Certainly, those who have lost their homes suffer the most \ndevastating impact of all, in many ways, because that is the center of \na neighborhood, it represents the ability of a family to survive and \nstay together. All the elements and qualities we like to attribute to \nbeing an American family are associated with our homes. The fact that \nso many have been destroyed as a result of these disasters is something \nall of us are mindful of, and if we are not, the Senator from Louisiana \nreminds us of it on a daily basis. We thank her for that.\n  We are certainly going to do everything we can to accommodate and be \nsupportive of this effort. As she points out, it doesn't expand the \nprogram financially. It operates within the financial constraints as \nthe amendment has been crafted. Right now it is focused on the Gulf \nStates, those areas that were adversely affected. My inclination is to \nkeep it that way. That is not to suggest other States may not have had \nsimilar occurrences, but I think because of the uniqueness of what \nhappened there, we need to recognize that in this effort. I would be a \nlittle uneasy about expanding it. Not that that is without merit, but I \nthink particularly in this case, with this one occasion we are talking \nabout a particular compelling case which has been made.\n  So once again, I thank her for fighting on behalf of our fellow \nAmerican citizens who happen to be her specific constituents. We thank \nher for it. Over this weekend, we will take a look at it, and if there \nare any questions we have about it, I will get back to her, but I will \nbe urging Senator Shelby and others to be supportive of this idea.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I \nwill follow his advice and keep the amendment tailored, and if he \nchanges his mind, he can let us know. I appreciate his attention to \nthis matter.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4384 to Amendment No. 4387\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that the Sanders amendment at the desk, No. \n4384, be called up, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself and Mr. \n     Brown, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4384.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide an increase in specially adapted housing benefits \n                         for disabled veterans)\n\n  At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. INCREASE IN SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING BENEFITS FOR \n                   DISABLED VETERANS.\n\n       Section 2102 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(2), by striking ``$10,000'' and \n     inserting ``$12,000''; and\n       (2) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``$50,000'' and inserting \n     ``$60,000''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting \n     ``$12,000''.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBrown, Schumer, and Harkin be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, first, I wish to commend Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby for their work on this legislation. In particular, I \nwish to congratulate them on the provisions already in the bill to help \nour servicemembers and veterans. I also wish to thank Senator Akaka, \nthe chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Senator Burr, \nthe ranking member, and their staffs, for helping to clear this \namendment.\n  The amendment I am offering today will provide another piece of \nneeded help to disabled veterans trying to stay in their homes. This \namendment increases funding for a VA grant program that assists \ndisabled veterans needing to adapt their homes to accommodate their \ndisabilities. As the Presiding Officer knows, many thousands of \nsoldiers, coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan as amputees, who are \nblind and who have a number of disabilities, and this amendment \nattempts to address some of those problems by helping them adapt their \nhomes so they can live in those homes with their disabilities.\n  This amendment is supported by some of our Nation's largest veterans \norganizations, including the VFW, the DAV, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, and the Vietnam Veterans of America. It is also important \nto note the policy changes we are advocating are contained in the \nindependent budget, the document authored every year by many of the \nsame organizations. It is also a policy that has the unanimous support \nof the majority members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nwhich endorsed this policy change in the 2007 and 2008 Views and \nEstimates letter to the Budget Committee; in other words, this policy \nin this amendment has broad support.\n  Veterans with certain severe service-connected disabilities are \nentitled to what are known as specially adapted housing grants of up to \n$50,000. Veterans with service-connected blindness only or with loss of \nuse of both upper extremities may receive a grant of up to $10,000. The \nauthors of the independent budget note increases in these amendments \nhave been sporadic, despite the increases in real estate costs. In \nparticular, veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are finding \nthe current VA program does not cover the cost of adapting their homes \nto accommodate wheelchairs or loss of vision, to create physical \ntherapy space or other needed changes.\n  This amendment increases the specialty adaptive housing grant to \nprovide $10,000 in additional benefits for those veterans eligible for \nthe $50,000 grant and $2,000 in additional benefits for those veterans \neligible for the current $10,000 grant. So we are raising the cap on \neach program to $60,000 and $12,000, respectively. According to CBO, \nfor fiscal year 2009, this amendment would cost about $6 million.\n  The Senate is now debating an important piece of legislation to try \nto bring relief to so many of the middle-income Americans who are \nstruggling to keep their heads above water in today's economy and \nhousing crisis. I think, given the context of this bill, certainly we \ncan reach out to disabled veterans to adapt their homes so they can try \nto live as full lives as possible.\n  I wish to again commend Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, and the Banking \nCommittee for the proveteran, proservicemember provisions already in \nthis legislation, and I ask that my colleagues support this small \nadditional benefit. I ask for my colleagues' support on this amendment, \nand if it is appropriate, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me commend my fellow New Englander for \nthis idea. You wonder how something such as this persisted as long as \nit did. I wish to commend our colleague for discovering it and finding \nit out. Senator Shelby is not here this afternoon, but his staff is \naround, and we have been talking with them. I think this will \noverwhelmingly be accepted. This should not require a recorded vote.\n  I was telling the staff I am one of six children. My oldest sister \nCarolyn was born legally blind. When I arrived at the House of \nRepresentatives in the mid-1970s, I remember as a freshman I discovered \nyou couldn't be a foreign service officer if you were legally blind. We \nmanaged to change those regulations. How silly a rule it was. Unrelated \nor related, I guess, to some degree here, but I thank my colleague from \nVermont for raising this.\n  I appreciate his kind comments about Senator Akaka. Senator Kerry and \nSenator Coleman offered some ideas as well on the veterans housing \nissues also. I am told by Senator Shelby's staff he is very supportive \nof this\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nas well. This isn't a large amount. It may not be a banner headline for \nsome, but the Senator from Vermont is going to make a difference in the \nlives of some families and some individuals. It may not be thousands. \nEven if there are a few hundred, it makes a difference.\n  So at a moment such as this, on a Friday afternoon, when most people \nhave headed off for home, let the Record record and history record that \nthe Senator from Vermont made a difference in the lives of a handful of \npeople with this amendment. I thank him.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who have \nworked so hard this week on the housing stimulus bill. I particularly \nwant to commend my friend from Rhode Island--Senator Jack Reed--for his \ntireless work on simplifying mortgage disclosures so that mortgage \napplicants will have in plain English--not fine print or jargon--the \nmost important terms of the loan including the maximum monthly payment \npossible. This provision was included in the bipartisan substitute \namendment and I congratulate Senator Reed.\n  For months, as America has sunk deeper and deeper into economic \ndistress, hard-working people all over this country have wondered what \nthey are going to do to make ends meet--and why their Government wasn't \ndoing more to help.\n  For families already strained by rising health care and gasoline \ncosts, and with many struggling to care for an elderly parent or put a \nchild through college, the latest economic downturn is fast becoming \nthe proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, where affordable housing was already in \nscarce supply, thousands of families face foreclosure, eviction, and an \nuncertain future. For the 12-month period ending in December 2007, the \nforeclosure rate in Rhode Island increased by a staggering 238 percent. \nMore than 12 percent of subprime loans in my State were in foreclosure \nin December 2007. The foreclosure rate among subprime loans in Rhode \nIsland is 15 times higher than the prime loan foreclosure rate.\n  This is a crisis that strikes at the most vulnerable. As I talked to \nRhode Islanders during the recent recess, I heard over and over again \nabout the difficulty of making ends meet in this fragile economy. And \nas they watch things get worse, they wonder why our Government would do \nso much to keep the investment bank Bear Stearns from going under, but \nso little for them and their neighbors.\n  There are some in this city, and in this building, who believe that \nif we simply let the markets correct themselves, all will be well. I \nhave great faith in market forces, and I've seen firsthand the power of \nAmerican industry and American ingenuity to work great good in our \ncountry and our world. But we in Government should know by now that \nmarket forces need disciplined constraint, and that the American people \ndeserve better than to see their homes swept away by a financial \ntyphoon while Congress stands idly by. They need our help.\n  Earlier this week, after hard work and good-faith negotiations, \nSenators Dodd and Shelby reached a compromise on legislation to soften \nthe blow of the residential real estate collapse. In addition to \nSenator Reed's disclosure provision, the bill now before us includes $4 \nbillion in funding for community development block grants to assist \nStates and municipalities in purchasing and rehabilitating homes that \nhave been foreclosed upon, and $100 million for pre-foreclosure \ncounseling. It also includes Federal Housing Administration reform that \nwill increase the availability of FHA-backed mortgages, offering an \nalternative to the subprime market for more middle- and lower-income \nfamilies for whom buying a new home might otherwise be out of reach.\n  This agreement is a strong start, but it failed to include a \nprovision authored by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois that would permit \nbankruptcy judges to modify the terms of a primary residence mortgage. \nI was proud to cosponsor Senator Durbin's amendment, which included \nthis provision, and was disappointed that the amendment lost a \nprocedural vote yesterday. I plan to support my colleague from Illinois \nas he continues his efforts to enact this important change to the \nbankruptcy code.\n  As my colleagues know, unlike most contracts, including mortgages on \nvacation homes and family farms, bankruptcy judges cannot currently \nmodify the terms of the very contract most dear to families facing \nbankruptcy, their principal residence: the place they call home, where \nthey raise their children, know their neighbors, and live their lives.\n  Simply put, this provision would fix this glaring anomaly in section \n1322(b)(2) of the bankruptcy code so that primary residence mortgages \nare treated like most other secured debts. Like any secured creditor, \nthe mortgage holder would be entitled to adequate protection of his or \nher property interest during the chapter 13 case. The modification of \nthe mortgage would be limited by market prices and rates and to a \nrepayment term of no longer than 30 years.\n  Given the cost of foreclosures--which may average as high as $50,000 \nper incident--it would seem that this amendment to the bankruptcy code \nwould benefit all parties to a mortgage. Passing this measure could \nhelp more than 600,000 families facing bankruptcy stay in their homes.\n  As we continue to consider this housing stimulus package, we have an \nopportunity to help millions of families weather this crisis and get \ntheir lives back on track. I will continue to fight for meaningful \nrelief for middle-class families threatened with the loss of their \nhomes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am told, and I could be corrected, but I \nthink we have probably completed any amendments to be offered on this \nlegislation at this juncture.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are at least one or two other Members \nwho may come to the floor to talk about this bill or maybe even offer \nsome ideas they intend to propose next week when we reconvene. I \nthought it might be worthwhile at the end of this week--which has been \na busy week, obviously, and one where a lot of attention for the first \ntime in a long time has been focused on the most critical economic \nissue we face, and that is the foreclosure crisis--to restate where we \nare.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I began this process almost a year ago \nwhen we convened the stakeholders across the country on a bipartisan \nbasis, I might add, in the Senate Banking Committee to talk about the \nforeclosure crisis--that was March of last year--resulting in a set of \nprinciples we adopted jointly that would make it possible for workouts \nof these mortgages that would make it possible for more Americans \nfacing foreclosures to stay in their homes. That was the goal as we \nbegan last spring when this emerged as a growing problem.\n  I felt then, and it has been confirmed over the last number of \nmonths, that this was not a minor issue, that it was not going to go \naway or likely to be contained very quickly. Unfortunately, that has \nproven to be just the case.\n  Today, we are looking at economic statistics that point to a \ndifficult time. We are in a recession. I know it has not been declared \nformally yet, maybe Washington hasn't called it that yet, but if you \nare out there trying to feed your family, put fuel in your automobile, \npay your mortgage, pay your child's college tuition or anything else, \nyou are watching inflation at the highest rates it has been in years, \nand we are watching unemployment numbers continue to rise. The fiscal \npicture of our country is the worst it has been in years, with the \nnational debt now reaching some $9 trillion, a staggering sum of money \naccumulated over the last 5 or 6 years. The value of the dollar is the \nlowest it has been since we allowed our currency to float back in the \nearly 1970s.\n  Every major economic indicator points to what difficulty our country \nis in, and this crisis has been compounded and exacerbated by a \nforeclosure crisis. That is the center of this issue, the foreclosure \ncrisis. So everything we should be doing should be designed to try to \noffer relief in that sector. If we do that, then I believe we can take \na major step forward in getting us back on track again and, hopefully, \nthis recession will not last long and people's confidence and optimism \ncan begin to rise.\n  This is the first time we have dealt with this issue in any \ncomprehensive way at all in the last year. There have been a number of \nother bills that have been brought to the floor that have made some \ncontribution to this issue. But this is the first time we have actually \nhad a day or two to debate the housing crisis and to offer some ideas \non resolution of that issue.\n\n  I want to add, as quickly as I can, that anyone who thinks this bill \nis the end-all is making a huge mistake. This bill is a step in the \nright direction, it is a positive one and a good one, but there are key \nmissing ingredients. Why is that the case? That is the case because, \ncandidly, we weren't able to get any debate going at all unless we \ncould develop some consensus around several provisions on which there \nwould be little or no debate, some core issues, and then open the \nprocess for some additional ideas, as we have seen over the last few \ndays, with various amendments that have been offered and considered \nalready. But it is a step in the right direction. It does not include \nthe kind of fundamental relief for those in foreclosure or about to go \ninto foreclosure and offering them some escape from losing their homes.\n  So while I welcome the steps we are taking, I would be the first to \nadmit and tell my colleagues that we have yet to really address the \nunderlying problem; that is, how do we keep people in their homes? In \nfact, we will have a hearing next week, Mr. President, on the very idea \nthat has now been circulating over several months and that I proposed \nback several months ago--that has also been embraced, I might point \nout, by the chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the other \nbody. I am pleased to say that there are a number of Members here, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, who, while they have not signed on to a \nbill, have been extremely encouraging in terms of their support for \nthis idea. So I hope in the coming days to be able to finalize a \nproposal and bring it to the floor that would, for the first time, \noffer some very meaningful direct relief to the people who are facing \nforeclosure--some 8,000 a day.\n  We talk in numbers here of billions of dollars and millions of \npeople, trillions of dollars. The language gets beyond the grasp of \nmost people to understand. But I think everyone can understand when I \ntell you that almost 8,000 people a day are going into foreclosure. \nOver the last 2 or 3 days we have been debating this bill on the floor, \nsome 24,000 of our fellow citizens are finding themselves in danger of \nlosing the most important possession they have outside of their \nfamilies, and that is their home. And every day we wait, every day we \ndelay, every day we procrastinate, every day we talk about something \nother than the core issue affecting our economy, more and more \nAmericans run the risk of being in that statistic of losing their \nhomes. And it isn't just them, because for every foreclosure that \noccurs in a square block, the value of every other home in that \nneighborhood declines as well. So while people are saying: Well, I am \nnot in foreclosure, I am not likely to be there, but my neighbors are, \nyou are affected by it. We know that values decline by as much as 1 \npercent of median if one of your neighbors watches their property go \ninto foreclosure, if it ends up being boarded up or in deteriorating \ncondition. Crime rates go up. So there is a ripple effect to all of \nthis, and hence\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\nthe importance of addressing the underlying issue of how do we keep \npeople in their homes.\n  A lot of what we are talking about in this bill is how to deal with \nthe properties once they are foreclosed. That is not an insignificant \nproblem, and I welcome the opportunity to do something about it. But it \nseems to me that if we really wanted to address the issue, instead of \nhow much money we can spend to rehabilitate foreclosed property or how \nmuch money we can get to mayors or county supervisors to clean up \nneighborhoods and to put them in better shape for possible resale, or \nto come up with a tax provision that will make that foreclosed property \nattractive to some future buyer, why not spend as much time seeing to \nit that we keep people, where we can, in their homes? That is what we \nare going to be offering in the coming days.\n  But there are some very good ideas in this proposal, so as we go into \nthe weekend now, before we come back on Monday and Tuesday, I thought \nit might be worthwhile just to briefly encapsulate what has been \naccomplished and what is in this bill.\n  First of all, we provide $100 million for counseling services to help \npeople stay in their homes. That is in addition to the $180 million \nalready appropriated last year. Senator Bond and I offered that \nlanguage, and it was adopted, and it has been a real asset to these \norganizations out there that assist people every day.\n  I had the privilege of meeting with some families in Connecticut a \nweek or so ago who were facing foreclosure and would have been in \nforeclosure but for the intervention of these nonprofit organizations \nthat were able to establish a workout with the lender and the borrower \nand have been able to keep people in their homes. So this is $280 \nmillion for this fiscal year. If you compare that to the $42 million \nthat existed previously, it is a substantial increase.\n  Would I like more here? Absolutely. My colleague from the State of \nWashington, Senator Murray, and Senator Schumer wanted $200 million. I \nam not going to ever tell them I disagree with that, but in trying to \nput together a package here, the only amount of money the majority \nleader and I were able to get in that negotiation was to cut the \ndifference and get $100 million for counseling. I am hopeful we can add \nsome more to that in time, but at this juncture we have $100 million \nfor it.\n  We have provided $4 billion to go to community development block \ngrants specifically targeted to assist local governments to take a \nforeclosed property and put it in condition so it can be resold or used \nas rental housing. That idea is to try to make sure we don't end up \nwith a lot more supply than we already have.\n  One of the reasons the market is not necessarily addressing this \nissue as comprehensively as we might like is because the supply of \nhousing vastly exceeds demand. When you end up with people in \nforeclosure, you are adding to that supply. One of the reasons we ought \nto keep people in their homes is you then reduce that supply, and the \nnormal economic market forces then would begin to assist us. That is \nwhere supply and demand get closer together and the market can help \nresolve some of this problem. By having foreclosed properties that grow \nworse, become abandoned, fall into disrepair, the value of other homes \nbegins to decline in the neighborhood, and it makes it far more \ndifficult to address this problem in the near or long term. So the $4 \nbillion in community development block grants is designed to go to \nthose communities and specifically give them help to see to it that \nthese properties can get back on their feet.\n  The mortgage revenue bonds we are providing here as well, some $1.5 \nbillion for mortgage revenue bonds, will help people refinance out of \nthe lousy mortgages they got into. It is not as much as I would like, \nbut it will assist people to get a better deal, a better mortgage than \nthe one they have. That does make a difference for some of these people \nwho are trying to come to a different economic circumstance than the \none they are in. So it is not insignificant. I would have liked to have \nseen us do a bit more, but it will make a difference. So there is $1.6 \nbillion in that area.\n  Veterans. I want to thank Senators Kerry, Akaka, Sanders, and I think \nSenator Coleman as well, if I am not mistaken, who were all involved in \ntrying to do what we could to assist our men and women serving in \nuniform in Iraq and Afghanistan and who are already under tremendous \npressure, to make sure their properties are not foreclosed on \nunderneath them while they are off in a desperate condition serving our \ncountry. Whether you agree or disagree with our policies, don't ever \nblame the soldier, the airman, the marine, the sailor out doing their \njob, and least of all they shouldn't be losing their homes in the \nprocess. So we provided for that in this legislation as well, and I \nthank my colleagues for those ideas.\n  We provided as well some assistance here for builders. I had some \nquestions about this, I will be quite candid with my colleagues, and \nhad I been writing this on my own, I am not sure I would have added \nthose provisions. But there were those here who felt strongly about \nthat, both Republicans and Democrats, and wanted to do something in the \nTax Code to assist in these losses, to extend them over a longer period \nof time. It is in the bill. Again, I had some reservations about it, \nbut, as my colleagues know, you don't write these things on your own, \nand if you are trying to put together a compromise package, the word \n``compromise'' implies that you are going to accept some things you may \nnot like and you are going to have some things tailored back that you \nwant support for.\n  On Federal Housing Administration modernization, here we have raised \nthe loan limits from $417,000 to $550,000. We also require that the \ndownpayments will be as much as 3\\1/2\\ percent. That is a lot more than \nI would like, candidly. I wanted 1\\1/2\\ percent. But in order to get \nthat additional $230,000 increase over the loan limits, where some 19 \nStates, I might add, would have been disadvantaged--higher cost States \nor at least part of their States in higher cost--we had to agree on a \ncompromise here and raising that number to 3\\1/2\\ percent. But that \n$550,000 under FHA will make a huge difference for many people who are \nlooking again to refinance or to get mortgages they can afford. So it \nis a very valuable addition to this bill, and I welcome the opportunity \nto include that as well.\n  Those are some of the major provisions of what we have packaged. \nThere will be additional amendments offered on Tuesday that will add to \nthis, some of which or all of which may be adopted either by voice vote \nor recorded votes, but it is a step again in the right direction. It is \naction. It is movement on this issue.\n  Again, as I said, the bill doesn't in any way go far enough, in my \nview, to help the distressed borrowers, those who are living under the \nmonthly threat of foreclosure, in fact the daily threat of foreclosure \non their homes. So it is hardly a final action, but it is a first step \nand a major step in the right direction.\n  There was an idea that I had hoped to include in this bill and that I \ncouldn't get agreement to bring as part of the bill. The danger of \nbringing it up as an amendment, Mr. President, is that I am concerned, \nbecause it is complicated, it might not carry, and therefore, with \nnegative votes, it would be harder to bring it back. But as many will \ntell you here, the effort to try to restructure these mortgages could \nmake a huge difference.\n  One of the problems we are having, of course, is that capital has \nseized up. It is not moving. How do you begin to get capital to flow in \nthese markets? One certain way is to get some clear ideas of where the \nbottom, where the floor is in the residential mortgage market, and that \nis unclear as I speak. As long as it is unclear where that bottom is, \nthen you are going to find people very reluctant to move capital into \nthis area, or others, for that matter. This problem has spread far \nbeyond the housing issue. It is now into student loans, car loans, and \nevery other aspect of our economy is being affected by this.\n  So the idea--and it is not a new one; actually, it has been used in \nthe past--is to try to see if we can come up with a scheme that would \nallow us to reduce or write down the value of these mortgages to some \ndegree, thereby the lender would be getting less than they anticipated \nwhen they made the original mortgage, but they would end up getting \nsomething rather than a foreclosed property and nothing coming\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\nback. Secondly, the borrower would have to pay the insurance to FHA, \nwhich would guarantee this mortgage. They would also have to stay in \nthe home. These residences would have to be owner occupied. It is a \nvoluntary program both for the lender and the borrower. To the extent \nthat value in the property increases, then money would come back to the \nFederal Government as a result of financing, through insurance, this \ninstrument.\n  That is a rough idea of what it would do. The real value of it, aside \nfrom obviously helping people stay in their homes, is establishing that \nfloor and that bottom. Anyone who is paying any attention to this issue \nat all will tell you that unless we address that issue--address that \nissue--we will be back here month after month after month in the coming \nyears dealing with the effects of the problem, and that is money going \nto our cities to help them make foreclosed properties look better, and \nwe will be doing things we can to help out people to somehow get \nthrough all of this. But if you really want to address the issue, then \nyou have to confront the problem, and that is that capital is not \nmoving.\n  The one thing we can do, of course, is to provide this kind of floor. \nYou need to have enough transactions to determine that, but I believe \nthat if we act quickly enough around here, we can make a difference in \nthat area. And I will hold a hearing on this in the Banking Committee \nnext week. We will have one additional hearing, at the request of \nSenator Shelby and others, to examine this issue and fine-tune it. I am \npleased a number of people here and outside of this body have indicated \nvery strong support for this idea, cutting across the normal \nideological lines that too often divide us, as something we ought to \ndo.\n  I invite my colleagues to take a good look at this, or their staffs, \nover the weekend. I will submit, at the end of these remarks, a copy of \nthe bill and its proposals, and I would strongly invite people to take \na look at it, and any thoughts and ideas they have to strengthen this \nor improve it, I welcome. No one is claiming exclusive authorship of \nthis idea. As I mentioned, it was tried during the Great Depression. In \nthose days, the Federal Government actually purchased these very \ndistressed mortgages at a very discounted rate and then arranged for \nthat owner-occupied resident to stay in the home at a new rate. The \nGovernment actually made some $14 million on that program back in the \nGreat Depression. We are not suggesting anything quite like that, \nalthough there are some similarities to it as a way of keeping people \nin their homes.\n  Anyway, I invite people to look at that idea because I think it does \ngo right to the heart of what we are talking about. There are other \nideas as well to try to strengthen this situation, but unless we do \nsomething like what I have suggested here, actually dealing with the \n8,000 people a day who are falling into foreclosure, then this problem \nis only going to grow in its magnitude and the ability to provide some \nrelief for people is going to grow far more expensive than it already \nis. That is the reason I am urging my colleagues to take a look at this \nidea to see if we can't, in the coming few days, complete a markup in \nthe committee and then bring a bill to the floor that would really \nprovide some meaningful and direct assistance to those who are facing \nthis problem.\n  Look, I am not talking about speculators, Mr. President. That is a \ndifferent crowd altogether. I feel bad that they have lost money, but \nwe bear no moral obligation to help out a speculator. And I am worried \nabout those who should never have gotten into a mortgage in the first \nplace, but there is probably not a lot I can do about them except to \nhelp them in some ways.\n  We are talking about that large constituency in the middle, who were \nlured into very bad deals, were lured into arrangements they never \ncould afford at the fully indexed rate. You could say they bear some \nresponsibilities for having gone into those deals, and I do not \ndisagree with that, but if you only were going to look at the \nforeclosed property you might draw that conclusion--we bear no \nresponsibility to deal with the individual caught in those \ncircumstances. But let me make a case to you if you are harboring those \nthoughts, why you might want to think differently about this. If you \nlive in that neighborhood, if you live next-door or you live down the \nblock or if your child does, in a new home, one they just bought, the \nvalue of every other property declines with one foreclosure in a \nneighborhood. That doesn't help anybody. We are watching housing values \ndecline two consecutive years in a row. This is the first time that has \nhappened since the Great Depression; sales are way off--all the related \neconomic problems associated with a massive downturn in the housing \narea.\n  We may have as many as 50 million homes adversely affected by \nforeclosure. The number of foreclosures could be somewhere between 2.5 \nand 3 million homes in the country, but the number of homes affected by \nit is vastly in excess of the number of actual foreclosures. Those \nnumbers on foreclosures may be low. It may be higher than that. We are \nhoping it will not be. But even if not, the ripple effect is going to \nbe felt by everyone else in the area. If you are harboring the notion I \ndon't care about my neighbor, I am sorry they got themselves into that \nmess, I feel badly for them, but I don't think we have any obligation \nto do anything about them at all, I remind you it will affect you--it \naffects all of us; hence, the necessity to address this issue and do \neverything we can to keep people in that home if we can.\n  We are all going to benefit from that. Our economy clearly would also \nbenefit in a very specific way; people who live within that \nneighborhood will be benefited by our efforts to try to stabilize this \nsituation and have better financial arrangements for those who \notherwise are going to lose their homes.\n  That is where we are as we complete our business at the conclusion of \nthis week. This bill has been a good week, I would say. This bill is \nnot one that has everything we would like to have in it, but the good \nnews is this: The Senate, for the first time in a year, is \ncomprehensively trying to address this housing crisis. While you may \nnot agree with everything we have done--you may be disappointed, as I \nam, that we do not have some provisions in here I would like to see \nincluded--the fact is we are debating, discussing and coming up with \nideas and adopting them, to provide some relief for people in this \narea, as it should be.\n  I am grateful to Senator Shelby, my colleague from Alabama, the \nformer chairman of the Banking Committee. I am very grateful to the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid. When I talked to him last week before we \ncame back, we both agreed this was an issue we had to pursue. He agreed \nand went out and sought out Senator McConnell and created the kind of \narrangement that allowed for Senator Shelby and I to spend over 24 \nhours to package a proposal that could serve as the core coming \nforward. So we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the majority leader for \ninsisting this be the debate this week, that we move forward next week \nand try to conclude our business, get together with the other body and \nresolve these matters and then come back with other ideas on how we can \nprovide some real relief in this area.\n  I conclude by thanking him and his staff as well as our own staffs on \nthe Banking Committee who worked through the night to try to come up \nwith some compromises in these areas. It is always difficult to do it \nwhen you have 50 Members in a body with very strong ideas on where \nthings ought to be. These people don't often get the recognition they \ndeserve for spending the long hours and putting together these kinds of \npackages. I am grateful to the Senate Banking staff, Democrats and \nRepublicans, for their efforts. My hope is next week we can conclude \nthis and then come back again with some additional ideas that can truly \nmake a difference.\n  I thank everyone for their involvement. I know there are several \nother people who want to come over and be heard on this subject matter, \nbut in their absence, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Congressman \nWilliam Dickinson, who passed away on Monday, March 31, 2008. Bill was \na skilled legislator and a personal friend, and along with the entire \nState of Alabama, I mourn his passing.\n  William Dickinson was born on June 5, 1925, in Opelika, AL. He served \nin the United States Navy during World War II and as a Major in the \nUnited States Air Force Reserves. In 1950, he obtained a law degree \nfrom the University of Alabama. He then practiced law for 2 years. In \n1952, Bill began his career as an elected official, serving as a judge \nin city, juvenile, and circuit courts in Lee County. After his \nsuccessful career as a judge, Bill was an executive for the Southern \nRailway. Bill also served on the Opelika Board of Education.\n  When Bill was elected to Congress in 1964, most of his constituents \nhad never before been represented by a Republican. Nevertheless, Bill \nwas elected to 14 consecutive terms in office and was a pivotal force \nin Alabama's change into a two-party State. While in office, \nCongressman Dickinson accomplished a great deal for his district, the \nState of Alabama, and our Nation.\n  He worked tirelessly for the 13 counties in his congressional \ndistrict, particularly on military matters. As ranking member of the \nHouse Armed Services Committee, Bill was able to protect and strengthen \nthe military bases in Alabama. He was a steamroller in military funding \nissues for the Air War College at Air University, Maxwell Air Force \nBase, and Gunter Annex in Montgomery, AL, and also further south in \nAlabama at Fort Rucker, where Army helicopter pilots go through their \ntraining. His exemplary work in this area improved both the economy of \nour State and the security of our Nation.\n  Bill's work for the military also extended to the national level. He \nwas very influential in the rearming of America during the Cold War, \nworking to stop the spread of communism and providing the military with \nthe programs and equipment they needed during the Vietnam war. Bill is \ncredited both with the creation of the Aviation Department in the \nDepartment of the Army and for the Apache Attack Helicopter program. In \nfact, Bill was nicknamed the ``Father of Army Aviation'' due to his \nadvocacy on behalf of those issues.\n  His work garnered the attention of the American Conservative Union, \nwhich presented him with the Statesman Award; the Army Aviation \nAssociation of America, which awarded him with its Congressional \nAppreciation Award; and the Association of the United States Army, \nwhich presented William with the Distinguished Service to Soldiers \naward, among others.\n  Bill is loved and will be missed by his wife Barbara, his four \nchildren and his five grandchildren. He was an inspiration to many and \nwill be remembered for his service to our Nation. I ask the entire \nSenate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of our \ncolleague, Congressman William Dickinson.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/04/senate-section/article/S2611-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  CONGRATULATING HOLY FAMILY RESIDENCE\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Holy \nFamily Residence of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Scranton, PA, on \nthe occasion of its 100th anniversary.\n   The Holy Family Residence has served the elderly poor of Scranton \nfor the past century with loving care and devotion. All of the devoted \ncaregivers ensure that the guests of Holy Family Residence receive the \nphysical, social, and spiritual care advocated by Blessed Jeanne Jugan, \nthe foundress of the Little Sisters of the Poor. In fact, all of the \nsisters have taken a vow of hospitality to care for their impoverished \nneighbors. Not only do the guests of the Little Sisters of the Poor \nenjoy a true sense of belonging through recreational and social \nactivities and responsibility for certain daily tasks, but the guests \nalso receive hospitality in the form of physical comfort and \ncompassionate healthcare.\n   The current staff of Holy Family Residence consists of ten Little \nSisters of the Poor and 90 full and part-time employees. These devoted \nindividuals offer skilled nursing care to 52 elderly residents and also \noperate apartment-style living for another 22 disadvantaged senior \ncitizens. All of those under the care of Holy Family Residence are \neligible for Medicaid. In spite of such financial difficulties, these \nresidents can enjoy peace of mind and compassion through the charitable \nefforts of the Little Sisters of the Poor and the dedicated caregivers \nat Holy Family. It is with great pride that I congratulate Holy Family \nResidence for its 100 years of service to the elderly poor of Scranton. \nI hope that the Little Sisters of the Poor may continue their good \nworks in Scranton for many years to come and that they might inspire \nothers to show the same care toward their neighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/04/senate-section/article/S2611-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF IOWA WRESTLING TEAM\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am here today to honor the \nUniversity of Iowa wrestling team. The Hawkeye wrestlers won their 21st \nNCAA championship on March 22, 2008 in St. Louis. It was the first \nnational championship for the Hawkeyes since 2000, and it shows that \nIowa's great wrestling tradition continues. Under the tutelage of \nformer Hawkeye great Tom Brands, the Iowa squad won its 32nd Big Ten \nconference title with a perfect 8-0 record. They had an overall dual \nrecord of 21-1.\n  Iowa crowned two individual national champions in St. Louis, Brent \nMetcalf and Mark Perry. Metcalf had an incredible season for the black \nand gold and was named Outstanding Wrestler at the Big Ten and NCAA \nChampionships, and at the Division I NWCA/Cliff Keen National Duals. \nMetcalf was named Big Ten Wrestler of the Year, and most recently was \nawarded the Dan Hodge Trophy which recognizes the top college wrestler \neach year. Perry won the second national championship of his college \ncareer. He was also named an All-American for the fourth time. A \nsenior, Perry compiled an overall record of 96-16, and a 20-3 record \nthis season. They also had seven athletes named All-Americans, Metcalf, \nPerry, Jay Borschel, Matt Fields, Charlie Falck, Phillip Keddy and Joe \nSlaton.\n  Coach Brands was named National Wrestling Coaches Association Coach \nof the Year and Big Ten Coach of the Year.\n  Iowans also celebrated the Hawkeyes' success on April 3, which \nGovernor Culver proclaimed ``University of Iowa Wrestling Day'' in our \nState.\n  I am proud to recognize the Iowa Hawkeye wrestling team, along with \nCoach Tom Brands and his outstanding staff, for winning the Division I \nWrestling National Team Championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/04/senate-section/article/S2611-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. PHILIP MASON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to recognize the \nefforts of Dr. Philip P. Mason, widely regarded as one of Michigan's \nmost distinguished living historians, on the opening of the 50th Annual \nConference on Local History; ``Michigan in Perspective.'' This \nconference, which Dr. Mason founded in 1958 and continued to organize \nand nurture for a half century, is one of our Nation's most outstanding \nhistorical gatherings, appealing to historians of all ranks. Dr. \nMason's efforts throughout the years to preserve, promote, and \nfacilitate the use of historical records is, indeed, an important \nendeavor.\n  Dr. Mason graduated from Boston University with a degree in liberal \narts in 1951, and subsequently moved to Michigan to pursue a master's, \nand ultimately a doctorate, in history from the University of Michigan. \nWhile at the University of Michigan, he served as Michigan's State \nArchivist from 1953 to 1958.\n  In 1958, Dr. Mason launched a long and distinguished career at Wayne \nState University as a professor of history. That same year, he founded \nthe Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs and served as its director \nuntil he retired in 1992 to return to teaching. By 1992, the Labor \nArchives had grown to become the official depository for the inactive \nrecords of nine international labor unions, including the United Auto \nWorkers, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of \nState, County and Municipal Employees, Airline Pilots, American \nFederation of Teachers, and the United Farm Workers.\n  The archives also preserved and made available to researchers the \nhistorical files of several thousand labor leaders, reformers, and \nprominent community leaders. In May 1975, the new Walter Reuther \nLibrary opened on the Wayne State University campus. By the end of his \ntenure as director, the library had become one of the major research \ncenters in the world and an integral part of the research of hundreds \nof scholars, writers, film producers, and other researchers.\n  Dr. Mason was promoted to full professor in the department of history \nin 1966. He also became professor of library and information science in \n1993 and his popular archives curriculum educated and inspired hundreds \nof young professional archivists. In 1990, Wayne State University named \nDr. Mason a distinguished professor of history, a rank he retained \nuntil his retirement in 2006. Throughout his career, he received \nnumerous awards, including the Alumni Faculty Service Award in 2005, \nthe President's Exceptional Service Award in 2001, and the \nDistinguished Graduate Faculty Award in 1985.\n  During his career as an archivist, he assisted many institutions, \nincluding Penn State University, Georgia State University, the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin, and San Francisco State University to \nestablish their labor archives. He was the major consultant to the AFL-\nCIO in establishing the George Meany Archives at Silver Spring. He also \nassisted 15 other international unions to set up archives and records \nmanagement programs.\n  Dr. Mason played an active role as a member of at least seven \nprofessional societies ranging from the American Association of State \nand Local History to the Michigan Historical Society.

Mr. President, I wish to honor a remarkable man \nfrom Michigan, Wally Bronner, who passed away on April 1, 2008, at the \nage of 81. As the founder of BRONNER'S CHRISTmas WONDERLAND in \nFrankenmuth, he embodied the spirit of Christmas.\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\n  I had the privilege of visiting Wally at his store and it was an \namazing experience. His enthusiasm and passion were contagious. He was \ntruly an ambassador for the community of Frankenmuth and the State of \nMichigan, throughout our country and the world. It is hard to think of \nChristmas without thinking about Wally Bronner. BRONNER'S CHRISTmas \nWONDERLAND is truly one of a kind and provides visitors with the \nopportunity to experience different cultures and Christmas traditions \nfrom around the world.\n  Wally Bronner was born and raised in Frankenmuth, MI. He started a \nsign painting business while in high school and then decorated window \ndisplays for a local hardware store. Several merchants approached him \nabout providing them with Christmas decorations and that was the \nbeginning of what has now become BRONNER'S CHRISTmas WONDERLAND, which \nsits on 45 acres of land with a shipping department that is the size of \n5\\1/2\\ football fields and a chapel.\n  Wally had a deep faith in God and was passionate about giving back to \nthe community. His generosity has been felt in Frankenmuth and beyond. \nThe Walter and Irene Bronner and Family Foundation, which he founded, \nhas made many special things happen for the community, including a new \nauditorium at Frankenmuth High School and ``Operation Sparkle'' that \nprovided the equipment needed to clean up Saginaw.\n  BRONNER'S CHRISTmas WONDERLAND will continue to delight people of all \nages across the world, but Wally's presence will surely be missed. I \nwant to express my deepest sympathies to his wife Irene Bronner and his \nchildren Carla Spletzer, Maria Sutorik and Wayne Bronner. Frankenmuth, \nthe State of Michigan and Christmas lovers everywhere are forever \nindebted to Wally Bronner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/04/senate-section/article/S2612-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4847.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 2822. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal a \nsection of that Act relating to exportation or importation of natural \ngas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, along with Senator Clinton, Senator \nLieberman, and Senator Dodd, I am introducing legislation that will \ncorrect a fundamental wrong perpetrated in the 2005 that allowed \nFederal bureaucracy to override local control by placing the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission in the primary role of siting Liquified \nNatural Gas, LNG, terminals. That action, taken in the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005, took what had historically always been a state government \nresponsibility--the permitting of LNG storage terminals--and handed it \noff to a Federal agency in Washington, DC--FERC.\n  At the time, 45 Senators went on record saying that cutting State \nsiting agencies out of the LNG siting process was a bad idea and the \nhistory of FERC's actions since then have borne us out.\n  Right now, in Oregon, we have three separate LNG proposals pending \nbefore FERC. Together, they would have a combined capacity of 3.3 \nbillion cubic feet, BCF, of gas per day. Oregon and Washington, \ntogether, only use 1.33 BCF per day. Yet, FERC categorically refuses to \naddress the basic question of whether the three proposed facilities are \neven needed to serve our market. FERC also refuses to consider whether \nany of the three publicly announced interstate pipeline proposals to \nbring natural gas to Oregon from the Rocky Mountains would be a better \noption. In fact, FERC asserts that it's not its job to determine which, \nif any, of these proposals best serves our market. FERC also asserts \nthat it has no obligation to determine which of these proposals--and \nthe hundreds of miles of pipelines that would cut through forest lands, \nfarms, vineyards, and residential neighborhoods to connect them to the \ninterstate pipeline system--has the least environmental impact to our \nState and our citizens' private property.\n  To make matters worse, FERC's insistence that each of these projects \nis a separate, unrelated project has produced a bureaucratic nightmare \nof competing public meetings, scoping hearings, and filing requirements \nfor each project. Letters from local officials to FERC asking \nlegitimate questions about impacts on local land use don't get \nanswered. They simply get filed, because that's what the FERC process \nis set up to do--to process paper and not address real concerns.\n  The end result is a public process in which the public has no due \nprocess and no assurance that their concerns will be heard, much less \naddressed.\n  At every turn, FERC's LNG siting process in Oregon has defied common \nsense and public accountability. It is a process divorced from the real \nworld questions that need to be answered. The situation in other parts \nof the country is no different.\n  It's time to restore the local and State role in these critical \ndecisions about in whose backyard a pipeline or\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\nLNG plant will be built. It is time to reverse the ill-considered \ndecision Congress made in 2005 when it overrode State and local \ndecision-making to put a Federal bureaucracy in charge of LNG siting \nauthority. This bill would do exactly that.\n  I am pleased that Senator Clinton is joining me in sponsoring this \nimportant legislation to give States and local communities a say in \nwhere LNG facilities and pipelines should be built. I urge colleagues \nto join me in sponsoring the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
