Mr. President, the Senate will conduct a period of morning \nbusiness for the next hour, with Republicans controlling the first \nhalf. Following that, we will resume consideration of the immigration \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I walked by the President's Room today and said hello \nto a bunch of Senators in there. They were in there working on the \nimmigration bill, Democrats and Republicans. We don't see enough of \nthat. It was really, for me, a good scene. They were in there and had \nstacks of papers. They are trying to figure out a way to get through \nthe immigration bill.\n  We all acknowledge that the immigration system in our country is \nbroken and needs to be fixed. I am not foolish enough to think we are \ngoing to make it perfect with this bill, if we can get it out of the \nSenate. We need to try. We have an obligation to try. That is what is \nhappening on a bipartisan basis.\n  I want Senators to keep working and see what we can do. There are \ncertain issues, they have told me, they think will give Democrats \nheartburn and other issues that will give Republicans heartburn. \nTherefore, they are trying to get an agreement on some amendments, to \nhave a 60-vote margin. That is the way it should be. We should not be \nin a posture where somebody is filibustering something they don't like. \nI hope people will be reasonable and continue to work as they have.\n  I spoke to the distinguished Republican leader late last night, and \nwe talked briefly this morning. We are looking forward to, when the \nHouse finishes the emergency supplemental, moving to that as soon as we \ncan. It is an important issue. We have struggled on this now for \nmonths. Emotions are high. I think it is time to move on and see what \nwe can do to fund the troops in an appropriate way. So we will keep \nMembers informed. I have told the distinguished Republican leader that \nI will keep him informed on any word I get from the House.\n  I have gotten calls, and people are upset that some of their things \nare not in this piece of legislation. It is very difficult--the \nPresident's Chief of Staff, in the first meeting Senator McConnell and \nI had with Josh Bolten, said: On this issue, I speak for the President. \nHe said: If I don't have authority to speak for the President, I will \ngo back to the President. When he called me, as he has on a number of \noccasions, and said: I am telling you that if this provision is in the \nbill, the President is going to veto it, we worked through some of \nthese. We had to take certain things out of the bill. It wasn't a \npleasure to do that because Members are affected on both sides. We had \nsome issues that only affected the Senate. The President was unhappy \nwith that. I wish he would let us do what we wanted to do, but we are \nin a position where that cannot be done.\n  I hope the bill is in a position where we can fund the troops without \na lot of animosity at this stage. People can make whatever statement \nthey want regarding the war, and I am sure that will happen. I think we \nneed to get to this as quickly as we can.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6578-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me say that I am very honored today to \njoin my friends, Senator Salazar of Colorado and Senator Alexander of \nTennessee, in their efforts to try to restore some nonpartisanship to \nour discussion on Iraq. I feel very strongly that we should never have \na party-line vote on Iraq. We have 160,000 troops on the ground. It is \njust too important an issue for one party to take one side, the other \nparty to take another side, and for the White House to do one thing and \nCongress to do another. In fact, we talk often in this Chamber about \nhow there needs to be a political solution inside Baghdad. The truth \nis, there needs to be a political resolution inside of Washington, DC, \nwhen it comes to Iraq.\n  I am honored to lend my name today to this effort by Senator Salazar \nand Senator Alexander.\n  One thing I have noticed in the last several weeks and months--maybe \nin the last year--when it comes to Iraq is that there is a lot of \nrhetoric. To be honest, that is not helpful. It is not bringing our \ntroops home earlier. It is not providing more stability inside Iraq. It \nis not allowing Iraq to function as a sovereign nation. We need to tone \ndown the rhetoric and roll up our sleeves and work through this \ntogether.\n  I also understand that Senator Bennett, Senator Gregg, and Senator \nCasey have all joined in this effort as well. It is an honor for me to \nbe part of this bipartisan solution.\n  One of the things we are going to emphasize here is Iraqi \naccountability. We know that is something which needs to happen inside \nIraq. The Iraqis need to take responsibility for their own country. The \nIraq Study Group talked about this a lot in the pages of their report, \nwhere on page after page they talk about what they believe needs to \nhappen inside Iraq.\n  So this bill which Senators Salazar and Alexander will be filing in \nthe coming weeks talks about diplomatic efforts, about securing Iraq's \nborders, promotes economic commerce and trade inside Iraq, political \nsupport, and it talks about a multilateral diplomatic effort. It talks \nabout milestones and also about redeploying troops. After talking to so \nmany people in my State and around the country, I think that is where \nAmerica wants us to be. They want a stable Iraq.\n  It is a little bit like what Colin Powell said: It is the Pottery \nBarn principle; that is, if you break it, you own it. Well, we went \ninto Iraq, and we have a lot of responsibility there. I think most \nAmericans understand that. They don't like what they see on the front \npages of the papers every day or on the evening news, but they do know \nwe have a responsibility inside Iraq, and they want us, in the Senate, \nin the House, and also at the White House, to show leadership. This is \na time for leadership, a time for us to come together on these \nprinciples which the Iraq Study Group laid out--not that every one of \nthem is exactly right, but they laid out a lot of principles that I \nbelieve many people in this Chamber can rally around and hold on to. If \nwe implement these and make that our national policy, then I think we \ncan get better results on Iraq than we have had in the past.\n  I know General Petraeus has mentioned that we cannot rely on a purely \nmilitary solution inside Iraq. I think he is exactly right; I think he \nis 100 percent right on that. It needs to be a multifronted effort--\nsecurity, political, economic, and diplomatic. We need to do a lot to \nhelp Iraq get back on its feet and become a functioning nation again.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues in this effort. I \ninvite other colleagues to look at the Salazar legislation and consider \njoining it as well in the coming weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am honored to join with my friends in \nthis particular effort. I congratulate the occupant of the chair, \nSenator Salazar, and Senator Alexander for putting this forward. We are \nseeing people come on board in equal numbers on both sides of the aisle \nto demonstrate that this is a bipartisan effort.\n  Some might say this is an attack on the President's plan. I do not \nsee it in that fashion at all. I think this is a demonstration of \nbipartisan support for an American plan, to see what we can do to get a \nmore stable Iraq.\n  When I go to Iraq and talk to the experts, they tell me the war is \nbeing fought on two fronts: It is being fought in Iraq and in \nWashington, DC. Al-Qaida has declared Iraq as the front line of their \nwar on the ``great satan,'' which to them is the United States of \nAmerica. The battle being fought in Washington, DC, has to do with \nAmerica's resolve in standing up to al-Qaida. The word that is going \nout from Osama bin Laden in his audiotapes, and the letters that are \nbeing circulated, is that if we can just hold on long enough, the \nbattle will be resolved in Washington, DC, as the Americans decide they \nno longer want to continue the fight.\n  By demonstrating in a bipartisan fashion that the Senators of the \nUnited States are willing to talk about long-term commitments and long-\nterm solutions, we are making our contribution to winning the war in \nWashington. General Petraeus has been charged with the security portion \nof the war in Iraq. The Iraqi Parliament and the Iraqi Government \nthemselves must deal with the political problems in Iraq. We must not \nlet them down by partisan bickering in Washington that encourages al-\nQaida to believe America will walk away from its responsibilities.\n\n  This piece of legislation is not about name calling or blaming for \npast mistakes. There is no question there have been past mistakes. We \nwill let the historians sort that out. Our responsibility is to do \ntoday what is needed to bring about an eventual proper resolution.\n  In every war America has been in, there have been times of darkness,\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\ntimes of despair. Think about Abraham Lincoln and what he faced with \nthe continuing bad news from the front in his effort to keep the Union \ntogether. Think about World War II and the bad news that came out of \nthe first encounters in North Africa and some of the other American \nefforts where we were repulsed. If we had all said we are going to turn \nour backs on this and walk away, we would not have the kind of world of \npeace we have received as a result of our efforts in those wars.\n  Now is the time for the Congress to say: Regardless of what may or \nmay not have been a mistake in the past, we still have to stand \ntogether and move forward on the basis of intelligent analysis, and we \nare using as our starting point as that analysis the Iraqi Study Group. \nThe President is not hostile to this. I think he is open to it, and I \nthink it is incumbent upon the Congress to say to him: Look for new \nsolutions, but base them on sound analysis, and if you will, we will be \nwith you, we will move forward in a bipartisan manner to see to it \nAmerica does not fail in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am honored today to join in a bipartisan \ninitiative to introduce legislation based upon the recommendations of \nthe Iraq Study Group. I proudly stand with my distinguished \ncolleagues--you, Mr. President, as well as Senators Alexander, Bennett, \nPryor, and Gregg--in affirming that this bill will offer a new way \nforward for the United States in Iraq.\n  The detailed recommendations contained in this bill offer a \ncomprehensive blueprint for renewed diplomacy, restructured economic \nassistance, and a redeployment of U.S. military forces in Iraq to \nemphasize training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, conducting \nlimited counterterrorism missions, and protecting our own forces.\n  These recommendations were issued in December 2006, over 5 months \nago, but, if anything, their utility is even more apparent today.\n  Our troops should not be refereeing a civil war. And so this Congress \nand the President must come together--must come together--to form and \nto forge a new path. The Iraq Study Group's final report is the only \ncomprehensive plan on the table to do that.\n  I approach this bill from a slightly different perspective than some \nof my cosponsors. In fact, I cosponsored the Reid resolution to change \nour direction in Iraq, with a goal of completing that redeployment no \nlater than March of 2008. That position has been reflected in the votes \nI have cast, the questions I have asked as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee at hearings, and the statements I have delivered on \nthe Senate floor. I strongly opposed the President's decision to \nescalate the number of combat troops in Iraq. For that reason, I voted \nfor the first supplemental bill sent to the President's desk which \ncalled for a more restricted U.S. military mission and a phased \nredeployment of our combat forces from Iraq.\n  A majority of Congress has made clear their desire to change course. \nYet unless we achieve a more bipartisan consensus in the Congress that \nchange is necessary, an impasse will continue and our troops will \ncontinue to pay the price. It is for that reason I believe the Iraq \nStudy Group's prescribed course of action represents our best hope for \na bipartisan consensus in an approach to wind down this combat role in \nIraq and successfully transition our mission there.\n  The members of this Iraq Study Group included foreign policy and \nmilitary experts, as well as other distinguished Americans with \nimpressive experience in public service.\n  There is no challenge greater than determining how the United States \ncan salvage our effort in Iraq in a manner that protects our core \nnational interests, that does right by the Iraqi people, and enables \nour troops, who have accomplished every mission they have been given \nover the past 4 years, to come home finally.\n  After months of study and focused deliberations with almost 200 \nexperts, including leading U.S. and Iraqi Government officials and \nregional scholars, the Iraq Study Group released last December a \ndetailed report with 79 recommendations. This report prescribed a \ncomprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that \nincludes sustained engagement with regional neighbors and the \ninternational community in a collective effort to bring stability to \nIraq.\n  There are a few recommendations in the Iraq Study Group report that \nI, in fact, disagree with personally. But the comprehensive plan put \nforth by the group, and particularly the elements emphasized in our \nbill, represents the best thinking we have on how to resolve the Iraq \ndilemma in the long run.\n  Time is running out to change course in Iraq. In Pennsylvania, 166 \nmen and women have died. Yesterday we learned 9 Americans were killed \nin a series of attacks across Iraq. Meanwhile, we continue to search \nfor two American soldiers taken hostage, and at the same time we hear \nthe grim news that the body of a third missing U.S. soldier was \nidentified yesterday.\n  It is time for a change, and I know of no more detailed proposal, no \nmore exhaustively researched set of recommendations and findings and no \nmore comprehensive solution than that offered by the Iraq Study Group. \nThis bill, brought forward by a bipartisan group of Senators, with a \ndiverse set of perspectives and opinions, transforms the \nrecommendations of this group into the declared policy of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  This bill offers our best chance to forge a change of direction at \nlong last in Iraq and to do so in a fashion that, indeed, brings our \nNation together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join my colleagues this morning \nespecially in thanking and congratulating the Senator from Colorado and \nthe Senator from Tennessee for bringing forward this approach. There is \nno question but that we are going to begin disengaging from Iraq. The \nquestion is: Is that disengagement going to be done in a manner which \nstrengthens our security as a nation or is it going to be done in a \nmanner which undermines our security as a nation? Are we going to leave \nan Iraq which is stable enough to govern itself and maintain its own \nsecurity and have a government that functions or are we going to leave \nan Iraq which becomes divided into warring factions which may lead to \nliterally a genocidal event with an element of the country which is a \nclient state for Iraq, an element of the country which is a safe haven \nfor al-Qaida, and an element of the country which is perceived as a \nthreat to Turkey?\n  Clearly, we cannot precipitously abandon the people of Iraq or our \nown national interests in having a stable Iraq. So we need to look for \na process which is going to allow us to proceed in an orderly way and \nin a way which, hopefully, can start to bring our own Nation together \nas we try to address this most difficult issue.\n  Looking to the proposal of the Iraq Study Group is, in my opinion, \nthe appropriate way to proceed. It is interesting that today we are \ngoing to see, I believe, the passage of a supplemental bill which will \nfund our soldiers in the field, which we absolutely have an obligation \nto do, which, after a lot of pulling and tugging and different ideas \nbeing put on the table, has reached a position which, hopefully, will \nhave a consensus vote and will represent a majority which will be able \nto pass that bill and, thus, fund the soldiers in the field in a manner \nwhich has both sides working together, the Democratic leader having \nendorsed the language and the President having endorsed the language.\n  But this agreement today which has in it the Warner language, which I \nsupported, is a precursor to the next step, and the next step should be \na broader coalition within our political process of developing a plan \nfor disengagement from Iraq that assures the security of the United \nStates and the stability of that country. Thus, I think the step which \nis being proposed today by the Senator from Colorado and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and is supported by the Senator from Pennsylvania, the \nSenator from Arkansas, the Senator from Utah, and myself is an effort \nto set out a blueprint or a path which we can, hopefully, follow in a \nbipartisan way as we proceed down this road.\n  The Iraq Study Group did this country an enormous service--former \nCongressman Hamilton and former Secretary of State Baker--in \nextensively\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nstudying the issue and coming back with very concrete and specific \nproposals as to how we can, hopefully, effectively deal with settling \nthe Iraq situation.\n  I congratulate both of these Senators for this initiative. I am happy \nto join in it. I look forward to it being the template upon which we \nbuild a broader coalition which I hope will be bipartisan and which I \nhope can settle a little of the differences which are so dividing our \nNation and which will give not only the Iraqi people the opportunity to \nhave a surviving, stable government, but will give ourselves the \ndirection we need to assure our safety as we move forward in this very \nperilous time confronting terrorists who wish to do us harm.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. \nI can think of no two Senators on our side of the aisle whose words are \nlistened to more carefully and more respectfully than the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and the Senator from Utah. I salute the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his statement and leadership, and the Senator from \nArkansas, who spoke so constructively, and especially the Senator from \nColorado, who is the principal sponsor of this legislation and whom I \nam proud to join.\n  Senator Pryor is exactly right when he said this morning that it is \ntime for us to stop having partisan votes on Iraq. If I were an \nAmerican fighting in Iraq, I would be looking back at us and wondering: \nWhat are they doing in Washington, DC, arguing and sniping at each \nother while we are fighting and dying? I would be thinking: If they are \ngoing to send us to Iraq to do a job, at least they could agree on what \nthe job is.\n  We owe it to our troops and to our country to find a bipartisan \nconsensus to support where we go from here in Iraq. We need a political \nsolution in Washington, DC, as much as we need a political solution in \nBaghdad.\n  The announcements today by four more Senators, each well respected--\nSenators Pryor, Bennett, Casey, Gregg--suggests the recommendations of \nthe Iraq Study Group is the way to do that. Three Republicans, three \nDemocrats from the North, South, East, and West, some relatively new \nSenators, some who have been here a long time, fresh voices, a fresh \napproach for a fresh attitude for this debate. Before the end of the \nweek, I believe there will be two more Senators--one Democrat, one \nRepublican. Then in June when we return to Washington, the six or the \neight of us intend to offer the legislation Senator Salazar and I have \ndrafted to implement the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study \nGroup.\n  Today we are only six, perhaps eight--a modest beginning. But even we \nsix or eight are a more promising bipartisan framework of support for a \nnew direction in Iraq than we have seen for some time in the Senate. \nThose who know the Senate know we usually do our best and most \nconstructive work when a handful of Senators cross party lines to take \na fresh look at a problem, embrace a new strategy, and try to do what \nis right for our country.\n  We are not going to put hundreds of thousands of American troops into \nIraq. We are not going to get out of Iraq tomorrow, and the current \nsurge of troops in Baghdad, which we all hope is successful, is not by \nitself a strategy for tomorrow. The Iraq Study Group report is a \nstrategy for tomorrow. It will get the United States out of the combat \nbusiness in Iraq and into the support, equipment, and the training \nbusiness in a prompt and honorable way. It will reduce the number of \ntroops in Iraq. Those who stay will be less in harm's way--in more \nsecure bases, embedded with Iraqi forces. Special forces will stay to \ncounter al-Qaida. The report says this could--not must but could--\nhappen in early 2008, depending on circumstances.\n\n  The report allows support for General Petraeus and his troops by \nspecifically authorizing a surge, such as the current surge. Because \nthere would still be a significant long-term presence in Iraq, it will \nsignal to the rest of the Middle East to stay out of Iraq.\n  It aggressively encourages diplomatic efforts. The President of the \nUnited States has spoken well of this report recently, and embraced \nparts of it, but it is not his plan. The Democratic majority has \nborrowed parts of the Iraq Study Group report, but it is not the \nDemocratic majority plan. That is why the report has a chance to work. \nIt has the seeds of a bipartisan consensus.\n  We six or eight, or hopefully more, will introduce our legislation in \nJune, making the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group the policy of \nour country and inviting the President to submit a plan based upon \nthose recommendations. I hope President Bush will embrace this \nstrategy. I hope more Senators will.\n  It is ironic for the oldest democracy, the United States, to be \nlecturing the youngest democracy, Iraq, about coming up with a \npolitical consensus when we, ourselves, can't come up with one. This is \nthe foremost issue facing our country. The Iraq Study Group report is \nthe most promising strategy for a solution: getting out of the combat \nbusiness in Iraq and into the support, equipping, and training business \nin a prompt and honorable way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise this morning, first of all, to \ncongratulate my colleagues. Senator Alexander has worked tirelessly \nwith us in putting together the legislation on the implementation of \nthe Iraq Study Group recommendations. He has been a key leader in \ntrying to pull a group of us together to try to develop a new direction \ngoing forward in Iraq. I thank him for his leadership.\n  I also wish to thank both Senator Pryor and Senator Casey for joining \nus as cosponsors of this legislation. They are people who are trying to \nsearch for a solution on the Democratic side, and I very much \nappreciate their efforts. As for Senator Gregg and Senator Bennett, I \nappreciate also their statements, their cosponsorship of this \nlegislation, and their desire to come forward to a solution that might \nunite us in the Senate on a way forward.\n  Let me say at the outset that when we think about what it is we are \ntrying to do with respect to Iraq at this point in time, we have a lot \nof people who are looking backward and saying there are lots of \nproblems, lots of failures that have happened--from prewar \nintelligence, to decisions going into Iraq, to the prosecution of the \nwar, et cetera--but the fact is we are there now. The fact is, we have \n140,000 American troops on the ground in Iraq today. So the real \nquestion for us ought to be, as the Congress, how it is we are going to \nmove forward together.\n  I think in the broadest sense there is not a disagreement on what it \nis we want. What is the end stake for us in Iraq? We want to bring our \ntroops home. I think we all would like to have our troops back home, \nreunited with their families and out of harm's way. That is the goal we \nwant to get to. The second goal we want to get to is a stable Iraq and \na stable Middle East. The fact is, Iraq does not stand alone. It is in \na sea of very difficult political turmoil at this point in time. So we \nwant us to have success in Iraq.\n  There has been a lot of debate about what it is we ought to have been \ndoing in Iraq over the last several years. But the only group that has \ntaken a significant amount of time and thought through the best way \nforward in Iraq was the Iraq Study Group. It was this bipartisan group \nof leaders, led by former Secretary of State James Baker and \nCongressman Hamilton, as cochairs of a bipartisan commission of elder \nstates men and women, that came up with the most thoughtful, \ncomprehensive approach on the way forward.\n  The essence of what that report said is that the Iraqi Government has \na responsibility to move forward and to meet the milestones that are \nset forth for success in that report. It says: If you do that, Iraqi \nGovernment, we, the United States, are going to be there to help you. \nOn the other hand, if you don't do that, we, the United States, are \ngoing to reduce our help to you. It is an effort to put pressure on the \nIraqi Government and the Iraqi people to\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\ndeal with the sectarian violence they have in place and to move forward \nin a fashion that will create stability in Iraq.\n  I am hopeful, as we move forward from this day, and by the time we \ncome back from the Memorial Day break, that besides the six Senators \nwho have joined as cosponsors of this legislation, we will have \nadditional cosponsors. At the end of the day, it seems to me that we, \nas the Congress, have a responsibility to the men and women who are on \nthe ground in Iraq to try to find a common way forward.\n  On the issue of war and peace, there should not be a Republican and \nDemocratic divide. What we ought to be doing is trying to find a common \nway forward where we can bring Democrats and Republicans together to an \nunderstanding of how we will ultimately achieve success in Iraq and \nbring our troops home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from \nTennessee, Senator Alexander.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6581-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6581-S6582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I return to the floor to continue my \nseries of remarks on health care reform.\n  As I have said, I recognize the difficulty of figuring out a better \nway to finance our health care system, a better way than part employer \ninsured, part Government insured, and part uninsured. I am committed to \nworking to achieve universal coverage for all Americans, but we have to \nrecognize also that the underlying health care system itself is broken. \nIt is broken in the way it delivers and pays for care, it creates \nmassive costs and poor health outcomes, and those massive costs and \npoor health outcomes make the financing and access problems actually \nharder to solve. So I wish to focus now on system reform to give us a \nbetter operating health care system.\n  We have to start by recognizing that America's health care \ninformation technology is decades behind where it could be. The \nEconomist magazine has described it as the worst in any American \nindustry except one--the mining industry. As a result, we are losing \nbillions and billions of dollars to waste, to inefficiency, and to poor \nquality care. Ultimately, and tragically, lives are lost to preventable \nmedical errors because health care providers do not have adequate \ndecision support for their decisions on treatment, medication, and \nother care.\n  Let us stop on the financial question for a moment. Some pretty \nrespectable groups have looked at health information technology to see \nwhat they think it would save in health care costs, and here is what \nthey report: RAND Corporation, $81 billion, conservatively, every year; \nDavid Brailer, former National Coordinator for Health Information \nTechnology, $100 billion every year; and the Center for Information \nTechnology Leadership, $77 billion every year. If you average the \nthree, you get $86 billion a year. For RAND, the number I quoted was a \nconservative number. Their high-end estimate was a savings of $346 \nbillion a year. So there is a huge amount of money at stake.\n  The question is: Are we making the investments we need to capture \nthese savings? Well, say you are a CEO, and one of your division heads \ncomes to you with a proposed investment to reduce production costs in \nyour facility by $81 billion a year. How much would you authorize her \nto spend to achieve those savings? I suspect it would be quite a lot of \nmoney. Well, here is what we authorized ONCHIT to spend this year--the \nOffice of National Coordinator of Health Information Technology. This \nCongress authorized $118 million. That is about 14 hours' worth of the \n$81 billion in annual savings conservatively estimated by RAND. Would \nit not be worth spending more to capture those savings?\n  You say, well, maybe the private sector will spend it for us. But \nlook at the way our complex health care sector is divided into doctors, \nhospitals, insurers, employers, nurses, patients, and more. Which group \ndo you expect to make the decisions about a national health information \ntechnology system? And they are not homogenous groups. Whom within them \ndo you expect to make decisions about a national health information \ntechnology system?\n  Go back to imagining that you are a CEO. You want to install an IT \nsystem in your corporation. Your corporation has five major operating \ndivisions. Would you pursue your corporate IT solution by waiting for \neach division to try to build the entire corporate IT system, without \neven talking to each other? Of course not. It would be a ridiculous \nstrategy. None of your divisions would want to go first. Each division \nwould like to wait and be a free rider on the investment of another \ndivision. Each one would face what I call the ``Betamax risk,'' that \nthey will invest in a technology that proves not to be the winning \ntechnology, and each would have to figure out how to pay for the \nsystem, the whole system, out of only its own share of the gains. The \nresult is the capital would not flow efficiently.\n  This pretty well describes where we are in America on health \ninformation technology. So here, in Washington, we have a job to do. \nFirst, we have to set some ground rules. In the old days, when our \nNation was building railroads, the Government had a simple job to do: \nIt had to set the requirements for how far apart the rails were going \nto be. That way a boxcar loading in San Francisco could get to \nProvidence, RI, and know it could travel the whole way on even rails. \nThe development of the rail system would never have happened without \nthose ground rules.\n  In health information technology, there are ground rules we need to \ndecide on, too, to get this moving--rules for interoperability among \nsystems, rules for confidentiality and security of data, rules for the \ncontent of an electronic health record. All of that is the job of \nGovernment to organize.\n  The second job is to get adequate capital into the market. Software \ncosts money. Hardware costs money. Entering data costs money. Most \nimportant, the disruption to the work flow of hospitals and doctors \ncosts time and money, and it takes time and attention away from \npatients. So developing adequate health information technology is not \ngoing to be easy or cheap. But for savings of $81 billion a year, maybe \n$346 billion a year, it is worth a big effort.\n  So how do we get that capital flowing? Well, one could argue the way \nto solve this is to treat the health information highway similar to the \nFederal highway system--a common good that we pay for with tax dollars \nbecause it is so valuable to the economy to get goods cheaply and \nreliably from point A to point B. So maybe we should pay for this \nthrough taxes, similar to the national highway system. But a highway is \npretty simple technology. Because the health information network is so \nmuch more complex, and because I think we need a lot more market forces \nat work and a lot more initiative and profit motive than the Federal \nhighway funding model provides, I looked around for another model, a \nmodel that provides the central decisionmaking that is required to get \nthe boxcars rolling, a model that provides access to capital, and a \nmodel that captures the vibrancy of the private sector.\n\n  I found one. We have actually been here before, or pretty close \nanyway. There was, some time ago, a new technology. Similar to health \ninformation technology, it would transform an industry; similar to \nhealth information technology, it would lower costs and expand service; \nsimilar to health information technology, it was a win-win situation \nfor business and for consumers.\n  But the technology was, like health information technology, stuck in \na political and economic traffic jam.\n  Our President at the time came up with the solution. The technology \nwas communications satellites. The President was John F. Kennedy. The \nsolution was COMSAT.\n  The COMSAT legislation broke the logjam. The COMSAT legislation \ncreated a publicly chartered corporation with a private board that \nraised the capital, launched the satellites, was profitable and \nsuccessful for decades, and eventually merged into Lockheed-Martin--a \ntrue public-private success story.\n  My proposal, in a nutshell, is to create a not-for-profit, modern \nCOMSAT for health information technology. Because of the complexity of \nthe health care information puzzle, legislation is\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\ntoo blunt an instrument to drive the details. But an organization like \nthis can be flexible enough to meet market demands and can maintain the \nexpertise to develop the details as the plan develops. American leaders \ncould be recruited from the private sector to lead this board--CEOs \nfrom the IT sector, America's top retailers, manufacturers, and service \nproviders; the champions of health information technology in the \nmedical community; enlightened consumers and labor representatives.\n  I ask my colleagues to think of the caliber of just a few of \nAmerica's leaders who have spoken to them about this issue, or spoken \nout publicly: Andy Stern at SEIU, Jim Donald at Starbucks, John \nChambers at Cisco, or Lee Scott at Wal-Mart.\n  In conclusion, enormous cost savings, new technological horizons, \nempowerment of patients, better quality of care, more convenience and \nefficiency, and lives saved by improved information, error reduction, \nand decision support--what a rich area this opens up for American \ntechnological companies, for American health care providers, for \nAmerican patients, and for American manufacturers now drowning under \nhealth care costs, if only we can break the logjam blocking this future \nnow.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider seriously my legislation, \nproposing a nonprofit, privately led corporation that will help open \nthe doors to that future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today is going to be a day of great \nimportance to America. We are going to be voting on the supplemental \nbill to fund the surge and the number of soldiers on duty in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. But last night we learned the body of one of the missing \nsoldiers in Iraq was found. Despite our prayers, he was dead. We were \ninformed that the body of Joseph Anzack, Jr., was pulled from the \nEuphrates River south of Baghdad.\n  On May 12, he and two of his colleagues went missing after they were \nambushed by insurgents. How did the capture of three Americans take \nplace? Are we short of troops to back them up or is it so dangerous we \njust can't overcome the odds we face?\n  All of America is hoping and praying, as we keep these other two \nsoldiers in our hearts and our minds, that they will be found alive by \nthe troops searching for them.\n  One of the soldiers searching for their two colleagues said something \nto the Associated Press. I quote him here.\n\n       It just angers me that it's just another friend that I've \n     got to lose and deal with, because I've already lost 13 \n     friends since I've been here and I don't know if I can take \n     it anymore.\n\n  Much of America feels the same way. Outside of my office in \nWashington we have a tribute called ``The Faces of the Fallen.'' \nVisitors from across the country have stopped by this memorial--\npictures of those who perished. I encourage my colleagues to come and \nsee these photographs displayed on placards on the third floor of the \nHart Building.\n  Since the beginning of May, and we are now at the 24th of May, the \nPentagon has announced the deaths of 75 of our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan coming from thirty-one different states.

Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  I rise today to express my disappointment, both in the final version \nof the supplemental spending bill that we expect to consider today, and \nin the process that led to this badly flawed bill. Those two concerns \nare linked because the flawed procedure the Senate adopted when we \npassed a sham supplemental bill last week, without debate or \namendments, helped grease the wheels for a final bill that contains no\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\nbinding language on redeployment. While our brave troops are stuck in \nthe middle of a civil war in Iraq, we have a bill with political \nbenchmarks that lack meaningful consequences if they are not reached.\n  Legislation as important as this funding bill should have been openly \nconsidered in this body. I am talking about an open and on-the-record \ndebate with amendments offered and voted upon. That is the way the \nSenate is supposed to operate. I shared the desire of my colleagues to \npass this important bill as quickly as possible, but that was no excuse \nfor us avoiding our responsibilities as legislators. Unquestionably, it \nwas easier and faster for us to send a place holder bill back to the \nHouse. By doing that, the real work could be done behind closed doors \nwhere all kinds of horse trading can occur and decisions are unknown \nuntil the final deal is sealed. That process makes it a lot easier for \nmost Members of Congress to avoid responsibility for the final \noutcome--we didn't have to cast any votes or make any difficult \ndecisions. In short, we didn't have to do any legislating.\n  Now that we face a badly flawed, take-it-or-leave-it bill, we can \nsimply shrug, apparently, and tell our constituents we did the best we \ncould. That is not good enough, not when we are talking about the most \npressing issue facing this country.\n  In the 5 months we have been in control of Congress, a unified \nDemocratic caucus, with the help of some Republicans, has made great \nstrides toward changing the course in Iraq. We were able to pass the \nfirst supplemental bill, supported by a majority of the Senate, that \nrequired the phased redeployment of our troops to begin in 120 days.\n  Last week, a majority of Democrats supported ending the current open-\nended mission by March 31, 2008. It has been almost 1 year since 13 \nSenators supported the proposal I offered with Senator Kerry that would \nhave brought our troops out of Iraq by this summer. Now, 29 Senators \nsupport an even stronger measure, enforced by Congress's power of the \npurse, to safely redeploy our troops.\n  Unfortunately, after that strong vote, we are now moving backward. \nInstead of forcing the President to safely redeploy our troops, instead \nof coming up with a strategy providing assistance to a postredeployment \nIraq, and instead of a renewed focus on the global fight against al-\nQaida, we are faced with a spending bill that just kicks the can down \nthe road and buys the administration time.\n  But why, I ask you, would we buy the administration more time? Why \nshould we wait any longer? Since the war began in March 2003, we have \nlost more than 3,420 Americans, with over 71 killed since the beginning \nof this month. Last month, we lost over 100 Americans. Last weekend, \nthe media reported that 24 bodies were found lying in the streets of \nBaghdad, all of whom had been killed execution style. Nineteen of them \nwere found within parts of the city where the troops have ``surged.''\n  The administration's policy is clearly untenable. The American people \nknow that, which is why they voted the way they did in November. They \nwant us out of Iraq, and they want us out now. They don't want to give \nthe so-called surge time. They don't want to pass this problem off to \nanother President and another Congress. And they sure don't want \nanother American servicemember to die or lose a limb while elected \nrepresentatives put their own political comfort over the wishes of \ntheir constituents.\n  It was bad enough to have the President again disregard the American \npeople by escalating our involvement in Iraq. Now, too, Congress seems \nto be ignoring the will of the American people. If the American people \ncannot count on the leaders they elected to listen to them and to act \non their demands, then something is seriously wrong with our political \ninstitutions or with the people who currently occupy those \ninstitutions.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the weak supplemental conference \nreport and to stand strong as we tell the administration it is time to \nend the war that is draining our resources, straining our military, and \nundermining our national security.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama).

The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1158\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I would like to start this morning's \ndebate on immigration by speaking to two of the pending amendments that \nare before the Senate. First, I would like to speak toward the Coleman \namendment.\n  Under Senator Coleman's amendment, he would, in essence, undermine \nthe rights of States and local municipalities which have instructed \ntheir police, health, and safety workers from inquiring about the \nimmigration status of those they serve in order to protect the health \nand safety and promote the general welfare of the community.\n  As Ronald Reagan said: Here we go again. Over the last several years, \nparticularly in the House of Representatives, there have been different \npieces of legislation and amendments offered and debated that would \ndeputize State and local police to enforce what is, in essence, Federal \ncivil immigration law. The Coleman-Bond amendment would effectively \nprohibit State and local Government policies that seek to encourage \ncrime reporting and witness cooperation by reassuring immigrant victims \nthat police and other government officials will not inquire into their \nstatus.\n  So the amendment would send a mandate from Washington that would end \nState and local policies that prevent their employees, including police \nand health and safety workers, from inquiring about the immigration \nstatus of those they serve if there is ``probable cause''--probable \ncause; exactly what standard we are going to use for that is still, in \nmy mind, not quite defined--to believe the individual being questioned \nis undocumented.\n  Now, I have talked to some of the toughest law enforcement people \nacross the country. Many cities, counties, and police departments \naround the country have decided that it is a matter of public health \nand safety not to ask, not to ask about the immigration status of \npeople when they report crimes or have been the victims of domestic \nabuse or go to the hospital seeking emergency medical care.\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\n  Currently, scores of cities and States across the Nation have such \nconfidentiality policies in place, some upwards of 20 years of having \nsuch policies in place. The point of these policies is to make sure \nimmigrants report crimes and information to police and do not stay \nsilent for fear that their immigrant status or that of a loved one \ncould come under scrutiny if they contact the authorities.\n  Information is one of the most powerful tools law enforcement has to \nprosecute individuals in the course of a crime, to know who the \nperpetrator was, to know who was in the gang activity, to know who is \nthe drug dealer. Think of the potential chilling effect this amendment \ncould have on the willingness and ability of immigrant crime victims \nand witnesses, those who have been victims of domestic abuse, and those \nwho may need emergency health care to turn for assistance if they \nfeared that deportation rather than receiving assistance would result. \nThat is why cities and States have passed local laws and set policies \nlimiting when police and city and county employees can ask people to \nprove their immigration status.\n  States and local police have long sought to separate their activities \nfrom those of the Federal immigration agents in order to enhance public \nsafety. Now, why do States and local law enforcement entities do that? \nWhy is that? Because when immigrant community residents begin to see \nState and local police as deportation agents, they stop reporting \ncrimes and assisting in investigations. It undermines the trust and \ncooperation with immigrant communities that are essential elements of \ncommunity-oriented policing.\n  There are numerous examples of police opposing such efforts. In fact, \nin 2005, Princeton, NJ, police chief Anthony Federico said:\n\n       Local police agencies depend on the cooperation of \n     immigrants, legal and illegal, in solving all sorts of crimes \n     and in the maintenance of public order. Without assurances \n     that they will not be subject to an immigration investigation \n     and possible deportation, many immigrants with critical \n     information would not come forward, even when heinous crimes \n     are committed against them or their families.\n\n  So those who are entrusted to protect us understand that the \nrelationship of trust built with the immigrant community would be \nruined overnight if this provision becomes law.\n  This amendment would also cause millions of people in this country, \nnot just immigrants--not just immigrants--to think twice about getting \nthe medical treatment they need. Why would we discourage individuals \nfrom receiving medical care? Let's think about the possible \nconsequences for a second. You are rolled into an emergency room, and \nyou do not have insurance. Would there be ``probable cause'' to be \nasked whether you are here legally in the United States?\n  Assume I get rolled into an emergency room ``Mr. Menendez'' or maybe \nsomeone who might even be described as more characteristically Hispanic \nor maybe Asian or some other group, and I do not happen to have \ninsurance, as, unfortunately, 40 million Americans who are here as U.S. \ncitizens do not have, and in that moment, I am asked whether I am an \nAmerican citizen. That would be shameful. You would not ask any other \ncitizen that. But what you create under these sets of circumstances is \nthe opportunity for law enforcement, for health officials, for \nemergency management officials to begin to ask the questions. And under \nwhat probable cause? The way someone looks? The accent with which they \nspeak? The surname? Under what probable cause? Under what probable \ncause? The misfortune of not having health insurance? Is that an \nindicator that you are likely not here in a documented fashion, those \nwho look a certain way?\n  This amendment can clearly also encourage racial profiling. People \nwho look or sound foreign would be the ones whose citizenship or \nimmigration status will be questioned. Under this amendment, we are \nasking public hospital workers, teachers, police, social workers, and \nall public employees to decide where there is probable cause to believe \nsomeone does not have lawful immigration status. That means treating \nanyone who looks or sounds foreign with suspicion. In my mind, that is \njust plain wrong.\n  One could argue that the Coleman amendment is a coercive action \nagainst any State, municipality, or other entity to say to that State, \nmunicipality, or other entity that they must do a series of things, \nsuch as obtaining information on a person's status, like my own, which \nI was born in this country. So much for States rights. So much for the \nlocal municipalities know best. For 15 years in the Congress, I have \nlistened to my Republican colleagues speaking of States rights, of \nlocal rules, of States knowing best. But I guess they do not know best \nwhen it comes to the law enforcement of their own communities.\n  We don't need a provision such as this. Current law already provides \nample opportunity--ample opportunity--for State and local police to \nassist Federal immigration agents in enforcing the laws against \ncriminals and terrorists. What they cannot do is start asking everyone \nthey come across for their ``papers.'' ``Let me see your papers.''\n  States and localities that do want to take on a broader role in \nimmigration enforcement can enter into a memorandum of understanding \nwith ICE, receive training in immigration law, and assist in \nenforcement operations under Immigration's supervision. That already \nexists in the law, and there are communities which have chosen to do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would create fear in entire \ncommunities, would inevitably deter not only undocumented immigrants \nbut legal immigrants and citizens from not being subject to being \nprosecuted simply because of who they are, what they look like, how \nthey sound, what their surname is, because God knows what the probable \ncause is.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I don't think that is the America we want.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just wonder if the Senator would yield on this point \nbecause this is extremely important. This is about American citizens \ntoo. There are individuals who go to a hospital, people who take their \nchildren to school for vaccinations, and this has the language that if \nan official has probable cause to believe they are undocumented, they \ncan question that individual.\n  Suppose they question them before they treat them? The way I look at \nit and read that, this could be an American who goes in, an American \ncitizen goes in, and for some reason, some attendant says: Well, I have \nreason to believe this is undocumented, let's see all of your papers, \nwhile the person is either trying to be attended to, with a serious \ninjury, or trying to get their child immunized to protect not only that \nchild but other children in the classroom. How in the world are they \ngoing to be able to do that without opening up a whole system of \nprofiling in this country?\n  I maintain that we have very strong border security and we have very \nstrong provisions in here in terms of employment security, to try to \nmake sure we are going to have the right people who are going to be \nable to work here and we are going to know who is going to be able to \ncome into the United States. But this here really seems to me to be \nendangering American citizens in a very important way. I was just \nwondering if the Senator might comment on that.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, I appreciate the question and the Senator's \nobservations. The Senator is absolutely right. Actually, this makes \nhospital workers enforcement workers. This makes your local volunteer \nambulance corps an agent because a municipality may say: We don't want \nyou to ask that question; we want you to deal with the lifesaving \nmoment that is before your hands.\n  As a matter of fact, let's think about an outbreak of disease. We \nhave an outbreak at a hospital. Do you not want that individual to be \nable to go and be treated and contain the outbreak? No, let's find out \nwhat their status is. If you happen to have a surname that is what we \nconceptualize as undocumented, or if you don't have command of the \nEnglish language in a powerful way, we conceptualize that you must be \nundocumented. If you don't have insurance, that must be an indicator of \nprobable cause, even though there are 40 million U.S. citizens who \ndon't have\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nit. Clearly, this turns people who have professed to protect, to \ndefend, and to provide health care into agents against their will. That \nis why municipalities and States have chosen a different course. They \nunderstand better. That is why I certainly urge a strong ``no'' vote on \nthe Coleman amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1184\n\n  I wish to turn to another amendment pending before the Senate, the \nCornyn amendment. I will talk about some elements of this to give our \ncolleagues in the Senate a taste of what is here. This is far from a \ntechnical amendment. It has very substantive consequences, if it were \nto be adopted. It actually undermines the ``grand bargain'' that I \nunderstood was struck. Let me give one of the examples of how it \nundermines the ``grand bargain.'' A provision of the Cornyn amendment \nadds new grounds of deportability for convictions relating to Social \nSecurity account numbers or Social Security cards and relating to \nidentity fraud. As with virtually all of the other provisions in his \namendment, this suspension is retroactive. So upon passage of this \nbill, if it were to become law, these new offenses would go backward, \nwould become retroactive, so that the acts that occurred before the \ndate of enactment would become grounds for removal. If part of the goal \nis to bring those in the shadows into the light and to apply for a \nprogram, you would have huge numbers of people who would in essence be \ncaught by this provision in a way that would never allow the earned \nlegalization aspect of what is being offered as a real possibility for \nthem. It would undermine the very essence of the ``grand bargain.'' \nSignificantly, this provision would place individuals applying for \nlegalization in a catch-22 situation. We want them to come forward and \nregister because we want to know who is here pursuing the American \ndream versus who is here to destroy it. Yet if they admit to having \nused a false Social Security card to work in the United States, only to \nbe prosecuted by a U.S. Attorney or one working in concert with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to selectively target certain \napplicants, that individual's ultimate prosecution changes to a removal \nbecause of conduct that occurred prior to the enactment, conduct that \nwas fundamentally incident to his or her undocumented status.\n  The potential impact of making literally thousands and thousands of \nundocumented workers subject to these provisions would in essence \nnullify the very essence of the earned legalization aspect of the \n``grand bargain.'' We know that because of the failed employer \nsanctions, which this bill undoes and makes sure we have the right type \nof employer verification and the right type of sanctions and the right \ntype of enforcement, undocumented workers have moved consistently in \norder to earn a livelihood and support their families in a way that \nwould be undermined by this amendment. Given ICE'S new interior \nenforcement strategy, it seems to me what we will see is the rounding \nup of thousands of undocumented workers during worksite enforcement \nactions while we are supposedly waiting for the triggers which we \nenhanced yesterday. We made those even more difficult, which means it \nisn't going to be 18 months for those triggers to take place, it is \ngoing to be a lot more time, if this is what ends up being the final \nbill.\n  In that effort, we are going to have individuals who ultimately are \nnot going to be subject to the opportunities we supposedly say are a \npathway to earn legalization as part of the overall solution to our \nproblem. Because the amendment is retroactive, and retroactivity as a \nprovision of law is something we generally have disdain for, it would \napply even to those applying for admission after the date of enactment. \nClearly, it puts in jeopardy the total element of the legalization \nprocess.\n  Secondly, to address a different provision of the Cornyn amendment, \nit permits secret evidence to be used against an individual without any \nopportunity for it to be reviewed. This amendment gives the Attorney \nGeneral--and we have seen of late what is capable out of the Justice \nDepartment--unreviewable discretion to use secret evidence to determine \nif an alien is ``described in''--not guilty of anything, but just \ndescribed in--the national security exclusions within the immigration \nlaw. A person applying for naturalization could have her application \ndenied and she would never know the reason for that denial, never have \na chance to appeal and prove it was wrong.\n  If a lawful permanent resident already, somebody who followed the \nrules, obeyed the law, waited, came in, now a lawful permanent \nresident, maybe even serving their country, was giving money to tsunami \nrelief and accidentally that money went to a charity controlled, for \nexample, by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, that person could be denied \ncitizenship on the basis of secret evidence, and there would be no \nreview in the courts. In sum, it allows deportation based upon \nunreviewable determinations by the executive branch, determinations \nthat can be based on secret evidence that the person cannot even see, \nlet alone challenge.\n\n  All of these provisions are retroactive. Retroactivity is \nantithetical to core American values. What could be more unfair than \nchanging the rules in the middle of the game. That is why it is \nunconstitutional in criminal law and strongly objectionable in a \ncontext like immigration law, where such changes can have profound, \nlife-altering consequences. Why would we want to repeat the mistakes of \npast immigration reform? Retroactivity in that law led to incredible \nhardship and had the most strident immigration hardliners questioning \nwhether the law had gone too far. Retroactivity was eliminated from all \nof those provisions during Judiciary Committee markup in past \nlegislation, but now it emerges again.\n  We can be tough. We can be smart. The underlying substitute does so \nmuch to move us forward in this regard. But at the end of the day, let \nus not undermine the very essence of the constitutional guarantees that \nhave been upheld by the courts--of judicial review, of due process, \nwhich makes America worthy of fighting for and dying for, the \nConstitution, the Bill of Rights that enshrines those essential rights \nand guarantees them to all of us, for its enforcement that makes us so \ndifferent than so much of the rest of the world. We are moving in this \nbill, by a series of amendments--some that would have been adopted and \nsome that are already pending and others I fear may come--into a state \nin which that is continuously eroded to great alarm. I hope the Senate \nwill reject these because in terms of their pursuit and enforceability, \nat the end of the day, they will become real challenges.\n  We are going to overturn States and municipalities. We will make them \nenforce them. Will there be penalties against States and municipalities \nthat have a different view of public safety? Secret evidence, is that \nthe new standard for us, secret evidence that is not subject to review, \nnot subject to be contested? What are we going to permit now? \nRetroactivity as a rule of law for the United States? You never know \nwhat you did before may have been right or wrong. That is the essence \nof why we don't like retroactivity. We tell people: This is the law, \nfollow this law. We expect them to do it. But we also don't change it \non them by passing a new law and saying: By the way, that was wrong, \nyou couldn't do that, even though we told you you could, but \nretroactively we changed it; now we catch you in a set of circumstances \nin which you have committed a crime. That is why we don't do that \ngenerally in the law. That is why the Cornyn amendment should be \ndefeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from New \nJersey for his comments, both on the Coleman amendment and the Cornyn \namendment.\n  To remind our colleagues, we intend to have votes starting at 12:15. \nYesterday we had some success on a number of different amendments. We \nhave a number here which we expect votes on through the afternoon. We \nwill have a full morning and afternoon.\n  With regard to the Coleman amendment, because the American people \nobviously are concerned about security, we are concerned about security \nfrom terrorism. We are concerned as well about security from \nbioterrorism or from the dangers of nuclear weapons. We have heard \nthose words. We have\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\ntaken action on many of them. We still have much to do. But we have in \nthis legislation taken a number of very important steps with regard to \nsecurity. It is important to understand what has been done in this \nlegislation in terms of security and how the Coleman amendment fails to \nmeet the test. In a number of areas, it probably endangers our \nsecurity. It does so with regard to health care, education. It may even \nin other areas as well.\n  In this legislation, we are doubling the Border Patrol. We are \ncreating a new electronic eligibility verification system, increasing \npenalties on noncompliant employers by a factor of 20. We are \nincreasing detention space and requiring more detention of undocumented \nimmigrants, pending adjudication of their cases. We are expanding the \ndefinition of aggravated felony to encompass a wider array of offenses. \nWe are increasing the penalties related to gang violence, illegal \nentry, and illegal reentry. We are increasing penalties related to \ndocument and passport fraud. The list goes on. The question is, does \nthis amendment add to our security, or does it make us more vulnerable \nto a public health crisis, more vulnerable to crime, terrorist attack, \nand less competitive?\n  What we are basically doing with the Coleman amendment is saying to \nany teacher, any doctor, any nurse, any public official, if they \nbelieve they have probable cause--and we have to understand what that \nmeans in terms of the individual, how they are going to know there is \nprobable cause--then they can test the individual that is before them \nto find out whether they are undocumented, whether they are legal, or \nwhether they are an American.\n  Let's take an example. Tuberculosis, which we have seen grow \ndramatically over the last 3 years for a number of different reasons--\n71 percent of those who have tuberculosis are foreign. But in order to \nprotect American children from tuberculosis, we need to screen and \nprotect those who have tuberculosis; otherwise, we will find the \ntuberculosis is going to spread.\n  Well, what are we going to do? What is important is that if we find \nout a person comes in and the family has tuberculosis and the \nindividual says: Well, I am not sure I am going to treat you because I \nam not sure you are an American citizen or if you are undocumented or \nif your papers are right, so I am not sure we are going to treat you, \nand that family has tuberculosis, the child goes into a classroom with \na communicable disease and infects a number of American children? This \nis the typical kind of challenge.\n  On immunization: Immunization is down in this country dramatically. \nWhat happens? We know when we do not immunize the children, they become \nmore vulnerable to disease. Maybe these children are going to go into \nthe public school system and are going to spread that disease. Isn't it \nbetter to make sure they are going to get the immunization? Or are we \ngoing to say to the medical professionals: Well, I think that person is \nundocumented. I think they may be illegal. Sure, they have papers. They \nlook OK. But I am not sure they are OK, so therefore I am not going to \ntreat them.\n  This is false security. We have tough security in the bill.\n  What are we going to say in the situation where we have battered \nwomen--which is taking place today in too many communities across this \ncountry? It is a reality. We might not like it, but it is a reality, \nand many of the people who are being battered happen to be immigrants, \nundocumented individuals. What are they going to do after they are \ngetting beaten and beaten and beaten and they go on in to try to get \nsome medical care? Oh, no. Well, you are undocumented, so we are going \nto report you for deportation. Report to deport. That is the Coleman \namendment: Report to deport--trying, in these situations, to meet the \nimmediate needs.\n  What is going to happen to the migrant, the undocumented, who sees a \ncrime, knows the people, is prepared to make sure the gangs who are \ndistributing drugs--they are a witness to a crime in the community and \nthey go down to the police department and the first thing the police \nofficer says is: Well, you look like you are undocumented. Let's see \nyour papers, and they arrest the person, rather than solving the crime, \nrather than stopping the gang.\n  So this is, I think, false security and unnecessary. We will have a \nchance to address that. As we mentioned earlier, the amendment would \nprevent the local governments from having the flexibility to reassure \nfearful immigrant communities it is safe to come forward for programs \nthat are absolutely essential to public health and safety. If the \nimmigrant families are afraid to access the key public health \ninterventions, such as immunization or screening for communicable \ndisease, the public health consequences for the entire community are \nsevere.\n  When the Nation is attempting to be prepared for the threat of \nbiological terrorism or serious influenza epidemic, this is a dangerous \npolicy. Local governments need the flexibility to keep the entire \ncommunity safe.\n  Public health workers should not be enforcers. Public health workers \nshould not be enforcers of immigration law. This can create a massive \nfear of the health care system and upset the trust of a patient-doctor \nrelationship that many public health workers have worked to build among \nthe immigrant community for years.\n  Further, social service and health care providers are unlikely to be \nfamiliar with the complex and constantly changing immigration laws, \nwhich would be needed to determine a patient's status and for which \nthey would have to undergo extensive training.\n  I have listened to the Members of the Senate talk about the 1986 \nimmigration laws like they understood it and knew what they were \ntalking about. How in the world are we going to expect the local \npoliceman or the local nurse or the local doctor to understand it when \non the floor of the Senate they do not even understand it?\n  What are going to be the implications? The implications are going to \nbe: There is going to be increased fear, increased discrimination, \nincreased prejudice, and increased disruption--not only of people's \nlives but also of the public health system, the education system, and \nthe law enforcement system.\n  So this amendment does not make sense. At an appropriate time, we \nwill comment further about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I respect the purpose the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota has in advancing this amendment, but I believe \nit would have a chilling effect on the reporting of crime by immigrants \nwhose status is undocumented.\n  We had a hearing on this subject in Philadelphia, for example. The \nchief of police, Sylvester Johnson, had this to say:\n\n       Meeting public safety objectives is only possible when the \n     people trust their law enforcement officials. Fear of \n     negative consequences or reprisal will undermine this \n     important element of successful police work.\n\n  Many major cities in the United States have adopted so-called \nsanctuary city policies, such as Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego, \nPhiladelphia, San Francisco, New Haven, Portland, Baltimore, Detroit, \nMinneapolis, Albuquerque, and New York.\n  Mayor Bloomberg testified before the Judiciary Committee saying:\n\n       Do we really want people who could have information about \n     criminals, including potential terrorists, to be afraid to go \n     to the police?\n\n  Mayor John Street of Philadelphia, in a letter to me, said:\n\n       It is imperative that immigrants who may be witnesses to or \n     victims of crime not suffer repercussions as they attempt to \n     give and receive assistance from law enforcement.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full statement of the \nanalysis of the amendment be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The essential point is that undocumented immigrants, if \nthey are victims and make a report, or if they are witnesses, or if \nthey have information about dangerous people--terrorists, \nillustratively--should have confidence and feel free to come to the \npolice. Well-intentioned as this amendment is, I think it would be \ncounterproductive and unwise.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1190\n\n  Mr. President, I think we are in a position to accept the McCain \namendment when Senator Kennedy returns\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\nto the floor. The thrust of the amendment offered by Senator McCain, \nNo. 1190, would provide that undocumented immigrants would have an \nobligation to pay Federal back taxes at the time their status is \nadjusted under the provisions of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as an original \ncosponsor to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota in the Chamber, who intends to speak, so I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                         Analysis of Amendment\n\n       Requiring local law enforcement to inquire about \n     immigration status undermines both law enforcement efforts \n     and raises national security concerns:\n       ``Meeting public safety objectives is only possible when \n     the people trust their law enforcement officials. Fear of \n     negative consequences or reprisal will undermine this \n     important element of successful police work.'' [Philadelphia \n     Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson, Written testimony to \n     SJC, 7/5/06 hearing, p. 1.]\n       ``Crime does not discriminate. Requiring immigration \n     enforcement by local Departments will create distrust among \n     persons from foreign lands living in the United States. \n     Undocumented immigrants will not report victimization or \n     cooperate in solving crimes or testifying for fear of \n     deportation.'' [Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester \n     Johnson, Written testimony to SJC, 7/5/06 hearing, p. 1.]\n       ``If an undocumented person is a victim or a witness of a \n     crime, we want them to come forward.

Mr. President, my understanding is--I will wait for \nSenator Kennedy to appear on the floor--my understanding is there would \nbe an agreement to allow me to offer my amendment at this point, which \nwould require me to set aside whatever pending amendment exists. If \nthat is acceptable, I will do that, offer my amendment, and then speak \non my amendment.\n  So I ask whether that it is acceptable for me to ask consent to set \naside the pending amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think it is acceptable for the Senator \nfrom North Dakota to ask that the pending amendment be set aside. I \nwill not object, and I am the only Senator on the floor--unless the \nPresiding Officer objects.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may be able to offer an amendment that is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1181 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the amendment's immediate \nconsideration.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 1181 to \n     amendment No. 1150.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To sunset the Y-1 nonimmigrant visa program after a 5-year \n                                period)\n\n       At the end of section 401, add the following:\n       (d) Sunset of Y-1 Visa Program.--\n       (1) Sunset.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, or any amendment made by this Act, no alien may be \n     issued a new visa as a Y-1 nonimmigrant (as defined in \n     section 218B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as added \n     by section 403) after the date that is 5 years after the date \n     that the first such visa is issued.\n       (2) Construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) may be \n     construed to affect issuance of visas to Y-2B nonimmigrants \n     (as defined in such section 218B), under the AgJOBS Act of \n     2007, as added by subtitle C, or any visa program other than \n     the Y-1 visa program.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDurbin be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is relatively simple. It is \nan amendment that would sunset the so-called guest worker or temporary \nworker provision.\n  As my colleagues know, I was on the floor the day before yesterday \nattempting to abolish the temporary or guest worker provision. I failed \nto do that. We had a vote and, regrettably, in the Senate they count \nthe votes, and when they counted those votes, I was on the short end. I \nhave felt very strongly about this issue, and I wish to describe why. \nBut having lost that vote, what I next propose is that we sunset the \ntemporary or guest worker provision.\n  Let me describe that even if we were not on the floor of the Senate \ntalking about immigration today, we have a great deal of legal \nimmigration in this country. We have a system by which there is a quota \nwhere we allow in people from other countries to become citizens of our \ncountry, to have a green card, to work, and then work toward \ncitizenship.\n  Let me describe that even if we were not here with an immigration \nproposal, here is who would be coming to our country. The 2006 numbers, \nI believe, are: 1.2 million people--1,266,000 people--last year came to \nthis country legally; 117,000 of them came from Africa; 422,000 came \nfrom Asia; 164,000 came from Europe; 414,000 came from various \nlocations in North America, including the Caribbean, Central America, \nand other portions of North America; 138,000 came from South America.\n  Let me reiterate, the cumulation is 1.2 million people that came to \nthis country legally, and received green cards last year. So it is not \nas if there is not immigration--legal immigration. We have a process by \nwhich we allow that to happen.\n  There are people, even as I speak this morning, who are in Africa or \nEurope or Asia or South America or Central America, and they have \nwanted to come to this country, and they have made application. They \nhave waited 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, and perhaps they have risen to \nthe top of the list or close to the top of the list to--under the legal \nprocess for coming to this country--be able to gain access to this \ncountry.\n  Then, they read we have a new proposal on immigration. No, it is not \nthat immigration quota where you apply and you wait over a long period \nof time. It is that if you came into this country by December 31 of \nlast year--snuck in, walked in, flew in--illegally, we, with this \nlegislation, deem you to be here legally. We say: Yes, you came here \nillegally. You were among 12 million of them who came here illegally--\nsome of them walking across, I assume, on December 31, who crossed the \nsouthern border--and this legislation says: Oh, by the way, that does \nnot matter. What we are going to do is describe you as being here \nlegally, and we are going to give you a permit to go to work.\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\n  What does that say to people in Africa or Asia or Europe who have \nbeen waiting because they filed, they believed this was all on the \nlevel, there is a process by which you come to this country legally--it \nis quota--and they decided to go through that process? What does it say \nto them that now we have said: Do you know what. You would have been \nbetter off sneaking across the border on December 31 of last year \nbecause, with a magic wand, this legislation would say you are \nperfectly legal.\n  In addition to the 1.2 million people who came here legally, under \nthis bill there would be another 1.5 million people coming to do \nagricultural jobs. There are also 12 million people who have come here \nillegally. Let me say quickly I understand there will be some of them \nwho have been here 10 years, 20 years, and more, who came here--they \ndidn't come legally, I understand that--but they have been here for two \nor three decades. They have raised their families here, they have been \nmodel citizens, they have worked. I understand we are not going to \nround them up and ship them out of this country. I understand that. \nThere needs to be a sensitive, thoughtful way to address the status of \nthose who have been here for a long period of time and who have been \nmodel citizens. This is different than deciding that those who walked \nacross the border on December 31 of last year are going to be deemed \nlegal. That is very different.\n\n  But in addition to those questions about the legal status of 12 \nmillion people who came here without legal authorization, the other \nquestion is: Should we decide to bring additional people into this \ncountry who aren't now here to take American jobs under a provision \ncalled the guest worker or temporary worker provision?\n  Now, you don't have to read many newspapers in the morning to see the \nnext story about the company that closed its plant, fired its workers, \nand moved its jobs to China. You don't have to spend a lot of time \nlooking for stories such as that. They are all around us, American \ncompanies exporting American jobs in search of cheap labor in China, \nIndonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and at exactly the same time, we see \nall of these stories about exporting American jobs. We now see the \nurgings of the biggest enterprises in this country, many of which do \nexport these jobs in search of cheap labor. We see their urgings to \nallow them to bring in additional cheap labor from outside of this \ncountry into this country to assume jobs American workers now have. \nThey say these workers are necessary because they can't find American \nworkers to do those jobs. That is not true. They don't want to pay a \ndecent wage for those jobs. The people across the counter at the \nconvenience store, the people who make the beds in the morning at the \nhotels, if they paid a decent wage, they will get workers, but they \ndon't want to have to do that. What they want to do is bring in cheap \nlabor, and that is why we have a guest or a temporary worker provision.\n  I talked yesterday on the floor of the Senate about Circuit City, the \nstory which reinforces all of this for me. Circuit City, a corporation \nall of us know, announced they have decided to fire 3,400 workers. The \nCEO of Circuit City, it says in the newspaper, makes $10 million a \nyear. They announced they are going to fire 3,400 workers at Circuit \nCity because they make $11 an hour and that is too much to pay a \nworker. They want to fire their workers and hire less experienced \nworkers at a lower wage. This pernicious downward pressure on income in \nthis country--fewer benefits, less retirement, less health care, lower \nincome--is, in my judgment, initiated by the export of American jobs \nfor low wages and the import of cheap labor for low wages, all of it \ncoming together to say to the American worker: It is a different day \nfor you and a different time for you. Don't expect the kind of wages \nyou used to have. There is downward pressure on all of those wages, and \nthat is part and parcel of what this proposal is: temporary guest \nworkers.\n  Let me show you a graph I put up the other day, and this is a graph \nthat has 200,000 temporary workers, because the proposal I tried to \ncompletely abolish was bringing in 400,000 temporary workers a year. \nThat was cut by the Bingaman amendment to 200,000 a year. Let me \ndescribe how it works, because I am anxious to put a tape recorder on \nsomebody and go listen to how they describe this at a town meeting, if \nthey decide to vote for this.\n  Two hundred thousand foreign workers can come in as temporary or \nguest workers for 2 years. So these 200,000 come in for 2 years; then \nthe second year another 200,000 can come in, so you have 400,000 the \nsecond year, but the 200,000 who come in can come in for 2 years, and \nthey can bring their family if they wish. Then they have to go home for \na year and take their family with them, and then they can come back for \n2 more years. Or, they can come in for 2 years, not bring their family, \ngo home for a year, and bring their family for another two years. Or, \nthey can decide to come in for 2 years without a family, 2 years \nwithout a family, 2 years without a family, as long as they stay 1 year \nbetween each of the 2-year periods; as long as they stay 1 year outside \nof this country between those periods. It is the most Byzantine thing I \nhave seen.\n  Now, what are the consequences of it? The consequences are this: This \nis cumulative, so what we have are these blocks of 200,000 workers who \ncome and go, come and go. They stay 2 years, leave a year, bring their \nfamily, maybe don't bring their family. It is unbelievable. We are not \ntalking about a few million people here. Add all these family members \nto these 200,000 workers who come for 2 years with their families and \nask yourselves: What kind of immigration is this? By the way, where \nwill they get jobs when they come to this country? We already have an \nagricultural provision that is in this legislation, so these are not \nfarm workers. We are not talking about people who come and pick \nstrawberries here. We are talking about people who will assume jobs--we \nare told--in manufacturing. Why? Because we don't have enough American \nworkers in manufacturing? Are you kidding me?\n  I have described at length on the floor of the Senate the people who \nlost their jobs because their manufacturing jobs went to China for 20 \ncents an hour labor, 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day. They want to \nknow where to get people to work in manufacturing? Go find the people \nwho were laid off--thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions \nlaid off--because their company decided they were going to make their \nproducts in China. If they need hints, go back and read my previous \nspeeches on the floor of the Senate. Fruit of the Loom underwear, a lot \nof folks worked there; not anymore. Levi's, not any more. Huffy \nBicycles, no more. Radio Flyer, Little Red Wagon, no more. Fig Newton \nCookies, no. All of those folks worked for all of those companies. \nPennsylvania House Furniture.\n\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania is on the floor. Pennsylvania House \nFurniture is a great example of what has been happening, if you want to \nfind some great workers, some real craftsmen. I know I have told this \nstory before, and I will tell it again, because it is so important and \nso emblematic of what is going on.\n  Not many people know it, but Pennsylvania House Furniture, which is \nfine furniture--those folks in Pennsylvania who use Pennsylvania wood \nand were craftsmen to put together upper-end furniture, they all got \nfired because La-Z-Boy bought them and they decided they wanted to move \nPennsylvania House Furniture to China, and they did. Now they ship the \nPennsylvania wood to China, make the furniture and sell it back here as \nPennsylvania furniture. But on the last day of work with the last piece \nof furniture these Pennsylvania House Furniture craftsmen produced--not \nmany people know that they turned the last piece of furniture upside \ndown, and as it came off the line, all of these craftsmen who for years \nhave made some of the finest furniture in this country, decided to sign \nthe bottom of that piece of furniture. Somebody in this country has a \npiece of furniture and they don't know it has the signatures of all the \ncraftsmen at Pennsylvania House Furniture on the bottom of their piece \nof furniture. Do you know why they signed it? Because they understood \nhow good they were. They didn't lose their jobs to China because they \ndidn't do good work. They were wonderful craftsmen and they were proud \nof their work and\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nthey wanted to sign that piece of furniture. Somebody has that piece of \nfurniture today, but none of those craftsmen have a job today. If \nsomebody is looking for a manufacturing worker, I can steer them in the \nright direction. We have plenty of people in this country who need \nthese jobs.\n  We are told two things that are contradictory. We are told there is \nbona fide border security in this bill. I happen to think the way you \ndeal with immigration, first and foremost, is to provide border \nsecurity. If you don't have border security, you don't have immigration \nreform because all you will do is nick at the edges and continue to \nhave a stream of illegal workers flowing into this country. So the \nfirst and most important step is to provide border security.\n  I was here in 1986, and I heard the promises of border security, but \nin fact, there wasn't border security. Employer sanctions. In fact, \nthere were not employer sanctions that were enforced. No enforcement on \nthe border of any consequence; no enforcement with respect to employer \nsanctions.\n  We are told a guest worker provision is necessary because we cannot \nprovide border security. Several of those who have been involved with \nthis compromise have said: Workers will come here illegally or legally; \none way or another, they are going to come in. My colleague has a \ncouple of times pointed to the Governor of Arizona--and I suspect she \ndid say this; I don't contest that--the Governor of Arizona, Governor \nNapolitano, says: You know, if you build a 50-foot-high fence, those \nwho want to come in will get a 51-foot ladder.\n  Well, if that is the case, if Governor Napolitano is correct, then I \nguess we are not going to have border security unless we cut the legs \noff 51-foot-ladders. The implication of that is: Illegal immigration is \ngoing to occur, like it or not. Therefore, let's have a temporary \nworker program, which means we will describe as legal those who come in \nillegally. That is the point. I mean, I don't understand this; I just \ndon't.\n  So I lose the amendment fair and square to try to strike that \ntemporary worker provision. I understand where the votes were on it. \nBut I come to the floor suggesting let's do one additional thing. Let's \nat least sunset this provision.\n  Here is what will happen for 10 years under the temporary worker \nprovision. This chart shows 10 years, 200,000 in the first year, \n200,000 the second year. That first group of 200,000 will be on their \nsecond year, so as those 200,000 continue their work the second year, \nanother 200,000 will join them, and then by the fourth year, we have \n600,000. By the fifth year, we have 800,000.\n  My proposition is this: Why don't we decide to sunset this at the end \nof 5 years and take a look at it and see. We have plenty of experience \nwith claims that have never borne fruit here on the floor of the \nSenate. Why don't we take a look at 5 years and see where the claims \nwere made for the temporary worker provisions. Were they claims that \nturned out to have been accurate or not?\n  Now, my understanding is--and I was looking for a statement in the \npress that was reporting on a colleague who was part of the compromise, \nif I can find it. Let me read from Congress Daily, Wednesday, May 23, \nwhich would have been yesterday.\n\n       One change that might win over some would be a sunset \n     provision which Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat, North Dakota, \n     said he wanted to offer after his proposal to eliminate the \n     guest worker program failed.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida, who helped \n     negotiate the compromise immigration bill, said today he \n     would not consider the sunset proposal a deal breaker.\n\n  I am quoting now Senator Martinez from Congress Daily:\n\n       Labor conditions might change, Martinez said. I don't see \n     why in five years we shouldn't revisit what we have done.\n\n  Martinez is among a group of roughly a dozen Senators dubbed the \n``grand bargainers,'' who have agreed to vote as a block to stop any \namendments they believe would unravel the fragile immigration \ncompromise on the Senate floor.\n  So at least one of the grand bargainers, Senator Martinez, has told \nCongress Daily that the amendment I offer is not a deal breaker. He \nsays:\n\n       I think it is perfectly reasonable.\n\n  Again quoting him:\n\n       I don't see why in five years we should not revisit what we \n     have done.\n\n  So I would say to my colleagues, at least one of the ``grand \nbargainers,'' so described by Congress Daily, has said the amendment \nthat I offer with Senator Boxer and Senator Durbin to provide a sunset \nafter 5 years to the temporary or guest worker provision would not be a \ndeal breaker.\n  We have passed a lot of legislation in the Congress that represents \nimportant policy choices and a number of those pieces of legislation \nhave sunset provisions. The farm bill. The farm bill has sunset \nprovisions in it. The Energy bill, the bankruptcy reform bill, the \nintelligence reform bill, all have sunset provisions. The purpose: \nLet's find out what happened and then determine what we do next. A \nsunset clause doesn't mean a piece of legislation will not get \nreauthorized. It might. If all of the claims that buttress the original \npassage turn out to be accurate, then you might well want to \nreauthorize it. But with other pieces of legislation, we have sunsetted \nkey provisions. Why wouldn't we want to do the same with respect to \ntemporary workers, which will open the gate and say come into this \ncountry.\n\n  This immigration bill that we have, with 12 million people being \ndeemed legal, who came without legal authorization, that is not enough. \nWe need more. I know we had discussion yesterday about chicken pluckers \non the floor of the Senate. How much money will chicken pluckers make? \nWell, I will tell you one thing about chicken pluckers and those who do \nthat kind of work. They are never going to make the money they used to \nmake because of downward pressure on wages. That downward pressure in \nthat sector comes directly from a massive quantity of cheap labor that \nhas come into this country. That may be all right if you are not \nplucking chickens.\n  If you are working in one of those plants and you see what happened \nto wage standards and wage rates, it is very hard to say we are making \nprogress on behalf of the American worker. We are not. That is what \nbrings me to the floor of the Senate. I regret that I disagree with \nsome very good friends in the Congress on these issues. But the fact is \nthat this is very important public policy. This public policy and \nthings that attend to it and relate to it determine what kind of jobs \nwe are going to have in the future, what kind of economic expansion we \nwill have, and what can the middle-income families expect for \nthemselves and their kids and their lives.\n  I am not going to speak much longer, but I wish to say this. I remind \nall my colleagues where we have been. Almost a century ago, there was a \nman who was killed. I wrote about him and said he died of lead \npoisoning. He actually was shot 54 times--James Fyler. The reason he \nwas shot 54 times almost a century ago is he was one of these people \nwho decided to fight for workers' rights in this country. He believed \nthat people who were coal miners and went into a coal mine ought to be \nable to expect, one, a fair wage; two, they ought to expect to be able \nto work in a safe workplace; they ought to have the right to organize \nand fight for those things. For that, he was shot 54 times.\n  For over a century, beginning with that, we dramatically, and through \ngreat difficulty, improved standards in this country. We demanded safe \nworkplaces, fair labor standards, and all these things that would raise \npeople up. We expended the middle class and created a country that is \nextraordinary, a middle class in which they could find good jobs that \npaid well and had decent fringe benefits. They negotiated for decent \nhealth care and retirement benefits. We did something extraordinary in \nthis country. That didn't happen by accident.\n  At this point, all around the country, with middle-income workers, \nthey see a retraction of those things, a downward pressure on their \nincome, much less job security, and too many workers being treated akin \nto wrenches--use them up and throw them away. If you pay $11 an hour, \nthat is too much. You find workers for $8 an hour, with no experience. \nTerrific. Or you can pay 30 cents an hour in China; that is even \nbetter.\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\n  You may say, what does that have to do with this bill? A lot, in my \njudgment. That is what pushes me to come to the floor on these \namendments--not because I wish to hear myself talk or because I wish to \ntake on friends but because I think the direction we are headed in is \nwrong. Yes, we have an immigration problem. I accept that and I \nunderstand that. I believe the first step to resolving it is border \nsecurity because, otherwise, 10 or 15 years from now, we will be back \nwith another immigration problem, and we will understand there was not \nborder security. Those who tell us there is border security are the \nsame ones who tell us, as Janet Napolitano says, that if we build a 50-\nfoot fence, they will get a 51-foot ladder. You can't stop it, so \ndeclare it legal. Illegal immigration is going to occur, like it or \nnot; therefore, let's have a temporary worker program. I disagree with \nthat.\n  The fact is, I don't know all the nuances of what happened this week. \nI know this: The price for the support of the national Chamber of \nCommerce in the last bill brought to the Senate--the price for the \nsupport of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was to allow them to bring in \nthis cheap labor in the form of guest or temporary workers. I didn't \nsupport it then; I don't support it now.\n  We have 1.2 million people who came in legally last year. I support \nthat process. That is a quota system. The process works. We refresh and \nnurture this country with immigrants. So 1.2 million were allowed in \nunder the legal immigration system last year. That doesn't count the \nagricultural workers who would come in under the AgJobs program in this \nbill. That is another 1 million-plus people.\n  I also understand the urging and the interest to try to be sensitive \nin resolving the status of people who have been here a long time. Yes, \nthey came without legal authorization, but they have been model \ncitizens. They have lived up the block, down the street, and on the \nfarm, and they have been among us and raised their families and gone to \nschool; they have good jobs. Should we resolve their status with some \nsensitivity? Of course, I fully support that. But you do not resolve \nthat, in my judgment, by pointing to December 31 of last year and \nsaying, by the way, anybody who came across December 31 of last year \nand prior to that is considered to have legal status in our country. \nThat is the wrong way to resolve it.\n  Let me do two things. Let me urge my colleagues to support a 5-year \nsunset on this legislation. Let me say a second time to those with whom \nI disagree, I respect their views. I disagree strongly with them. I \nmean no disrespect on the floor of the Senate about the views they \nhold. They perhaps hold them as strongly as I hold my views. I believe \nin my heart, when you look at people who got up this morning and got \ndressed and went to work, many of whom packed a lunch bucket, they came \nhome and took a shower after work because they work hard and sweat, \nthose people want something better for their lives in this country. \nThey want the ability to get ahead and to get a decent wage for their \nwork.\n  Regrettably, all too often, that is being denied them by a strategy \nthat says this country values cheap labor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal of \nthe Senator from North Dakota. I appreciated over the period of these \ndays the good exchanges we have had on the issues of the labor \nconditions in this country, which is what this legislation is all \nabout.\n  I am going to put a chart behind me that describes the circumstances \nof what is happening to undocumented workers and to American workers in \nNew Bedford, MA. This is a picture of a company in New Bedford, MA. \nThis was taken probably in the last 4 weeks. These were the \nundocumented workers in New Bedford. This sweatshop is replicated in \ncity after city all over this country. One of the key issues is: Can we \ndo something about it? We say yes, and we say our legislation makes a \nvery important downpayment to making sure we do.\n  Many of these individuals--not all--are undocumented workers. This is \nwhat happened to these workers. These workers were fined for going to \nthe bathroom; denied overtime pay; docked 15 minutes pay for every \nminute they were late to work; fired for talking while on the clock; \nforced to ration toilet paper, which typically ran out before 9 a.m. So \nthis is the condition in sweatshops in New Bedford, MA.\n  These conditions exist in other parts of my State, regrettably, and \nother parts of this country. Why? Because we have, unfortunately, \nemployers who are prepared to exploit the current condition of \nundocumented workers in this country--potentially, close to 12\\1/2\\ \nmillion are undocumented. Because they are undocumented, employers can \nhave them in these kinds of conditions. If they don't like it, they \ntell them they will be reported to the immigration service and be \ndeported. That is what is happening today.\n  I yield to no one in terms of my commitment to working conditions or \nfor fairness and decency in the workplace. That is happening today. The \nfact that we have those undocumented workers and they are being \nexploited and paid low wages has what kind of impact in terms of \nAmerican workers? It depresses their wages. That should not be too hard \nto grasp. Those are the facts.\n  Now what do we try to do with this legislation? We are trying to say: \nLook, the time of the undocumented is over. You are safe. You will not \nbe deported. Therefore, you have labor protections. If the employer \ndoesn't do that, you have the right to complain, a right to file \nsomething with the Labor Department, and we are going to have a \nthousand labor inspectors who are going to go through the plants in the \ncountry to make sure you are protected. That doesn't exist today. It \nwill under this legislation.\n  So what we are saying is that those who are coming in to work \ntemporarily are going to be treated equally under the U.S. labor laws. \nEmployers must provide them workers' compensation. So if something \nhappens to them in the workplace, they will be compensated rather than \nthrown out on the street. Employers with histories of worker abuse \ncannot participate in the program. There are the penalties for \nemployers who break the rules, which never existed before.\n  Now, we say: Well, you may very well be taking jobs from American \nworkers. That is the question. What do you have to do to show that you \nare not going to take jobs from American workers? Well, if the employer \nwants to hire a guest worker, the employer must advertise extensively \nbefore applying for a temporary worker. The employer must find out if \nany American responds to that. If they do, they get the job. So the \nemployer has to advertise and the employer must hire any qualified \nAmerican applicant. Temporary workers are restricted in areas with high \nunemployment, and employers cannot undercut American wages by paying \ntemporary workers less.\n  So we are saying the temporary workers are going to come in and be \ntreated as American workers, and those who are undocumented are going \nto be treated as American workers. That is not the condition today. \nThat is the condition in this legislation. How do we get there? Well, \nwe get there with a comprehensive approach. What do you mean by a \ncomprehensive approach? We are saying a comprehensive approach is that \nyou are going to have border security. That is part of it. But you are \nalso going to have the opportunity for people who are going to come in \nhere through the front door--if you have a limited number of people \ncoming in through the front door, and that number is down to 200,000 \nnow, they will be able to come through the front door, and they will be \nable--in areas where American workers are not present, willing or able \nto work--to work in the American economy, with labor protections, which \nso many do not have today.\n  But we are going to have to say you need a combination of things--the \nsecurity at the border. You have a guest worker program which is part \nof the combination. Is that it? No, no, it is not it. You have to be \nable to show your employer that you have the biometric card to show \nthat you are legally in the United States. Therefore, you have rights. \nIf that employer hires other people who do not have that card, they are \nsubject to severe penalties. That doesn't exist today.\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\n  So when we hear all these voices about what is happening about the \nexploitation of workers, that happens to be true today. But those of us \nwho have been working on this are avoiding that with the proposal we \nhave on this particular issue.\n  Included in this proposal--the Senator makes a very good point, \nalthough I never thought we sunsetted the Bankruptcy Act. I wish we \nhad. In this legislation, we have the provisions which set up and \nestablish a commission. The commission in the legislation does this: In \nsection 412 we say: Standing commission on immigration and labor \nmarkets. The purpose of the commission is what? To study the \nnonimmigrant programs and the numerical limits imposed by law on \nadmission of nonimmigrants; to study numerical limits imposed by law on \nimmigrant visas, to study the limitations throughout the merit-based \nsystem, and to make recommendations to the President and the Congress \nwith respect to these programs.\n\n  So we have included in this legislation a very important provision to \nreview the program we have. That panel is made up of representatives of \nthe worker community, as well as the business community to make these \nannual reports to Congress about how this program is working so that we \nwill then be able to take action: Not later than 18 months after date \nof enactment and every year thereafter, submit a report to the \nPresident and the Congress that contains the findings, the analysis \nconducted under paragraph 1; make recommendations regarding adjustments \nof the program so as to meet the labor market needs of the United \nStates.\n  What we have built into this is a proposal to constantly review this \nprogram and report back to the Congress, so if we want to make the \njudgment to change the numbers, the conditions, the various incentives, \nwe have the opportunity to do so. We believe--and I think the Senator \nmakes a valid point--that it is useful to have self-corrective \nopportunities. He would do it by ending the program, by finishing it, \nby sunsetting it. We do it by having a review by people who can make a \njudgment and a decision and give information to Congress so that we can \ndo it.\n  There is one final point I wish to make. We have a system, as the \nSenator from North Dakota pointed out, where people will work here, go \nback to their country of origin for a period of time, come back to \nwork, go back to their country, and come back to work. Under our \nproposal, they get a certain number of points under the merit system \nwhich help move them on a pathway toward a green card and toward \ncitizenship.\n  I wish that merit system could be changed in a way that favored \nworkers more extensively and provided a greater balance between low \nskill and high skill because the labor market demands both. If you read \nthe reports of the Council of Economic Advisers, you find there is a \nneed for high skill, but 8 out of the 10 critical occupations are also \nlow skill. We have tried, during this process, to see if we couldn't \nfind equal incentives for both.\n  It is a fair enough criticism to say this merit system is more skewed \ntoward the high skilled than it is toward the low skilled, but there \nare still very important provisions and protections in there for low \nskilled, and there are additional points added in case of family \nassociations or if you are a member of an American family.\n  I really do not see the need. We moved from 400,000 down to 200,000. \nThis is a modest program at best. We have in the legislation the report \nthat will be made available to the Congress on a variety of areas. We \nhave been very careful to make sure that everyone who is going to \nparticipate in this program, who is going to come in legally, is going \nto have the protections for working families today. That doesn't exist \ntoday. This legislation does protects them. The amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota would cut out those provisions with regard to \nthe temporary worker program.\n  The fact is, we need some workers in this country. All of us will \nbattle and take great pride in being the champion of the increase in \nthe minimum wage, and I commend my friend from North Dakota for his \nsupport over the years in increasing the minimum wage. We are very \nhopeful that we are going to finally get that increase in the next \ncouple of days as part of this other legislation, the supplemental. We \nwill be out here trying to get further increases in protections for \nAmerican workers.\n  This is a modest program. It has the self-corrective aspect to it. It \nis a program that ought to be tried, and it ought to be implemented.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, recognizing the good-faith interest of \nthe Senator from North Dakota in proposing this amendment, I \nnonetheless believe it should be rejected by the Senate. What the \nSenator from North Dakota has here is a fallback position. He offered \nan amendment yesterday to eliminate the guest worker program. Having \nfailed there, he has a fallback position of trying to have it \nsunsetted.\n  There is no doubt about the need for guest workers in our economy. \nLast year in the Judiciary Committee, we held extensive hearings on \nthis matter. We did not hold hearings this year, and we did not process \nthis legislation through the Judiciary Committee, which in retrospect \nmay have been a mistake, but here we are. But we have an ample record \nfrom last year.\n  We had the testimony of Professor Richard Freeman from Harvard \noutlining the basic fact that immigration raises not only the GDP of \nthe United States because we have more people now to do useful \nactivities, but it also raises the part of the GDP that goes to the \ncurrent residents in our country.\n  We heard testimony from Professor Henry Holzer of Georgetown \nUniversity to the effect that immigration is a good thing for the \noverall economy. ``It does lower costs. It lowers prices. It enables us \nto produce more goods and services and to produce them more \nefficiently.''\n  The executive director of the Stanford Law School program on law, \neconomics, and business, Dan Siciliano, testified that there is a \n``mismatch between our U.S.-born workers' age, skills, and willingness \nto work, and the jobs that are being created in the economy, in part as \na function of our own demographics, whether they be elder care, retail, \ndaycare, or other types of jobs.''\n  There is no doubt that there is a tremendous need for a guest worker \nprogram in our restaurants, hotels, on our farms, in landscaping, \nwherever one turns.\n  The Assistant Secretary of Policy at the U.S. Department of Labor \ntestified earlier this month before the House Immigration Subcommittee \nthat there are three fundamental reasons the United States needs \nimmigrants to fuel our economy. That is the testimony of Assistant \nSecretary Leon Sequeira. The reasons he gives are that we have an aging \nworkforce; we do not have enough people of working age to support the \neconomy and support the social welfare programs, such as Social \nSecurity for the aging population; and immigrants contribute to \ninnovation and entrepreneurship.\n  The chart which had been posted shows that the guest worker program \nis being treated fairly. Senator Kennedy has outlined in some detail \nthe review and analysis of the program, so the Congress is in a \nposition to make modifications, if necessary.\n  After the laborious efforts in producing this bill, it would be my \nhope that we would not have to revisit it on an automatic basis in 5 \nyears. If we find a need to do so, we will be in a position to \nundertake that review and to have congressional action if any is \nwarranted. But on the basis of the record we have before us, I think \nthis amendment ought to be rejected, and I urge my colleagues to do \njust that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, unless the Senator from North Dakota wishes \nto briefly respond to Senator Specter, let me speak for 3 or 4 minutes.\n  I join Senator Specter in urging our colleagues to defeat this \namendment. This is simply a light version of the amendment we defeated \na couple days ago that would have eliminated the temporary worker \nprogram.\n  The problem here is twofold. First, there has been a basic agreement \nthat even though Republicans generally did not want to allow illegal \nimmigrants to remain in the United States and, in some situations, be \npermitted to stay\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nhere for the rest of their lives, if that is their desire, and even get \na green card and ultimately become citizens, there was an understanding \nthat certain tradeoffs had to occur if we were going to get \nlegislation. Part of the legislation does enable some 12 to 15 million \npeople to have that right, as well as immigrants whose applications are \npending, many of whom have no reasonable expectation of being able to \nnaturalize, to actually be able to come here and get green cards and \nnaturalize, perhaps some 4 million people.\n  If we have a temporary worker program, which is part of what Senators \nsuch as myself were proposing to relieve our labor shortages, if that \nprogram is only in existence temporarily but these other benefits are \nconferred permanently, you can see that you have a significant \nimbalance in the legislation.\n  Somebody said: What is mine is mine, and what is yours is up for \ngrabs. In other words, one side pockets the ability of all the illegal \nimmigrants to stay here, to get citizenship rights if they go through \nall of the process that enables them to do that, but the temporary \nworker program, which is desired by many in the business community and \nmany foreign nationals who want the opportunity to come here and work, \nis only going to be temporary, and that might go away. That is not a \nfair way to proceed to the legislation, to have what you like is \npermanent, what I like is only temporary.\n  But there is a deeper problem. The whole point of having a temporary \nworker program is to ensure we are going to meet our labor needs in the \nfuture. We don't know exactly what those labor needs are, but they are \ngoing to be substantial. If you cannot plan with certainty that you \nknow you can expand your business, you can make the capital investment \nin whatever the business is--let's say a meatpacking plant--that you \nare going to need some foreign nationals to come here on a temporary \nbasis with a temporary visa to meet the employment needs because you \nfound in the past that there are not sufficient Americans who have \napplied for that kind of work in the past, so you know you are going to \nneed the temporary worker program, but you don't know whether that \nprogram is going to be in existence in 5 years, are you going to make \nthe capital investment necessary? Are you going to be able to provide \nmore tax base, more employment opportunities for Americans, as well as \nothers, provide for more consumer choice in the country if you don't \nknow you are going to have the labor force necessary to meet your \nneeds?\n  Having a temporary worker program is not going to meet our long-term \nneeds. As a result, I suggest that for planning purposes, for being \nable to know that labor pool is going to be available if we need it, we \nare going to have to have this temporary worker program. Therefore, \nthere is not very much difference between simply eliminating the \nprogram now and saying in 5 years it is going to evaporate unless we \ntake steps to reinitiate it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment. We defeated an \namendment a few days ago. This is a killer amendment. Everybody knows \nthat if this program goes away, it undercuts the entire program we \ntried to craft in a bipartisan way. We have to relieve the magnet of \nillegal employment in this country. That magnet is jobs that Americans \nwon't do. As long as there is an excess of labor demand over supply, \nthat magnet for illegal immigration is going to continue to pull people \nacross our borders. That magnet is demagnetized when we have a \ntemporary worker program that says we now have a legal way for you to \nmeet your labor needs. It can be done within the rule of law. It is \nbased on temporary workers. We need to keep that in this bill. It \ncannot be subject to some kind of a sunset so that it disappears 5 \nyears from now and we have no idea at that point how to meet our labor \nneeds.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we did 2 days ago, to reject the Dorgan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield to me for a very brief unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, of course I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1168, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npreviously agreed to Hutchison amendment No. 1168 be modified to read \n``on page 7, line 2.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:15 \np.m., the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Akaka amendment \nNo. 1186, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Coleman amendment \nNo. 1158; that no amendments be in order to either amendment prior to \nthe vote; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form prior to each vote and that the second \nvote in the sequence be 10 minutes in length; further, that at 2:15 \np.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment \nNo. 1181, with 5 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form prior to the vote, with no amendment in order to the \nDorgan amendment prior to the vote, all without further intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I ask only \nthat the Senator from Massachusetts amend the request to give Senator \nColeman 5 minutes before the 12:15 vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator \nDurbin will ask to speak for 10 minutes, and we will do that in \naddition to the 10 minutes I will want to speak before my vote, if that \nis acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amended unanimous \nconsent request is agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand the request, the time the \nSenator is getting is prior to his vote at 2:15.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Prior to my vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And there will be time prior to that available as well \nfor the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, following the entry of that unanimous \nconsent request, I would ask the Senator from Massachusetts if we could \ncall up the McCain amendment with the modification change which is at \nthe desk and ask that it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside and the Kennedy unanimous consent request, as amended by \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Specter, is agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1190, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the McCain amendment \nwith the modifications which are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for Mr. \n     McCain, for himself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Burr, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1190, as modified, to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 293 redesignate paragraphs (3) as (4) and (4) as \n     (5).\n       On page 293, between lines 33 and 34, insert the following:\n       ``(3) Payment of income taxes.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than the date on which status \n     is adjusted under this section, the alien establishes the \n     payment of any applicable Federal tax liability by \n     establishing that--\n       ``(i) no such tax liability exists;\n       ``(ii) all outstanding liabilities have been paid; or\n       ``(iii) the alien has entered into an agreement for payment \n     of all outstanding liabilities with the Internal Revenue \n     Service.\n       ``(B) Applicable federal tax liability.--For purposes of \n     clause (i), the term `applicable Federal tax liability' means \n     liability for Federal taxes, including penalties and \n     interest, owed for any year during the period of employment \n     required by subparagraph (D)(i) for which the statutory \n     period for assessment of any deficiency for such taxes has \n     not expired.\n       ``(C) IRS cooperation.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     establish rules and procedures under which the Commissioner \n     of Internal Revenue shall provide documentation\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\n     to an alien upon request to establish the payment of all \n     taxes required by this subparagraph.\n       ``(D) In general.--The alien may satisfy such requirement \n     by establishing that--\n       ``(i) no such tax liability exists;\n       ``(ii) all outstanding liabilities have been met; or\n       ``(iii) the alien has entered into an agreement for payment \n     of all outstanding liabilities with the Internal Revenue \n     Service and with the department of revenue of each State to \n     which taxes are owed.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would \nsomebody tell the body what the McCain amendment is?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes. As I had explained earlier this morning, the McCain \namendment has a provision for the payment or a requirement of the \npayment of back Federal taxes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The payment of back Federal taxes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it calls for payment of back Federal \ntaxes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to see the \namendment, so I would object at this time. I may not ultimately object, \nbut I would object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection of the Senator from New Jersey \nis acknowledged.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1181\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Arizona used the dreaded \nwords ``killer amendment.'' It is like killer bees and killer whales. \nOn the Senate floor, it is ``killer amendment.'' Pass this amendment, \nand we will kill the bill, we are told.\n  I said yesterday that it is like the loose thread on a cheap sweater: \nYou pull the thread, and the arm falls off or, God forbid, the whole \nthing comes apart. It is not just this bill. This happens every single \ntime a group of people bring a bill to the floor of the Senate. If you \namend it, if you change our work, then somehow you kill what we have \ndone. Of course, that is not the case at all.\n  Let me talk about a couple of the items that have been raised. Worker \nprotection. The workers in New Bedford, MA. Let me describe to you a \nworker in the Gulf of Mexico just after Hurricane Katrina hit. His name \nis Sam Smith. Sam Smith was an electrician. Just after Katrina hit, he \nknew there was going to be a lot of reconstruction work. Sam Smith was \na skilled craftsman, an electrician. He was told by an employer that he \ncould come back and take a $22 an hour job--$22 an hour--for work as an \nelectrician. The job would last 1 year. It only lasted a couple weeks. \nI don't have the picture to show you, but I have had it here on the \nfloor before to show what Sam Smith faced, and it was a picture very \nsimilar to New Bedford, MA. Those who came into this country, \npresumably illegally, living in squalid conditions, being given very \nlow wages to take the work Sam Smith was promised.\n  What is the solution? Well, the fact is, in New Bedford, MA, and in \nthis case, the employer is guilty, in my judgment, of mistreating its \nworkers. We have worker protection laws in this country. We have worker \nprotections. If an employer abuses them in New Bedford, MA, or New \nOrleans, LA, that employer is responsible. Law enforcement is \nresponsible to investigate and prosecute.\n  That is not what this bill is about. My colleague says, well, the way \nto resolve the situation in New Bedford, MA, is to make the illegal \nimmigrants working there legal. Just describe them as legal. Would that \nbe the way you would handle it in New Orleans, LA, to say, well, the \npeople who came in to take Sam's job should be deemed legal? I don't \nthink so. Why not punish the employer for abusing the rights of these \nimmigrant workers and why not restore those jobs to those who were the \nvictims of the hurricane in the first place? Is the principle here that \nwe describe the problem as mistreatment of workers who are illegal \nimmigrants, and therefore what we will do is deem them legal to hold \nthose jobs and therefore expect some other kind of behavior by the \nemployer? I don't think so. So that is a specious argument, frankly. We \nhave worker protection laws. They ought to be enforced. If they are not \nenforced, there is something wrong with the system.\n  Now, one of my colleagues says there is no doubt that we need \nadditional workers. Oh yes, there is doubt--probably not in the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce. There is no doubt they want additional cheap \nlabor. But there is plenty of doubt.\n  My colleague says there is an economist from Harvard who says this \nraises the GDP, this bringing in of immigrant labor, presumably illegal \nlabor, determining that they are then legal once they have come across \nillegally. It raises the GDP. Well, you can get a Harvard economist to \nsay anything you want. We all know that.\n  Let me describe my Harvard economist--my Harvard economist, Professor \nGeorge Borjas. Here is what he says. The impact of immigration between \n1980 and 2000 on U.S. wages is lower wages in this country, and he \ndescribes which ethnic group is hurt the worst. Hispanics are hurt the \nworst and Blacks next.\n  My colleague says that his Harvard economist states that one of the \nbenefits of bringing in this additional labor from outside of our \ncountry is lower costs. Well, in my hometown, I understand what lower \ncosts means. It means they are going to pay less to the people making \nit. That is called lower wages. And that is exactly what my Harvard \nprofessor says is the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I profoundly misunderstood the unanimous \nconsent request. That is my fault, not the Presiding Officer's. I will \nask consent, of course, to speak after the break for the luncheons, and \nI guess we have in order 10 minutes for me and 10 minutes for Senator \nDurbin prior to the vote on my amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am not going to object to the time. The \nSenator ought to have wrap-up on this. But if we can have the 5 minutes \nprior to the Senator's last 5 minutes, I would be agreeable.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One of the things I am good at is wrapping up. So let me \nwrap up in 2 minutes by going through this grid so that we would then \nrecognize Senator Coleman for the time he has been given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is a \nunanimous consent agreement that says the vote starts at 12:15. I want \nto make sure everything is pushed back accordingly, if there is an \nextra 2 minutes here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor to the Senator from \nMinnesota. I will have time to wrap up. If we are in a time \nrequirement, I will yield the floor and find time elsewhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1190\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent that the \nMcCain amendment, No. 1190, which was called up as modified, with the \nchanges at the desk, be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, is this the same \namendment that was just offered a few minutes ago?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1190), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the bill managers for agreeing to accept this \namendment, which I am pleased to be joined in sponsoring with Senator \nGraham.\n  As my colleagues will hear throughout this debate, the bipartisan \ngroup of Members who developed this legislation, along with \nrepresentatives of the administration, worked to develop this \ncomprehensive reform measure with the foremost goal of developing a \nproposal that can be enacted this year. It is not a bill on which we \nare just ``going through the motions.'' Like any legislation on an \nexpansive issue like immigration reform, this is a complex\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\ncompromise agreement, and that means that while perhaps no one is \nentirely happy with every single provision in the bill, we believe it \nprovides a solid foundation for this floor debate. It is a serious \nproposal to address a very serious problem.\n  When Senator Kennedy and I first proposed legislation in May 2005, it \nincluded, among other things, a series of strict requirements that the \nundocumented population would have to fulfill before being allowed to \nget in the back of the line and apply for adjustment of legal status. \nOne of those provisions failed to be part of the consensus before us \ntoday due to concerns raised with respect to practicality. That \nprovision required the undocumented to pay any back-taxes owed as a \nresult of their time living and working in our country illegally.\n  I strongly believe everyone living and working in our country has an \nobligation to meet all tax obligations, regardless of convenience or \npracticality. Yes, requiring any undocumented immigrant to prove he or \nshe has met their tax obligations will take manpower. After all, we are \ntalking about as many as 12 million people. Undocumented immigrants \nwill most likely have to find and submit plenty of paperwork to prove \nthey have met their obligations. But that is what citizens here do. We \npay our taxes. We may complain, but we pay our taxes. And while I don't \ndoubt that it may be a difficult undertaking to require as a condition \nof receiving permanent status in the United States the payment of back-\ntaxes, that isn't a good reason to toss the requirement aside. If an \nundocumented immigrant is willing to meet the many stringent \nrequirements we are calling for under this bill, and I think they will \nbe willing, including learning English and civics, paying hefty fines, \nand clearing background checks, that person should also have to prove \ntheir tax obligations have been fulfilled prior to adjusting their \nstatus.\n  Again, I thank the bill managers and urge the adoption of this \namendment.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nMcCain that requires the collection of back taxes from those who have \nworked in our country illegally and seek future adjusted status.\n  As one of the Founders of our Nation, Benjamin Franklin, wisely \nacknowledged long ago, ``In this world, nothing is certain but death \nand taxes.'' All individuals enjoying the American lifestyle have to \npay taxes. As burdensome, painful, and onerous as the process may be, \nanyone who lives and works in the United States has the responsibility \nto pay Uncle Sam. The people whose legal status is affected by this \nbill should be no different. If they have worked in our country \nillegally, they should not get a free-ride when it comes to paying the \ntax obligations they have avoided for the time that they have been \nhere.\n  Undocumented aliens who seek to assimilate into our society and want \nto become American citizens have high hurdles to overcome--and that is \nthe way it should be. Those who want to become a part of our great \ncountry must come out of the shadows, tell us who they are, pay heavy \nfines, return to their country, learn English, consistently hold a job, \nfollow the law, and they should also have to pay their tax obligations. \nThere is no doubt that these requirements will be difficult to achieve \nfor those seeking adjusted status--both practically and financially. \nHowever, this additional requirement is absolutely necessary. Payment \nof back taxes for unauthorized work is not only financially critical, \nit is morally right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1158\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I just want to, in perhaps less than 5 \nminutes, address the amendment we are going to vote on in a little bit, \nat 12:35. It is a simple amendment.\n  There is existing Federal law which says that municipalities may not \nrestrict in any way--the language is very clear--in any way prohibit or \nrestrict any governmental entity from sharing information with Federal \nauthorities about immigration status. It is the law. The law says you \ncan't restrict from sending, maintaining, or exchanging. What has \nhappened is that some cities--referred to as so-called sanctuary \ncities--have adopted policies to circumvent what has been Federal law \nsince 1996. I want my colleagues to understand that this is an \namendment to a bill that, if passed, will end the need for sanctuary \ncities. If passed, this bill will allow folks to come out of the \nshadows and into the light. The only folks who won't come into the \nlight will be those folks who have criminal problems. In other words, \nif this bill is passed with this amendment, it will allow folks to come \nout of the shadows, a concept that I support, and I want to make sure \nwe do the right thing.\n  In the existing bill, we are telling employers they cannot create a \nsanctuary, they cannot create a haven for illegal aliens. We are saying \nto them that if they do, they will be penalized. If we do that, we \nshould also then go to those cities or communities which are creating \nthese sanctuaries and say to them that everyone is going to follow the \nrule of law, everyone is going to.\n  I think one of the challenges we face in getting the public to accept \nwhat we are trying to do is that there is a sense that somehow we are \nnot following the rule of law. So this is very simple. If we are \ntelling employers that they cannot provide a sanctuary, that they \ncannot shield individuals, then we have to tell the same thing to \ncities and to communities.\n  Lastly, there are those who say: Well, this is going to impact crime \nvictims. The reality is that these sanctuary cities protect criminals. \nThey are not limited. It protects criminals. So if we pass the \nunderlying bill, folks can come out of the shadows. And for those who \nwant to stay in the shadows, they should not get sanctuary by a city \npolicy that is in contravention to existing Federal law. I believe \nthose policies violate existing Federal law and in doing so protect \ncriminals.\n  Let's uphold the rule of law. Let's do what is the right thing and \nthe fair thing, and let's support this amendment, which, again, very \nsimply--very simply--requires cities and communities to comply with \nwhat has been Federal law since 1996. Let's tell the public that this \nbill is about respecting the law at every phase.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment to get rid of this \nconcept of sanctuary cities.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield the \nlast minute and a half to the Senator from Colorado. Would he be \nwilling to do that?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota for \nyielding me a minute and a half of time. I come to the floor to speak \nagainst his amendment, No. 1158. At the end of the day, what his \namendment would do--it appears to be innocuous on its face--it would \nessentially make cops out of emergency room workers, out of school \nteachers, and out of local and State cops.\n  The reality is that we have a responsibility at the Federal \nGovernment to make sure we are enforcing our immigration laws as a \nnational government. We ought not to put emergency room workers, we \nought not to put school teachers in a position where they have to be \nthe cops of our immigration laws in our country. New York City Mayor \nBloomberg, in his own statement in opposition to this amendment, said:\n\n       New York City cooperates fully with the Federal Government \n     when an illegal immigrant commits a criminal act. But our \n     city's social services, health and education policies are not \n     designed to facilitate the deportation of otherwise law-\n     abiding citizens.\n\n  Do we want somebody by the name of Martinez simply to go into an \nemergency room and to have that emergency room responder be in a \nposition where he has to act as a cop because he suspects somebody \nnamed Martinez might be illegal?\n  This is a bad amendment. It will create problems. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1186\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 1186, offered by \nthe Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Hawaii. Could we \ndelay the 1 minute? I ask unanimous consent we delay the 1 minute for \n30 seconds.\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I thank the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Akaka. He has brought to the \nSenate the fact that there are about 20,000 immediate relatives of \ncourageous Filipino families who served with American forces in World \nWar II. They would be entitled under the other provisions of the bill \nto come here to the United States. This particular proposal moves this \nin a more expeditious way. These are older men and women who have been \nmembers of families who served with American fighting forces in World \nWar II. He offered this before. It was accepted unanimously. I hope the \nSenate will accept a very wise, humane, and decent amendment by the \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for bringing this \nforward. My amendment seeks to address and resolve an immigration issue \nthat, while rooted in a set of historical circumstances that occurred \nmore than seven decades ago, still, and sadly, remains unresolved \ntoday. It is an issue of great concern to all Americans who care about \njustice and fairness. It goes back to 1941, when President Roosevelt \nissued an Executive order, drafting more than 200,000 Filipino citizens \ninto the United States military. During the course of the war, it was \nunderstood that the Filipino soldiers would be treated like their \nAmerican comrades in arms and be eligible for the same benefits. But \nthis has never occurred.\n  In 1990, the World War II service of Filipino veterans was finally \nrecognized by the U.S. Government and they were offered an opportunity \nto obtain U.S. citizenship. Today we have 7,000 Filipino World War II \nveterans in the United States. The opportunity to obtain U.S. \ncitizenship was not extended to the veterans' sons and daughters, about \n20,000 of whom have been waiting for their visas for years.\n  While the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 raises \nthe worldwide ceiling for family-based visas, the fact remains that \nmany of the naturalized Filipino World War II veterans residing in the \nUnited States are in their eighties and nineties, and their children \nshould be able to come to America to take care of their parents. My \namendment makes this possible. I urge my colleagues to support my \namendment and to make this come through for our Filipino veterans and \ntheir families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 1186, offered by Senator \nAkaka.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that my vote be \nchanged from ``nay'' to ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1158\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand there is 2 minutes evenly \ndivided. I yield our minute to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order there will be 2 \nminutes equally divided on amendment 1158, offered by the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want my colleagues to listen. I want my \ncolleagues to understand there is nothing in this amendment that \nrequires teachers, hospital workers, anyone, to do anything. What it \nsimply does is it lifts a gag order. It lifts a policy and a practice \nin some cities that gags police officers from doing their duty, from \ncomplying with what has been Federal law since 1996.\n  There is no requirement that anybody do anything. It lifts the gag \norder. There was testimony by Houston police officer John Nichols \nbefore the House Judiciary subcommittee. He said this: When we shackle \nlaw enforcement officers in such a manner, instead of protecting U.S. \ncitizens and people here legally, the danger to society greatly \nincreases by allowing potentially violent criminals to freely roam our \nstreets.\n  If the underlying bill is passed, there should be no need for \nsanctuary cities. The only folks who will want to remain in the shadows \nwill be those who do not want anyone to know they are in the shadows. \nThese present sanctuary cities, if the law passes, will protect \ncriminals, and we should again get rid of the gag order. That is all \nthis amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this amendment undoes what State and \nlocal police have long sought to do, separate their activities from \nthose of Federal immigration orders, because they understand some of \nthe toughest law enforcement people in this country want the freedom to \nbe able to communicate with immigrant communities so they come forth \nand talk about crimes. The standard the Senator offers here is probable \ncause. Probable cause what? Based on what? My surname, Menendez? \nSalazar? Martinez? Probable cause how? The way I look? Probable cause, \nthe accent I have? Is that the probable cause that leads an ambulance \nworker or a municipal hospital worker to ask when somebody is being \nrolled in? This leads to the opportunity for racial profiling. This \nleads to the opportunity when we have disease spreading, such as \ntuberculosis, for people, not coming forth to report themselves, this \nleads to a woman who has been the subject of domestic violence not \nreporting herself. This is clearly not in the interest of our country. \nI believe it is discriminatory. It leads to racial profiling. It is not \nnecessary for the pursuit of law enforcement.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1158.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I do \nnot intend to object--my friend from Connecticut has an amendment that \ndeals with family reunification. We have several other amendments--\nSenator Menendez and Senator Clinton have other amendments--dealing \nwith family and family reunification. This is going to be a very \nimportant aspect in terms of our debate and the completion of this \nlegislation.\n  It is our intention to try to consider these amendments in \nrelationship with each other at the appropriate time. We will work with \nthe proponents of each of these amendments. So I will not object, but I \nwould also put in the queue, so to speak, the other--I see Senator \nMenendez on the Senate floor. He will probably put his in. And we would \nthen put in, I guess, Senator Clinton's amendment as well.\n  That is for the general information about how we are going to \nproceed. But I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill not object--if the Senator from Massachusetts would yield for a \nmoment for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I have been waiting on the floor of \nthe Senate most of the day to offer an amendment related to families. I \nwill not be objecting to Senator Dodd's, which I am a cosponsor of as \nwell. The question is, I assume the Senator may be going to an \namendment, after Senator Dodd's, on the other side of the aisle, and \nthen I would hope we could come back and that my amendment would be \nnext in order--after the next Republican amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we thought we would try to take Senator \nDodd's and yours, and then take two Republican amendments.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. That would be fine with me. Thank you.\n  I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment will be set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, and \n     Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 1199 to \n     amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I have spoken about the amendment already, \nlast evening. Again, I have talked to Senator Graham of South Carolina \nand the Senator from Massachusetts, the manager of this legislation on \nthe floor. My understanding is, at an appropriate time we will have an \nopportunity to actually vote on these amendments.\n  Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment to the immigration bill \nwith my good friend from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, that relates to \nthe parents of U.S. citizens. My amendment is simple in what it \nproposes but enormously important in what it seeks to accomplish.\n  It prevents this bill from dividing millions of American families by \nmaking it easier for U.S. citizens and their parents to unite. As \ncurrently written, this bill weakens the principle of family \nreunification in a way that is harmful to our nation and unfair to our \nfellow citizens.\n  Under current law, parents are defined as immediate relatives and \nexempt from green card caps. Yet this bill drastically and \nirresponsibly excludes parents from the nuclear family and subjects \nthem to excessively low green card caps and an overly restrictive visa \nprogram.\n  This amendment rights this wrong by increasing the new annual cap on \ngreen cards for parents of U.S. citizens; extending the duration of the \nparent visitor visa; and ensuring that penalties imposed on overstays \nare not borne collectively.\n  The debate on this provision goes to the heart of how a family is \ndefined in America. For millions of American citizens, parents are not \ndistant relatives but absolutely vital members of the nuclear family \nwho play a critical role, be it as grandparents providing care for \ntheir grandchildren while their parents are at work or as sources of \nstrength and support for their bereaved or single children.\n  Ensuring that parents have every opportunity to unite with their \nchildren or live with them for extended periods is important not only \nbecause of their contribution to the nuclear family but also so that \ntheir children can support and care for them in sickness and in health.\n  We all know that sense of duty from our own lives. And for those of \nus who have lost our parents, we wish we had the opportunity to do so.\n  That is exactly why it has been our policy to date to allow U.S. \ncitizens to sponsor their parents to come to this country without caps. \nYet now we are told that parents are no longer immediate relatives and \nsubject to caps. That parents no longer fit in the same category of \nrelatives as minor children and spouses, an idea that millions of \nAmericans would disagree with.\n  We are told that we must weaken that principle, thus disrupting the \nlives of countless law-abiding families, in the name of reducing \n``chain migration.'' Well, that is a red herring. The truth is that \nonce parents of citizens obtain immigrant visas, they usually complete \nthe family unit and are unlikely to sponsor others.\n  That is why today we must do justice to the families of our fellow \ncitizens who seek nothing more than to keep their families intact. This \namendment does just that.\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\n  First, it increases the new green card cap from 40,000 to 90,000. \nNinety thousand is the average number of green cards issued each year \nto parents who as I mentioned have to date been exempt from caps. Again \nthis is just an average. Last year the number was 120,000.\n  It is abundantly clear that 40,000 green cards per year is an \nunreasonably low number. One of the goals of this bill is to clear the \nbacklog on immigrant visa applicants which in some cases extends as far \nback as 22 years. If we don't allot sufficient numbers of green cards \nfor parents in this bill, we risk creating a whole new category of \nbacklog. Ninety thousand would meet this need.\n  To those who still think 90,000 is too high a number, I would also \nargue that it is simply not the place of the Senate to tell our fellow \ncitizens that they should wait a year or two to see their parents. I \nwould ideally not want the parents of any citizen of this country \nsubject to caps but working within the framework of this bill, I \nbelieve 90,000 is entirely fair and reasonable.\n  Second, it extends the parent visitor visa to allow for an aggregate \nstay of 180 days per year and makes it valid for 3 years and renewable. \nThese are already accepted timeframes for the validity of a visa. Madam \nPresident, 180 days is the length of a tourist visa; H-1Bs are valid \nfor 3 years. This would allow those parents who do not want to \npermanently leave their countries of residence yet want to stay with \ntheir children in the U.S. for extended periods the ability to do so.\n  The current bill however limits the length of this visa to only 30 \ndays per year--30 days. This is far too soon to pry parents away, \nparticularly those who come to America for health reasons, or to care \nfor their children during and after childbirth.\n  Many parents who live abroad, come to the United States at great \nexpense. They often come from thousands of miles away just to be with \ntheir children and grandchildren. To limit them to a 30-day visit per \nyear is simply unacceptable, especially when under a tourist visa, an \nindividual can come to this country for 6 months.\n  To think that a parent can only be with his or her child or \ngrandchild for 1 month out of 12 is simply unacceptable. Yet under this \nprovision, a tourist can be in America six times longer than a parent \nof a citizen. That is not the America I know. That is not an America \nthat cherishes family values.\n  Third, and finally, this amendment prevents collective punishment for \nparent visa overstays. Under this bill, if the overstay rate exceeds 7 \npercent for two years, either all nationals of countries with high \noverstay rates can be barred or the entire program can terminated.\n  Needless to say, this form of collective punishment is patently wrong \nand unjust. We should never punish law abiding individuals on account \nof the misdeeds of others.\n  Under this bill, for example, a sponsor could be barred from \nsponsoring his widowed mother because his father at some earlier date \noverstayed his visa. That is not the type of law we want on our books. \nThat is not what this country is about. Nor is it about stopping \nthousands of parents from entering this country because of the misdeeds \nof some.\n  This my amendment will unite and strengthen the families of our \nfellow Americans and the fabric of our society, while upholding the \nbest traditions of this great country. Because as we all know, families \nare the backbone of our country. Their unity promotes our collective \nstability, health, and productivity and contributes to the economic and \nsocial welfare of the United States.\n  My amendment does not strike at this bill's core; nor should it be a \npartisan issue. It is one of basic humanity and fairness for our fellow \ncitizens.\n  What is at stake here is whether Congress should dictate to U.S. \ncitizens if and when they can unite with their parents; if and when \ntheir parents can come and be with their grandchildren; if and when \nU.S. citizens can care for their sick parents here on American soil.\n  It is our duty to remove as many obstacles as we can for our fellow \ncitizens to be with their parents. None of us would stand for anyone \ndictating the terms of that union to us. Why should we then apply a \ndouble standard for other citizens of this country? We must craft a law \nthat is tough yet just.\n  I urge my colleagues not to think of this amendment in terms of \nnumbers and caps, but in terms of its all too real and painful human \nimpact for U.S. citizens.\n  I urge them to vote for this amendment and to take down the \nlegislative barrier that this bill has stood up between our fellow \ncitizens and their parents.\n  Again, at the appropriate time, I will ask for a recorded vote on \nthis amendment. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for allowing us \nto get in the queue here so that when these matters come up for votes, \nwe will be able to consider them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HALEH ESFANDIARI\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. Res. 214 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 214) calling upon the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran to immediately release Dr. Haleh \n     Esfandiari.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this resolution brings to the Senate's \nattention the ongoing plight of Dr. Haleh Esfandiari. Dr. Esfandiari is \nthe director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars here in Washington, DC. She holds \ndual citizenship with the United States and Iran and visits her ailing \n93-year-old mother twice a year in Iran.\n  During her return to the United States on her last visit, Dr. \nEsfandiari's vehicle was robbed by three knife-wielding men. She lost \nher luggage and her travel documents. Later, when she requested the \nreplacement documents, agents of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence began \nto question her for hours over the course of several days. The Ministry \nof Intelligence asked Dr. Esfandiari questions about her work and her \nwork at the Woodrow Wilson International Center. The Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center supplied exhaustive material about her education \nand information about her mission.\n  Dr. Esfandiari was essentially kept under house arrest for 10 weeks. \nOn May 7 she was informed she must return to the Intelligence Ministry \non May 8. Upon honoring the summons, Dr. Esfandiari was immediately \ntaken into custody and jailed. She has been denied contact with her \nfamily, her attorneys, and the outside world. Earlier this week, news \nreports stated that Dr. Esfandiari is suspected of espionage and \nsupporting the ``soft revolution'' against the regime in Iran.\n  Dr. Esfandiari is well known and well respected as a Middle East \nscholar. She has dedicated her professional career to bringing people \ntogether from the West to gain greater understanding of the Middle East \nand to gain common ground.\n  Increasingly, Iran has begun to stifle debate among different people \nand international exchanges.\n  The Department of State has called upon the Iranians to release Dr. \nEsfandiari. I am joined in this resolution by Senators Mikulski, Biden, \nLieberman, Smith, Clinton, and Dodd, which encourages the State \nDepartment to keep up the pressure on the Iranians to do the right \nthing and release Dr. Esfandiari.\n  I also wish to recognize the solid effort of the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center and its staff, led by our former colleague in the \nHouse of Representatives, Lee Hamilton, for its steadfast support of \nDr. Esfandiari.\n  Finally, I wish to express my support for Dr. Esfandiari's family \nduring this trying time. She has a strong family and dozens of caring \nfriends who refuse to give up her plight and refuse to let the Iranians \nsuppress a beacon of peace and understanding.\n  This is outrageous. The Iranians need to do the right thing and allow \nher to return home here in the United States.\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\nI can tell my colleagues that this body needs to stand in strong \nopposition to what the Iranians are doing, urging them to release this \nU.S. citizen so she can return here to her home.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating there to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 214) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 214\n\n       Whereas Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, Ph.D., holds dual citizenship \n     in the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran;\n       Whereas Dr. Esfandiari taught Persian language and \n     literature for many years at Princeton University, where she \n     inspired untold numbers of students to study the rich Persian \n     language and culture;\n       Whereas Dr. Esfandiari is a resident of the State of \n     Maryland and the Director of the Middle East Program at the \n     Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in \n     Washington, D.C. (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Wilson Center'');\n       Whereas, for the past decade, Dr. Esfandiari has traveled \n     to Iran twice a year to visit her ailing 93-year-old mother;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, on her return to the airport \n     during her last visit to Iran, Dr. Esfandiari was robbed by 3 \n     masked, knife-wielding men, who stole her travel documents, \n     luggage, and other effects;\n       Whereas, when Dr. Esfandiari attempted to obtain \n     replacement travel documents in Iran, she was invited to an \n     interview by a representative of the Ministry of Intelligence \n     of Iran;\n       Whereas Dr. Esfandiari was interrogated by the Ministry of \n     Intelligence for hours on many days;\n       Whereas the questioning of the Ministry of Intelligence \n     focused on the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center;\n       Whereas Dr. Esfandiari answered all questions to the best \n     of her ability, and the Wilson Center also provided extensive \n     information to the Ministry in a good faith effort to aid Dr. \n     Esfandiari;\n       Whereas the harassment of Dr. Esfandiari increased, with \n     her being awakened while napping to find 3 strange men \n     standing at her bedroom door, one wielding a video camera, \n     and later being pressured to make false confessions against \n     herself and to falsely implicate the Wilson Center in \n     activities in which it had no part;\n       Whereas Lee Hamilton, former United States Representative \n     and president of the Wilson Center, has written to the \n     President of Iran to call his attention to Dr. Esfandiari's \n     dire situation;\n       Whereas Mr. Hamilton repeated that the Wilson Center's \n     mission is to provide forums to exchange views and opinions \n     and not to take positions on issues, nor try to influence \n     specific outcomes;\n       Whereas the lengthy interrogations of Dr. Esfandiari by the \n     Ministry of Intelligence of Iran stopped on February 14, \n     2007, but she heard nothing for 10 weeks and was denied her \n     passport;\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2007, Dr. Esfandiari honored a summons \n     to appear at the Ministry of Intelligence, whereby she was \n     taken immediately to Evin prison, where she is currently \n     being held; and\n       Whereas the Ministry of Intelligence has implicated Dr. \n     Esfandiari and the Wilson Center in advancing the alleged aim \n     of the United States Government of supporting a ``soft \n     revolution'' in Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate calls upon the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran to immediately release Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, \n     replace her lost travel documents, and cease its harassment \n     tactics; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the United States Government, through all appropriate \n     diplomatic means and channels, should encourage the \n     Government of Iran to release Dr. Esfandiari and offer her an \n     apology; and\n       (B) the United States should coordinate its response with \n     its allies throughout the Middle East, other governments, and \n     all appropriate international organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6598-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6598-S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nDurbin, Clinton, Dodd, Obama, Akaka, Lautenberg, and Inouye be added as \ncosponsors of this amendment, along with Senator Hagel and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, the legislation currently before us \ncurtails the ability of American citizens, or U.S. permanent residents, \nto petition for their families to be reunified here in America. Right \nnow, if the bill goes untouched, this bill sets two different standards \nfor groups of people, and it sets it in a way that is fundamentally \nunfair. One group is those who have followed the law and obeyed the \nrules by having their U.S. citizen relative or U.S. lawful permanent \nresident petition to bring them into this country legally, and one more \nfavorably--it treats the next group much more favorably, one who has \nentered or remained in the country without proper documentation. So \nthose who have obeyed the rules, followed the law, relatives of U.S. \ncitizens, get treated in an inferior way to those who have not followed \nthe law, who get treated in a better way. Let me explain how.\n  The Menendez-Hagel amendment simply states that at a minimum, the two \ngroups should be treated equally under the bill. Our amendment is about \nfundamental fairness. All this amendment does is to make sure both \ngroups face the same cutoff date.\n  Right now, those who are in our Nation in an undocumented status are \nallowed under the bill to potentially earn permanent residency so long \nas they entered this country before January 1, 2007. All our amendment \nsays is that those who followed the rules who are waiting outside of \nthe country who are the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens shouldn't \nbe treated worse because they obeyed the law and followed the rules. \nThey should at least be treated the same, not worse. Therefore, they \nshould have the same date: January 1, 2007. All this amendment does is \nsimply apply the same standard, the same cutoff date to those who \nfollowed the rules so that those who did obey the law and who legally \napplied for their green card can potentially earn permanent residency \nso long as they apply for their visa before January 1, 2007.\n  Now, this is a somewhat complicated issue, so let me explain exactly \nwhat the legislation as it is currently drafted does if we don't adopt \nthis amendment. Right now, there is a family\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\nbacklog of people who have applied for legal permanent residency. These \nare the people waiting outside of the country, waiting as they are \nclaimed and have their petitions by a U.S. citizen or permanent \nresident saying: I want to bring my father or my mother here. I want to \nbring my child here. I want to bring my brother or sister here. This \nlegislation, as currently drafted, does away with the rights of U.S. \ncitizens to make that claim if, in fact, those individuals have not \nfiled their application before May 1, 2005.\n  It is important to pay attention to that May 1, 2005 date because it \nis nearly 2 years before the cutoff for people who are here in an \nundocumented status--those who didn't follow the law, obey the rules, \nand those who may obviously have no U.S. citizen to claim them. So it \nactually says to a U.S. citizen and a U.S. permanent resident: You have \nan inferior right and a right that is now lost because it exists under \nthe law as it is today. That right is lost, and your right is inferior \nto the rights of those individuals who have not followed the rules and \nobeyed the law. So as this bill seeks to clear the legal family \nbacklog, we say: Don't treat a U.S. citizen worse. Don't treat a U.S. \ncitizen worse. The legislation as currently drafted sets this arbitrary \ndate of May 1, 2005, yet gives everybody else who didn't follow the law \nthe date of January 1, 2007. That means a lot of family gets cut off. \nThe rights of U.S. citizens get cut off as well.\n  Right now, the legislation also says that if you overstayed a visa or \ncame to this country without proper documentation before January 1, \n2007, you can ultimately become a lawful, permanent resident between \nthe 9th and 13th year of the process that the bill describes. But if \nyou applied for a visa outside of the country and you applied by a U.S. \ncitizen or permanent resident and you followed the rules, there is no--\nno--guarantee you will ever be able to be reunified with your family.\n  Our amendment would remedy this injustice by moving the cutoff date \nfor those who legally applied for visas to January 1, 2007--the same \ncutoff date that is currently set for the legalization of undocumented \nimmigrants. And we would add the appropriate number of green cards to \nensure we don't create a new backlog or cause the 8-year deadline for \nclearing the family backlog to slip by a few years. So we stay within \nthe framework of the underlying bill; we just bring justice and \nfairness to the bill for those who have obeyed the law, followed the \nrules, and are the family members of U.S. citizens.\n  Now, why shouldn't legal applicants be able to keep their place in \nline if they applied before January of 2007? Clearly, this legislation, \nas it is currently written, is unfair to those who legally applied for \na visa. The legislation unfairly says that those who followed the rules \nlose their place in line. The legislation unfairly says that those who \nfollowed the rules will have to wait at least an additional 8 years \nbefore they even become eligible to compete--eligible to compete--for a \nnew proposed merit-based green card. The legislation unfairly says that \nthose who followed the rules would have to wait a total of 10 years in \naddition to the time they have been waiting--in addition to the time \nthey have been waiting--before they are eligible to compete under a new \nand different system, with a different set of rules, and no guarantee \nthey will ever be able to be reunited with their family member, that \nU.S. citizen or permanent resident. Clearly, at a minimum, we should \nallow those who played by the rules to have the same cutoff date of \nJanuary 1, 2007.\n  Now, not only is it unfair to make people who follow the rules wait \nlonger than those who chose not to, it is also wrong to make people who \napplied under our current system have to reapply under a totally \ndifferent one. Those who applied on May 1, 2005, or after, applied \nunder our current immigration system that values family ties and \nemployment at a premium, unlike under this bill, would now be subject \nto a completely different standard that is primarily concerned with \neducation and skill levels. This is like changing the rules of the game \nhalfway through it. People who applied after May 2005 would not only \nlose credit for the up to 2 years they have been waiting under the \nlegal process, they would also have to apply under a completely \ndifferent system than the one under which they originally applied.\n  Now, let's think of how fundamentally unfair that is.\n  In this photo is the late Marine LCpl Jose Antonio Gutierrez, a \npermanent resident of the United States--the first American casualty in \nthe war in Iraq. For people similar to the late Jose Antonio Gutierrez \nwho served their country, for them, under this bill--he was not only \nhere legally but was serving his country--oh, no, you apply for your \nfamily by May 1, 2005, or, sorry, we will give those people who don't \nfollow the rules and obey the law a preference. But you, who served \nyour country, you who wore the uniform, you who have done everything \nright--no, you have an inferior right.\n  Is that the legacy we leave to people who have served their country, \na legal permanent resident? Sometimes people don't even know we have \nlegal permanent residents fighting in the service of the United \nStates--tens of thousands. That is fundamentally unfair.\n  In this photo is another group of lawful permanent residents, ``first \ncalled to duty.'' They were in different services of the Armed Forces \nof the United States, serving their country, in harm's way. Guess what. \nUnder the bill, you have family abroad, you applied for them, you did \nthe right thing, and you told them to wait. After May 1, 2005, sorry, \nCharlie, your right is gone, just like that. Your value and service \ndoesn't matter. All these soldiers, sailors, and marines--all different \nservices--all of them are ultimately serving their country.\n  Under this bill, we take people such as them, and so many others, and \nvitiate their rights. That is fundamentally unfair. These people not \nonly are serving our country abroad, they are protecting our airports, \nour seaports, and our borders. They risk their lives in Afghanistan and \nIraq and around the world to protect us at home. To petition for your \nsister to come to live with you in America, you lose that right if you \nfiled after May 1, 2005. You didn't do the right thing, but you get the \nbenefit of 2 years more than those who obeyed the laws and followed the \nrules--brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers. \nIt is hard to imagine that one would have that right taken away from \nthem.\n  Here is another case for you to consider. You are a U.S. citizen, you \nhave paid your taxes, you have served your Nation, you attend church, \nand you make a good living. You are a good citizen. You petition to \nhave your adult child come to America, but you did so after the \narbitrary date of May 1, 2005. Under this bill, that U.S. citizen would \nlose their right. However, those undocumented in the country after May \n1, 2005, get a benefit. It is hard to imagine, but it is true.\n  Right now, this bill is unfair and nonsensical, capriciously \npunishing those who have followed the rules and legally applied for a \ngreen card. What message, then, do we send? I have heard a lot about \nthe rule of law, a lot about waiting in line, a lot about all those who \nshould have followed our immigration laws. Yet what message does the \nbill send? You followed it, but your rights are vitiated, taken away--\nnot the rights of the family member waiting abroad to come here, it is \nthe rights of the U.S. citizen to make the claim for that individual. \nThat is what bothers me about the underlying legislation. They are \ntaking my right away and your right away as a U.S. citizen.\n  We must make sure that people who have played by the rules and \nlegally applied to immigrate here are not arbitrarily placed at a \ndisadvantage in respect to those who are in this country in an \nundocumented status. As I have said many times before, comprehensive \nimmigration reform must be tough but must also be practical and fair \nand tough on border security. Certainly, we have done that here--this \nbill even moved more to the right--by providing a pathway to earned \ncitizenship.\n  At the same time, we have to be fair by rewarding those who have \nfollowed the law. I think we have to remain true to those principles. \nLet me give you a little sense of this. I have heard a lot about chain \nmigration. You know, it is interesting, we have seen during history \nthat when we want to dehumanize something, take out the humanity of \nsomething, when we want to make it an abstract object, we find a word \nor a\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\nphrase for it, such as chain migration. I have heard a lot about what a \n``nuclear family'' is and is not.\n  I will use these paperclips to demonstrate this. I always thought a \nmother or father, son or daughter, brother and sister was not a chain; \nI thought that was a circle of strength. It is a circle of strength \nwithin our community. It is a sense of what our society is all about, \nregardless of what altar you worship at, what creed you believe in. I \nthought, when I heard the speeches of family values on the floor, that \nthis was a circle of strength and dignity and the very essence of what \nis essential for our communities to grow and prosper.\n  What does this bill do? It says that is not a value--a mother, \nfather, son, daughter, brother, sister. It is not a value. That is what \nthis bill does. Let me tell you what family values have meant to this \ncountry. Here on the chart are names of Americans who had immigrant \nparents. A lot of them probably could not have come to this country \nunder the bill as proposed. Look at what their offspring have provided \nfor this country.\n\n  A gentleman known as General Petraeus happens to be leading our \nefforts in Iraq. He is our big hope to turn it around. He had immigrant \nparents.\n  Thomas Edison, from my home State of New Jersey, Menlo Park, invented \nelectricity. He may not have been the originator of that in this \ncountry if his parents had not come here.\n  Martin Sheen, from the show ``West Wing,'' would not have been here \nunder this bill.\n  Jonas Salk invented the polio vaccine, which was a great achievement. \nHis parents would have likely not made it here under this bill.\n  Colin Powell, former Secretary of State, former chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff--he is somebody who is admired on both sides of the \naisle--he would not have made it here under this bill.\n  Antonin Scalia--I may not agree with him all the time, but he is a \ndistinguished member of the Supreme Court of the United States. Several \nof these names you might recognize as Republicans. He would not have \nlikely made it here under the bill as proposed; Carl Sandburg, a great \npoet, who wrote of our humanity as a people; the late Peter Jennings, \nwho talked to us every night on television.\n  These are all people who have contributed in so many different ways \nto our country because their parents came to America. Family values \nhave enriched America.\n  Let me give you another group of citizens. These, unlike those others \nwho were born in the United States, are naturalized U.S. citizens, \nmeaning they weren't born in this country. They came here through the \nimmigration process of our country. I would like to think some of them \nhave contributed some good things:\n  The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger. I am not sure he \nwould have made it into this country; Henry Kissinger, former Secretary \nof State; Ted Koppel, who brought us the news on ``Nightline:'' Levi \nStrauss, you have probably worn his products; Desi Arnez, one of my \nfavorites, a Cuban immigrant, who loved Lucy every day on national TV; \nBob Hope was a naturalized U.S. citizen. He brought an enormous amount \nof joy to our service men and women across the globe; Patrick Ewing, a \ngreat basketball player; Oscar de la Renta, a great designer; Liz \nClaiborne; Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State; Albert \nEinstein. His parents never would have made it under this bill; Andrew \nCarnegie of the Carnegie Foundation; Joseph Pulitzer, of Pulitzer Prize \nfame; Michael J. Fox, who talks to us every day about the necessity for \nstem cell research and the incredible challenges of Americans with \nParkinson's. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n  The list goes on and on. The bottom line is that under this bill, so \nmany of those, such as General Petraeus, Colin Powell, Thomas Edison, \nand Antonin Scalia, whose parents came to this country and therefore \ngave them the opportunity to be born in America, they would not have \nmade it under this bill. Family values. Those who did not have the good \nfortune to be born here, but because their parents immigrated here, \nwere naturalized U.S. citizens. They have contributed greatly.\n  So let's not dehumanize this reality. This isn't about ``chain \nmigration.'' This isn't about some abstract sense of how we try to \nchange a very important concept--family, family values, reunification, \nstrengthening communities, and having great Americans who have altered \nthe course of history and made this country the greatest experiment and \ncountry in the history of the world.\n  Our amendment simply says to all those who have espoused family \nvalues, it is time to put your vote with your values. It says don't \nsnuff out the right of a U.S. citizen or a U.S. permanent resident, \nthese guys in this picture--don't snuff out their right, all permanent \nresidents of the U.S. originally, don't snuff out their rights to be \nable to claim family members. Don't treat those of us who are U.S. \ncitizens and legal permanent residents worse than those people who \ndidn't obey the law, follow the rules, and came into the country. Don't \ndo this. At least treat us equally. At least treat us equally.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from New \nJersey and the passion and value he brings to this debate; it is \ntremendous, and we are all better for it. I am grateful to him.\n  I rise this afternoon to, once again, discuss the dire need we have \nin this country and in our communities for comprehensive immigration \nreform. I do believe the debate on immigration reform has been the kind \nof meaningful, bipartisan approach in the Senate--with Senators Kyl and \nKennedy working together, Senator McConnell and Leader Reid working \ntogether--this is a bipartisan approach and the debate the American \npeople expect out of the Senate.\n  I am proud we are moving forward on it because of the immediate need \nbut also the way we are going about this process.\n  Despite the Senate's success in producing a bipartisan bill last \nyear, the issue still has not been resolved. There is still much to be \nquestioned, and we are working through that.\n  The majority of my colleagues will agree that our Nation's current \nimmigration system is badly broken, it is out of date, and it \ndesperately needs to be fixed. I plan to look for any plan that we can \nsupport that is tough and practical and fair in dealing with this ever-\nincreasing issue.\n  Without a doubt, the top priority must be the safety and security of \nour country, as well as the economic needs of industry, U.S. citizens, \nand immigrants. But most importantly, the security issue is one of our \ntop priorities.\n  I am so pleased the underlying bill includes triggers to require that \nBorder Patrol agents are significantly increased and vehicle barriers \nand fencing are installed along the southern border with Mexico before \nany of the other provisions can even begin, making sure that we are \ntaking care of what we know we can do and we can do quickly.\n  I believe this bill is a work in progress, though, just as any other \nbill we bring before the Senate--working hard through the committee \nprocess and through years of debate, but also recognizing that we are \nnot here to create a work of art but to create a work in progress. \nThrough these debates and actually through implementation, we learn \nwhat works and what doesn't work, what the current needs of our country \nare. But as we move forward with implementation, we learn the future \nneeds.\n  If we debate reform in this bill in the coming days and weeks, we \nmust also address other important issues. As I stated during last \nyear's debate, my home State of Arkansas had the largest per capita \nincrease of the Hispanic population of any State in the Nation during \nthe last census. Arkansas has become what is referred to as an emerging \nHispanic community, with largely first-generation immigrants. These \nimmigrants have had a dramatic impact on our communities and our \neconomy.\n  The majority of immigrants in my State came to the United States \nbecause they wanted an opportunity to work hard and achieve a better \nlife for themselves and for their families. However, I believe it is to \nthe detriment, oftentimes, of taxpaying Americans if we don't address \nthe millions of illegal\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\nimmigrants living in our communities. We have to do so in a practical \nway, in a realistic way of how we effectively use the tax dollars we \nhave, along with the rules and regulations and realistic barriers that \nwe can put into place to rein in the problem that exists today in this \ncountry.\n  No reform proposal should grant amnesty. Amnesty is total unqualified \nforgiveness without restitution, and no policy should provide amnesty. \nThis policy does not, nor did the one we passed in the last session of \nCongress. I don't think it is fair to the citizens of this Nation or to \nthose immigrants who do play by the rules to come into this great land. \nThose who have broken the law, including employers who knowingly hire \nillegal immigrants, must face proper recourse.\n  However, I also don't believe it is practical, wise, or even, quite \nfrankly, an economic reality to think that we can simply round up and \ndeport all of the illegal immigrants who are residing in this country \ntoday. That is why I support an approach that includes serious \nconsequences for those who are in our country illegally and yet want to \nremain. We create an earned path to citizenship and tough enforcement \npolicies for businesses and those who are working toward that \ncitizenship. We can eliminate the shadow economy that encourages \nillegal immigration.\n  According to the bill being debated, all undocumented immigrants who \narrive in the United States before January 1, 2007, will be required to \npay a hefty fine, a $5,000 fine, go to the end of the line, and wait 8 \nyears before a green card can be issued, putting into place stiff \nregulations and expectations of those who have come here against the \nrules and yet want to remain, putting them at the back of the line not \nat the front.\n  In addition, a touchback provision has been included that will \nrequire the head of a household to return to his or her country of \norigin to apply for a green card before being allowed to return. Many \nof us know how absolutely precious citizenship in this great land is. \nWhen I first ran for Congress, I can remember the first thing my father \ntold me. I was a young single woman out campaigning and pleading with \nmy fellow Arkansans in east Arkansas, people I had known ever since I \nwas born, people who had helped raise me, those I had grown up around.\n  My father said: Never, ever, ever miss an opportunity to ask someone \nfor their vote. He said: When you have something that precious, you \nwant to be asked for it.\n  Citizenship in this great country, just as that vote, is a precious \ngift, and we, as Arkansans and Americans, know that anything similar \nthat precious is worth working for.\n  That is why these provisions are important because it demonstrates \nthat citizenship is something that must be earned and is not free.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am sorry, I didn't know I had a \nrestricted time limit. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for an \nadditional 2 minutes for the Senator from Arkansas? Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I said, citizenship in this country is not free, \nand it is something that has to be earned and worked for, and that is \nwhat this bill requires.\n  I also believe any plan must consider guest workers. Many business \nleaders throughout our great State of Arkansas have told me about the \nvaluable contribution that legal immigrant workers have made to the \neconomic growth we have seen. It is my belief these workers are vital \nto sustained growth and development of many industries and farming \ncommunities throughout our land. However, we must ensure that adequate \nsafeguards are in place to prevent guest workers from taking jobs from \nU.S. workers or driving down wages and benefits for hard-working \nAmericans. We have seen that in this bill, and we will continue to work \nto strengthen it.\n  I am pleased the immigration reform legislation we are currently \ndebating contains provisions that will improve our agricultural guest \nworker program which will benefit our Nation's farmers.\n  We stand at a crossroads in this country. Over the last decade and a \nhalf, the immigrant population has expanded in every area of our \ncountry, many of them coming here legally but some not; some coming \nillegally, many of them already paying local taxes. Almost half are \npaying into Medicare and Social Security with no promise of ever \nreceiving any benefits.\n  We are faced with the decision that gets to the heart of what values \nwe hold near and dear as Americans. We have always said: If you work \nhard and play by the rules, there is a place for you in this great land \nof America to raise your children and contribute to our great melting \npot.\n  We now must consider as part of this debate what to do with those who \nhave broken the rules to come here but have since worked hard to \nprovide for their families. I hope the Senate will give this difficult \nquestion the reasoned, thorough debate it deserves.\n  The problems we face today with border security and illegal \nimmigration did not appear overnight, and they will not be solved \novernight. It is a difficult and complicated issue, and fixing it will \nnot be easy. But while I am still reviewing the provisions of this \nlegislation and reserve the right to try to improve it through the \namendment process, as others will, I believe strongly that we can work \nto complete an immigration bill this year because we no longer can \nwait.\n  I thank the majority leader and Senator McConnell. I thank Senator \nKennedy and Senator Kyl for their hard work. And I look forward to \ncontinuing our work on this bill and hopefully finding a solution to \nthis issue and doing so in a timely way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1186, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the adoption of amendment No. 1186, that it be modified \nwith the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Section 201(b)(1) (8 U.S.C. 1151(b)(1)) is amended by \n     inserting after subparagraph (G), as added by section 503 of \n     this Act, the following:\n       ``(H) Aliens who are eligible for a visa under paragraph \n     (1) or (3) of section 203(a) and who have a parent who was \n     naturalized pursuant to section 405 of the Immigration Act of \n     1990 (8 U.S.C. 1440 note).''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1181\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate and a vote in a \nfew moments is an amendment by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan. It will sunset the guest worker program at 5 years. We will \nstop at 5 years and take a look at this immigration program and decide \nwhether it is good for America, whether it is fair and just.\n  I don't believe that is an unreasonable request. I think it is the \nright thing to do, and I will be supporting that amendment.\n  I wish to speak to that amendment, but first I wish to say a word \nabout the bill.\n  Mr. President, 96 years ago, just a few miles from where we are \nmeeting, on July 18, 1911, a woman came down a gangplank in Baltimore, \nMD. She had just arrived on a voyage from Bremen, Germany. She had a 2-\nyear-old little girl in her arms and two young children, a boy and a \ngirl, by her side. She stepped foot in America in Baltimore and took a \ntrain to join up with her husband in a place called East St. Louis, IL.\n  This woman who brought these three children across the Atlantic \ndidn't speak English. She only knew that her husband was waiting 800 \nmiles away and was making her journey. That woman was my grandmother. \nThe baby in her arms was my mother. That was 96 years ago. Ninety-six \nyears later, the son of that little girl stands as a United States \nSenator from Illinois. It is a story about America.\n  This Nation is great because of the immigrants and their sons and \ndaughters who came here and made it great. I am certain that when my \nmother's family announced to their villagers in Jurbarkas, Lithuania, \nthat they were leaving for America, that they were leaving behind their \nhome, their garden, their church, their history, their language, and \ntheir culture and heading someplace where they couldn't\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\neven speak the language, I am sure as their neighbors walked away in \nthe darkness that evening they all said the same thing: They'll be \nback. They'll be back.\n  They didn't go back. They stayed here. They built America. People \nsimilar to them have been building America since the beginning.\n  This bill is about immigration. It is about a system of immigration \nthat has failed us. It has failed us because 800,000 undocumented \nillegal people pour across our southern border every year into America. \nIt has failed us because employers welcome these employees, often \npaying them dirt wages under poor conditions and say to them: We will \nuse you until we don't need you, and then you are on your own.\n  These immigrants sacrifice for themselves, send their money home, and \ndream of someday that they will have security and peace of mind. That \nis the story.\n  Sadly, we have 10 or 12 million now in our country who came that way, \nwith no legality or documentation.\n  I salute Senator Kennedy and those who brought this bill to the \nfloor. They have worked long and hard for years to deal with this issue \nhonestly. They have to fight the talk show hosts who are on every \nafternoon screaming about immigration with not one positive thought of \nwhat we can do about it. Instead, Senator Kennedy and many like him \nhave stood up and said: We will risk our political reputation by \nputting this measure before America. Let's do something and fix this \nbroken immigration system.\n  I salute them for that--for border enforcement, for workplace \nenforcement, for dealing honestly, fairly, legally, in an American way \nwith the 12 million people who are here.\n  The amendment before us addresses one part. It addresses the guest \nworker program. As written in this bill, we would allow 400,000 people \na year to come into America and work as temporary workers, and that \nnumber could increase. By action of the Senate yesterday, we reduced \nthe 400,000 to 200,000.\n  Do we need 200,000 guest workers every year in America? I don't know \nthe answer to that. I can tell you today that among college graduates \nin America, the unemployment rate is 1.8 percent. The unemployment rate \nfor high school graduates is 7 percent. It tells me that there is a \npool of untapped talent in America.\n  Do we need 200,000 people coming from overseas each year to \nsupplement our workforce? I don't know the answer to that question. \nThere are those who insist we do and some who say we don't. And that is \nwhy Senator Dorgan's amendment is important. It says we will try the \n200,000 a year for 5 years and then stop and assess where we are, what \nhas happened to wages of American workers, what has happened to \nbusinesses that need additional workers. We can make an honest \nassessment at that point. If we see American wages going down, if we \nsee the unemployment rate of Americans going up, we may want to \ncalibrate, reconsider.\n  His is a thoughtful and reasonable approach. Senator Kennedy has \nsaid, and he is right, that we establish standards of treatment for \nthese guest workers that are dramatically better than what they face \ntoday. There is gross exploitation taking place. We know that.\n  Many of these undocumented, illegal workers are treated very kindly, \nbut many are exploited. We know the stories. we hear them, we read \nabout them. We can change that, and we should. A great nation should \nnot allow people to be exploited in this way.\n\n  It is not inconsistent to say that we will have a limited number of \nguest workers, that we will treat them fairly and honestly and in a \ndecent manner, with decent wages, and then step back in 5 years and \nmake an assessment of where we are. I think that is a reasonable \napproach to take.\n  There are many positive provisions in this bill, but the one thing \nthat troubles me is the idea of guest workers being here for 2 years \nand leaving, creating a rotating class of people with little investment \nin the United States. How will that work? We already know the answer to \nthat question. That is what European nations are doing today. They are \nbringing in people from former colonies and other countries. The Turks \nare coming into Germany, Africans coming into France, but they never \nbecome part of those countries. They are always the workforce. They \nbecome angry. They become dispossessed. They riot in the streets \nbecause they have no investment in that country in which they are \nworking. They are being exploited and used. I don't want to see that \nhappen in America. I want those who are living here to be vested in \nthis country and its values and its ideals.\n  Finally, let me say that when it comes to guest workers and H-1B \nvisas, where we invite higher skilled workers, our first obligation is \nto the workers of America, those who are unemployed and those who have \nthe American dream but just need an American chance. As we look at each \nof these categories of workers, let us make certain that the first \nquestion we ask and answer is, are we dedicated to the workers and the \nfamilies across America to make sure they have a fighting chance to \nrealize the same American dream my mother realized when she came off \nthe boat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just as an inquiry, I think we are \nscheduled for a vote at 2:15; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the Senator from North Dakota.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes, \nand the Senator from North Dakota has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes, and the \nChair will let me know when I have \\1/2\\ minute remaining.\n  Mr. President, just to summarize where we are, those of us who have \nstudied this issue--and I respect all the Members of the Senate in \ngiving this consideration--recognize we have to have a comprehensive \napproach. We don't rely on any one part in order to be successful with \nthis recommendation in terms of immigration reform. We have the strong \nborder security, but with the border security we do have some \nopportunity for people to come in the front door so they are not coming \nin the back door illegally. We have tough interior enforcement because \nwe require that those individuals who are going to come in have a card. \nWe treat them fairly, we treat them well, and we provide the same kinds \nof protections for those individuals that we give to the American \nworkers. That doesn't exist today. It is an entirely different game.\n  We have to understand at the outset that the guest worker doesn't get \nin here unless there is a refusal of any American to do that job. If \nthere is any American anyplace that will do the job, they get it. Do we \nunderstand that? This is for jobs Americans will not do. We hear great \nstories about people being unemployed here and unemployed there. I \nagree with that. But the fact is, there are some jobs in the American \neconomy which Americans just will not do. I don't think that needs to \nbe debated. And there are those who will come here and will do those \njobs with the idea that, hopefully, they will have an opportunity to be \npart of the American dream. So the advertising goes out for the job \nthat is out there, and Americans can get the job. If no American wants \nit, then the opportunity is there for a guest worker.\n  We have built in here a review of the guest worker program. The \nSenator from North Dakota says: Let's do a 5- year and then end it. We \nsay: Let's take it to 18 months. I spoke earlier in the debate about \nwhat this commission does. It is made up of businessmen, it is made up \nof workers and of economists who will decide how this program is \nworking. Is there exploitation? Is it functioning? If it is working, is \nit fair? It is 18 months, and then they have to give Congress the \ninformation. They do the study, they give the information, and we \nmodify the program.\n  Under the existing program, people will go out and work for a period \nof 5 years, and they may very well earn points to become part of the \nAmerican dream. That doesn't exist in the European system. This is \nentirely different. These individuals, in 5 years, up to a million \nindividuals, earn points to become part of the American dream, but\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\nthen suddenly the Dorgan amendment pulls the strings right out from \nunder them. Down they go. Down they go. The promise to them is if they \nwork hard and play by the rules and work in very tough and menial jobs, \nthey may have an opportunity--not guaranteed, but they may have the \nopportunity to be a part of the American dream, but not under the \nDorgan amendment, under our amendment.\n  This is the way to go. We have in here the review that is essential \nand necessary. This can provide the Congress with the information of \nwhether this program is working. It has been established, and it will \nbe set up. It will be functioning, and it will give Congress the best \ninformation. We will have continuing oversight, and we will be able to \nadjust that program in ways that serve humanity and serve our economy.\n  I hope the Dorgan amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is very rare that I have such a strong \ndisagreement with my friend, Ted Kennedy, but I don't understand the \nagitation over an amendment that simply says that a program that allows \n200,000 foreign workers in here, a generalized program--this isn't \nAgJOBS, which is a specific industry program that we know we need \nbecause we know right now half the workers are foreign workers; this is \na generalized, open program, 200,000 foreign workers a year. I think \nSenator Dorgan and I and others have shown that American workers are \ngoing to be hurt by this. So why is there so much angst about \nsunsetting a program that will allow in now 200,000 people a year? It \nwas 400,000. Thanks to the Bingaman amendment, it is down. This is a \nmodest amendment. This is a sensible amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my friend to yield me 1 more minute, or 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, here is the point: You are doing no harm \nto these people. Under this bill, these people have to leave at the end \nof 6 years. They are done. So for the Senator to say this somehow hurts \npeople in the long run, it simply isn't true.\n  This is a modest amendment. It makes a lot of sense. Who knows, in 5 \nyears, we could be in a massive depression. We don't want that, but we \nare certainly not going to want to extend the program in that case. \nThis is a wise amendment, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is no social program in this country \nas important as a good job that pays well. That is just a fact. Having \na job that pays well, with some job security, is the way we expand \nopportunity in this country and allow someone to be able to take care \nof their family.\n  We are told by those who offer this legislation that there are jobs \nAmericans won't take, that we don't have enough workers and we should \nbring in workers from outside of our country. Well, it is true there \nare jobs, for example, at the lower end of the economic scale where \nbusinesses that offer those jobs don't want to pay anything for those \njobs, and so they do not have people rushing to beat down the door to \nget those jobs. They do not have to pay a decent wage for those jobs if \nthey can keep bringing in cheap labor. That is what is at work here in \nthe guest worker program. I thought supply and demand was something \nthat was cherished and embraced by the people who most strongly support \nthis. Supply and demand. So if you are having trouble finding workers \nfor a job, you raise the price, you raise the wage.\n  Do my colleagues know what is happening to workers in this country? \nTheir productivity has gone way up. We have had dramatic gains in \nproductivity by workers. Has their income gone up? No, not at all, \nespecially those at the bottom. There is downward pressure on their \nincome. Why? Because we are told we can have an almost inexhaustible \nsupply of cheap labor coming into this country.\n  Even if this bill were not on the floor, we bring in 1.2 million \npeople per year under the legal process by which people come to this \ncountry. So it is not as if there is not going to be immigration. On \ntop of that, there will be well over a million people coming in for \nagricultural jobs without this bill. But this bill says that is not \nenough, that we need additional workers to come in because we need more \nof those workers, particularly unskilled workers, at the bottom.\n  Here is what this group has put together as a plan. It is hard for me \nto see how you could come up with a plan such as this, but this is the \nplan. It used to be 400,000, but now it is 200,000. In the first year, \nwe bring in 200,000 people from outside of this country to come in and \ntake American jobs--200,000 people come on in. They can stay for 2 \nyears, by the way, and bring their family, if they want. Then they go \nhome for a year, come back for 2, go home for a year, and come back for \n2 more years. If they bring their family, they can only come twice, \nwith a year in between.\n  So here is the way it works: 200,000 come in the first year. They \nstay here for the second year. That is 200,000. Another 200,000 come \nin, perhaps their families come in. Let's go through year 10. What you \nhave, for example, in year 10 is you have 1,200,000 people here in year \n10; 11, 1,200,000 people; in year 8, you have 1,200,000 people. We are \nnot talking about 200,000 people; we are talking about millions of \npeople, including their families, coming in during this period of time \nfor the sole and exclusive purpose of taking American jobs--jobs which \nwe offer in this country and which we are told Americans will not \nperform.\n  That is simply not true, by the way. Americans will perform these \njobs if there are decent wages. But you don't have to pay decent wages \nif you can bring in people from elsewhere who are used to working for \n50 cents an hour or from Asia where they are used to working for 20 \ncents an hour and working 7 days a week, 12 and 14 hours per day. If \nyou dispute that, go to Xianxian, China, and check any of the factories \nthere and find out the conditions and the wages.\n  Well, my point is this: We will get these millions of people into \nthis country on top of the 1.2 million who will already come in \nlegally. Plus we will say to the 12 million who came in illegally that \nyou, too, now are deemed to be legal and given a work permit. On top of \nthat, we want to bring in additional guest or temporary workers. I ask \nthis question: Of these millions of people--millions of people--how \nmany of them are going to leave and go back home?\n  My colleague yesterday said that the Governor of Arizona, who \nprobably knows as much about this as any other Member of the Senate, \nhas pointed out that you can build the fence down there--talking about \nthe southern border--but if it is 49 feet high, they will have a 50-\nfoot ladder. Talk to the Arizona Governor, he says. It is a matter of \nfact that some workers will still come here illegally or legally, but \none way or another, they will come in. So much for the proposition that \nthe bill brought to the floor of the Senate solves the immigration \nproblem.\n  We are told we need a guest worker or temporary worker provision here \nbecause they are going to come anyway. Apparently, we are saying: OK, \nthey are going to come in illegally anyway because we can't stop them--\nwe don't have a provision in the bill to stop them--so we will very \ncleverly say they are guest workers and give them a permit as they come \nin. That is the bottom line here.\n  My amendment is very simple. I lost the amendment to strip out the \nguest worker provision, a provision we don't need and shouldn't need. \nIt is a provision that is the price paid to the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce for their support for this bill even as they export good \nAmerican jobs through the front door, mostly to Asia. We don't need and \nshould not support this provision. I lost my amendment the day before \nyesterday to strike this provision. This amendment I offer today says \nat least--at least let us sunset this provision in 5 years so we can \ntake a look at whether any of these promises have made any sense.\n  I was here in the Congress in 1986. I heard all the promises of the \nSimpson-\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\nMazzoli Act. None of them were true, and 3 million people got amnesty. \nThere was no border security to speak of, no employer sanctions to \nspeak of, and there was no enforcement. Now, all these years later, we \nhave 12 million people in this country without legal authorization. \nWhat do we do? We bring a new bill to the floor with border security, \nwith employer sanctions, and a guest worker provision. Nirvana.\n  The fact is, it is not going to work, regrettably, and this is the \nworst possible provision in this bill, in my judgment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve my time.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will reserve the 17 seconds unless the Senator from \nMassachusetts is ready to yield back, and then I will yield back and we \ncan vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, Members on both sides have voiced a\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\nlot of legitimate concerns about the immigration bill that we brought \nto the floor earlier this week, which is precisely what we were hoping \nfor when we decided to move forward with it. We needed to air things \nout. Many of our Republican colleagues have rightly focused on border \nsecurity and their concern that people who have broken the law can \nsomehow get away with it under the proposed legislation.\n  As we have debated this issue on the floor, the American people have \nspoken very loudly. Phones have been ringing off the hooks. If we have \nsettled anything this week, it is that Americans are not shy about \nexpressing their views on immigration. It is my hope this debate will \nmove forward until every apprehension will be addressed.\n  Now I wish to voice a concern of my own. The Constitution says: All \npersons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens, and are \ntherefore free to vote. As a corollary, we have always maintained that \nno one who is not a citizen has a right to vote. But in order to \npreserve the meaning of this pledge, we need to make sure the influence \nof those who vote legally is not diluted by those who do not; those who \ndo not abide by the laws are not free to influence our political \nprocess or our policies with the vote.\n  As we move forward on this immigration bill, we need to make sure we \nprotect voters, protect the 15th amendment by strengthening protections \nagainst illegal voting. This is the principal concern, but it is also \npractical.\n  The fundamental question we have been debating this week is what to \ndo about the fact that 12 million people in this country are here \nillegally. We would have to go back more than two decades to find a \nPresidential election in this country in which 12 million votes would \nnot have tipped the balance in the other direction.\n  Only citizens have the right to choose their elected representatives. \nRegardless of what we decide to do about these 12 million, those who \nare not here legally and are not citizens should not have the ability \nto upend the will of the American people in a free and fair election. \nThis is not fantasy. It was reported last week that hundreds of \nnoncitizens in and around San Antonio have registered to vote over the \npast several years. Most are believed to be here illegally and many are \nthought to have cast votes.\n  We have no reason to believe this practice, if true, is not being \nreplicated in other cities and towns all across our country. So the \nquestion is: Given the current reality, how do we safeguard the \nintegrity of the voting system? If these millions were eventually to \nbecome citizens, how do we propose to make sure their vote counts, that \nit isn't diluted?\n  Now the Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform, founded \nafter the 2004 election and spearheaded by former President Jimmy \nCarter and former Secretary of State Jim Baker, has already addressed \nthe problem. Here you see President Carter and former Secretary Jim \nBaker together addressing this issue as they cochaired the Federal \nElection Reform Commission. That report said, quite simply, election \nofficials need to have a way to make sure the people who show up at the \npolls are the ones on the voter lists.\n  I cannot think of anyone who would disagree with that. The solution \nthe commission proposed, the Carter-Baker Commission, is the same one I \nam proposing today as an amendment to the immigration bill.\n  In our country, photo IDs are needed to board a plane, to enter a \nFederal building, to cash a check, even to join a wholesale shopping \nclub.\n  In a nation in which 40 million people change addresses each year, in \nwhich a lot of people don't even know their neighbors, some form of \nGovernment-issued tamperproof photo ID cards should be used in \nelections as well. If they are required for buying bulk toothpaste, \nthey should be required to prove one's identity, to prove that someone \nactually has a right to vote and a right to influence the laws and \npolicies of our country. We need to ensure those who are voting are the \nsame people on the rolls and that they are legally entitled to vote. ID \ncards would do that. They would reduce irregularities dramatically and, \nin doing so, they would increase confidence in the system.\n  We have all been through elections where groups of voters questioned \nthe results based on rumors of coercion or fraud. Photo IDs would \nsubstantially limit this kind of voter skepticism and loss of faith in \nthe political process.\n  Consistent with the purpose and the aim of the 15th amendment, we \ndon't want anyone who has the right to vote to have any difficulty \nacquiring an ID. This amendment addresses this concern by establishing \na grant program for those who cannot afford a photo ID. People who \nqualify will be provided one for free, no cost. No less an advocate for \npoor Americans than Ambassador Andrew Young has said photo IDs would \nhave the added benefit of helping those who don't have drivers licenses \nor other forms of official ID to navigate an increasingly computerized \nculture. Photo IDs would make it easier to cash checks, rent movies, or \ngain access to other forms of commerce that are closed to people who \ndon't have them.\n  An overwhelming majority of Americans support this attempt to ensure \nthe integrity of our elections. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll \nlast year showed 26 percent of respondents strongly favored requiring a \nuniversal tamperproof ID at the polls. Nineteen percent said they \nmildly favored the IDs. You can do the math, Mr. President. That is 80 \npercent of the American people think this is a good idea. On issues in \nAmerica, 80/20 is about as good as it gets. Twelve percent were neutral \nand didn't have an opinion at all, only 3 percent mildly opposed, and 4 \npercent opposed. So let's add those together. We are talking about 80 \nto 7, with the rest of Americans not having a view. Ninety-three \npercent of those who were asked for their opinion were either undecided \nor in favor of implementing this control. State polls show similar \nresults. Americans are clearly divided on what to do with illegal \nimmigrants in our communities, but they seem to agree on the benefit of \nan ID.\n  Members from both sides of the aisle agree we need to address voting \nirregularities. The junior Senator from Illinois is sponsoring a bill \nthat would stiffen penalties for preventing someone from exercising his \nor her right to vote. He has already drawn 12 Democratic cosponsors. \nThe bill is meant to respond to a problem we all recognize and which we \nshould do something about by requiring photo ID for voters. Two dozen \nStates already require--that is 24 States--some form of identification \nat the polls.\n  As a result of the Help America Vote Act, photo ID is required for \nthose who register to vote by mail but who can't produce some other \nidentifying document. What I would like to do is to provide a Federal \nminimum standard that is consistent but which allows States wide \nflexibility in determining the kind of ID that is required. It doesn't \nhave to be a driver's license. It could be a hunting or fishing \nlicense. Either way, we would be ensuring for the first time the same \nverification standards from rural Iowa to Dade County, FL. This would \nbe one of the surest steps we could take to protect the franchise \nrights of every American citizen in a fast-changing and increasingly \nmobile society.\n  The promise of America is that every law-abiding citizen has an equal \nstake in the political process and should be treated equally under the \nlaw. The most concrete expression of this right is the right to vote. \nIt is a right that has been at the core of our democracy for more than \na century, and whenever it has been deprived at the local level, we \nstrengthen it federally. We need to strengthen it again now as part of \nour effort to reform America's immigration laws. Stronger borders would \ndo nothing to prevent noncitizens who are already here from abusing the \nsystem further through illegitimate voting. To protect franchise rights \nof all born and naturalized citizens, we need to harden antifraud \nprotections at the polls. For the sake of the citizen who is already \nhere and for those who dream of becoming citizens in the future, this \namendment is an important step in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1157\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up Vitter amendment No. 1157.\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself, Mr. \n     DeMint, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Inhofe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1157.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike title VI (related to Nonimmigrants in the United \n                 States Previously in Unlawful Status)\n\n       Strike title VI.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is an important amendment that goes \nto the heart of our debate. This amendment strikes all of the text of \ntitle VI, the Z visa amnesty section. It takes all of that Z visa out \nof this massive immigration bill. I thank several Members for joining \nme in this important amendment: Senator DeMint, Senator Thomas, Senator \nBunning, Senator Enzi, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Coburn. They are all \ncosponsors of this amendment. I ask all of my colleagues to join in \nthis fundamental but necessary correction of the bill.\n  Many folks will say: We can't do this. This goes to the heart of the \nbill. It goes to the heart of the compromise. Well, indeed, it does. It \ndoes that because that is where an absolutely fundamental flaw with \nthis approach resides. The Z visa is amnesty, pure and simple. Amnesty \nis at the heart of this bill and is a fundamental problem and flaw with \nthe bill that we must correct. Make no mistake about it, the American \npeople know this. It is obvious. Why is it so hard for us to \nacknowledge the fact, acknowledge the negative consequences that flow \nfrom it, and correct it?\n  Considering how badly received last year's Senate-passed amnesty bill \nwas, I am shocked we are here again, admittedly with a better bill in \nsome respects but with a bill with Z visa amnesty right at the heart of \nit. The American people don't want this. They don't want the Z visa, \nbecause they don't want to reward law breaking and thereby encourage \nmore of the same. The Z visa amnesty provision absolutely rewards those \nwho have broken the law and, in doing so, is a slap in the face to \nthose thousands upon thousands of folks who are honoring the law, \nfollowing the law, standing in line, waiting their turn under the \nrules.\n  I ask my fellow Senators, are we going to be a nation that values \nthat rule of law? These Z visas tell lawbreakers the opposite, that it \nis OK to break the law. In doing so, most importantly, most negatively, \nthat has to encourage more like behavior in the future. Clearly, that \nsort of amnesty sends the wrong message, a reward for breaking the law. \nClearly, that encourages the same sort of behavior we absolutely don't \nwant in the future.\n  I think the fundamental question in this debate is, is this bill \ngoing to be a repeat of the 1986 immigration reform the Congress passed \nat that time or is this bill fundamentally different? Again, that is a \ncentral question that goes to the heart of the Z visa issue and others.\n  In 1986, Congress took up immigration reform. They passed a \nsignificant bill, not as wide sweeping as we are talking about now but \ncertainly a significant bill. Arguments were very much the same: We are \ngoing to beef up enforcement. We are going to get serious. We are going \nto have real enforcement at the border. We are going to have meaningful \nenforcement at the workplace. In that context, we need this amnesty one \ntime, and it will be done and the problem will be solved.\n  What is the history since then? The history is clear. A problem that \nwas then about 3 million illegal aliens has grown at least fourfold--\n12, 13 million, or more. So it has mushroomed. The problem has gotten a \nlot worse. Why? Because the amnesty provisions of that bill in 1986 \nabsolutely went into force and effect. They were absolutely honored. \nBut at the same time, the enforcement never happened to an adequate \nextent.\n  So what happens with those two dynamics? It is simple to see what did \nhappen--inadequate enforcement, real amnesty that sent the message \nloudly and clearly: You will eventually be forgiven for breaking the \nlaw to get into this country illegally. The problem mushroomed. The \nproblem quadrupled from more than 3 million illegal aliens in the \ncountry to 12 or 13 million or more today.\n  That is an awfully fundamental question we need to ask as we look at \nthis legislation. I have asked that question. My answer is: This is a \nvastly improved bill from last year, but this bill still has that \nfundamental flaw. This bill still risks--and I believe will inevitably \nrepeat--the mistake of 1986, only on a far broader, a far bigger, and \nfar more dangerous scale. We cannot afford that.\n  There are colleagues of both parties in this Chamber who make the \nargument that we hear about most legislation: The status quo is broken. \nThis bill is not perfect, but this bill will move it along. This bill \nwill make it better.\n  That sort of incrementalist approach is true in a lot of cases. In \nthis case, I don't think it is true at all. In this case, a flawed bill \ngives us the real threat, the real danger of making the problem a lot \nworse, not better. That is the history of what happened in 1986. That \nis what will happen again with inadequate enforcement plus amnesty.\n  How do we correct this? One way is to beef up enforcement. I support \na lot of different measures to make the enforcement more certain, to \nnail it down absolutely before we go into any of these other areas such \nas a temporary worker program, certainly Z visas. The triggers in this \nbill are much ballyhooed, but the triggers don't get us to where we \nneed to be before they trigger the Z visa. All the triggers do is say: \nWe are going to do what was planned for the next 18 months anyway, \nwhich isn't all of what we need to do, which isn't half of what we need \nto do to secure the border and have real workplace enforcement. But \nthen we are going to trigger the amnesty. We are going to trigger the Z \nvisa. That is not enough. We need to beef up those enforcement \nprovisions.\n  The other way to fix going down the 1986 road again is to get rid of \namnesty, to get rid of the Z visa. That is exactly what this amendment \ndoes.\n  Certainly many of my colleagues will protest wildly about calling \nthis amnesty. If you look at the facts, there is no other conclusion to \nreach. If you look at history, there is no other conclusion.\n  For those lawyers in the Chamber, probably the best known legal \nreference book is Black's Law Dictionary. Open it. Turn to ``amnesty.'' \nIt is very straightforward. Amnesty is ``a pardon extended by the \ngovernment to a group or class of persons.'' Black's Law Dictionary \ncites as its first example of what that means the 1986 Immigration \nReform and Control Act. It points to that very act and says it \n``provided amnesty for undocumented aliens already present in the \ncountry.'' That is the example it cites in the very definition of the \nconcept of amnesty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this definition with the example in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)]\n\n       amnesty, n. A pardon extended by the government to a group \n     or class of persons, usually for a political offense; the act \n     of a sovereign power officially forgiving certain classes of \n     persons who are subject to trial but have not yet been \n     convicted\n       The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided \n     amnesty for undocumented aliens already present in the \n     country.\n       Unlike an ordinary pardon, amnesty is usually addressed to \n     crimes against state sovereignty--that is, to political \n     offenses with respect to which forgiveness is deemed more \n     expedient for the public welfare than prosecution and \n     punishment.\n       Amnesty is usually general, addressed to classes or even \n     communities.--Also termed general pardon. See PARDON. [Cases: \n     Pardon and Parole 26. C.J.S. Pardon and Parole Sec. Sec. 3, \n     31.]--amnesty, vb.\n       ``Amnesty . . . derives from the Greek amnestia \n     (`forgetting'), and has come to be used to describe measures \n     of a more general nature, directed to offenses whose \n     criminality is considered better forgotten.'' Leslie Sebba, \n     ``Amnesty and Pardon,'' in 1 Encyclopedia of Crime and \n     Justice 59, 59 (Sanford H. Kadish ed., 1983).\n       express amnesty. Amnesty granted in direct terms. Implied \n     amnesty. Amnesty indirectly resulting from a peace treaty \n     executed between contending parties.\n  Mr. VITTER. In that context, one obvious question is: How does that \namnesty provision compare to what is in this 2007 bill?\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\n  I think if you go down the requirements of the 1986 law and the \nrequirements of this bill before us, you will see they are disturbingly \nfamiliar.\n  In 1986, how do you gain temporary residence status? Continuous \nunlawful residence in the United States since before January 1, 1982. \nFees: a $185 fee for the principal applicant, $50 fee for each child, a \n$420 family cap. You have to meet certain admissibility criteria: 18-\nmonth residency period, English language and civics requirement. Those \nare the basic requirements under that 1986 law.\n  Let's compare it to what is in this bill, which is very similar. The \ndollar amount fees are higher, more significant, but in terms of the \nnature of the requirements in this bill, they are disturbingly similar: \nphysically present and employed in the United States since a certain \ndate--January 1, 2007; $1,000 penalty and a $1,500 processing fee; meet \nadmissibility criteria; background check; English language basic \nrequirement, et cetera--the exact same type of requirements under the Z \nvisa provisions of this bill, as well as the 1986 law, which ``Black's \nLaw Dictionary'' itself labels amnesty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis simple side-by-side comparison of the 1986 law and this bill \npresently before the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               1986 IRCA\n\n\n                       temporary resident status\n\n       Continuous unlawful residence in the U.S. since before \n     January 1, 1982.\n       $185 fee for principal applicant, $50 for each child ($420 \n     family cap).\n       Meet admissibility criteria.\n       Ineligible for most public benefits for five years after \n     application.\n       18-month residency period.\n\n\n                    Adjustment to Permanent Resident\n\n       English language and civics requirement.\n       $80 fee per applicant ($240 family cap).\n\n                                  2007\n\n\n                             z visa status\n\n       Physically present and employed in U.S. since January 1, \n     2007.\n       $1,000 penalty and $1,500 processing fee.\n       Meet admissibility criteria.\n       Background check.\n\n\n                    adjustment to permanent resident\n\n       Meets merit requirements, file application in home country.\n       $4,000 penalty.\n  Mr. VITTER. So, again, let's not repeat the horrible mistakes of the \npast. Let's not repeat the fundamental mistake of 1986 that got us to \nthe situation we are in today, that quadrupled, or more, the problem \nthen faced in 1986. Let's not repeat it in either side of the ledger: \nby having inadequate enforcement--and I am afraid the enforcement \nprovisions of this bill, the trigger requirements, et cetera, are \ninadequate--and let's not repeat it on the other side of the equation \nby granting amnesty and creating a magnet for more illegal activity \ninto this country.\n  We cannot afford to do that. This amendment goes to the core of that \nfundamental problem and corrects it by taking out title VI, the Z visa \namnesty provisions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Louisiana. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  I am disappointed in the way the substitute amendment to S. 1348 was \nbrought before the Senate. I do not believe Senators have had adequate \nopportunity to fully understand all the impacts this legislation will \nhave on our Nation. Over the next 2 weeks, Senators and staff will \ncontinue to study the language. I hope the Senate leadership will \nensure that all Members have the opportunity to have their amendments \nconsidered by the full Senate. I am pleased an agreement was reached to \nvote on the Vitter amendment.\n  If this was the first time the Senate was considering offering \namnesty to illegal aliens, I think this debate would be under a \ndifferent tone. When the 1986 legislation was enacted, Members of the \nHouse and Senate had the best of intentions--to improve our border \nsituation and decrease illegal immigration by offering permanent status \nto those in the United States illegally. Those good intentions, \nhowever, were not without fault. We can see that now, 21 years later, \nand we cannot ignore the problems caused by that legislation.\n  Our goal here is to make an immigration system that works--one that \nmeets the economic needs of our Nation and allows for legal immigration \nand legal workers. We need to make it less complicated to immigrate \nlegally rather than illegally. The status quo is just the opposite. It \nhas become so difficult to follow the legal path that many look for the \neasier route of crossing our border without paperwork, without filing \nfees, and without bureaucratic delays. It has become so difficult for \nemployers to hire legal temporary workers that many hire illegal \nimmigrants without legal Social Security numbers, without labor \ncertifications, and without bureaucratic delays. Our laws should not be \na deterrent to themselves.\n  Our immigration system is complicated. Our borders remain open. \nBorder security must be the top priority of the debate. We cannot have \nimmigration reform without strengthening the security of our borders. \nThis is why I am pleased that the language the Senate is considering \nincludes triggers that must be met before certain provisions can be \nenacted.\n  There are some positive ideas in this legislation, but there remain \nmany problems. The Senate should not pass flawed legislation merely for \nthe sake of voting on something.\n  Amnesty is one of the main concerns of my constituents in Wyoming. \nAmnesty sends a message to illegal immigrants that if you break our \nimmigration laws and avoid being detected for several years, the United \nStates will not only forgive you but reward you with permanent resident \nstatus. Amnesty encouraged illegal immigration. In 1986, 7 million \nimmigrants were granted amnesty. Today, we are facing an illegal \npopulation of over 12 million. The 1986 legislation did not stop \nillegal immigration. We should not repeat this policy without ensuring \nthat we are not making the same mistake.\n  I continue to closely examine bill language as new developments \nunfold and will make decisions keeping in mind what concerns I have \nheard from the people and businesses of Wyoming. We expect to spend the \nfirst week of June continuing to debate and amend the bill. I am \nconcerned about where we will be in 2 weeks on this legislation. This \nissue is too important to refuse to consider amendments for members of \neither party.\n  Again, I state my strong support for Senator Vitter's amendment to \nremove the amnesty provisions from this legislation. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join me in taking a strong stance against \namnesty.\n  With that, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed as in morning business for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. BIDEN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. KLOBUCHAR). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so I might call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1176 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n       (Purpose: To establish commissions to review the facts and \n     circumstances surrounding injustices suffered by European \n     Americans, European Latin Americans, and Jewish refugees \n     during World War II)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1176.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1176 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, May 23, 2007, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this amendment contains the language \nof S. 621, the Wartime Treatment Study Act, a bill I have introduced \nwith my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  This amendment would create two fact-finding commissions: one \ncommission to review the U.S. Government's treatment of German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and European Latin Americans during World \nWar II, and another commission to review the U.S. Government's \ntreatment of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution during World War \nII.\n  I am very pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Inouye, have agreed to cosponsor this amendment. They are \nalso cosponsors of my bill, and I appreciate their continued support \nfor this important initiative.\n  This amendment would help us to learn more about how, during World \nWar II, recent immigrants and refugees were treated. It is an \nappropriate and relevant amendment to this immigration bill.\n  I would have preferred to have moved this bill on its own. Senator \nGrassley and I have introduced the Wartime Treatment Study Act in the \nlast four Congresses, and the Judiciary Committee has reported it \nfavorably each time, including just last month. It has been cleared for \nadoption by unanimous consent by my Democratic colleagues. But I am \nforced to offer this as an amendment because the Wartime Treatment \nStudy Act has not cleared the Republican side in this Congress or any \nof the last three Congresses. It is time for the Senate to pass this \nbill.\n  During World War II, the United States fought a courageous battle \nagainst the spread of Nazism and fascism. Nazi Germany was engaged in \nthe horrific persecution and genocide of Jews. By the end of the war, 6 \nmillion Jews had perished at the hands of Nazi Germany.\n  The Allied victory in the Second World War was an American triumph, a \ntriumph for freedom, justice, and human rights. The courage displayed \nby so many Americans, of all ethnic origins, should be a source of \ngreat pride for all of us. But we should not let that justifiable pride \nin our Nation's triumph blind us to the treatment of some Americans by \ntheir own Government.\n  Sadly, as so many brave Americans fought against enemies in Europe \nand the Pacific, the U.S. Government was curtailing the freedom of some \nof its own people here, at home. While it is, of course, the right of \nevery Nation to protect itself during wartime, the U.S. Government can \nand should respect the basic freedoms that so many Americans have given \ntheir lives to defend.\n  Many Americans are aware that during World War II, under the \nauthority of Executive Order 9066 and the Alien Enemies Act, the U.S. \nGovernment forced more than 100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes \nand ultimately into relocation and internment camps. Japanese Americans \nwere forced to leave their homes, their livelihoods, and their \ncommunities. They were held behind barbed wire and military guard by \ntheir own Government.\n  Through the work of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \nInternment of Civilians created by Congress in 1980, this unfortunate \nepisode in our history finally received the official acknowledgement \nand condemnation it deserved.\n  Congress and the U.S. Government did the right thing by recognizing \nand apologizing for the mistreatment of Japanese Americans during World \nWar II. But our work in this area is not done. That same respect has \nnot been shown to the many German Americans, Italian Americans, and \nEuropean Latin Americans who were taken from their homes, subjected to \ncurfews, limited in their travel, deprived of their personal property, \nand, in the worst cases, placed in internment camps.\n  Most Americans are probably unaware that during World War II, the \nU.S. Government designated more than 600,000 Italian-born and 300,000 \nGerman-born U.S. resident aliens and their families as ``enemy \naliens.'' Approximately 11,000 ethnic Germans, 3,200 ethnic Italians, \nand scores of Bulgarians, Hungarians, Romanians, or other European \nAmericans living in America were taken from their homes and placed in \ninternment camps. Some even remained interned for up to 3 years after \nthe war ended. Unknown numbers of German Americans, Italian Americans, \nand other European Americans had their property confiscated or their \ntravel restricted, or lived under curfews. This amendment would not--\nwould not--grant reparations to victims. It would simply create a \ncommission to review the facts and circumstances of the U.S. \nGovernment's treatment of German Americans, Italian Americans, and \nother European Americans during World War II.\n\n  Now, a second commission created by this amendment would review the \ntreatment by the U.S. Government of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \nNazi persecution and genocide and trying to come to the United States. \nGerman and Austrian Jews applied for visas, but the United States \nseverely limited their entry due to strict immigration policies--\npolicies that many believed were motivated by fear that our enemies \nwould send spies under the guise of refugees and by the unfortunate \nantiforeigner, anti-Semitic attitudes that were sadly all too common at \nthat time.\n  It is time for the country to review the facts and determine how our \nimmigration policies failed to provide adequate safe harbor to Jewish \nrefugees fleeing the persecution of Nazi Germany. It is a horrible \ntruth that the United States turned away thousands of Jewish refugees, \ndelivering many to their deaths at the hands of the Nazi regime we were \nfighting.\n  It is so urgent that we pass this legislation. We cannot wait any \nlonger. The injustices to European Americans and Jewish refugees \noccurred more than 50 years ago. The people who were affected by these \npolicies are dying.\n  In fact, one of them died earlier this month. Max Ebel was one of the \nthousands of German Americans who were interned during World War II in \nthe United States. He died on May 3, 2007. His death brings me great \nsadness.\n  Max Ebel was only 17 when he came to America in 1937. He fled Germany \nafter he was assaulted for refusing to join the Hitler Youth. When he \ncame to the United States, he lived with his father in Massachusetts. \nHe learned English. He joined the Boy Scouts. He completed high school. \nWhen the war broke out, he registered for the draft.\n  Nonetheless, in 1942, this new American was arrested by the FBI and \ninterned under the Alien Enemies Act because of his German ancestry. He \nspent the next 18 months in a series of detention facilities and \ninternment camps and ultimately was transferred to a camp in Fort \nLincoln, ND, where despite the way he had been treated, he found a way \nto help the war effort. He volunteered for a government work detail and \nspent a North Dakota winter laying new railroad track on the Northern \nPacific Rail Line. Max Ebel's crew boss saw how hard he worked and \npetitioned for his release.\n  Finally, in April of 1944, the Government let him go home. Despite \neverything that had happened, he remained loyal to his new country and \nbecame a citizen in 1953. A few years ago he told a journalist:\n\n       I was an American right from the beginning, and I always \n     will be.\n\n  Max Ebel's death is a loss not only to his family and friends but \nalso to our country.\n  But losing Max Ebel does more than bring me sadness; it also makes me \na bit angry. It makes me angry because he did not live to see the day \nthat Congress recognized what he went through: his internment at the \nhands of his newfound country.\n  I have been trying for years to pass this legislation creating a \ncommission to study what happened to Max Ebel and to other German \nAmericans and other European Americans and to Jewish refugees during \nWorld War II. I am gravely disappointed that Max Ebel and many others \naffected by these policies will not be here to see that legislation \nbecome law.\n  Americans must learn from these tragedies now, before there is no one \nleft. We cannot put this off any longer. These people have suffered \nlong enough without official, independent study of what happened to \nthem and without knowing this Nation recognizes their\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\nsacrifice and resolves to learn from the mistakes of the past that \ncaused them so much pain.\n  As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board put it, Congress \nmust move forward with this legislation:\n\n       Lest the passage of time deprive more Americans of the \n     justice that they deserve.\n\n  Let me again repeat that this amendment does not call for \nreparations. All it does is ensure that the public has a full \naccounting of what happened. We should be proud of our victory over \nNazism, as I am. But we should not let that pride cause us to overlook \nwhat happened to some Americans and refugees during World War II. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Wartime Treatment Study \nAct that is an amendment to this immigration legislation, and I hope \nthe managers of the bill can accept it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we are in the process where we will \nbegin to make comment on the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana. \nWe will address that very shortly. I am finding that the amendment of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin is enormously compelling. I would have \nthought it would be generally accepted. We are in the process of trying \nto get a review of that amendment.\n  But for the notice of our colleagues, we expect that we will probably \nhave two votes, if we are unable to get clearance, and we will probably \nhave that somewhere in the relationship of probably about--hopefully \nabout 4 o'clock. I haven't had the chance to clear this time with \nSenator Vitter, but that is generally sort of the plan we are looking \nat, at the present time. I am not asking unanimous consent on that, but \nthat is just in terms of information for our colleagues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1157 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the Vitter \namendment No. 1157, which strikes title VI of the bill, the title that \nauthorizes Z visas for illegal immigrants.\n  Z visas are amnesty, pure and simple. They allow illegal immigrants \nto stay here permanently without ever returning home to their \ncountries. This is the provision that has so many Americans upset.\n  By removing Z visas from the bill, illegal immigrants will be able to \ngo home and get right with the law. Once they have returned, they can \napply for legal entry, just like everyone else, but they would not be \nallowed to violate our laws.\n  I know many will say this amendment will be too disruptive to the \nillegal workers who would ultimately be forced to return to their home \ncountries, but I disagree. Last year, 51 million people traveled to and \nfrom the United States from abroad, and 13 million of these travelers \nwere from Mexico alone. People are very mobile, and moving this number \nof people around is relatively easy today. In fact, this bill \nacknowledges this very point by requiring them to go home to apply for \ncitizenship.\n  I have also heard some say the opposition to amnesty is being driven \nby an anti-immigrant bias. This is also untrue. Americans are extremely \npro-immigrant, but they are upset that their Government has lied to \nthem for 20 years on this issue, and they have lost confidence in our \nability to control our borders.\n  Let me be clear: I am pro-immigrant. I believe in legal immigration. \nI want people to come here, respect our laws, embrace our values, and \nbecome American citizens, but we must reject amnesty if we ever expect \nthat to happen.\n  That is why eliminating the amnesty provision in this bill is the \nmost compassionate and pro-immigrant thing we can do.\n  By striking the Z visas from this bill, this amendment will allow us \nto uphold the rule of law, create fairness for millions of people who \nwant to come here legally, and allow us to focus on securing our \nborders.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we are working with our colleagues and \ntrying to go back and forth, trying to be bipartisan. We have gone to \nSenator Vitter, to Feingold, to Hutchison, and then to Sanders. We \nexpect votes and reasonably short debate. We are trying to get votes on \nall of those before the debate starts on the supplemental. I thank the \nSenator from Vermont for his patience.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I would appreciate the Senator from \nVermont going first, after which I will offer mine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1223 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1223 to amendment number 1150.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To establish the American Competitiveness Scholarship \n                                Program)\n\n       At the end of title VII, insert the following:\n\n        Subtitle C--American Competitiveness Scholarship Program\n\n     SEC. 711.

Madam President, I will begin by quoting from an article \ntoday in Congress Daily by Bruce Stokes. He sets up in one paragraph \npretty much what we are going to talk about in this amendment:\n\n       The immigration deal under consideration in the Senate \n     raises the number of H-1B visas, a long-sought boon for the \n     high-tech industry that will provide Silicon Valley firms \n     with skilled workers at rock-bottom salaries, who will \n     bolster company profits.\n\n  This amendment I am offering now is supported by the AFL-CIO. I will \nread the few paragraphs of the letter they sent today:\n\n       Dear Senator Sanders:\n       On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing to offer strong \n     support for your amendment to the Secure Borders, Economic \n     Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act.\n       Your amendment would provide scholarships in math, science, \n     engineering, and nursing for our domestic workforce by \n     increasing fees on H-1B employers.\n       The last paragraph, signed by William Samuel, director of \n     the Department of Legislation for the AFL-CIO, writes this:\n       It is completely irresponsible for Congress to increase yet \n     again the total annual number of available H-1B visas without \n     addressing the myriad well-documented problems associated \n     with the H-1B program, or considering long-term solutions \n     involving access to training and educational opportunities \n     for domestic workers.\n\n  That is William Samuel, director of the Department of Legislation for \nthe AFL-CIO.\n  The amendment I am offering today also has the support of the \nTeamsters, the Programmers Guild, and the International Federation of \nProfessional and Technical Engineers.\n  The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act is a long and complicated \nbill. It touches on a number of very important issues, and some of \nthose issues I strongly agree with, no question. The time is long \noverdue that we control our borders. No question, the time is long \noverdue that we begin to hold employers--those people who are hiring \nillegal immigrants--accountable. Those items are long overdue, and we \nhave to deal with them. This legislation does that. I support that.\n  In my view, this bill is also responsible in how it deals with the \nvery contentious and difficult issue of how we respond to the reality \nthat there are some 12 million illegal immigrants in this country \ntoday. This bill carves out a path which eventually leads to \ncitizenship, and that is something I also support.\n  But--and here is the but: There are a number of provisions in this \nbill I do not support, that I think are going to be very harmful to the \nmiddle-class and working families of this country.\n  The amendment I am offering right now concentrates on only one aspect \nof this very long bill and of that problem. That point centers on the \nstate of the economy for working people in our country and the negative \nimpact this legislation will have for millions of workers--low-income \nworkers and professional workers as well.\n  The fact is there is a war going on in America today. I am not \ntalking about the war in Iraq and I am not talking about the war in \nAfghanistan; I am talking about the war against the American middle \nclass, the American standard of living and, indeed, the American dream \nitself.\n  The American people understand very well that since George W. Bush \nhas become President, an additional 5.4 million Americans have slipped \ninto poverty out of the middle class--5.4 million people who are poor. \nNearly 7 million Americans have lost their health insurance. Income for \nthe average American family has fallen by over $1,200 since President \nBush has been President, and some 3 million Americans have lost their \npensions.\n  All over this country, from Vermont to California, people get up in \nthe morning and they are working incredibly long hours. People need two \nincomes in a family to try to make ends meet. Yet, at the end of the \nday, they are falling further and further behind. There are a lot of \nreasons for that, but I think this bill, and what this bill proposes to \ndo, is part of the problem.\n  During the debate over NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations \nwith China, we were told by President Clinton and many others that, \nwell, yes, globalization and unfettered free trade, such as our trade \nrelations with China, yes, they will cost us blue-collar factory jobs, \nand the result is that because of our trade agreements, we have lost \nmillions of good-paying blue-collar factory jobs and, in fact, today \nthere are fewer people working in manufacturing than since President \nKennedy was in office in the early 1960s.\n  Yes, we have lost millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs, but \nwhat people told us is: Look, don't worry about that. Yes, we are going \nto lose blue-collar manufacturing jobs, but not to worry because your \nkids are going to become very sophisticated in terms of using \ncomputers, and the future for them is white-collar information \ntechnology jobs. We don't need those factory jobs anymore; we have \nwhite-collar information technology jobs, and those are the kinds of \njobs which are going to be growing. Unfortunately, that has not quite \noccurred. From January 2001 to January 2006, we lost over 600,000 \ninformation technology jobs.\n  Alan Blinder, the former Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, has told \nus that between 30 and 40 million jobs in this country are in danger of \nbeing shipped overseas. In other words, what we are looking at right \nnow is not just the loss of blue-collar manufacturing jobs, but we are \nlooking at the loss of significant numbers of white-color information \ntechnology jobs. I know that in my State--and I expect in Senator \nKennedy's State and all over this country--we have seen white-collar \ninformation technology jobs heading off to India and other countries. \nThere is nothing more painful than to see people in my State--I have \ngone through this experience--having to train people to do their jobs \nas those people return to India.\n  Some of the leading CEOs and information technology companies have \ntold us point blank--this is not a secret--that the new location for \nhigh-tech jobs is going to be India and China; it is not going to be \nthe United States of America.\n  John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco, has said:\n\n       China will become the IT center of the world, and we can \n     have a healthy discussion about whether that's in 2020 or \n     2040. What we're [in Cisco] trying to do is outline an entire \n     strategy of becoming a Chinese company.\n\n  The founder of Intel predicted in the Wall Street Journal that the \nbulk of our information technology jobs will go to China and India over \nthe next decade. That is the reality. That is what the heads of the \ninformation technology industry are telling us.\n  Over the last few days, a number of us have expressed the concern \nabout the impact of bringing low-wage workers into this country and \nwhat that\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nwould mean to Americans at the lower end of the economic ladder. Today, \nI wish to address a concern I have about what language in this bill \ncould do to the middle class and, indeed, the upper middle class, \npeople who hold professional jobs and who often earn a very good \nincome.\n  The bill we are discussing today substantially increases the number \nof well-educated professionals coming into the United States from \noverseas. This bill, in fact, would allow 115,000 new professionals to \ncome into this country each year, and that number could go up to \n180,000.\n  This program which allows well-educated professionals to come into \nour country is called the H-1B program. It is currently capped at \n65,000 visas a year. Under the language in this bill, the number would \nincrease at least by 50,000 and by as much as 115,000.\n  The argument that corporate America is using in supporting this \nincrease is that there are just not enough highly educated, highly \nskilled Americans to fill available job openings in the high-tech \nindustry and in various science fields. Proponents of the H-1B visa \nprogram also say it allows us to bring in the ``best and the \nbrightest'' from around the world to help America's competitiveness \nposition. That sounds good on its face, and it may also have the \nbenefit of being true in some cases, but there are those in this \nChamber and across the country who are very concerned that in many \ninstances the H-1B program is being used not to supplement American \nhigh-tech workers when they might be needed but instead is being used \nto replace them with foreign workers who are willing to work for \nsubstantially lower wages.\n  First, we should be clear that H-1B visas are not being used only in \nthe high-tech and highly specialized technology and science fields. \nThat is the argument often made, but it is really not true. The reality \nis that a whole host of jobs in various categories are going to H-1B \nvisa holders.\n  Let's take a look at some of the jobs that corporate America is \ntelling us that there are just not enough Americans who are smart \nenough, who are educated enough to perform. Here they are: information \ntechnology computer professionals--I guess we can't do that kind of \nwork; university professors--oh, my word, I guess we just don't have \nenough people to be university professors; engineers, health care \nworkers, accountants, financial analysts, management consultants, \nlawyers--lawyers, I love that one. Is there anyone in America who \ndoesn't think we have too many lawyers? I guess we need to bring some \nlawyers in as well. Architects, nurses, physicians, surgeons, dentists, \nscientists, journalists and editors, foreign law advisers, \npsychologists, market research analysts, fashion models--Madam \nPresident, fashion models--teachers in elementary or secondary schools. \nIn America, we do not have enough people to become teachers in \nelementary or secondary school. Does anyone really believe that we \ncannot, with proper salary inducements, bring people into secondary and \nprimary education?\n  Given that we all know there are many Americans who have college \ndegrees and advanced degrees in these fields who cannot find work, why \nis it that we need to bring in more and more professional workers from \nabroad? For those who believe that the law of supply and demand applies \nto labor costs, the evidence shows there is no shortage of college-\neducated workers in America. What we learn in economics 101 is if you \ncannot attract people for certain jobs, you pay them higher wages and \nyou give them better benefits. Unfortunately, in America today, from \n2000 to 2004, we have seen the wages of college graduates decline by 5 \npercent. So on one hand, corporate America says: Oh, my goodness, we \ncan't find people as professionals to fill these jobs, but amazingly \nenough, wages have gone down for college graduates from 2000 to 2004 by \n5 percent. Maybe somebody is not trying hard enough to find American \nworkers to fill these jobs.\n\n  In truth, what many of us have come to understand is that these H-1B \nvisas are not being used to supplement the American workforce where we \nhave shortages but, rather, H-1B visas are being used to replace \nAmerican workers with lower cost foreign workers.\n  There are studies which conclude that H-1B workers earn less than \nwhat U.S. workers make in similar jobs at similar locations. According \nto the Center for Immigration Studies, wages for H-1B workers average \n$12,000 a year below the median wage for U.S. workers in computer \nfields. Another study by Programmers Guild found that foreign tech \nworkers who came to the United States with H-1B visas are paid about \n$25,000 a year less than American workers with the same skill.\n  According to the GAO:\n\n       Some employers said that they hired H-1B workers in part \n     because these workers would often accept lower salaries than \n     similarly qualified U.S. workers.\n\n  What is very important to mention here is that some in corporate \nAmerica are giving the impression that most of the jobs within the H-1B \nprogram are for highly specialized technical work which just can't be \nfound in the United States. The truth is that most of the H-1B visas go \nto people who do not have a Ph.D., who do not have a master's degree, \nbut only have a bachelor's degree, a plain old college degree.\n  In today's Congress Daily, there is a very insightful article on H-1B \nvisas which is relevant to this debate:\n\n       As Ron Hira, a professor at Rochester Institute of \n     Technology, points out . . . the Labor Department \n     acknowledges that ``H-1B workers may be hired even when a \n     qualified U.S. worker wants the job, and a U.S. worker can be \n     displaced from the job in favor of a foreign worker.''\n\n  The article goes on to state:\n\n       The median wage for new H-1B computing professionals was \n     $50,000 in 2005, far below the median for U.S. computing \n     professionals, according to the annual report of U.S. \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\n  These findings are extremely troubling given the promises made to the \nAmerican people that the future for our economy was with high-skilled, \nhigh-paying, high-tech jobs. What we have found is that in the last 4 \nyears, wages for college graduates are going down, and we are finding \nthat people from abroad are coming in and doing jobs American \nprofessionals can do and they are doing them for lower wages.\n  To bolster their argument for increased H-1B visas, proponents point \nto a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the jobs of the \nfuture. That is what it is entitled, ``Jobs of the Future.'' According \nto the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over the next decade, 2 million jobs \nwill be created in mathematics, engineering, computer science, and \nphysical science. That equates to about 200,000 jobs a year times 10--2 \nmillion jobs. Under this legislation, the number of H-1B visas would \nincrease to as many as 180,000 a year. That means virtually every job--\nabout 90 percent--that will be created in the high-tech sector over the \nnext 10 years could conceivably be taken by a H-1B visa holder. What \nsense does that make? What are we telling our young people? We are \nsaying: Go to college, get the best education you can, and we have all \nkinds of jobs available to you, except those jobs in a significant way \nare going to be taken by people from another country.\n  We would hope that companies in the United States would have just \nenough patriotism, maybe just a little bit of patriotism so they would \nwork to hire qualified American workers. But if you look at the \nstatements and conduct of some of these companies, you realize that \npatriotism, love of country is becoming a dated concept for those who \nare pushing extreme globalization.\n\n  Let me take one case study, and that is Microsoft. In 2003, \nMicrosoft's vice president for Windows engineering was quoted in \nBusiness Week as saying:\n\n       It is definitely a cultural change to use foreign workers. \n     But if I can save a dollar, hallelujah.\n\n  The CEO of Microsoft, Steven Anthony Ballmer, has said, and this is \nan interesting quote, very relevant to today's discussion:\n\n       Lower the pay of U.S. professionals to $50,000, and it \n     won't make sense for employers to put up with the hassle of \n     doing business in developing countries.\n\n  In other words, if we lower wages for professionals in this country, \nmaybe our companies won't outsource and go to India or China.\n  The economic benefit of H-1B visas, though, is not limited to \nAmerican companies. The truth is, as my colleagues, Senator Durbin and \nSenator Grassley, have pointed out, the top companies applying for H-1B \nvisas are actually outsourcing firms from India, known in the industry \nas ``body shops.'' According to a February 7, 2007, article in \nBusinessWeek:\n\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\n\n       Data for the fiscal year 2006, which ended last September, \n     showed that 7 of the top 10 applicants for H-1B visas are \n     Indian companies. Giants Infosys Technologies and Wipro took \n     the top two spots, with 22,600 and 19,400 applications \n     respectively.\n\n  In fact, 30 percent of the H-1B visas approved last year went to nine \nIndian outsourcing firms. In other words, the very same companies that \nare involved in the H-1B program of supplying American companies with \ncheap foreign labor are exactly the same corporations that are involved \nin outsourcing, providing cheap labor to these very same companies when \nthey move to India. Two sides of the same coin.\n  In my view, the H-1B system is working against the best interests of \nthe American middle class. It is displacing skilled American workers, \nit is lowering our wages, and it is part of the process by which the \nmiddle class of this country continues to shrink. Meanwhile, it is \ncreating huge profits for foreign companies that traffic in H-1B visas.\n  I do wish to commend Senators Durbin and Grassley for their work to \nreform the H-1B program and their efforts to include in the substitute \nsome provisions that strengthen protection for American workers. But as \nimportant as these strengthened protections are, the H-1B program, \nwhich will be increased from 65,000 slots to 115,000 slots, and \npotentially even 180,000 slots, continues to pose a threat to American \njobs and American wages.\n  The question is: Where do we go from here? What is our response to \nthis problem? I could certainly offer an amendment to remove the \nincrease in H-1B visas or even to restrict them below the current \n65,000 level. But that amendment would be defeated. So where do we go? \nWhat is the sensible thing to do? How do we bring people together \naround this issue?\n  I think the author of the Congress Daily article I referred to \nearlier said it quite well when he wrote:\n\n       More importantly for the American taxpayer, the current \n     allocation system for H-1B visas conveys a valuable \n     resource--access to talented workers who add value to a \n     company's bottom line--at almost no cost. This is a subsidy \n     in violation of market principles for firms that are too \n     quick to appeal to market forces when they are fighting \n     Washington over export controls or other issues.\n\n  The amendment I am offering has two goals. First, raising the H-1B \nvisa fee from $1,500 to $10,000 will go a long way in telling corporate \nAmerica they are not going to be able to save money by bringing foreign \nprofessionals into this country, and they may want to look at the \nUnited States of America to find the workers that they need. If they \nhave to pay $10,000, that will cut back on their margin.\n  Secondly, to the degree it is true that the United States does not \nhave a significant number of skilled workers in certain categories--and \nin certain categories that may well be true--this new revenue will be \ndedicated toward providing scholarships to students who are studying in \nareas where we currently lack professionals.\n  Specifically, my amendment would create a new American Competitive \nScholarship program at the National Science Foundation that would \nprovide merit-based scholarships of up to $15,000 a year, and which are \nrenewable for up to 4 years, to students pursuing degrees in math, \nscience, engineering, medicine, nursing, other health care fields, and \nother extremely important fields vital to the competitiveness of this \nNation. These new scholarships would create the incentive for the best \nand the brightest of American students to enter these fields where \nthere is reputedly a shortage.\n\n  In other words, we have the absurd situation today where we are \nbringing people from all over the world into this country to do this \njob, yet we have large numbers of middle-class, working-class families \nwho can't afford to send their kids to college or to graduate school. \nWell, maybe we ought to pay attention to American workers and American \nfamilies first.\n  How will this program be paid for? Under current law, companies \napplying for H-1B visas pay a $1,500 fee. That fee is split up in a \nnumber of ways, with some of it going to scholarships and retraining \nprograms. Unfortunately, it is too small to effectively create a \nscholarship program of the scale needed to address the claimed shortage \nin math, science, and technology specialists. This amendment imposes an \n$8,500 surcharge on those companies seeking H-1B visas. This fee would \nonly apply to those who are required to pay the current $1,500 fee. \nTherefore, universities and schools would be exempt, as they are under \ncurrent law. Companies with less than 25 employees would pay only half \nthe fee.\n  I am sure corporate America will tell us this $8,500 fee is too \nexpensive; that they can't afford it. After all, many of these people \nare the same exact people who opposed raising the minimum wage above \n$5.15 an hour. However, this fee represents a very small amount \ncompared to the incredible economic benefits that companies realize \nfrom bringing in foreign H-1B visa workers.\n  H-1B visas are valid for 3 years. So the $8,500 surcharge on an \nannual basis is only $2,800. Compared to the median $50,000 wage of a \nnew H-1B computing professional, it is only about 5.5 percent of that \nwage. For this small fee, what would be the benefit to American \nstudents and our families? If there are 115,000 H-1B visas issued for \nwhich fees are paid, we could provide over 65,000 scholarships each \nyear to our students--65,000. If the number of H-1B visas goes to \n180,000, we could provide scholarships to over 100,000 American \nstudents.\n  If the Members of this body believe we need H-1B visas to compensate \nfor a shortage of skilled American professionals, this amendment will \nattract tens of thousands of America's best and brightest to those \nfields.\n  One of the reasons I am offering this amendment, which will provide \nmuch needed scholarships for the American middle class, is I was very \ninterested in reading an article that appeared in BusinessWeek on April \n19, 2004. In that article, BusinessWeek reported that:\n\n       To win favor in China, Microsoft has pledged to spend more \n     than $750 million on cooperative research, technology for \n     schools, and other investments.\n\n  If Microsoft and other corporations have billions of dollars to \ninvest in technology for schools, research, and other needs in China \nand other countries, these same companies should have enough money to \nprovide scholarships for middle-class kids in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Another major supporter of the H-1B program is IBM. Last year, IBM \nmade $9.5 billion in profits. Meanwhile, IBM has announced it will be \ninvesting $6 billion in India by 2009 and--get this--IBM has also \nsigned deals to train 100,000 software specialists. Where? In \nMassachusetts? In Vermont? In California? No, in China, according to an \nAugust 4, 2003, article in BusinessWeek.\n  Other major supporters of increasing H-1B workers include Intel, \nwhich made $5 billion in profits last year; Bank of America, \nCaterpillar, General Electric, Boeing, and Lehman Brothers. All of \nthese companies, making billions and billions of dollars in profit, \ncan't afford to pay American workers the wages they need. Well, if they \ncan't do that, at least let them contribute to an important scholarship \nprogram.\n  Let me conclude by saying a vote for this amendment is a vote for \npreserving American competitiveness in the 21st century, it is a vote \nfor giving our children a brighter future, and it is a vote--\nunfortunately all too rare--to help middle-income families in this \ncountry who are struggling so hard to make sure their kids can have the \neducation they need.\n  Madam President, I am not quite sure of the proper legislative \napproach, but on this amendment, I will be calling for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We had intended, Madam President, to vote on the \namendment. We are working out the sequence at the present time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1184, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, by way of housekeeping, I wish to submit \na modification of my amendment that is pending, amendment No. 1184.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the modification?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object----\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I may explain to my colleagues, there is a problem \nwith the pagination in the original draft of the bill. I noticed the \noriginal amendment appears to be off. This is to reconcile the problem \nwith the handwritten note on page 224, which was added on the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would my colleague from Texas yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Surely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If he would be kind enough to share with us a copy of the \nmodification, if it is routine, there will be no problem. I object at \nthis moment until he does. I will be glad to work with him and the \nchairman once we have seen a copy.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Absolutely. I am glad to do that and withhold until that \ntime. I do have some other comments I wish to make.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, could I ask my colleague, and also \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, when the Senator from Texas is finished \nwith his remarks, I wish to be recognized for 5 minutes--just to speak, \nnot to offer my amendments, but I wanted to speak on the bill. I ask \nunanimous consent to do that, after he speaks. Then we will talk about \nmy amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a minute, for a point of \ninformation?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Certainly. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will make a unanimous consent request in a few moments \nto vote at 5 o'clock on the Vitter amendment, and then the amendment of \nSenator Sanders. Then, at that time, we have been told, those who want \nto address the supplemental will begin that debate--a discussion on the \nSenate floor.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas. She has an amendment on Social \nSecurity. She has been kind enough, as always, to cooperate with us, \nand indicated a willingness to work out an appropriate time. It is a \nsubstantive amendment. We will look forward to considering it. I want \nto give her every assurance we will consider this and will deal with \nit. If not today, we will do the best we can to deal with it on the \nTuesday we get back. There are members on the Finance Committee, since \nit is dealing with Social Security, who wanted to at least have an \nimpact. This in no way will delay the consideration of this amendment. \nWe want to give her those assurances.\n  I know the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, is on his way \nover. He wants to be able to enter an amendment as well. We certainly \nwill look forward to that. We had hoped we might have been able to get \nan earlier consideration. He has been over in the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Members have been extremely cooperative, incredibly helpful. We have \nmade good progress here today. We want to make some brief comments at \nan appropriate time, when the Senator finishes, on the Vitter \namendment. Then, hopefully, we will have an opportunity to vote on \nthese amendments. Then those who are dealing with the supplemental will \nhave a chance to address the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator. We look forward to his comments.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, could I also have 5 minutes \nfollowing Senator Cornyn?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered; 5 minutes following the junior \nSenator from Texas.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand now, talking to the \nmajority whip, there is no objection to the modification of my \namendment, No. 1184.\n  As I was explaining, we checked with the legislative counsel last \nnight and this morning we were told the problem was with the \nhandwritten page, No. 224, that was added on the floor. So it is a \nmatter of pagination. I appreciate the accommodation of my colleagues \nto allow that modification to go forward. Also, legislative counsel \ncorrected a technical error in the text which this modification \ncorrects.\n  I have two things I want to speak on, briefly. First, on my original \namendment, No. 1184, as you recall, this is composed of two parts. The \nfirst part is what I would assume to be technical errors in the \nunderlying bill. In the haste of writing the bill, I think there were \nsome errors made that we pointed out in the amendment, errors that need \nto be corrected. I do not expect there will be a lot of controversy \nabout that.\n  What is more controversial, what I want to address, is the second \npart. That has to do with excluding from the benefits under this bill \nindividuals who have already come into our country in violation of our \nimmigration laws, who have been detained, who have had due process, a \ntrial, who have had their day in court and then, once they were ordered \ndeported, rather than agree to show up and be deported, they simply \nwent on the lam and went underground and melted into the great American \nlandscape. A second category is people who have had their day in court, \nwho have been deported but then who have reentered illegally. Under \nsection 234 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, both of those \nactions would constitute felonies. I think it would be a grave error \nfor this bill to reward individuals who have committed that sort of \nopen defiance of our laws. For, whatever you can say about other \npeople who have entered the country in violation of our immigration \nlaws, certainly those who have had a day in court, who have been \nordered by court to exit the country but who have gone on the lam, or \nthose who have reentered after they were deported, represent a \ndifferent type of lawbreaker. I do not believe we should reward those \nby conferring upon them a Z visa, outlined in the underlying bill.\n\n  The Senator from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, argued my amendment \nwould amount to an unconstitutional ex post facto rule because of its \nretroactive application. This is a misreading of the bill. In order for \nany immigration provisions to have immediate effect, it is imperative \nthat they apply to conduct and convictions that actually occurred \nbefore enactment. If prior conduct and convictions were not covered, \nyou would have an immigration regime that essentially welcomes the \nfollowing people--this is not how the U.S. immigration should operate. \nConsider an immigration regime where a known criminal gang member could \nnot be removed unless the Department of Homeland Security can show he \nwas a member after the statute was enacted, even if the DHS had \nvideotaped evidence, or even a confession from last month, showing the \nalien involved in gang activities. Surely that could not be construed \nas unconstitutionally retroactive or ex post facto.\n  Another example would be an undisputed terrorist fundraiser who would \nnot, unless we agree to this amendment, be barred from naturalization \non terrorism grounds. Not only would the citizenship application of \nsomeone who has been engaged in terrorist activity not be barred for \nthat reason, unless the terrorist activity occurred after the date of \nenactment, but this effective date could also be used to call into \nquestion the use by the Department of Homeland Security of existing \ndiscretionary authority to determine a terrorist did not possess good \nmoral character. To create a regime that turns a blind eye to these \nknown facts would be foolish and would not be in our country's national \ninterest.\n  To avoid such perverse and unintended consequences, Congress has on \nmany occasions enacted grounds of deportability and inadmissibility \nthat are based on past conduct and criminal convictions. For example, \nsection 5502 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act \nmade aliens who committed acts of torture or extra judicial killings \nabroad a ground of inadmissibility and a ground of deportability. That \nprovision applies to offenses committed before, on, or after the date \nof enactment.\n  The Holtzman amendment, enacted in 1978, rendered Nazi criminals \nexcludable and deportable. It applied to individuals who ordered, \nadvocated, assisted, or otherwise participated in persecution on behalf \nof Nazi Germany or its allies at least 33 years earlier, between the \nyears of 1933 and 1945.\n  It is clear from past experience, as well as common sense, that the \nonly actions we would be taking in this legislation would be to say to \nthose who have had their day in court, who literally thumb their nose \nat our legal system and at our court system, you\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\nwill not be rewarded with the benefits under this act; that you will be \nexcluded. You have had your chance, you have blown it, you have defied \nthe American legal system and, in fact, this is not the kind of acts \nfrom somebody we would expect to be a law-abiding citizen in the \nfuture.\n  I also want to speak briefly on an amendment Senator Menendez has \noffered. Ironically, I find myself in opposition to him on amendment \nNo. 1184, the amendment I have offered, but I find there is a lot to \nlike in his amendment. I want to explain why. This is what I would call \nthe line-jumping amendment Senator Menendez has offered. I have heard \nthe proponents explain that the underlying bill is not an amnesty \nbecause it does not allow anyone to jump in line. This is a \nfundamentally important concept. It is a matter of fundamental fairness \nand crucial to the integrity, not only of our immigration system, but \nto our entire legal system. It would be extremely unfair to allow \nsomeone who has not respected our laws to be able to obtain a green \ncard as a legal permanent resident before someone who has respected our \nlaws and waited in line for a chance to legally enter this country.\n  Please understand, I am not just talking about the fact that those \nwho wait in line legally have to do so in their home country while \nsomeone who has entered our country in violation of our immigration \nlaws and obtains Z status can wait in our country. That certainly is an \nissue, that those here are getting the advantage over those who are \nobserving our laws.\n  I point to a story in today's USA Today, where the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Secretary Chertoff, admits there is \n``a fundamental unfairness'' in allowing undocumented immigrants to \nstay in the country while those who have respected our laws wait \npatiently outside the country. Should we make what even Secretary \nChertoff admits is ``a fundamental unfairness'' that much more unfair?\n  To the proponents' credit, they have attempted to craft a proposal \nthat would not allow anyone who came here illegally obtain their green \ncard until everyone who chose to follow the law gets their green card. \nBut the problem with the bill is this: The compromise bill arbitrarily \nsets the cutoff date for being in line legally at May 1, 2005, while \nsetting the date for the end of the line for those illegally here at \nJanuary 1, 2007. I understand the reason why that was done. It was so \nthere would not have to be added a huge number of additional green \ncards in order to clear the backlog of people who have been waiting \npatiently, legally, in line to clear before Z visa holders would get \nthe benefits under the law.\n  But the problem is this: What this means is someone who chose to \nrespect the law, chose not to enter illegally, and filed the proper \nimmigration paperwork on, for example, June 1, 2005, is not considered \nto be ``in line'' under the terms of the bill, while someone who \ndecided not to respect the laws and entered illegally on the very same \ndate can obtain Z status and ultimately obtain citizenship.\n  Family groups such as Interfaith Immigration Coalition, Jewish \nCouncil for Public Affairs, the U.S. Conference of Bishops, and MALDEF, \nhave written to my office to explain that those people who played by \nthe rules and applied after May 1, 2005 will not be cleared as part of \nthe family backlog pursuant to the terms of this bill and will lose \ntheir chance to immigrate under the current rules and be placed in line \nbehind the Z visa applicants. Some of these family groups reported that \nmore than 800,000 people who will have patiently waited in line will, \nin essence, be kicked out of the line.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I just referred to from \nthese organizations, the Conference of Catholic Bishops, Interfaith \nImmigration Coalition, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, and MALDEF, \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For purposes of this \n     clause, the term `crime of domestic violence' means any crime \n     of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18, United \n     States Code) against a person committed by a current or \n     former spouse of the person, by an individual with whom the \n     person shares a child in common, by an individual who is \n     cohabiting with or has cohabited with the person\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\n     as a spouse, by an individual similarly situated to a spouse \n     of the person under the domestic or family violence laws of \n     the jurisdiction where the offense occurs, or by any other \n     individual against a person who is protected from that \n     individual's acts under the domestic or family violence laws \n     of the United States or any State, Indian tribal government, \n     or unit of local or foreign government.\n       ``(ii) Violators of protection orders.--Any alien who at \n     any time is enjoined under a protection order issued by a \n     court and whom the court determines has engaged in conduct \n     that violates the portion of a protection order that involves \n     protection against credible threats of violence, repeated \n     harassment, or bodily injury to the person or persons for \n     whom the protection order was issued is inadmissible.

I know it adds new green cards on top of all the green cards \nthis compromise has already provided. I will listen carefully to the \narguments of Senators Menendez and Hagel, the main cosponsors of that \namendment, as well as arguments of the opponents of the amendment \nbefore deciding finally how to vote. But I am troubled by those this \nbill disadvantages simply because they chose to abide by our laws as \nopposed to those who chose not to abide by our laws.\n  I, too, have an amendment, but my amendment does not increase the \nnumber of green cards. The effect of my amendment will be to cause the \n8-year time period to clear family backlogs to slip a few years. But my \namendment speaks to an important principle, one I have been speaking to \nhere for the last few minutes, which is, no one who came here illegally \nshould be placed ahead in the citizenship path in front of someone who \nhas played by the rules.\n  Finally, let me just say that I anticipate there may be an argument \nthat Citizenship and Immigration Services discontinued taking \napplications in May of 2005. However, we are told that the State \nDepartment has currently approved petitions dated after May 2005 for \nfamily members who are just waiting for an immigrant visa.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  U.S. Catholic Bishops Urge Senate Support for Family Reunification \n                         Amendments to S. 1348\n\n       The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops strongly urges \n     senators to vote ``For'' the following family reunification \n     amendments to S. 1348, Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act \n     of 2007:\n       Menendez/Hagel Backlog Reduction Amendment. The Menendez/\n     Hagel amendment would bring equity to the backlog reduction \n     contained in the substitute amendment to S. 1348 by \n     establishing the same cut-off date for backlog reduction \n     visas as is contained in the substitute for legalizing \n     undocumented aliens. Unless amended by Menendez/Hagel, the \n     substitute amendment would kick all relatives of U.S. \n     citizens and permanent resident aliens who filed petitions \n     after May of 2005 for family reunification visas out of line, \n     thus providing better treatment to undocumented aliens than \n     would be given to persons who have followed the law.\n       Dodd Parents of U.S. Citizens Amendment. The Dodd amendment \n     would mitigate the damage done to parents of U.S. citizens by \n     the substitute amendment. It would do this by increasing from \n     40,000 to 90,000 the number of such parents who can be \n     admitted to the United States each year as permanent \n     residents. Under current law, there are an unlimited number \n     of such parents who can immigrate to the United States each \n     year.\n       Clinton/Hagel Spouses and Unmarried Children Amendment. The \n     Clinton/Hagel amendment would categorize spouses and \n     unmarried children (under the age of 21) of legal permanent \n     resident aliens as ``immediate relatives.'' This would ensure \n     that longterm residents in the United States have the \n     opportunity to reunite with their immediate family members.\n       Menendez/Obama Sunset Amendment. The Menendez/Obama sunset \n     amendment would sunset the new, untested and little-\n     considered point system provision in the substitute amendment \n     to S. 1348 after 5 years in order to enable lawmakers to \n     assess whether the consequences of the experimental program \n     are unacceptable and warrant a return to the existing family- \n     and employment-sponsored preference systems.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Sir: The Interfaith Immigration Coalition is a \n     coalition of faith-based organizations committed to enacting \n     comprehensive immigration reform that reflects our mandate to \n     welcome the stranger and treat all human beings with dignity \n     and respect. Through this coalition, over 450 local and \n     national faith-based organizations and faith leaders have \n     called on Congress and the Administration to enact fair and \n     humane reform. Members of the coalition are extremely \n     concerned about the provisions of S. 1348 that would \n     undermine family reunification, and therefore urge Senators \n     to VOTE YES on the following amendments that will reaffirm \n     the United States' longstanding commitment to family values \n     and fairness.\n       Vote ``Yes!'' Menendez Amendment on Family Backlog Cut Off \n     Date. Currently, the compromise legislation will clear the \n     backlog under our existing family and employer based system, \n     but only for those who submitted their applications before \n     May 1, 2005. As a result, an estimated 833,000 people who \n     have played by the rules and applied after that date will not \n     be cleared as part of the\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n     family backlog and will lose their chance to immigrate under \n     current rules. The Menendez amendment would change the ``cut-\n     off'' date for legal immigrant applicants who would otherwise \n     be handled under the backlog reduction part of the bill from \n     May 1, 2005 to January 1, 2007, which is the same cut-off \n     date that is currently set for the legalization of the \n     undocumented immigrants. It would also add 110,000 green \n     cards a year to ensure that we don't start creating a new \n     backlog or cause the 8 year deadline for clearing the family \n     backlog to slip by a few years.\n       Vote ``Yes!'' Clinton Amendment to Include Minor Children \n     and Spouses of Lawful Permanent Residents in ``Immediate \n     Relative'' Category. Current immigration law limits the \n     number of green cards available to spouses and minor children \n     of lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to 87,900 per year. For \n     these spouses and minor children, quota backlogs are \n     approximately 4 years and 9 months long. The inequitable \n     treatment of minor children and spouses who are dependent on \n     the status of their U.S. sponsor has devastated thousands of \n     legal immigrant families. The Clinton amendment will re-\n     categorize spouses and children of LPRs as ``immediate \n     relatives,'' thereby lifting the cap on the number of visas \n     available to these close family members, allowing permanent \n     residents of the U.S. to reunite with their loved ones in a \n     timely fashion.\n       Vote ``Yes!'' Dodd Amendment Related to Foreign-Born \n     Parents of U.S. Citizens. Currently, the compromise \n     legislation would set an annual cap for green cards for \n     parents of U.S. citizens at 40,000 (less than half the \n     current annual average number of green cards issued to these \n     parents). It would also create a new parent visitor visa \n     program that only allows parents to visit for 100 days per \n     year and includes overly harsh collective penalties. The Dodd \n     amendment would increase the annual cap of green cards from \n     40,000 to 90,000, extend the duration of the parent visitor \n     visa from 100 days to 365 days in order to make it easier for \n     families to remain together for a longer period; and make \n     penalties levied on individuals who overstay their S-visa \n     only applicable to that individual and not collectively \n     applied to their fellow citizens. This amendment is essential \n     to making sure that our permanent legal immigration system is \n     fair to US citizens and their parents, and facilitates family \n     reunification.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 22, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: The Jewish Council for Public Affairs \n     (JCPA) applauds the Senate's commitment to finding a workable \n     compromise on Comprehensive Immigration Reform and supports \n     S.1348 as a starting point for the debate. The introduction \n     of a comprehensive framework that secures our borders, clears \n     much of the current family backlog, and provides a path to \n     citizenship for the estimated 12 million undocumented workers \n     in the United States is a step in the right direction toward \n     fixing our broken immigration system.\n       As the umbrella body for policy in the Jewish community, \n     representing 13 national agencies and 125 local community \n     relations councils in 44 states, the JCPA has long been \n     active in supporting comprehensive immigration reform that is \n     workable, fair and humane.\n       However, JCPA holds serious reservations about other \n     aspects of the bill, particularly those that address family-\n     based immigration.\n       For example, the JCPA believes that several aspects of \n     Title V of the Senate compromise are unworkable and unjust. \n     Cutting entire categories of family-based immigration and \n     restructuring our current immigration system to favor \n     employment-based ties over family ties not only undermines \n     the family values that our central to our national identity, \n     it is also detrimental to our economy.\n       Immigrant families bring an entrepreneurial spirit to our \n     country. Family-based immigration allows newcomers to pull \n     their resources together, start businesses, integrate more \n     easily into their communities and be more productive workers. \n     In addition, using education, English proficiency and job \n     skills as the basis for obtaining a green card does not \n     necessarily meet the economic need, as the U.S. Department of \n     Labor predicts that the U.S. economy has a higher demand for \n     low-skilled workers.\n       Therefore, the JCPA urges you to:\n       Vote ``Yes'' on the Clinton/Hagel Amendment to Include \n     Minor Children and Spouses of Lawful Permanent Residents in \n     the immediate Relative'' Category, thereby lifting the cap on \n     the number of visas available to these close family members.\n       Vote ``Yes'' on the Dodd/Hatch Amendment related to \n     Foreign-Born Parents of U.S. Citizens, which would increase \n     the annual cap of green cards for parents from 40,000 to \n     90,000, extend the duration of the parent visitor visa from \n     100 days to 365 days, and not impose collective punishment on \n     families when one member overstays their visa.\n       The JCPA is also concerned about the Title V provision that \n     arbitrarily sets the date of May 1st, 2005 as a cut-off for \n     clearing the backlog of applicants who have gone through \n     legal channels to try to reunite with their families in the \n     United States. Excluding individuals who have filed family-\n     based applications and paid fees after May 2005 sends the \n     wrong message that playing by the rules is not rewarded. \n     Unless this provision is fixed, the 800,000 applicants that \n     applied after the May 2005 cut-off will be re-directed to the \n     new application process, where they will have to compete \n     in an untested point system that is stacked against them, \n     in order to reunite with their family members.\n       Therefore, the JCPA urges you to:\n       Vote ``Yes'' on the Menendez/Hagel Amendment on Family \n     Backlog Cut-off Date, which would change the May 1, 2005 cut-\n     off date to January 1, 2007, the same cut-off date set for \n     the legalization for undocumented immigrants. The Menendez \n     amendment would also add 110,000 green cards a year to avoid \n     creation of a new backlog or cause families who went through \n     legal channels to wait longer than 8 years to reunite with \n     their loved ones in the United States.\n       The JCPA applauds the Senate's commitment to passing a \n     comprehensive immigration reform package this year. The \n     alternative is the status quo, which has proven to produce \n     suffering, exploitation, family separation and chaos. \n     However, the JCPA maintains serious reservations due to the \n     concerns outlined above. We therefore urge you to support the \n     above amendments to the agreement that reflect family values, \n     workability and fairness.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me at hsusskind@thejcpa.org or 202-789-2222 X10l.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Hadar Susskind,\n\n                                              Washington Director,\n     Jewish Council for Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            MALDEF--Promoting Latino Civil Rights Since 1968\n\n\n  IMMIGRATION DEBATE STARTS IN THE U.S. SENATE--Positive and negative \n                details emerge; first votes being taken\n\n       May 22, 2007.--On Monday, the U.S. Senate, by a vote of 69-\n     23, voted to begin debate on comprehensive immigration \n     reform. Contrary to the original plan to complete action by \n     Memorial Day, Senate leaders acknowledged that deliberations \n     will continue into June after the Memorial Day recess. MALDEF \n     will work with local organizations and leaders to organize \n     meetings and events while Senators are in their home states \n     to highlight the need for comprehensive immigration reform. \n     We encourage you also to work with local coalitions in your \n     area.\n       MALDEF is working to restore family reunification, support \n     realistic employment verification systems, and remove \n     unnecessary obstacles to legalizing the immigration status of \n     otherwise law-abiding people already in the United States. In \n     addition to drastically limiting the ability of U.S. citizens \n     to be reunited in the U.S. with their brothers, sisters, and \n     parents, the Senate bill arbitrarily terminates family \n     reunification petitions filed after May 1, 2005. Urge your \n     Senator to support Senator Menendez's effort to restore the \n     hope for reunification for families whose applications were \n     filed after May 1, 2005. Over 800,000 legal immigrants \n     currently waiting in line will be harmed if this provision is \n     not improved.\n       A key provision in the Senate bill requires all employers \n     to use a new government database to verify the employment \n     eligibility of every new hire within 18 months and every \n     existing employee, U.S. citizen or not, within three years. \n     Based on our experience with employer sanctions, we expect \n     significant discrimination to result against Latino workers. \n     The bill would bypass the existing Department of Justice \n     Civil Rights office and require discrimination victims to \n     complain to the Department of Homeland Security. The bill \n     also shields the implementing rules from class action \n     challenges and bars a court from awarding attorney fees to \n     those, like MALDEF, that would challenge the regulations. \n     These features must be changed.\n       The legalization program makes unauthorized immigrants \n     eligible for a new ``Z'' visa if they entered the United \n     States as late as December 31, 2006. The program would start \n     six months after the bill is enacted and individuals (and \n     heads of households on behalf of their spouse and minor \n     children) would have up to a year and potentially two years \n     to apply. If they are eligible, unauthorized immigrants would \n     have an immediate interim stay of removal even before they \n     applied. These are the most positive features of the \n     compromise. MALDEF is working to strengthen other features \n     such as the costs, timing and eligibility restrictions.\n       One of the first amendments expected, as early as today, \n     may be offered by Senators Feinstein (CA) and Bingaman (NM). \n     It would reduce the number of future ``temporary workers'' by \n     50% and permit 200,000 instead of 400,000 to enter per year. \n     This amendment does not address our key objections to the \n     temporary worker provision, namely, that it would be costly \n     to the workers and complicated for employers; it would allow \n     the families of only higher income workers to join them in \n     the United States; and it would require workers to leave \n     after two years and remain outside the U.S. for a year before \n     returning. The United States needs more workers than are \n     currently available in the domestic workforce. The flaws in \n     the program relate not to the number of workers but to the \n     conditions upon their entry and in their work environment.\n       While the U.S. Senate is in session debating the \n     immigration bill, you will be receiving a special daily \n     edition of The MALDEFian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I had originally come to the floor \nto\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\noffer two amendments on Social Security. However, I have yielded to the \nrequest from Senator Kennedy to withhold, and he has told me that I \nwill be able to offer those amendments on the first day we return and \ntake this bill up on the floor again.\n  Madam President, I did wish to speak, however, on what I hope to do \nwith this bill. I think there are some very good features of this bill. \nIt has been negotiated really for years. The good features are the \nborder security and we do have benchmarks that are required to be done \nbefore any temporary worker program or dealing with the backlog of \npeople who are in our country illegally begins.\n  We will have benchmarks that are finite for border security. That is \na good feature of this bill. It also has a temporary worker program \ngoing forward. I think it is essential, if we are going to have border \nsecurity in the future in this country, that we have a temporary worker \nprogram that works. If we do not have a temporary worker program that \nworks, we will not have border security. Many people are not putting \nthat together, but it is essential that you put it together because if \nwe do not have a way for people to come into this country and fill the \njobs that are being unfilled because we do not have enough workers who \nwill do those jobs, then we will never be able to control our borders.\n  I am supportive of those parts of the bill. What I cannot support in \nthis bill and what I am going to try to make a positive effort to \nchange are basically two areas. First is the amnesty portion of the Z \nvisa. It would allow people to come to this country illegally, stay \nhere, and if they do not wish to have a green card, they would never \nhave to return. And that visa would be able to be renewed as long as \nthe person wanted to stay here and work. I will offer an amendment at \nthe appropriate time that will take the amnesty out of the bill and \nrequire that before a person can work in this country legally, if they \nare here illegally, they would have to go home and apply from outside \nthe country. We will have a time that will allow that to happen in an \norderly way, probably 2 years after the person gets their temporary \ncard when they register to say they are in our country illegally, which \nthey will be required to do. Then they would have 2 years from the time \nthey get that first temporary card to go home and register at home to \ncome in our country legally.\n  I think taking out the amnesty part of this bill would be a major \nstep in the right direction, to say, for people who are here illegally \ntoday, they can get right with the law by applying from home, just as \nall future workers will have to do. So there would not be an amnesty \nfor people who would be able to work here, stay here, and never go \nhome. That would be my amendment which I would like to offer at the \nappropriate time.\n  The second area I think must be fixed is in the Social Security area. \nWe all know our Social Security system is on the brink of failure. We \nknow that in the year 2017, the system will start to pay out more than \nit receives. By 2041, the trust fund will be exhausted.\n  Now, in 2017, under the present law, we will have to make adjustments \nthat will either increase Social Security taxes or decrease payments to \nSocial Security recipients. If we put more people into our system who \nhave gotten credits illegally working in this country, it is going to \nbring forward the year in which we have to start either lowering the \npayments or raising the taxes. I don't think that is right. I do not \nthink we should give Social Security credits to people who will be Z \nvisa holders in this country for the time they have worked illegally.\n  In the underlying bill, they do address the issue of fraudulent \ncards. I commend them for putting that in the bill. If you have paid \nSocial Security with a fraudulent number or a card that is not yours, \nyou will not be able to get credit for Social Security. To be very fair \nand honest, that is a good part of this bill, but it does not deal with \nthe people who have a card in their own name, but they have worked \nillegally.\n  That is what one of my amendments will attempt to address, that we \nwill also not give credit to people who have a card in their name, but \nthey either obtained it illegally or they have overstayed a visa. So I \nhope we can also not give credit for that illegal time they have worked \neven if the card is in their name, but it was not their legal right to \nwork. If we can do that and then start a person, when they are on the \nproper visa, toward getting credit, I think the American people will \nfeel that is a fairer system.\n  The second area I hope to address is the new future flow of temporary \nworkers. Now, under the bill, the temporary workers who will be coming \nin after the backlog of the illegal workers is dealt with, those people \nshould not ever go into the Social Security system because, according \nto this bill, they will be limited to a 6-year period. It is very \nimportant that in dealing with those temporary workers, that they will \nnot ever be eligible for Social Security, nor should they be, because \nthey will not have the requisite number of quarters.\n  What my second amendment does is allow them to take what they have \nactually put into the Social Security system through the employee \ndeduction. It will allow them to take that home when they leave the \nsystem. We think--I think that is a fair approach for both the person \nworking and also the Social Security system itself, that they would get \nback what they put in, but they would not be eligible for our Social \nSecurity system, which would be much more costly down the road.\n  In addition, the Medicare deduction which is taken from the employee \nwould also go into a fund which is already a fund in place that now \nallows compensation for uncompensated health care to a county hospital \nor to a health care provider that delivers a baby of an illegal \nimmigrant who cannot pay or does any emergency service for an illegal \nimmigrant today.\n\n  We know many hospitals--I know that in my home State of Texas, my \nhospitals in my major cities always talk about how much they are having \nto raise taxes on the taxpayers who live in their districts because \nthere is so much use of the health care facilities by illegal \nimmigrants who cannot pay. So the Medicare deduction would go into a \nfund that would compensate health care providers for service to foreign \nworkers who would not be able to pay.\n  Those are the two amendments which I think would assure that the \ntaxpayers of our country and the contributors to the Social Security \nsystem who have earned the right to have that safety net would not be \nunfairly taxed for people who have not been legally in the system or \npeople who do not have the quarters that would be requisite. I hope we \ncan take these amendments up. I hope they will be acceptable. If we can \ntake the amnesty out of this bill by assuring that everyone who is here \nillegally will have to apply outside of our country to be able to come \nin legally to work, then we have set the precedent of the rule of law \nwhich we have always prided ourselves on in this country. If we can \nassure that the Social Security system is not also unduly burdened with \nquarters given for illegal work, then I think the American people will \naccept that we have to address this issue in a responsible way.\n  I have heard the outcry of people about this bill, and I think some \nof that outcry is justified. But I think we can fix the parts that are \nnot in tune with the American people and also do what is right for our \ncountry going forward because there is one thing on which I think we \ncan all agree; that is, we have a system that is broken when you have \n10 to 12 million people--and that is an estimate because we do not know \nfor sure--who are working in our country illegally. They are not being \ntreated fairly, nor are the American people who do live by the rule of \nlaw being treated fairly. It is a system that is broken, and it is a \nvery complicated and hard problem to fix, but that is our \nresponsibility.\n  I respect those who have tried, in a bipartisan way, to put forward a \nbill. As a person who has written a book, as a person who has written \nlegal briefs, I know that the person who puts out the first draft is \nalways going to be the one who is under attack. But someone has to do \nit, and the people who have worked on this bill did step out and say: \nHere is the starting point.\n  Congressman Mike Pence and I, last year, when the House and Senate \nbroke down in negotiations over this issue, did the same thing. We came \nout with\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nwhat we thought was a starting point that would be the right approach, \nand the principles we laid down were that we would have a guest worker \nprogram which would not include amnesty but would be a fair and \nworkable guest worker program. It would have private sector \ninvolvement. It would have border security as our No. 1 goal. It would \nalso preserve the integrity of our Social Security system. Congressman \nPence and I tried to do that last year. Many of the elements in the \nHutchison-Pence plan are in the bill before us.\n  If we can perfect this bill and take the amnesty out by requiring \neveryone to apply outside our country--and it can be done in a \nresponsible way mechanically because you would have some amount of \ntime--1 or 2 years--to do it so that it would not be a glut on the \nsystem. I regret the argument that you cannot do it. I think we can. I \nalso think we need to make a responsible effort, and that is exactly \nwhat I am going to try to do.\n  I hope all our colleagues will work in a positive way to try to fix \nthe parts that we think are bad, to admit that there are some good \nparts. The border security and the temporary worker program are very \ngood, and the part about the Social Security protection for fraudulent \ncards is good. Let's try to make it better. Let's try to make it a bill \nthat everyone will accept as fair for America, fair for foreign \nworkers, helps our economy, and keeps our borders secure. That is what \nwe owe the people. I hope to make a contribution in that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I see my friend from Vermont on his \nfeet. I know from conversation that he wants to modify his amendment.

Madam President, I wish to first describe what I am going \nto try to do at this moment so all Senators will know. I am going to \nask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending Sanders amendment \nfor the purpose of offering an amendment which I am going to offer and \nthen, after a brief comment of 3 to 5 minutes, I will ask unanimous \nconsent to return to the Sanders amendment as the pending business \nbefore the Senate. I don't wish to mislead anybody about what I am \ndoing. This should be a total of about 5 minutes, and we will be back \nwhere we started. My amendment will be at the desk for later \nconsideration.\n  I make that unanimous consent request to set aside the pending \nSanders amendment for the purpose of offering my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I had understood there \nwould be an opportunity for me to speak after Senator Sanders and \nSenator Durbin. Are we going to be in a situation where I may not be \nallowed to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Alabama through the Chair, I \nwill be completed in 3 to 5 minutes, and we will be in exactly the same \nplace we started. The Sanders amendment will be pending with no other \nrequirements under the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, and \n     Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 1231 to \n     amendment No. 1150.\n\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that employers make efforts to recruit American \n                                workers)\n\n       In section 218B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n     as added by section 403(a), strike ``Except where the \n     Secretary of Labor has determined that there is a shortage of \n     United States workers in the occupation and area of intended \n     employment to which the Y nonimmigrant is sought, each'' and \n     insert ``Each''.\n\n       In section 218B(c)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act, as added by section 403(a), strike ``Except where the \n     Secretary of Labor has determined that there is a shortage of \n     United States workers in the occupation and area of intended \n     employment for which the Y nonimmigrant is sought--'' and \n     insert ``That--''.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Grassley. The new Y guest worker program included in \nthe immigration bill would require employers to recruit Americans \nbefore hiring a guest worker. That is our first obligation. If there is \na job opening in America, an American should have the first chance to \nget it. That is the intent of the bill, but there is one loophole. The \nloophole allows the Secretary of Labor to declare a labor shortage and \nthen waive the requirement of offering the job to an American. We don't \ndefine what a labor shortage is. This amendment removes that right of \nthe Secretary of Labor.\n  What it means is, as there are job openings, they will always be \noffered first to Americans. Shouldn't that be our starting point, \nalways offer the job first to an American, to see if an unemployed \nperson or someone else wants to take it? Then if the job is not filled, \nwe can consider other options. We know when it comes to H-1B visas, \nwhich are visas offered to skilled workers to come into this country to \nfill in gaps for engineers and architects and professionals, there have \nbeen abuses. When we had the openings for the H-1B visas, opportunities \nfor people to come into this country, it turned out that 7 out of the \n10 firms that won the right to offer H-1B visas were not American \ncompanies trying to fill spots where they couldn't find Americans. They \nturned out to be foreign companies that were outsourcing workers to the \nUnited States, exactly the opposite of what we had hoped for. We don't \nwant that to happen with the temporary guest worker program. This \namendment would eliminate this jobs shortage exception. It would \nrequire that in temporary guest worker positions, the first job \noffering always be to an American. It is simple. Senator Grassley and I \noffer it. It is supported by the AFL-CIO and the building trades \nunions, the laborers and Teamsters, many other organizations. I urge my \ncolleagues, when we return after our Memorial Day recess, to consider \nthis amendment. It is a very important amendment to stand faithful to \nour first obligation, our people in America who are looking for jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set my amendment aside and return to the \nSanders amendment as the pending amendment before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think we are in a position to accept \nthe amendment of the Senator from Vermont as modified. What I propose \nto do is to speak very briefly on the Vitter amendment, and then it \nwould be my expectation that we would move to Senator Sessions to have \nan opportunity for him to offer his amendment. He has been on the floor \na great deal today trying to be recognized. He has been at a markup on \nArmed Services so he couldn't be here earlier.\n  I have been informed there are some objections to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Vermont. We will have to process them and \nsee what we will do. It is not unusual that the information given to us \nis that we can accept and then others come forward. But we will try to \nwork it out.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1157\n\n  Briefly, Madam President, I oppose the Vitter amendment. The core of \nthe legislation is to provide for border security, employer \nverification, a guest worker program, and a way to handle the 12 \nmillion undocumented immigrants. The Vitter amendment strikes title VI, \nwhich provides for the way of handling the 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants, which is, if not the heart of this bill, a vital organ of \nthe bill. Without this provision, the bill doesn't have the import \nwhich is necessary to deal with the immigration problem.\n  The 12 million undocumented immigrants are going to be in the United \nStates whether we deal with them in a systematic, appropriate way or \nnot. The only question is whether we eliminate the anarchy, having \nthem, as the expression is often used, living in the shadows, living in \nfear. If we systematize the approach, they come out of the shadows. \nThey register. We will have an opportunity to identify the criminal \nelement, deport a reasonable number when we identify those who can be, \nshould be deported, and then deal with the balance as the bill provides \nwith the Z visas.\n  Stated briefly, if you were to accept the Vitter amendment, there \nwould be nothing left but a shell of this bill. The whole bill is an \naccommodation of border security, employer verification for what we do \nin the guest worker program, and the 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants. For those reasons, I vigorously oppose the Vitter \namendment.\n  I believe we are now ready for the Senator from Alabama to offer his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, at the request of the leaders, we were \nin the process of trying to get some votes this afternoon. We were \nmoving along as well because the Appropriations Committee had asked us \nif we would be finished by 5 o'clock. I see my friend from Alabama who \nhas been extremely patient. He has been in the Armed Services \nCommittee, where I should have been earlier in the afternoon. He was \ndiligent there and arrived over here. He has important amendments on \nthe earned-income tax credit and others. The Senator from Vermont has \nbeen here all afternoon. He has a good amendment. We had initially, at \n2:15, said we would do the Vitter amendment. We were going to come back \nand do the Feingold amendment, but then we were told we couldn't vote \non that.\n  We were told we couldn't vote on Vitter because there were some \nmembers of his own party who chose not to do so. But we wanted to vote \non the amendment of the Senator from Vermont. Hopefully, he was going \nto be accepted, but that is not the case.\n  I hope we would have the opportunity to vote on that; then after \nthat, to recognize the Senator from Alabama for whatever time he might \nneed for the purpose of debate, rather than for voting. The request of \nthe leadership is to do the supplemental. We give assurance to the \nSenator from Alabama that we will consider his amendment at the \nearliest possible time after we return.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania to consider the following--if we could enter into a \nunanimous consent request that would allow the Senator from Alabama to \nlay down his amendments, to speak, and then withdraw the amendments, \nreturning to the Sanders amendment, and have unanimous consent at a \ntime certain that we would have a vote on the Sanders amendment; would \nthat be agreeable?\n  I would like to make that unanimous consent request, if the Senator \nfrom Alabama can tell us how much time he would need.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would prefer to have a vote on my \namendment tonight, if we could do so. I would be reluctant to have \nanother vote if we can't have a vote on the amendment I will offer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Senator from Vermont has been here \nall day waiting for this opportunity and has patiently waited as \nseveral suggested rollcalls have passed by. In fact, one was to be at 5 \no'clock. Without prejudicing the Senator from Alabama, I have a pending \namendment, too, or had one earlier, which I am willing to wait until \nafter the recess to consider. I think it might be a gesture of fairness \nto allow the Senator from Vermont to have his vote this evening, \nwhether the Senator and I get our chance or not. We will be back after \nMemorial Day.\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is a tough life in the pit here. If I desire to have \na vote tonight myself, what would be the difficulty with that? We could \ndo that at the same time as the vote on the Sanders amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think we have had a good debate and discussion on the \nSanders amendment. It was the request of the leadership that we have \nthe supplemental, which has been extremely important. There is going to \nbe action on that later this evening. They had initially asked us if we \ncould conclude at 4 o'clock. We have been trying to conclude so that \nMembers who want to address the supplemental would be able to address \nthe supplemental. That is basically the reason for that. We have been \nhere, as the Senator from Pennsylvania knows, ready to do business \nsince 9:30 this morning. We were glad to. I had hoped--and I apologize \nto the Senator from Vermont because we were all set to have a rollcall \non that. Then it appeared it might have been accepted. I was asked, \nrequested by Senators to hold for a few moments to see whether it could \nnot have been cleared. I could ask unanimous consent that the \namendments of the Senator from Alabama be considered on Tuesday at a \ntime agreeable to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, there will be a number of amendments I \nwould like to have considered and a number of others that need to be \nconsidered after we come back.\n  I would just reluctantly state that if we have a vote, I would need \nand request that my vote be also tonight; otherwise, I would object to \nthe unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Alabama yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I say to the Senator, I have been \ninformed by staff that his amendment has not been filed, and we have \nnot seen a copy of it. Senator Feingold, who earlier had an amendment, \nstepped aside so Senator Sanders would have his chance. I say to the \nSenator from Alabama, it appears some who have been waiting all day are \nlooking for a chance for a vote, and the Senator from Alabama is asking \nfor consideration of an amendment that has not been filed and we have \nnot seen.\n  Madam President, I say to the Senator, could I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Alabama be recognized to offer an amendment and \nthat he then be recognized for up to 15 minutes; that following his \nremarks, the Senate resume consideration of the Sanders amendment and \nthere be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Sanders \namendment, with no second-degree amendment in order to the Sanders \namendment prior to the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, if I would be allowed to make my two \namendments pending and to speak for 15 minutes, I would forgo a request \nfor a vote tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, did the Senator say two amendments?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have two amendments. They are both \non the same subject. I would rather offer both. I am not sure which \none--I would never ask the Senate to vote on both, but I would like to \noffer both.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I will renew my unanimous consent \nrequest and see if the Senator from Alabama will find it acceptable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sessions be recognized to offer \ntwo amendments and be given up to 15 minutes to speak to those \namendments; that following his remarks, the Senate resume consideration \nof the Sanders amendment and there be 2 minutes of debate prior a vote \nin relation to that amendment, equally divided, with no second-degree \namendments in order to the Sanders amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WHITEHOUSE). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Illinois for \nhis expertise in extracting that agreement from this confusion.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1234 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and I \nsend an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1234 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the more significant \nramifications of the immigration bill that is on the floor today is \nthat it will confer immediately on persons in our country illegally the \nbenefit of the earned-income tax credit. This is not a little bitty \nmatter. The earned-income tax credit is the largest aid program for \nlow-wage workers in America. Last year, the earned-income tax credit \nbenefitted over 22 million people who. The average recipient who \nreceives a benefit under the earned-income tax credit receives over \n$1,700 per year--a very generous event. Last year, we spent $41.2 \nbillion on the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n  What this bill would do, for the people who are here illegally, is \nconfer on them a Z status, a legal status, and under the impact of the \nlegislation, these individuals would immediately become eligible for \nthe earned-income tax credit.\n  Let me tell you why this is not good policy, it is not required by \nmorality, and it certainly is not required of Congress as a matter of \nlaw or policy. The earned-income tax credit was created in 1975 to \nprovide extra income to the working poor. Before welfare reform \nparticularly, there was a widespread understanding that many people \ncould not work, could stay at home, draw a panoply of welfare benefits, \nand end up making more money not working than working. It was creating \na disincentive to work.\n  Back when President Nixon was President, Republicans--and I guess\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nDemocrats--moved forward with the earned-income tax credit. It has \ngrown and become a major factor for low-wage working Americans. The \nwhole concept behind the earned-income tax credit was to encourage \nAmericans to work, to affirm their work, to provide aid and assistance \nto them, unlike welfare. It is tied to their work. Now, I have to tell \nyou, I have looked at it, and I do not think it is achieving quite what \nwe want it to do. In fact, I would like to change that and have \nsuggested it over the years but, regardless, that is the deal.\n  So how is it, then, that we would think we have an obligation to \nprovide, as a reward to someone who came to our country illegally, a \nbenefit they are not now receiving, did not expect to receive when they \ncame to the country, legally or illegally, and then, just as an \nadditional benefit and reward to their legalization, we provide a \n$1,700-per-year benefit? It does not make good sense to me. I think it \nis bad policy, and it has a huge impact on our bottom line in the \nbudget we have to deal with.\n  I also note that in 1996, when we passed the Welfare Reform Act, \nafter much effort and work--President Clinton vetoed it twice but \nfinally signed it--an effort was made to ensure that persons who \nobtained a green card did not receive means-tested benefits until at \nleast they had a green card for 5 years. In other words, if you were \ncoming to our country as an immigrant, we wanted to be sure you were \nnot coming for welfare benefits, but to work, and that you would not \nreceive means-tested benefits until you had a green card for at least 5 \nyears.\n  So what happened was, when they wrote that, it did not touch the \nearned-income tax credit. I guess that is a Finance Committee matter. \nIt is a tax committee matter. It was not considered a normal welfare-\ntype payment, and that was not included in the list of things a person \nwas not allowed to get. But, in my own mind, I say to my colleagues, it \nis perfectly consistent in philosophy and in principle with that \nbecause the earned-income tax credit is a payment from the Federal \nGovernment to working Americans. You file a tax return and obtain the \nEarned Income Tax Credit after a year's work. When your work shows your \nincome level was below a certain level in America, you reach a \nqualifying level, and you get a tax refund of $1,700, $1,000, $2,400, \ndepending on the circumstances of yourself and your family. So that is \nwhat happens today for working Americans. The individuals who are in \nour country illegally at this moment have not been expecting to get \nthat, have not been getting it unless they are filing fraudulently, and \nthey should not get it. They should not get it as an additional benefit \nto receiving a Z visa, which allows them permanent residence in the \nUnited States and a pathway to citizenship.\n  That Z visa would also allow them to obtain quite a number of other \nbenefits, such as food stamps--which would not be affected by my \namendment--health care for children, and, of course, anyone who goes \ninto a hospital who has an emergency need will be treated whether they \nhave insurance or legal status or not. So their children would be \neducated in our school systems. All those things would occur. Nothing \nwould impact those things. But it is not correct as a matter of law, as \na matter of principle, and certainly it is not a matter of fiscal \nresponsibility for this Congress to pass an immigration reform bill \nthat confers another $18 billion to $20 billion in earned-income tax \ncredit on people whom we just rewarded with permanent residence in our \ncountry. That is not required. There is no requirement of that.\n  The Congressional Research Service describes the EITC in this way:\n\n       The earned income tax credit began in 1975 as a temporary \n     program--\n\n  Typical of Washington, isn't it, that we start something that is \ntemporary, and it is $40 billion a year now--\n\n     to return a portion of the Social Security taxes paid by \n     lower-income taxpayers and was made permanent in 1978. In the \n     1990s the program was transformed into a major component of \n     Federal efforts to reduce poverty and is now the largest \n     antipoverty entitlement program.\n\n  I bet most Americans did not know that the EITC is the largest \nentitlement program on the books.\n  Now, I have had a fairly positive view of the earned-income tax \ncredit. I think in many ways it is a good philosophy to help Americans \nget out, get moving, make some work. They often start out at lower wage \njobs, and it sounds bad sometimes for them, and they are not making \nenough to get by. This earned-income tax credit can really be a benefit \nto them, and if they stay at that job, if they work at it, if they are \nresponsible and they come to work on time and do their duty \neffectively, most people in America get promoted. Their wages go up, \nand they do better and better. So I do not think it is a bad program, \nbut it is a very expensive program, and for a number of reasons it \ncould be operated better.\n  I will again say to my colleagues, I am not of the belief that it is \nrequired of us that we should confer on persons who came into our \ncountry illegally every single benefit we confer on those who wait in \nline and come to our country legally. I just do not think that is \nrequired. One of the things in particular I would suggest not to be \nconferred--should not be conferred--upon them is the extensive benefits \nof the earned-income tax credit.\n  In other words, we do not want to attract people to America on things \nother than their wages and salary. We have enough people who need help \nin America. We have a lot of people out there working who, frankly, \nmaybe did not have a good home life. They have not been as reliable as \nthey should have been. Maybe they have gotten in trouble a time or two. \nWe need our American businesses to take a chance on those people. We \nneed to help them get their lives together and establish a good work \nhistory and start making some money. The earned-income tax credit comes \nin as a refundable tax credit on top of that as a real bonus to them, \nand that is good. But it should not be an attraction to draw people \ninto our country because most of the persons who come into America as \nan illegal immigrant, at least in the first years, tend to make the \nsalary levels that qualify for the earned-income tax credit. So there \nwill be a disproportionately high number of persons who will qualify \nfor that.\n\n  I see my time is about up. I will reluctantly accept having a vote, \nas Senator Kennedy suggested we can do early in the next week when we \ncome back, if that will help move us along tonight. But I want to tell \nmy colleagues to think about this amendment--really think about it. \nThis is not a harsh amendment. This is not an amendment to hurt \nanybody. It is an amendment that says: OK, if you are in our country, \njust like the 1996 Welfare Reform Act said, and you qualify for the Z \nvisa under this amnesty program, or whatever you would like to call \nwhat we have in this bill, you are not automatically eligible for the \nearned-income tax credit. We absolutely should not allow that to \nhappen. It is not necessary. It is not right to do so. It is a raid on \nthe Treasury of the United States. It draws money from people who have \npaid taxes for years.\n  I would have to note, under the bill that is on the Senate floor, the \nimmigration bill before us, are individuals who have been here \nillegally, some of whom may have made nice incomes and are absolved \nfrom paying a portion of their back taxes. So they don't even pay all \nback taxes. Then we are going to give them, immediately, the next year, \nan earned-income tax credit that could be a very substantial amount of \nmoney, and that comes right out of the taxpayers' pockets, a billion \nhere and a billion there and a billion here and a billion there. It \ndoes add up, and it is significant.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to consider this and hope that they \nwill.\n  I also wanted to express my support for Senator Hutchison for the \nanalysis on Social Security of persons who come here to work and who \nviolate their stays and overstay, that they should not receive the full \nbenefit of Social Security. One of the things you have to have if you \nare going to have an effective immigration policy is you must have a \nsituation in which you don't reward people for bad behavior, for \nheaven's sake. We certainly are not very good at apprehending people \nwho violate the law, who either came in illegally or overstayed and \nremoved them from the country, but surely we ought to set up a system \nthat says if you violate the law, the way you come or stay here, you \ndon't get Federal taxpayer benefits and a reward as a result of\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nthat illegal behavior. If we are not able to make those distinctions \nand stand with clarity on those kinds of questions, I suggest we are \nnot able to take a stand on most any principle of law. So that worries \nme.\n  Senator Cornyn, who spoke earlier and very effectively, asked me to \nmake this note for the record; that his modification corrected--he \nstated in his remarks that he made a modification to his amendment to \ncorrect the page number. He also wanted to make clear that he did also \ninclude a technical correction beyond that, and he didn't want to \nmislead anyone. He asked that I clarify that for him so that there \nwould be no dispute about that.\n  Also, some people have suggested that the Cornyn amendment would \namount to an unconstitutional ex post facto rule because of its \nretroactive application. Now, that is a pretty harsh thing to say about \nJudge Cornyn. Senator Cornyn served on the Supreme Court of the State \nof Texas and he would just suggest this: In order for any immigration \nprovision to have immediate effect, it is imperative that they apply to \nthe conduct and convictions that occurred before enactment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute, and I will wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So, also, I would note on behalf of Senator Cornyn's \namendment that if prior conduct and convictions were not covered, you \nwould have an immigration regime that essentially welcomes the \nfollowing people, and this is not how the immigration system should \noperate. For example, as recently as 2005--I see my time is up, and I \nwon't go into that. I will just note that Senator Cornyn's amendment as \nhe offered it will meet constitutional muster, and it is not subject to \nthe criticism some have suggested, and please do support it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of the men and women who would become \nlegal residents of the United States under the terms of this \nlegislation are required to pay income tax like every other worker in \nAmerica. What the Sessions amendment would do is really quite \nextraordinary and grossly unfair. It would arbitrarily deny those \nimmigrants who have become legal residents one of the tax benefits \navailable to every taxpayer under the Internal Revenue Code. That \nprovision is the earned-income tax credit, a provision designed to \nreduce the I tax burden on low income families with children.\n  It is fundamentally wrong to subject immigrant workers to a \ndifferent, harsher Tax Code than the one that applies to everyone else \nin the country. An immigrant worker should pay exactly the same income \ntax that every other worker earning the same pay and supporting the \nsame size family pays--no less and no more. We should not be designing \na special punitive Tax Code for immigrants that makes them more than \neveryone else. Yet that is exactly what the Sessions amendment seeks to \ndo.\n  The Session amendment would result in highly inconsistent treatment \nof legal immigrant residents, and would drastically increase the amount \nof tax that many of these families had to pay. They would be subject to \nincome and payroll taxes in the same manner as other workers but would \nbe denied the use of a key element of the Tax Code that is intended to \noffset the relatively heavy tax burdens that low-income working \nfamilies, especially those with children, otherwise would face.\n  Most of the EITC is simply a tax credit for the payment of other \ntaxes, especially regressive payroll taxes. The EITC was specifically \ndesigned to offset the payroll tax burden on low-income working \nparents. The Treasury Department has estimated that a large majority of \nthe EITC merely compensates for a portion of the federal income, \npayroll, and excise taxes paid by the low-income tax filers who qualify \nto receive it.\n  A significant share of families that receive the EITC owe federal \nincome tax before the EITC is applied, in addition to paying payroll \ntaxes. Low-income working immigrant families in this category who would \nbe denied the EITC under the Sessions Amendment would consequently face \na dramatic increase in their income tax bill, requiring them to pay \nmuch higher taxes than other taxpayers with similar earnings.\n  Other families with even less income would not receive a refund to \noffset the disproportionately large payroll taxes they paid, unlike \nother workers with comparable wages and dependents.\n  To qualify for the EITC, under current law, a taxpayer must satisfy \nthe following criteria: 1., Be a US citizen or legal resident; 2., have \na valid Social Security number for both the worker and any qualifying \nchildren; 3., have earned income from employment or self-employment; \n4., have total income that falls below a certain level, and; 5., file \nan income tax return.\n  Current law already clearly prohibits illegal immigrants from \nreceiving the EITC. No immigrant can receive the earned income tax \ncredit unless he or she is a legal resident who is a low wage worker \npaying payroll taxes and filing an income tax return. These are men and \nwomen who are conscientiously fulfilling their responsibilities to \ntheir adopted country and they deserve to be treated like all other \nworkers in America.\n  This amendment would hurt children. The United States has more \nchildren living in poverty than any other industrialized country. We \nneed to help children, not hurt them. And they should not have to pay \nfor the sins of their parents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6622-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6622-S6625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. President, this so-called compromise doesn't do nearly enough to \nend the war, and I intend to vote against it. I support our troops. \nThey have fought bravely and with great courage under extraordinarily \ndifficult circumstances. But it is wrong for the President to send our \ntroops to war without a plan to win the peace, and it is wrong for \nCongress to keep them in harm's way on the current failed course.\n  The best way to protect our troops is to bring this war to an end, \nnot to pour more American lives into this endless black hole our Iraq \npolicy has become. It is wrong for Congress to continue to defer to a \nPresidential decision that we know is fatally flawed.\n  The American people know this war is wrong. It is wrong to abdicate \nour responsibilities by allowing this war to drag on and on and on \nwhile our casualties mount higher and higher. The President was wrong \nto get us into this war, wrong to conduct it so poorly, wrong to ignore \nthe views of the American people, and wrong to stubbornly refuse to \nsign legislation requiring a timetable for the orderly and responsible \nwithdrawal of our combat troops from Iraq.\n  It is time to end this continuing tragic loss of American lives and \nbegin to bring our soldiers home.\n  For the sake of our troops, we cannot repeat the mistakes of Vietnam \nand allow this war to drag on long after the American people know it is \na profound mistake.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before yielding so we can have a vote on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Vermont, I would like to respond to \nmy friend from Alabama regarding the earned-income tax credit.\n  The earned-income tax credit is to help children--help children. Of \nall the industrialized nations of the world, we have more children \nliving in poverty than any other Nation in the world. The earned-income \ntax credit is to help the children. They are not the lawbreakers; the \nparents are the lawbreakers. Yet this amendment will take it out on the \nchildren.\n  We don't do it for those who have committed murder and gone to \nprison. We don't do it for those who have committed aggravated assault. \nWe don't do it for those who commit burglary, but we are going to do it \nfor those who have been adjusted in terms of their status of being \nillegal. That is what the\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\nSessions amendment does. We don't do it for murderers, we don't do it \nfor burglars, we don't do it for those who have committed the most \negregious crimes, but we are going to do it in terms of those whose \npositions we are changing and altering in terms of their adjustment of \nstatus.\n  The people who are affected by it are the children. It doesn't seem \nto be the way we ought to go. But we will have a longer period of time \nto debate this at another time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1223\n\n  I believe now we are prepared to vote, and I suggest that we get to \nit as quickly as we can so that we don't have other interference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I thank Senator \nDurbin and Senator Kennedy for their support. This amendment has been \nmodified. The H-1B program would increase from $1,500 to $5,000, a \n$3,500 increase. The new revenue, as I mentioned earlier, would be used \nto establish a scholarship program so we can begin to see young \nAmericans get the education they need for these professions so that we \ndo not have to go abroad to bring people in to do the jobs that \nAmerican workers should be doing.\n  I would appreciate support for this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to commend the Senator from Vermont for this \namendment. I intend to support it. Years ago I thought we ought to have \nit at $3,000. It went down to $1,000, and it has come back up to \n$1,500. The Senator has brought this up to a much more reasonable \namount. I think he has made a very strong case for it. These funds will \nbe used to make sure we get Americans being able to do those jobs. That \nis what the purpose is: to see we have Americans able to do those jobs, \nthose H-1B jobs. It makes a great deal of sense. I commend the Senator.\n  There is one provision in here on the public hospitals, and I know he \nwill work with us to try to address that in the conference, and I thank \nhim for it. I hope the Senate will support his amendment.\n  I think we are prepared to vote on this amendment. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just a word or two. I think it is a good \namendment. I commend the Senator from Vermont. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1191.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1191 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nmy amendment to improve our Nation's treatment of asylum seekers.\n  This amendment would implement the key recommendations of the \ncongressionally established U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom, which 2 years ago issued a report raising serious concerns \nabout the protections offered asylum seekers arriving in this country.\n  I think it is worth noting that the Commission that issued this \nreport was established by Congress in 1998 as a result of legislation \nfirst introduced by Senator Specter, in concert with the efforts of \nSenators Nickles, Brownback, myself, and several others. Senator \nSpecter should be proud of that work and accomplishment. I hope we can \nsee this amendment as one of the fruits of that labor.\n  The Commission reported an unacceptable risk that genuine asylum \nseekers were being turned away because their fears--and the real \ndangers--of being returned to their home countries were not fully \nconsidered.\n  The Commission also found that while asylum seekers are having their \napplications considered, they are often detained for months in maximum \nsecurity prisons and jails, without ever having been fairly considered \nfor release on bond. The Commission described conditions of detention \nthat are completely unacceptable for a just nation to impose on people \nwho are trying to escape war, oppression, religious persecution, even \ntorture.\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\n  Since the Commission's report was issued, I have routinely asked \nofficials from the Department of Homeland Security what is being done \nabout the problems the Commission identified. I have been assured that \nthe Department was reviewing the report's findings. The time for review \nis over. The time for Congress to act is now.\n  My amendment will implement the Commission's most important \nrecommendations. It calls for sensible reforms that will safeguard the \nNation's security, improve the efficiency of our immigration detention \nsystem, and ensure that people fleeing persecution are treated in \naccordance with this Nation's most basic values.\n  My amendment would implement quality assurance procedures to ensure \nthat DHS officers carefully and accurately record the statements of \npeople who may have a legitimate fear of returning to their countries.\n  Asylum seekers not subject to mandatory detention would be entitled \nto a hearing to determine if they could be released. Providing bond \nhearings for those asylum seekers who are low-risk will free up \ndetention beds.\n  At an average cost of $90 per person per day, often much higher, \ndetention beds have always been scarce. Provisions in the Senate \nlegislation before us would vastly increase the numbers of aliens being \nheld in detention. Our immigration system should prioritize available \nspace for aliens who pose a risk of flight, a threat to public safety \nor are subject to mandatory detention.\n  The amendment also promotes secure alternatives to detention of the \ntype DHS has already begun to implement.\n  For those who must remain detained, we are obliged as a compassionate \nsociety to provide humane conditions at immigration facilities and \njails used by DHS. My amendment includes modest requirements to ensure \ndecent conditions, especially for asylum seekers, families with \nchildren, and other vulnerable populations. It requires improvements in \nkey areas, such as access to medical care and limitations on the use of \nsolitary confinement. And it creates a more effective system within DHS \nfor overseeing and inspecting facilities.\n  The origin of the United States is that of a land of refuge. Many of \nour Nation's founders fled here to escape persecution for their \npolitical opinions, their ethnicity, and their religion. Since that \ntime, the United States has honored its history and founding values by \nstanding against persecution around the world, offering refuge to those \nwho flee from oppression, and welcoming them as contributors to a \ndemocratic society.\n  I hope this amendment will be viewed as a noncontroversial way the \nNation can continue to honor that history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside \nand that the Senate return to the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1157\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have 1 minute each side. This will be \nthe final vote on the immigration bill this week. We have had great \ncooperation. We are enormously grateful to all the Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple, it is very \nstraightforward, and it is very important. It strikes title VI from the \nbill, which is the very controversial Z visa provision.\n  In my opinion, and the opinion of many people, many Americans, this \nis amnesty purely and simply, and that conclusion is important not \nbecause of a brand, not because of the word but because of what it \nmeans and what it will create.\n  It will create a magnet to increase illegal activity into the \ncountry, to encourage more of the same, more of the problem and not \nsolve the problem. That is why we must remove this title from the bill.\n  The key question in this debate is will this bill fundamentally \nrepeat the horrible mistakes of 1986 when we did amnesty but not nearly \nenough enforcement. I believe this bill, as it stands now, repeats that \nhorrible mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, legalization is good for national \nsecurity. We need to know the names of everyone living here. That is \nwhy the Department of Homeland Security supports earned legalization. \nAll of title VI was written with the close cooperation of Secretary \nChertoff and his staff.\n  Legalization is good for our economic prosperity. We need every \nworker in this country to join the formal economy and pay their taxes. \nThat's why the Department of Commerce supports earned legalization. All \nof title VI was written with the close cooperation of Secretary \nGutierrez and his staff.\n  Legalization is consistent with American family values. Would \nopponents of legalization deport children and divide families?\n  More than 1.6 million undocumented children live in the United \nStates.\n  More than 3.1 million U.S.-citizen children have at least one \nundocumented parent.\n  Legalization supports our broader reform effort. We must break \nAmerica's cycle of illegality. Enforcement at the worksite and \nelsewhere will fail if 12 million Americans and 5 percent of U.S. \nworkers remain in the shadows.\n  The American people support earned legalization. Poll after poll find \nthat large majorities of Americans want undocumented immigrants who \nhave lived and worked in the United States to have a chance to keep \ntheir jobs and earn legal status.\n  This support spans political parties and crosses demographics.\n  Americans understand that this is a complex problem that requires a \ncomprehensive solution.\n  Mr. President, this is not 1986; 1986 was amnesty. This is not \namnesty. Let's be very clear about it. Not only do you have to have a \nbackground check, but you pay fees of $5,500, you have to learn \nEnglish, you have to demonstrate you paid your taxes, you have to work \nfor the next 8 years and demonstrate that you have worked in the past \nif you are ever going to get a green card. You have to return home in \norder to get your application for a green card, and you have to go to \nthe back of the line. None of that was 1986.\n  Legalization is important for our national security. We have to know \nwho is in the United States of America. Legalization is important in \nterms of our economic prosperity so our economy can function well, and \nlegalization is important for the families. Do we think we are going to \ndeport 3.5 million American children who have parents who are \nundocumented? Are we going to send those people overseas?\n  This amendment will undermine the legislation. I hope it will be \nrejected by the Senate.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1157. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), and the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

and\n       (C) extend financing for alternative rural economic \n     activities beyond direct agricultural production;\n       (4) expanding efforts to reduce the transaction costs of \n     remittance flows in order to increase the pool of savings \n     available to help finance domestic investment in Mexico;\n       (5) encouraging Mexican corporations to adopt \n     internationally recognized corporate governance practices, \n     including anticorruption and transparency principles;\n       (6) enhancing Mexican efforts to strengthen governance at \n     all levels, including efforts to improve transparency and \n     accountability, and to eliminate corruption, which is the \n     single biggest obstacle to development;\n       (7) assisting the Government of Mexico in implementing all \n     provisions of the Inter-American Convention Against \n     Corruption (ratified by Mexico on May 27, 1997) and urging \n     the Government of Mexico to participate fully in the \n     Convention's formal implementation monitoring mechanism;\n       (8) helping the Government of Mexico to strengthen \n     education and training opportunities throughout the country, \n     with a particular emphasis on improving rural education; and\n       (9) encouraging the Government of Mexico to create \n     incentives for persons who have migrated to the United States \n     to return to Mexico.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding Bilateral Partnership on \n     Health Care.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government \n     of the United States and the Government of Mexico should \n     enter into a partnership to examine uncompensated and \n     burdensome health care costs incurred by the United States \n     due to legal and illegal immigration, including--\n       (1) increasing health care access for poor and under served \n     populations in Mexico;\n       (2) assisting Mexico in increasing its emergency and trauma \n     health care facilities along the border, with emphasis on \n     expanding prenatal care in the United States-Mexico border \n     region;\n       (3) facilitating the return of stable, incapacitated \n     workers temporarily employed in the United States to Mexico \n     in order to receive extended, long-term care in their home \n     country; and\n       (4) helping the Government of Mexico to establish a program \n     with the private sector\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n     to cover the health care needs of Mexican nationals \n     temporarily employed in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 414.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, Congress approved \nlegislation that would have changed the course of the U.S. occupation \nof Iraq. I say occupation because, frankly, that is what this is. Our \ntroops won the battle they were sent to fight. The dictator Saddam \nHussein is deposed and executed. His rotten government is no more, \nreplaced with a democratically elected Parliament, President, and Prime \nMinister. We all are cheered at the skill of our soldiers.\n  But, sadly, this President has not done justice by our brave troops. \nThe dreadful management of this occupation has resulted in chaos. Iraq \nis at war with itself and our troops are caught in the middle. That is \nwhy this Congress established a new direction for bringing our troops \nhome from this misbegotten occupation. The bill the President vetoed \nwould have refocused our military, not on the civil war in Iraq but, \nrather, on Osama bin Laden and his base of operations. It is time for \nthe President to take off his blinders and uncover his ears. White \nHouse obstinacy cannot continue to drive our military plans in Iraq.\n  With this supplemental funding legislation we begin to shift the \nresponsibility for Iraq's future off the shoulders of our military, and \nonto the shoulders of the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people. The \nWhite House wanted a blank check for the President's mangled occupation \nof Iraq. We are not going to sign on that dotted line--not now, not \never. The legislation that is before the Senate today is a step toward \nthat goal. It is not a giant leap, but it is progress. And it is only a \nfirst step. In a few weeks, this Senate is expected to focus on the \nDefense Department authorization bill. I shall press for a vote on the \nproposal Senator Clinton and I have outlined in the authorization for \nthe Iraq war and to give Congress a chance, just a chance, to decide \nwhether the so-called new mission in Iraq should continue. If this \nmission is so critical, then let the administration make its case and \nlet the people's elected Representatives--that is us--let the people's \nelected Representatives vote.\n  In July we will turn our attention to the Pentagon's fiscal 2008 \nfunding request, and in September we will consider the $145 billion war \nfunding request for the next fiscal year. Each of these bills is an \nopportunity to shape the future course of the mission in Iraq. Clearly, \nCongress is not turning from the debate on Iraq. On the contrary, we \nare just beginning this debate.\n  We have all committed to protecting our men and women in uniform. \nThis legislation provides the funding to do just that. We ensure $3 \nbillion for the purchase of mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles. \nThe 2,000 additional advanced armored vehicles that will be built with \nthese funds will help to save the lives of American soldiers and \nAmerican marines as they travel the lonely streets of Baghdad--the \nlonely streets of Iraq.\n  If our soldiers are injured in battle, this legislation ensures they \nwill receive high-quality health care when they come home. The fiasco \nat Walter Reed should be seared into our national consciousness. That \nis why this legislation provides $4.8 billion to ensure that troops and \nveterans receive the health care they have earned with their service.\n  A few weeks ago, we watched Kansas families try to put their lives \nback together after deadly tornadoes ripped through their homes. The \nKansas Governor pointed out that her State's National Guard equipment \nwas parked in Iraq and not at home, slowing cleanup and recovery \nefforts. Other States faced the potential for the exact same problem. \nThis supplemental bill provides $1 billion--that is 1 dollar for every \nminute since Jesus Christ was born--$1 billion for the National Guard \nand reserve to replace the trucks and heavy equipment that Guard units \nhave been directed to leave in Iraq.\n  Again today President Bush warned of terrorist attacks on American \nsoil. He talks a great deal about the threats of such attacks, but very \nseldom does he provide resources to protect the country. If the \nPresident's warnings are accurate, the $1 billion contained in this \nbill should help to save lives.\n  We include funds for port security and for mass transit security, for \nexplosive detection equipment at airports, and for several initiatives \nin the 9/11 bill that recently passed the Senate, including a more \naggressive screening of cargo on passenger airlines. We will not--no, \nwe will not--close our eyes to the huge gaps in our protections at \nhome.\n  We also work to heal the devastated communities still struggling to \nrecover from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. To this day, mangled \ntrash heaps stand where homes and families once lived. This White \nHouse, the Bush White House, sends billions of dollars to rebuild \nBaghdad but ignores the overwhelming needs in New Orleans, Slidell, \nBiloxi, and so many other places at home.\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\n  This bill invests $6.4 billion--that is $6.40 for every minute since \nJesus was born--this bill invests $6.4 billion to rebuild the gulf \ncoast communities and to restore the vibrance of this proud region.\n  I close, and I thank my ranking member, Senator Thad Cochran, for his \nhelp. I thank Representative Dave Obey, chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, and the Senate leaders, Senator Harry Reid \nand Senator Mitch McConnell. I thank the Appropriations Committee \nstaff: staff director, Charles Kieffer; Republican staff director, \nBruce Evans; and our subcommittee and professional staff members.\n  I appreciate, I deeply appreciate the long hours they have worked--\nyes, long hours they have worked to craft the supplemental legislation. \nI urge Senators, all Senators on both sides of the aisle, to support \nthis legislation. It is the product of bipartisan negotiations. That is \nright, isn't it, Thad?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Sometimes.\n  Mr. BYRD. It meets the critical needs of this country. It moves us \nforward in our efforts to change the dynamic in Iraq. We must \nchallenge--we must challenge--this President, our President, to open \nhis eyes to the truth and adopt the new direction in Iraq that this \nNation and the world so eagerly--yes, so anxiously--awaits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to talk first about the \nprocess and then the substance of this legislation. As everybody knows, \nwe will soon be considering the war supplemental bill entitled ``The \nU.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq \nAccountability Appropriations Act of 2007.''\n  That title is very important. As the title says, the legislation is \nan appropriations bill. The title refers to troop readiness. There is \nfinally, after several months of legislative wrangling, funding for the \ntroops that the President can sign.\n  The title refers to veterans care. There is funding for that. The \ntitle refers to Katrina recovery. There are funds for Hurricane Katrina \ndamage. The title also refers to Iraq accountability. There is language \nfinally in the form acceptable to the President so that he can sign it \ndealing with benchmarks on our mission in Iraq and the role of the \nIraqi Government.\n  The title of the bill, however, does not refer to any matters within \nthe jurisdiction of a committee I am very familiar with, the Finance \nCommittee. But take a look and you will find three categories of \nFinance Committee matters: One, the small business tax relief package; \ntwo, the so-called pension technicals; and, three, Medicaid and SCHIP \nprovisions.\n  Now, why does it matter whether these policy provisions travel in a \ntax-writing committee bill or an appropriations bill? It matters for \nseveral reasons. I had the pleasure of serving on both the Finance \nCommittee, and for a very short period of time during my career in the \nSenate, on the Appropriations Committee. They are the money committees \nof the Senate.\n  Appropriations bills, by and large, spend money. That is not \nentitlements, that is the set-asides in the budget. Finance Committee \nbills, on the other hand, raise revenue and deal with most of the \nhealth and welfare entitlement spending.\n  Both the Appropriations and Finance Committees have very strong \nconstitutional traditions, expertise in the complex subject matter, and \nseasoned memberships motivated and dedicated to service of the \nrespective committees. All you have to do is look at the careers of \nChairman Byrd, the ranking member, or Senator Baucus, to know that they \ndedicate themselves to these two great money committees of the Senate.\n  So when policy issues are processed outside of the Appropriations or \noutside the Finance Committee, necessary care, expertise, and \nexperience is lost. When I was chairman, I took great pains to avoid \ntaking on appropriations matters. More often than not, policy made \noutside of either of these committee jurisdictions will, it seems, \nsomehow need to be corrected.\n  There is another reason it matters; that is, policy made through the \ncommittee process is very transparent, and that is what American \nGovernment and the Congress is all about, transparency--the public \nbusiness to be done publicly. The committee's role is to air and \ncarefully consider proposals in the areas of committee jurisdiction.\n  We are really talking about transparency. Sunshine is the best \ndisinfectant. When the committee process is end-run, as I will \ndemonstrate in part of this bill, there is usually no positive reason. \nUsually the reason is expediency on the part of people, maybe even \nbeyond the control of the committee chairman, and I would suggest \nlegislative leadership.\n\n  It has happened not just now, it has happened under Republicans and \nunder Democrats. But I am pleased to say it has been effectively very \nrare over the last few years. Skipping the committee process on new \nproposals was the exception rather than the rule.\n  Unfortunately, now, with respect to the critical pieces of Finance \nCommittee jurisdiction, it looks as if leadership prefers to skip the \ncommittee, after I have been told privately and publicly so many times \nall of the work is going to be done through the committee. So I am \nhoping that what I am going to complain about is pretty much a \ntemporary pattern.\n  To sum it up, the people's business should be done in committees in a \ntransparent way so the people of this country know what is going on. \nCommittee process means sunshine. I think the committee process was \nabused on this legislation.\n  But the conference process was also abused. We never even went \nthrough the trappings of the committee process. We have an amended \nHouse bill that because of the imperative of an acceptable war funding \npackage has the force of a conference report.\n  How was the process abused? Just take a look at the bill, and you \nwill find a patchwork of unconnected provisions in the Finance \nCommittee jurisdiction that is not even mentioned in the title. Aside \nfrom a small business tax relief provision, no real back-and-forth \ndiscussion occurred on these matters, either in the Finance Committee \nor in conference.\n  With respect to the small business tax relief provisions, the House \nand Senate Democratic leadership set an arbitrary ceiling that \nconstrained our outstanding chairman, Senator Baucus, from reaching a \nbipartisan agreement which is so much in the tradition of how Senator \nBaucus and I work together.\n  The bottom line is, Republicans opened the door to a conference \nagreement without receiving assurances of a fair deal. I don't think we \ngot a fair deal. Once Republicans opened the door to the conference, \nthe door was effectively shut on full and meaningful participation.\n  Now, in the past, Republican leadership did similar things, and \nDemocrats cried foul. I am proud to say that on most, not all, Finance \nCommittee conferences, the Senate Democrats were represented and \npresent for final conference agreements. After crying foul about some \nconference processes, the Senate Democratic leadership insisted in \nprevious years on preconference agreements before letting Republicans \ngo to conference.\n  As I feared earlier in the year, the Senate Republican leadership \nwill have to similarly insist on assurances before conferences are \nconvened. This supplemental and its vetoed predecessor made the case \nthat the conference process can't be trusted.\n  Senate Republicans have no recourse other than to insist on \npreconference agreements, as we can learn from the Democratic minority \nof the previous 4 years.\n  Now, I want to turn to the substance of three categories of the \nFinance Committee matters that were inserted in the process, after \nspending my previous minutes on that process. Now to the substance.\n  The first matter deals with the small business tax relief package \nthat traveled with a minimum wage increase. The deal in the conference \nis basically the same deal presented by the Democratic negotiators on \nthe last appropriations bill. It favors the House position in number \nand composition of that package, practically ignoring the great work \nthat Senator Baucus and I did on these provisions.\n  From a small business standpoint, the House bill was a peanut shell. \nThe\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nSenate bill was real peanuts. Real peanuts--still not enough from my \nperspective but more, much more than what the House has.\n  As you can see here, I have got Mr. Peanut up here to demonstrate the \nSenate bill, the House bill, and the conference report. From a small \nbusiness standpoint, then, I want to repeat: The House bill was a \npeanut shell. The Senate bill was real peanuts. It is a missed \nopportunity because a conference agreement is a single, shriveled \npeanut, not helping small business the way small business ought to have \nbeen helped to offset the negative impacts on small business of a \nminimum wage tax increase.\n  We could have, in fact, provided small business with meaningful tax \nrelief that is contemporaneous with the effects of the minimum wage \nhike that I say, and I think economists agree, are negative toward \nsmall business.\n  This chart shows Mr. Peanut. It shows this bill at each of its \nstages--a peanut, a peanut shell, and shriveled peanut. What we are \ngoing to be voting on will be that shriveled peanut.\n  There is another matter that bothers me and this is the so-called \npension technical corrections. What is a technical correction, one \nmight ask. Technical corrections measures are routine for major tax \nbills. Last year's landmark bipartisan pension reform bill certainly \ncan be described as a major tax bill. It contained the most significant \nretirement security policy changes within a generation. There are \nproposals necessary to ensure that the provisions of the pension reform \nbill are working consistently within congressional intent and to \nprovide clerical corrections. That is what technical corrections means. \nBecause these measures carry out congressional intent, no revenue gain \nor loss is scored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Technical corrections is derived from a deliberative and consultative \nprocess among the congressional as well as administration tax staffs, \nwhere there is a great deal of expertise. That means the Republican as \nwell as the Democratic staffs, regardless of who is in the majority or \nminority of both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate \nFinance Committee, are involved, as well as Treasury Department \npersonnel, whether we have a Republican or Democratic President. All of \nthis work is performed with the participation and guidance of the \nnonpartisan professional staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. A \ntechnical enters the list only if all staffs agree it is appropriate. \nAny one segment I have listed can veto it. That is why we know it is \nnonpartisan. That is why we know it is technical. That is why we know \nit is not a substantive change in law. If it were, it would not be \ntechnical.\n  The pension provisions in this bill, the one we will be voting on in \na little while, represent then forgetting this process so you know \nthings are done right. It represents a cherry-picking of some, not all, \nof the technical corrections that these professional people, in a \nnonpartisan way, are currently trying to put together with a bill that \nwill come up later on.\n  In addition, there are pension provisions included in this bill that \nare called technical but are of great substance and are not then \ntechnical. Some of these proposals are even controversial. I have \nreviewed legislative history over the last 15-plus years, and that \nhistory informs me that this may be an unprecedented treatment of \ntechnical corrections. Techincals were processed on a 2000 year bill \nthat was not a tax-writing committee bill, but that package was a \nconsensus package. All the committees and the administration had signed \noff that year, 7 years ago. In other instances, technicals were \nprocessed on tax-writing committee vehicles. In all these instances, \nthe packages represented an agreement between all the tax-writing \ncommittees, Republican and Democratic, and the Treasury.\n  In this case, there are four committees involved, the two tax-writing \ncommittees and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, what we call the HELP Committee, and the House Education and \nLabor Committee. To illustrate the controversy over the pensions \ntechnical package, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \ncopy of a letter from HELP Committee Chairman Kennedy and Ranking \nMember Enzi. The letter lays out their objections to the House \ntechnical process. I also ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter \nI wrote regarding the Finance Committee's jurisdiction be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n           Pensions,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders: Last year we worked with other committees to \n     author the most extensive overhaul of pension funding rules \n     in a generation. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was \n     signed into law in August 2006, following extensive \n     bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. Conferees were intent on \n     ensuring that retirement plans are properly funded, and that \n     Americans' retirement savings will be there when they need \n     it. This law passed the Senate with overwhelming support, 93-\n     5.\n       We understand that a number of pension provisions \n     originating in the House may be included in the emergency war \n     spending bill. While moving forward on pensions technical \n     corrections is a goal that many members share, moving House \n     pension technical corrections separately on this spending \n     bill from Senate priorities creates a disparity. We are very \n     concerned at this disregard for equal consideration and lack \n     of discussion of Senate priorities and prerogatives.\n       Retirement security is a cornerstone of the HELP \n     Committee's jurisdiction, and we recognize that immediate \n     technical corrections are needed to the PPA. Bicameral, \n     staff-level meetings are taking place regularly, and we are \n     working with the Administration to ensure that the needed \n     corrections are promptly addressed. The HELP Committee has a \n     history of finding common ground on complex legislative \n     challenges, and we are confident that we will reach consensus \n     on a package soon. We urge you to provide us with the \n     opportunity to bring a finished pension technical package to \n     the floor in a timely fashion in order to give our colleagues \n     the chance to have their priorities considered.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M.

Thad Cochran,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran: I am writing \n     to express my continued opposition to the consideration of \n     any provision concerning intergovernmental transfers/cost \n     based reimbursement by the Committee on Appropriations for \n     the supplemental appropriation bill we will be voting on \n     shortly. I am also opposed to the inclusion of tax provisions \n     that passed separately through the Senate as part of the \n     supplemental appropriations. As you know, the Medicaid matter \n     pertains to programs under the Social Security Act and the \n     tax provisions amend the Internal Revenue Code. Both the \n     Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code fall \n     clearly and solely within the jurisdiction of the Committee \n     on Finance.\n       Throughout the years, the Committee on Finance has worked \n     to safeguard and improve the programs under its jurisdiction, \n     including the Medicaid program. The Finance Committee has \n     unique expertise with these programs and is the only \n     Committee in the position to assess the possible effects of \n     individual changes on all Social Security Act programs as a \n     whole. Any requests for additional changes to these programs \n     must be examined with great care, and the Committee on \n     Finance is the only Committee with experience necessary for \n     this task. Accordingly, the Committee will legislate to \n     modify these programs only after thorough analysis of the \n     issues involved and potential solutions.\n       The proposed intergovernmental transfers/cost based \n     reimbursement provision in question is case in point of why \n     it should not be considered in an appropriations bill. This \n     provision would halt the implementation of a Department of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) regulation on cost based \n     reimbursement. The regulation addresses the questionable \n     practice of states recycling Medicaid funds paid to \n     providers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has \n     opined numerous times about the inappropriateness of the \n     practice and the Finance Committee has worked to expose it as \n     well. Restricting payments to cost and requiring claims \n     documentation both are in the best interest of the integrity \n     of the Medicaid program, and forbidding HHS from acting in \n     these areas is extraordinarily short-sighted. In fact, the \n     Administration believes the new rule will save $5 billion \n     over the next five years. Clearly, halting implementation \n     will have an impact on Medicaid resources and, therefore,\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\n     decisions that have such an impact are more appropriate for \n     the Finance Committee.\n       Certainly, a one-year moratorium is an improvement over the \n     two-year moratorium that was in the bill that was originally \n     passed by the Senate, but the language in the bill still \n     encourages states to push the envelope on payment schemes. If \n     a state submits a proposed waiver or state plan amendment \n     that is in contravention with the regulation, the agency will \n     not have the authority to deny the proposal. This is a \n     provision written for the benefit of special interests so \n     they can avoid real scrutiny of their financing arrangements. \n     This provision will encourage states to offer payment schemes \n     that CMS has previously disallowed as being inappropriate. It \n     will encourage litigation if CMS tries to assert that they do \n     still maintain jurisdiction.\n       The inspector general has investigated and reported to \n     Congress on why there are problems in the areas the rule \n     addresses. The Finance Committee has not had the first \n     hearing on why the rule doesn't work and must be stopped.\n       The way that this provision is paid for is equally \n     problematic. The extension of the Wisconsin pharmacy plus \n     waiver is an unnecessary earmark. Every state but Wisconsin \n     has changed their pharmacy assistance program as the MMA \n     required. Furthermore, the way the language is written sets a \n     very bad precedent. The language is written in a way that \n     alters Medicaid's budget neutrality test. It's written to \n     guarantee that it appears to save money. The reality is that \n     Wisconsin will be providing many poor seniors with less of a \n     benefit than they could get through Part D. Wisconsin charges \n     greater cost-sharing than Medicare for low income seniors.\n       Legislating to prevent CMS from cleaning up \n     intergovernmental transfers scams on this appropriation bill \n     sets a bad precedent. That is clear. It is legislation on \n     Medicaid and that is a basic part of the jurisdiction of the \n     Finance Committee.\n       I am also concerned that the supplemental appropriation \n     includes tax provisions which also fall solely in the \n     jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. The power of the \n     purse, appropriations, is Congress' power and we are directly \n     accountable to our constituents for our spending actions. In \n     that vein, I deeply respect the deep traditions of the \n     Appropriations Committee. As a former Chairman, and now, \n     Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, I deeply respect \n     that division of power. The power to tax is our power and we \n     are directly accountable to our constituents for our taxing \n     actions.\n       We should rarely mix the jurisdiction of the two great \n     money committees. It should only occur, if at all, when the \n     four senior members of the tax writing and appropriations \n     committees agree. Mixing tax writing and appropriations \n     jurisdiction should not occur at the whim of leadership. \n     Those kinds of actions demean the committees. Fortunately, I \n     insisted and the leadership respected this division of \n     jurisdiction between the tax writers and appropriators over \n     the last six years.\n       Earlier this year, the Senate acted on the minimum wage \n     bill/small business tax relief bill after the House had \n     passed its own version of the bill. We worked with our House \n     counterparts to resolve differences between the two bills. \n     However, because of a bicameral Democratic Leadership \n     obsession with a top-line number on the tax side, the \n     conference options were severely limited. Chairman Baucus was \n     able to accommodate far less than half the tax policy the \n     Senate sent to conference. The Senate's authority was limited \n     by the Leadership decision to attach the bill to the \n     supplemental appropriations bill where Chairman Baucus was \n     not a conferee. Legitimate tax policy proposals on the \n     revenue losing and revenue raising sides were left on the \n     conference's cutting room floor.\n       The composition of the final package is heavily weighted \n     towards an extension and modification of the work opportunity \n     tax credit. I support that credit. But the benefits of that \n     policy are delayed. Small businesses need the tax relief to \n     be in synch with the time the minimum wage kicks in.\n       Both of these outcomes do not reflect a proportionate \n     agreement between the House and Senate bills. The arbitrary \n     ceiling on the amount of tax relief was not a fair balance.\n       I appreciate your Committee members' interest in the Social \n     Security Act programs and the Internal Revenue Code. I ask \n     that they work with the Committee on Finance to see that \n     their objectives are examined and addressed at the \n     appropriate time, in the appropriate setting. Thanks for your \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The bottom line is, the Republicans now know that the \nconference process and the committee process will not be respected. We \nare doing things of a substantive nature. We are doing things for which \nthere is a process to make sure that the term ``technical'' is abided \nby. That process that worked so perfectly is ignored. So if the \ncommittee process will not be respected, we have to do things to make \nsure that it is. In the future, we will need to protect the committee \nand the conference process, and we will need to do some preconferencing \nagreements as we ought to have learned from now what is the majority, \nthe Democrats, when they were in the minority, that they got \nRepublicans to agree to. It seems to me that is legitimate. It may not \nbe exactly the way it ought to work, but it is something we have to do \nto make sure these things don't happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, history has proven it was a mistake to give \nthis President the power to go to Iraq, and I believe history will \nprove it is a mistake to give him the open-ended power that this \nsupplemental bill leaves in his hands. This war is not what this \nPresident says it is. I believe we have an obligation not to vote for \nthe continuation of a policy that empowers the President to simply \ncontinue the war at his discretion. I have listened to some of my \ncolleagues and others who have suggested that this bill will somehow \nchange the course. I have to respectfully disagree. This bill does not \nprovide a strategy worthy of our soldiers' sacrifice. Instead it \npermits more of the same, a strategy that relies on sending American \ntroops into the alleys and back roads of Iraq to referee a deadly civil \nwar.\n  Instead of the same misguided strategy, I believe we had an \nopportunity. While I understand the votes and I understand the threat \nof veto, and I am not new to this process, I still believe we had an \nopportunity to elicit a legitimate, fundamental change and some \ncommitments from this administration with respect to the way in which \nwe would hold Iraqis accountable and the way in which this \nadministration itself would be held accountable.\n  I say with all due respect, that is what the American people voted \nfor in November 2006. That is what they have a right to expect from \nthis Congress. The fact is, we could show our support for our troops in \nmany different ways in this legislation. I don't believe the only way \nto show that support is by letting the President have full discretion \nto continue to do what the President has been doing for these last \nyears. I believe the way you do it is by requiring--and setting up real \nmeasurements with real consequences--the Iraqis to stand up for Iraq. I \nam convinced, because the last years have proven it, the President is \nwrong to keep suggesting we will stand down when they stand up. I \nbelieve they will not stand up until we stand down. That is the \nreality.\n  The fact is, the benchmarks in this supplemental are not meaningful \nbenchmarks. The President has a complete waiver. All we require is a \nreport, a certification from the President. Is there anybody here, \nbased on the statements the President has made for the last 5 years, \nwho doesn't know exactly what the President is going to say with \nrespect to progress? All we require is that there be some measurement \nof ``progress.''\n  Let me say very clearly, because I have been there before in this \nargument, I know what happens when you vote in a way that people can \neasily try to pick up and construe as a vote other than what it is. \nThere is good in this supplemental. Yes, we need money for readiness \nfor troops, and every single one of us wants our troops to be as ready \nas they can be. Yes, it is good that there is money for care for \nveterans, and our veterans deserve the best care in the world. In fact, \nthe money available in this bill is a far cry from the real needs of \nour veterans with respect to mental health, outreach centers, the \nveterans centers, the VA, care in the hospitals. That could be a great \ndeal stronger. But we are for that. We are also for the money for \nKatrina. So let me make it clear to anybody who wants to try to distort \nthis vote: I am in favor of the money for readiness. I am in favor of \ngiving our troops all the care they need and deserve. I am in favor of \nmoney for support for Katrina.\n  But the fundamental gravamen of this bill, the heart of this bill, is \nthe strategy with respect to the war in Iraq. The heart of this bill \nare the consequences that we invite as a result of our votes.\n  In the last week or two, I have been to three funerals, one funeral, \nthe son of a man who was opposed to the war, a military man, a West \nPointer, a man\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\nwho gave his career, but he is opposed to this war. He dared to use the \nword to me in a conversation on the very day that his son was being \nburied about how it was important for us to redouble our efforts in the \nSenate to bring this to a close, how it was important for us not to \nallow these young men and women to have their lives ``wasted,'' a word \nthat if any politician used, we would be pilloried for. But the father \nof a man who was being buried used that word on the very day his son \nwas being buried. Another funeral I attended with a father who was \novercome from emotion speaking from the pulpit, left the pulpit, came \ndown, stood beside his son's coffin and said: I have to talk beside my \nson. He put his hand on the coffin and talked to us about his son's \npride, his son's patriotism, his son's love of his fellow soldiers, his \nson's and his commitment to what he was doing personally but, \nobviously, the agony they feel over a war that so many people don't \nsupport.\n  We have a responsibility with respect to those young men and women, \nwith respect to those families. I believe that responsibility is not \nmet when you give the President the very same power to continue on a \ndaily basis what he has been doing for these last years. There isn't \none person in this body who doesn't know what this President is going \nto say with respect to progress. How many times have we heard, in the \nmidst of this war, Vice President Cheney come out: We are making \nprogress. The President yesterday talked about progress, even as he \nmischaracterizes what this war is about, talking principally about al-\nQaida, when all of us know this war is principally a civil war, a \nslaughter now between Shia and Sunni over the political spoils of Iraq. \nOur presence is empowering that.\n\n  A few days ago, we set a new strategy, forcing Iraqis to do what only \nIraqis can do. We gave the President the full discretion to leave the \ntroops necessary to complete the training of Iraqi security forces, to \nchase al-Qaida and protect U.S. forces and facilities. In the sixth \nyear of this war, which we will reach by next year, it seems to me fair \nthat we should expect that Iraqis can assume that responsibility. The \nIraqi Government has said they can. The Iraqi Parliament has said they \ndon't want us there. Our own CIA tells us our presence is creating more \nterrorists, that we are creating a bigger target. We have become a \nrecruitment tool for fundraising by al-Qaida out of Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. We now know that al-Qaida is using our presence in Iraq to \nraise money and recruit jihadists around the world. This policy is \ncounter to the best security interests of our Nation.\n  This vote is a vote about those best security interests. We demanded \na little while ago a strategy of real benchmarks. There is not in this \nsupplemental one benchmark that can be enforced, not one. I don't \ndisagree with the benchmarks themselves. Yes, we want an oil deal. But \nI listened to Secretary of State Rice in front of our committee months \nago say: The oil deal is just about to be approved, right around the \ncorner.\n  It hasn't even been put to the Parliament. It is not approved months \nlater and too many lives lost later because of the procrastination of \nIraqi politicians. How do you say to an American family that their son \nor daughter ought to give up their life so Iraqi politicians can spin \naround and play a game between each other at our expense?\n  It is unconscionable. It is bad strategy. It is bad policy. It defies \ncommon sense. That is what this vote is about: why and when we, as a \nCongress, are going to insist--now, I understand they do not want the \ndeadline, and the President insists he is not going to have the \ndeadline, notwithstanding--notwithstanding--we gave the President full \ndiscretion to leave troops there to complete the training, to leave \ntroops to chase al-Qaida, to leave troops there to protect American \nfacilities and forces.\n  Those kids we are burying deserve an honest debate, not a debate \nwhere people come to the floor and say: Oh, these are the cut-and-run \nfolks. These are the folks who are looking for defeat. It is an insult \nto any Member of the Senate to suggest somebody is actively looking for \ndefeat. We have a different way of finding success. As Thomas Jefferson \nsaid: Dissent is the highest form of patriotism. Even the patriotism of \npeople who offer a different road has been questioned. Well, not any \nlonger, and I have no fear about casting this vote against this because \nthis is the wrong policy for Iraq. This continues the open-ended lack \nof accountability. This allows the President to certify whatever the \nPresident wants, to waive whatever the President wants.\n  I promise my colleagues, we will be back here in September having the \nsame debate with the same benchmark questions, and they will not have \nmoved in their accountability. Even the strategy is still changing.\n  Let me ask my colleagues something: When can you remember in American \nhistory hearing about a President of the United States casting about to \nfind a general to act as the czar for a war, where four four-star \ngenerals said no to the President?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. General Sheehan, a career military man--these are people \nwhose lives are committed to defending our Nation, whose lives are \ncommitted to the troops, who, when a President would call them, you \nwould think would be so honored and so unbelievably challenged by the \nmoment, they would say: Of course, Mr. President, I will do what I need \nto do for my country. But four of them said no. And one of them was \nquoted, in saying no: Why would I do that because they don't know where \nthe hell they're going. And as he said it, he said: I would go over \nthere for a year, I would get an ulcer, I would come back, and it would \nbe the same thing.\n  We have an obligation to vote for a change. That is why I will cast \nmy vote ``no'' on this supplemental--yes for the money for troops; yes \nfor care; yes for readiness; yes for all the things we need to do; but, \nmost importantly, a ``yes'' that we are not able to cast for a change \nin the entire dynamic with the Iraqis themselves and the accountability \nwe will hold this administration to, the accountability we hold the \nIraqis to, and, ultimately, a strategy for real success, not just in \nIraq but in the Middle East, where we have made Hamas more powerful, \nIran more powerful, Nasrallah and Hezbollah more powerful, and our \ninterests are being set back.\n  It is time for us to get the policy right. That is how you support \nthe troops.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in March and April I voted for an \nemergency spending bill that would have fully funded our troops in Iraq \nbut would have changed their mission--would have changed their \nmission--to a sound mission. That mission would have taken our troops \nout of the middle of a civil war and put them into a support role, as \nthe Iraq Study Group suggested, training Iraqi soldiers and police. We \nwould have allowed them to fight al-Qaida and protect our troops.\n  The President did not agree to that, and he will not agree to that. \nAs a matter of fact, the President will not agree to any change in \nstrategy in Iraq. That is more than a shame. For the American people, \nit is a tragedy.\n  It does not seem to matter how many Americans die in Iraq, how many \nfunerals we have here at home, or what the American people think. This \nPresident will not budge. This new bill on Iraq keeps the status quo. \nOh, it has a few frills around the outside, a few reports, a few words \nabout benchmarks--while our troops die and our troops get blown up.\n  Now, I understand why this legislation is before us today. It is \nbecause this President wants to continue his one-man show in Iraq. That \nis the only thing he will sign. The President does not respect the \nCongress. What is worse, he does not respect the American people when \nit comes to Iraq. He wants to brush us all off like some annoying spot \non his jacket. Well, that is wrong, and we won't be brushed off.\n  We have lost 3,427 American soldiers in Iraq. Of those, 731--or 21 \npercent--have been from my State of California or based in my State of \nCalifornia. Mr. President, 25,549 American soldiers have been wounded.\n\n  If you come to my office, on big boards, I have the names of the \nCalifornia dead and they are now blocking\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\nthe doorway, there are so many names, and we have to send the charts \nback for smaller and smaller print.\n  Today, after several days of worrying and praying, we received the \ntragic news of the death of PVT Joseph Anzack, Jr., 20 years old, of \nTorrance, CA, who was abducted during a deadly ambush south of Baghdad \nalmost 2 weeks ago. One member of his platoon, SPC Daniel Seitz, summed \nit up this way to the Associated Press:\n\n       It just angers me that it's just another friend I've got to \n     lose and deal with, because I've already lost 13 friends \n     since I've been here, and I don't know if I can take any more \n     of this.\n\n  He should not have to. But with this bill, he will.\n  The first half of this year has already been deadlier than any 6-\nmonth period since the war began more than 4 long years ago. In this \nmonth alone, 83 U.S. servicemembers have already been killed in Iraq.\n  Let me be clear: There are many things in this bill I strongly \nsupport--many provisions I worked side by side with my colleagues to \nfight for, for our troops, for our veterans, for their mental health, \nfor our farmers, for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, who so deserve \nour attention--but I must take a stand against this Iraq war and, \ntherefore, I will vote ``no'' on this emergency spending bill.\n  Mr. President, we are not going away. You cannot brush us off like \nsome spot on your jacket because we are going to be back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern and deep regret \nover the conference report to H.R. 2206, the U.S. Troop Readiness, \nVeterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Appropriations Act of 2007.\n  I am extremely disappointed our troops have to continue to pay the \nprice for our political posturing on this legislation and the inclusion \nof funding for pet programs in a must-pass military funding bill.\n  I want to make very clear my strong support for the members of our \nArmed Forces and the vital work they are doing around the world every \nday. I have the greatest admiration for all of them, for their \ncommitment to preserving our freedoms and maintaining our national \nsecurity. They are all true heroes, and they are the ones who are doing \nthe heavy lifting and making the great sacrifices in our country's name \nso we might continue to be the land of the free and the home of the \nbrave.\n  We are faced with a vote on a bill that our troops need, but the \ntroops are not the focus of this legislation. This supplemental is yet \nanother example of a Congress whose fiscal house is not in order. It \ncontains more than $17 billion in unrequested items--$17 billion in \nfunding that has nothing to do with the war on terror.\n  The intent of this legislation is to fund our troops and to provide \nthem with the resources they need to win the war on terror. Emergency \nsupplementals are not intended to be a Christmas tree that includes \npresents in the form of every Member's favorite pet programs. \nUnfortunately, the bill we will be voting on is just that.\n  This legislation includes funding for a number of programs I would \nsupport on their own merits. It includes agricultural disaster \nassistance for our Nation's ranchers who have suffered through years of \ndrought. Many of those are in Wyoming. It includes funding for the \nSecure Rural Schools program. These are both important priorities for \npeople in Wyoming, and although I support the programs on their merits, \nI do not support their inclusion in this emergency war supplemental.\n  This legislation is not intended to deal with drought relief. It is \nnot intended to deal with SCHIP. It is not intended to deal with \nwildland fire management. It is intended to fund our troops. Instead of \nattaching these unrelated programs to a must-pass troop funding bill, a \nfiscally responsible Congress would examine each of these programs on \ntheir own merits through our regular appropriations process--or else we \nought to call ourselves irresponsible.\n  The American people have made clear that we need to be fiscally \nresponsible. They have made clear they do not support spending billions \nof taxpayers' dollars with little or no debate. Unfortunately, if this \nlegislation passes, that is exactly what we are going to do.\n  The war supplemental also touches on various issues before the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, including minimum \nwage and pensions. Unfortunately, our committee was not consulted on \nthis language nor made any part of the discussions on this \nsupplemental.\n  The supplemental contains a provision that will boost the Federal \nminimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. I have always believed any \nincrease in the minimum wage must be accompanied by appropriate relief \nfor those small business employers who have to absorb those costs. It \nis a mandate. Small businesses are the proven engine for our economy, \nand they are the greatest source of employment opportunity for U.S. \nworkers. A raise in the minimum wage is of no value to a worker without \na job or a job seeker without prospects.\n\n  It was for these very reasons the minimum wage package which passed \nthe Senate, with overwhelming bipartisan support--overwhelming \nbipartisan support; I think there were two votes in opposition--\ncontained a series of provisions designed to provide relief for small \nbusinesses. That is how we got it. That was bipartisan.\n  The Senate-passed versions of the minimum wage legislation contained \nsignificant tax relief that was targeted to small businesses and \nindustries most likely to employ minimum wage workers. Unfortunately, \nmuch of this tax relief has been stripped from the current version of \nthe supplemental. While some tax relief remains, the lion's share of \nthat relief is contained in the Work Opportunity Tax Credit provisions, \nwhich, as a practical matter, are not utilized by small businesses.\n  While the bill does continue to contain important regulatory relief \nprovisions, such as compliance assistance for small businesses, and a \nsmall business childcare grant authorization, the tax relief this body \noverwhelmingly determined was necessary to help small businesses offset \nthe cost of a new Federal minimum wage is no longer contained in the \nlegislative package, nor were any of us consulted. I cannot support \nlegislation that dramatically raises the Federal minimum wage and fails \nto acknowledge and adequately offset the impact of such an increase on \nour small businesses.\n  With respect to pensions, last year the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions worked with other committees in landmark \nlegislation to author the most extensive overhaul of pension funding \nrules in a generation. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed \ninto law in August 2006, following extensive--extensive--bipartisan, \nbicameral negotiations. Conferees were intent on ensuring that \nretirement plans are properly funded and that Americans' retirement \nsavings would be there when they need it.\n  One of the fundamental reasons for pension funding reform was to \nensure--to ensure--the solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation and its ability to guarantee benefits in plans that are \nunderfunded. I am very concerned that there are provisions in the war \nsupplemental that the House leadership claims are technical corrections \nto the Pension Protection Act. Any changes to the Pension Protection \nAct must be considered by the committees that have jurisdiction, the \nones that know about all the intricacies and interrelationships of the \nparts that are in there, instead of legislating on an appropriations \nbill.\n\n  Chairman Kennedy and I sent a letter to Senate leadership on Tuesday \nnight citing our concerns with the House approach. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a copy of that letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Health Education, Labor, and \n           Pensions,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders: Last year, we worked with other committees to \n     author the most extensive overhaul of pension funding rules \n     in a generation. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was \n     signed into law in August 2006, following extensive \n     bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. Conferees were intent\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\n     on ensuring that retirement plans are properly funded, and \n     that Americans' retirement savings will be there when they \n     need it. This law passed the Senate with overwhelming \n     support, 93-5.\n       We understand that a number of pension provisions \n     originating in the House may be included in the emergency war \n     spending bill. While moving forward on pensions technical \n     corrections is a goal that many members share, moving House \n     pension technical corrections separately on this spending \n     bill from Senate priorities creates a disparity. We are very \n     concerned at this disregard for equal consideration and lack \n     of discussion of Senate priorities and prerogatives.\n       Retirement security is a cornerstone of the HELP \n     Committee's jurisdiction, and we recognize that immediate \n     technical corrections are needed to the PPA. Bicameral, \n     staff-level meetings are taking place regularly, and we are \n     working with the Administration to ensure that the needed \n     corrections are promptly addressed. The HELP Committee has a \n     history of finding common ground on complex legislative \n     challenges, and we are confident that we will reach consensus \n     on a package soon. We urge you to provide us with the \n     opportunity to bring a finished pension technical package to \n     the floor in a timely fashion in order to give our colleagues \n     the chance to have their priorities considered.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       Chairman.\n     Michael B. Enzi,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Retirement security is a cornerstone of the HELP \nCommittee's jurisdiction. I recognize that technical corrections are \nneeded to the over 900 pages of the Pension Protection Act. Bicameral, \nstaff-level meetings are taking place at this very time, and we are \nworking with the administration to assure that the needed corrections \nare promptly addressed. With the huge bipartisan, bicameral support \nthat had before, there should be no difficulty with that, and people \nhave been working on it since the very time that we passed it. House \nleadership, by cherry-picking certain technical corrections intended \nfor certain special interest groups, is not the way to legislate, and I \nwould contend that they are not technical corrections.\n  Chairman Kennedy and I, together with Chairman Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, have worked extremely well on making sure that everyone has a \nvoice at the table and that the process is transparent.\n  Generally, these provisions undo, in a piecemeal fashion, what was \naccomplished in the Pension Protection Act as far as strengthening \nfunding requirements. It permits some plans to choose to have reduced \nfunding obligations and reduced pension benefit guarantee premiums. In \nfact, it means that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation must \nrefund some premiums to some employers.\n  Again, I want to provide our troops with the funding and the \nresources they need to be successful in all their tasks. Unfortunately, \nthis conference does not make our troops the priority of congressional \nbusiness. The men and women of our armed services deserve better than \nthis spending bill. The people of the United States deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to support the \nsupplemental appropriations bill we will be considering shortly.\n  Let me be very clear. I strongly disagree with the President on our \ncourse in Iraq. I was one of only 23 Members of the Senate to vote \nagainst going to the war in Iraq, and I am committed to changing the \ncourse, redeploying our troops, and refocusing our efforts on fighting \nthe global war on terror. I have voted time and again for resolutions \nand amendments to change direction. I believe the President is wrong to \ncontinue on with an open-ended commitment to an Iraqi government that \nhas repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and take responsibility for its \nown country. I believe the President is wrong to continue to ignore the \nwarnings of generals, experts, and the will of the American people.\n  But I also believe the President is wrong when, in his stubborn \nrefusal to change, he also withholds money for our troops whom he has \nsent into harm's way. The President did just that on May 1 when he \nvetoed a congressionally approved supplemental that provided $4 billion \nmore than he asked for for our troops. When the President vetoed that \nbill, he was the one who denied our troops the resources, equipment, \nand funding they need to do their jobs safely. The President was wrong, \nbut he hasn't changed his mind. He and the majority of Republicans in \nCongress are blocking funding for our troops.\n  As we head into this Memorial Day, I will vote for this supplemental \nbecause the President has blocked this funding for too long, and I will \nvote for this supplemental because Democrats in Congress have changed \nour course. With this bill, we have taken a responsible path forward, \nin spite of the President, on many of our Nation's most pressing \nissues.\n  This bill, for the first time, funds the needs of our veterans and \nwounded warriors who have sacrificed for all of us and whose needs the \nPresident has refused to acknowledge as the cost of war. This bill \nmakes our homeland more secure by investing critical funds in our ports \nand our borders, and this bill aids the recovery of hard-hit \ncommunities across the country and in the gulf coast where families \nhave continued to suffer due to neglect from this administration. In \njust 5 short months, Democrats have provided a new commitment to the \nAmerican people, a new direction in Iraq, and we are going to continue \non this new path to change.\n  From the start of the war in Iraq, the Republican Congress allowed \nPresident Bush a free hand. They held few oversight hearings. They \ndemanded no accountability. There were no wide-ranging investigations \ninto this administration's endless mistakes. Year after year, they sent \nthe President blank checks in the form of emergency supplementals. Now, \n5 years into this war, after 5 years without accountability, 3,400 of \nour heroes have died, and over 25,000 have been injured. Our troops are \nnow policing a civil war in Iraq. Billions of taxpayer dollars are \nunaccounted for. The reconstruction of Iraq is far from complete, and \nour veterans are facing awful conditions when they return home.\n  In November, voters asked for an end to this. They voted for us to \nstand up, ask difficult questions, and hold those who make mistakes \naccountable for them. Democrats heard that call.\n  Immediately after being sworn in, we began to hold hearings. We heard \nfrom military and foreign affairs experts and called administration \nofficials to testify--under oath. We began conducting investigations \ninto prewar intelligence, the waste of taxpayer dollars, and the \ntreatment of our veterans. Democrats began holding vote after vote on \nIraq. We forced Republicans to make clear to Americans where they stood \non the war: Are they for escalation or redeployment? Are they for \nallowing Iraqis to continue to shirk their responsibility or for \nforcing them to stand up?\n  In January, President Bush ignored calls from Congress to follow the \nIraq Study Group recommendations. Instead, he escalated our troops in \nIraq. Congressional Republicans refused to criticize the escalation and \nstood by the President and attacked anyone who spoke out against that \nsurge.\n  But congressional Democrats stood strong. We upheld our \nconstitutional duties and what Americans put us in office for--\nconducting oversight and holding the administration accountable for its \nactions. This trend continued for months, and eventually, though \nslowly, some of my Republican colleagues began separating from the \nPresident and siding with us and the American people. After months of \nthis, Democrats overcame Republican opposition and passed a bill with \nredeployment provisions. We sent that bill, based on the advice from \nthe Iraq Study Group and military leaders and supported by 64 percent \nof Americans, to the President. We hoped he would read that bill. We \nhoped he would realize it was the best way forward in Iraq. But he \ndidn't, and he vetoed it.\n  Now, finally, after months of blindly following the President, more \nand more of our colleagues on the other side are beginning to stand up \nto the President, demanding benchmarks and a timeline for change in \nIraq.\n  It is clear that despite a slim majority in the House and only a one-\nvote margin in the Senate, Democratic efforts are working. Today is \nfurther evidence of that.\n  The bill we pass tonight will not be perfect. It doesn't go nearly as \nfar as many of us would like. We, along with the American people, have \nmade it clear what we want--a new direction that forces Iraqis to take \ncontrol of their own country. Unfortunately, the President has said he \nwould veto that bill.\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\n  So today we have a bill that takes a step forward with our changing \ncourse in Iraq. It forces the White House to acknowledge the will of \nthe American people and the role of Congress, it pressures Iraqis to \nstand up, and, importantly, it funds our troops. The hard truth, of \ncourse, is that not enough Democrats are here to override a veto. We \nrealize that another veto will not serve our troops well. They need our \nfunds; they don't need another White House delay. So we are moving \nahead.\n  I will say it again: This bill is not all I hoped for, but this war \nis not going to be brought to a close in 1 day. It is not going to be \nbrought to a close with one bill. We will support our troops, and we \nwill bring an end to the war in Iraq. We will continue to debate and \nforce votes on this war week after week after week. Americans will \ncontinue to hear where the Republicans stand on this war.\n  We face terror threats around the world. We must, and we will, defeat \nthem. Unfortunately, the Iraqi civil war is not making us more secure. \nWe do need to refocus our fight back on the war on terror, and we do \nneed to rebuild our military. I support a new direction in Iraq so that \nwe can focus on the larger security challenges our country faces, and \nthey are high. But I know we can improve security at home, that we can \ntrack down and eliminate terrorists around the world, and that we can \ntake care of our servicemembers. It is a matter of getting our \npriorities straight. Redeploying our troops from Iraq is an important \nfirst step toward getting those priorities straight. It is a step the \nSenate must take, just as passing this bill tonight is one.\n  This bill, however, is about much more than just Iraq; it is about \ntaking care of the best military in the world, both when they are \ndeployed and when they return home. It is about rebuilding here in \nAmerica, on the gulf coast and on family farms from coast to coast, and \nit is about providing hard-working Americans struggling to care for \ntheir families with a desperately needed raise.\n  I am not satisfied with the Iraq language in this bill. I disagree \nwith Senator Warner's language. I voted against it last week. But I am \nproud of what we were able to accomplish in this bill--in particular, \ntaking care of the troops, which this bill does. It includes billions \nmore than the President requested to train and equip and take care of \nour fighting men and women and to make sure we care for them when they \ncome home.\n  So tonight, when we vote, I will cast my vote as a yes--not for the \nWarner language, not for the language on Iraq, but to make sure that \nthose men and women whom we have sent to battle, despite how I feel, \nhave the care and support they need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of the \nsupplemental.\n  I opposed the authorization to go to war in Iraq because I thought it \nwould be a tragic error, and it has proved to be. Iraq did not attack \nthis country; al-Qaida did. Sometimes I think that is somehow lost in \nthis discussion. It was al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden, not Iraq, led \nby Saddam Hussein, who masterminded the attacks of September 11. That \nis a fact. That is a reality. I think it was one of the great mistakes \nin American history that we launched an attack on Iraq before ever \nfinishing business with al-Qaida.\n  Now we face a difficult choice. We have 160,000 troops in the field, \nand I believe we must fund those troops until there is a responsible \nplan to redeploy them. Unfortunately, this President has absolutely \nrefused to construct such a plan. I believe that leaves us with little \nchoice but to fund the troops in this resolution before us tonight.\n  We also have in this package a matter of great interest to the people \nwhom I represent, so I would like to speak for just a moment on a \nseparate subject; that is, the disaster relief which is contained in \nthis legislation.\n  I introduced a comprehensive disaster plan 3 years ago. The Senate \nhas supported it, most recently in a vote of 74 to 23 on the Senate \nfloor. The House supported it 2 weeks ago in a vote of over 302 Members \nin support. Today, it received 348 votes. Now we have an assurance we \ndid not have before--that the disaster package will be signed by \nPresident Bush. This has been a long, hard fight, but it is critically \nimportant to the people whom I represent.\n  These have been the headlines all across my State:\n\n       Crops Lost To Flooding.\n       Beet Crop Smallest in 10 Years.\n       Heavy Rain Leads to Crop Diseases.\n       Rain Halts Harvest.\n       Area Farmers Battle Flooding and Disease.\n\n  This is the picture which we saw in my State 2 years ago. I flew over \nsoutheastern North Dakota, and it looked like a giant lake. Over a \nmillion acres were prevented from even being planted. Another million \nacres had tremendous losses in production.\n  Then, irony of ironies, last year we had one of the worst droughts in \nour Nation's history--by scientific measurement, the third worst \ndrought in American history--and the Dakotas were the epicenter of that \ndrought.\n  Mr. President, it got very little attention. It wasn't like \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, which were disasters that were immediately \nevident, and which received enormous national media attention. This was \na slow-developing tragedy but a tragedy nonetheless. The Dakotas were \nright at the heart of it--North Dakota and South Dakota. It was rated \nas an exceptional drought--not extreme or severe or moderate, which are \nthe other measurements, but an exceptional drought. Exceptional it was.\n  Here is the map of the U.S. Drought Monitor. They concluded it was \nthe third worst drought in our Nation's history, right down the center \nof our country.\n  As you can see in this picture taken near my home in Burleigh County, \nND, the corn is supposed to be knee-high by July 4, but it was just \nover the edge of this man's boot. I went into a cornfield that was \nirrigated. The farmer started shucking the corn, and every other row \nwas empty. I asked him how can that be? He told me: Senator, this week \nit was 112 degrees one day. We had day after day where it was over 100 \ndegrees.\n  This led to a devastating series of losses. The bankers of my State \ncame to me and said: If there is not help, 5 to 10 percent of our \nclients are going to be out of business. That is how serious and \nconsequential this is. Without this help, thousands of farm and ranch \nfamilies will be forced off the land.\n  This legislation is funded as an emergency and doesn't require \noffsets from other programs. This is a change from the 2004 agriculture \ndisaster package. Producers will be eligible for assistance for one \nyear only. Assistance payments plus the value of crop sales and crop \ninsurance cannot exceed 95 percent of the expected crop value, so \nnobody is getting rich.\n  It doesn't allow producers to receive multiple benefits for the same \nloss. So there is no double-dipping.\n  Crop assistance eligibility requires a 35-percent loss before there \nis a dime of assistance, and the payment rate is 42 percent of the \nestablished price for insured crops.\n  Livestock producers are eligible for both a livestock compensation \nprogram to help offset forage losses and feed costs and a livestock \nindemnity program to help cover death losses.\n  I thank my colleagues in the Senate and the House who have worked \ntirelessly for the last 3 years to help deliver this assistance. It has \nbeen bipartisan in the Senate. It has been a long and hard fight, but \nit is going to be a lifeline to thousands of farm and ranch families in \nmy State. This is a bill the President should sign.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am glad this long and unfortunate \npolitical process has apparently come to an end, so we can now provide \nthe funding for our troops that has been needed for some time. The \nfailure to do so has created uncertainty and ambiguity and has, I \nbelieve, undermined our policies in Iraq in a number of different ways. \nHistorically, politics have stopped at the water's edge. That was a \ncardinal rule of American foreign policy that you might agree with or \nnot, but you would not criticize fundamental decisions made by the \nUnited States while things are ongoing in various places in the world \nand, certainly, you would not take steps and actions that would \nundermine our troops in combat someplace in the world.\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\n  Vigorous debate is absolutely a part of who we are as a Nation. A lot \nof people who have been critical of our war efforts in Iraq have made \nsuggestions that have been good. A number of their criticisms have been \ncorrect, and it is certainly welcome and a part of our heritage that we \nwould have that kind of debate. I don't mean to suggest otherwise. But \nthe delays we have been seeing now in actually providing the funding \nnecessary for our military men and women in harm's way has been too \nlong. I believe it has had a tendency to embolden our enemies and raise \nquestions in the minds of our own soldiers.\n  So as I have said a number of times on the floor of the Senate, those \nsoldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan today are there for one reason, and \nthat is because we sent them. They are doing tough, hot, demanding, \ndangerous work. I have been there six times. I have to tell you, I have \nnever been more impressed. They don't complain. They do their work with \nprofessionalism. They care about what they are doing. They believe in \nwhat they are doing. They want to succeed, and I tell you that with \nevery fiber in my being. It is their desire to help the country of Iraq \nachieve stability and progress.\n  They are executing lawful policies of the U.S. Government. That \nincludes the Congress--the House and Senate--as well as the President \nof the United States. We have, through lawful processes, deployed them \nto execute policies that we have decided on. This Congress, of course, \nhas the power to bring them home at any moment that we desire. I think \npeople are wrestling with that. Some think they should come home now. \nSome think that is not the appropriate decision. The President believes \nthat is not the appropriate decision. We have accepted and have \nfundamentally affirmed the surge that has sent additional troops there. \nThey are there to execute our mission. That is all I wish to say. They \nare there to execute our mission.\n  I talked to a mother not long ago whose son was killed in Iraq. She \ntold me her son told her he believed in what he was doing. He told me \nwhen they went into neighborhoods, the women and children were glad \nthey were there. They wanted them in the neighborhoods. That is all I \nam telling you. You can read what you want to in the newspaper. But \nbecause it brought a sense of security there, they wanted them there. I \nknow there are limits to our ability to achieve what we would like to \nachieve, no matter what we would like to achieve; I know we are not \nunlimited in our ability to achieve it. We have to be realistic, and we \ncannot commit a single soldier to an effort a single day longer than we \nconclude is an appropriate thing for them to be doing. If we think it \nis not justified and worthwhile, we need to bring them home. I \ncertainly agree with that.\n\n  This is a serious discussion we have been having, and I don't dispute \nthe people who have different views of how this ought to occur. I will \nsay again that real support of the soldiers in harm's way means we \naffirm them and their mission as long as we fund their mission, as long \nas we order them there. You may say we didn't order them there, but we \ndid order them there. We have funded them to stay there, according to \nthe President's tactical decision. But we authorized him to do so, and \nwe can end that authorization as we choose.\n  But the truth is, we have invested a tremendous amount in Iraq. \nGeneral Petraeus--what a fabulous general he is--told us the truth, I \nbelieve. The truth is it is hard, but it is not impossible. He also has \nsaid what we are doing there is important. It is important that a \nstable, decent government be maintained in Iraq. That is not a little \nthing; it is a very important thing. The soldiers who have been there--\nthe soldiers who serve--would be, indeed, in pain and be hurt if we \nprematurely give up on what they have sacrificed to achieve and what so \nmany of them truly believe in, if you talk to them.\n  I have to tell you that the surge of troops into Iraq was a bitter \npill to me. I remember distinctly when General Casey said in late 2005 \nhe believed we could start bringing home troops in 2006. That was \nabsolutely music to my ears and what I wanted to hear. Then he said he \nhad to delay the troops coming home because the sophisticated, \nsustained effort by al-Qaida to attack Shia individuals in holy places \nhad created a reaction by Shia, with the formation of a Shia militia, \nand they were killing Sunni individuals and that broke out into a spate \nof violence in Baghdad, the capital city, the central focus of Iraq, \nand that was extremely unfortunate.\n  So my thinking is this: Benchmarks for the Iraqi Government--if we \nwrite that correctly and don't do it in a way that is unwise and \ncounterproductive, as I believe this language is, at least it would be \nlanguage the President can accept, and I would be prepared to accept \nthe demand that they do certain things. That is all right with me. Our \ncommitment is not open-ended. We cannot continue to try to lift a \ngovernment that cannot function effectively. We want them to function. \nWe want them to have a healthy, prosperous government. There are some \ngood things that have happened--really and truly, there have been good \nthings. But there are very difficult things also that are not going \nwell. This is a challenge to the Iraqi Government.\n  I truly hope the benchmarks and language in this funding resolution \nwill be such that it will be a positive spur to the Iraqi Government to \nconfront their reconciliation difficulties, spur them to reach \nagreements on other constitutional questions that are critical, and be \nan effective step in helping that Government stand up and assume \nresponsibility for its own fate.\n  I have to say I am not comfortable and am indeed uneasy with high \ntroop levels sustained in what would be considered an occupation or a \nstand-in for the democratically elected Government of Iraq. That \nGovernment has to stand up and assume greater and greater \nresponsibility. I do hope and pray that they will because it is \nexceedingly important that they do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think it is important that, in response \nto the comments of my friend Senator Enzi, I set the record straight \nfor the Senate and the American people regarding the practice of \nincluding unrequested emergency funding in war supplementals.\n  The emergency supplemental bills approved by Republican Congresses in \n2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 included emergency funding for many of the \nsame issues that are in the emergency supplemental, such as: \nagriculture disaster assistance--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--\n$500 million; border security--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$1.9 \nbillion; pandemic flu--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$2.3 billion; \nwildland fire suppression--fiscal year 2005 Defense Appropriations Act, \nwhich carried $25.8 billion war supplemental--$500 million; airline \nsecurity--fiscal year 2003 war supplemental--$2.396 billion; \nand fisheries assistance--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$112 \nmillion.\n\n  The White House has complained about Democrats including agricultural \ndisaster assistance in the war supplemental. Not only did the \nRepublican Congress approve a targeted agriculture disaster package in \n2006, but there is also precedent for including assistance to a sector \nin the economy that has been hard hit by a disaster. In 2003, Congress \napproved $515 million of relief for the aviation industry.\n  The White House has also complained about Democrats including other \nmatter in a war supplemental, such as the minimum wage increase.\n  Yet under Republican control, war supplemental laws included such \nunrelated matters as the REAL ID Act, fiscal year 2005, a temporary \nworker program, fiscal year 2005, and budget process provisions, fiscal \nyear 2006.\n  So I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify for my colleagues the \nreal record when it comes to meeting the needs of the American people \nin emergency supplemental appropriation bills.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, while there are many aspects of this \nconference report that I cannot support, I am pleased that it will \nfinally allow us to get a minimum wage bill to the President's desk. \nThe minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 an hour for more than 10 \nyears, but now--finally Americans across the country will get the raise \nthey need and deserve. For the millions of working families who will \nbenefit, this increase may be long overdue, but it is nonetheless \nsomething to celebrate.\n  Mr. President, 13 million Americans will see more money in their \npaychecks\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nfor the first time in a decade. They will have a few more dollars to \nspend on the essentials of life, or maybe they will have a few more \nhours to spare to spend time with their families; 6 million children \nwill have better food, better health, and better opportunities for the \nfuture.\n  I deeply regret that this vital increase was so long in coming. The \nminimum wage bill passed the House and Senate by overwhelming margins \nin January and February of this year. Had we been able to send that \nbill to the President's desk right away, the first phase of the raise \nwould already be in effect.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would not \nlet that happen. They prevented the minimum wage bill from going to \nconference until they could make sure it included a big enough tax \ngiveaway for businesses. That is why were here talking about it today. \nWe had to put in on a bill they couldn't block to get it to the \nPresident's desk.\n  We have overcome many obstacles--and faced every procedural trick in \nthe book--to get this minimum wage increase across the finish line. \nDemocrats stood together, and stood firm, to say that no one who works \nhard for a living should have to live in poverty.\n  But we didn't do it alone. The passage of the minimum wage is not \nmerely a legislative victory--it's a victory for the American people.\n  After years of delay and inexcusable inaction by Congress, the \nAmerican people took this fight into their own hands. They started a \ngrassroots movement that spread across the Nation like wildfire. They \npounded the pavements. They prayed in their pews. They refused to take \nno for an answer. We are here today because of their efforts, and they \ndeserve the gratitude of our Nation.\n  The minimum wage is one of the great achievements of our proud \ndemocracy. It is a reflection of our values, and a cornerstone of the \nAmerican dream. It is about the kind of country we want to be.\n  Americans want to live in a country where everyone has opportunity \nand the chance to succeed. Where anyone who works hard and plays by the \nrules can build a better life for their family. Where there is no \npermanent underclass, and everyone has hope for a brighter future. When \nthe President signs a minimum wage increase into law, we will be one \nstep closer to that noble goal.\n  Certainly, the increase we have passed today is only the first of \nmany steps we must take to address the problems of poverty and \ninequality in our society. There is no doubt that we need to do much, \nmuch more. But it's important to take a moment today to celebrate this \nvictory. Raising the minimum wage will add dignity to the lives of \nmillions of working families. It is one of the proudest achievements of \nthis new Congress.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, due to a family medical emergency, I am \nreturning to Minnesota this evening and will be unable to cast my vote \nin favor of the supplemental appropriations bill. I believe the Senate \nis taking responsible action by passing critical funding for the troops \nwithout attaching it to arbitrary timelines for withdrawal. Moreover, \nthis bill contains critical agricultural disaster assistance funding \nthat I have been fighting to deliver for Minnesota's farmers for over a \nyear. Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on the \nsupplemental.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to announce that I am voting \nagainst the Iraq war supplemental. I wish I didn't have to. I wish that \nI looked at Iraq and saw a stable, united government, a society free of \nterrorists and insurgents, and liberal democracy around the corner, if \nonly we spent another billion dollars, or a hundred lives, or another \nyear of waiting. I wish that our surge had, at long last, brought quiet \nto the tortured city of Baghdad. I wish that our President's policies \nwere working.\n  I wish that I could look at Iraq and say, with a clear voice and a \nclean conscience: I share our President's confidence.\n  I wish; and even as I wish, the truth tells me otherwise. It tells me \nthat 3,415 men and women in uniform have already sacrificed everything \nin Iraq, with no end in sight. It tells me that our military is being \nhollowed out by the Iraq experience, that two-thirds of our Army in the \nUnited States and 88 percent of our National Guard are forced to \nreport: Not ready for duty, sir. It tells me that the American people \ndemand an end to this war, and that the Iraqi people--for whose sake we \ntoppled a dictator and established elections, precisely so we could \nhear their voice--demand the same.\n  I look at this bill and I don't see the truth in it. It exists in a \nworld in which the President's plans are all meeting their mark. It \ngives us a status-quo strategy that has failed and failed again. It \nwrites the President a blank check.\n  I had hoped that this supplemental would have passed with strong \ntimetables for withdrawal, a unambiguous line in the sand. A \nresponsible supplemental would have established definitive guidance for \nthe President to transition the mission of our forces away from combat \noperations. It would have defined that mission clearly as counter-\nterrorism, training of Iraqi forces, and American force protection. It \nwould have required a diplomatic and economic strategy in Iraq. And it \nwould have held both the President and the Iraqi Government \naccountable. The Feingold-Reid-Dodd bill contained just such \ntimetables, and mandated a responsible transition in mission, all \nbacked by Congress's constitutional power of the purse.\n  But I cannot, in good conscience, support the half-measure that has \ntaken its place. Instead of establishing realistic timetables, this \nsupplemental does one thing only: It delays for 4 months, until funding \nruns out again, the decision we all know is coming: ultimately, combat \ntroops will be redeployed from Iraq. This bill allows 4 more months of \nreckless endangerment of our troops and our national security.\n  A Senator shouldn't talk like that, some will say. I will be told I \nam declaring surrender right here on the Senate floor. Those are the \nwords that will come from the other side of the aisle, big, grand \nwords--surrender, triumph, defeat, victory--words that will blur and \nswirl together until they lose all mooring in reality. The President's \nsupporters want to paint us a picture of a world in which we line up on \na field of battle, the terrorists on one side and America on the other, \nand fight pitched warfare until one side waves the white flag.\n  But Iraq does not exist in that world. General Petraeus tells us that \nthere will be no military solution; so does the Iraq Study Group. \nSenator Hagel, a war hero and member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, tells us that ``there will be no victory or defeat in Iraq . \n. . Iraq belongs to the 25 million Iraqis who live there . . . Iraq is \nnot a prize to be won or lost.''\n  So I am not conceding defeat in Iraq--because there is no defeat to \nbe conceded. There is only the hope that Sunni, Shia, and Kurd will \nreconcile in government, call off their militias and death squads, and \nturn against the foreign terrorists who have helped to spark this civil \nwar. Our combat presence in Iraq cannot make that hope real. We can, \nand must, continue to assist the Iraqis in trying to reach these \ngoals--but we cannot do it with military might alone. In the end, the \nchallenges in Iraq can only be addressed through political means.\n  We are told, again and again, that we are failing to ``support the \ntroops''--support that is subject to only the vaguest of measurements: \n``messages'' and ``signals'' and ``resolve.''\n  We answer with fact. We answer with young lives lost and dollars \nsquandered. We answer with the wisdom of James Baker and Lee Hamilton. \nWe ask how any conceivable definition of ``support'' would leave our \ntroops stranded in a civil war of strangers, with no mission or end in \nsight. And we say, unequivocally, that the only way to support our \ntroops is to bring them home--now.\n  In fact, from the very outset of this war, it has been the \nPresident's defense policies that have hollowed out our Armed Forces \nand further threatened our national security. To reverse this \nnegligence, Democrats have taken concrete action for our troops, again \nand again.\n  In 2003, I offered an amendment to the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to add $322 million for critical protective gear \nidentified by the Army, which the Bush administration had failed to \ninclude in its budget.\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\nBut it was blocked by the administration and its allies.\n  In 2004 and 2005, I authored legislation, signed into law, to \nreimburse troops for equipment they had to purchase on their own, \nbecause the Rumsfeld Pentagon failed to provide them with the body \narmor and other gear they needed to stay alive.\n  And last year, working with Senators Inouye, Reed, and Stevens, I \noffered an amendment to help address a $17 billion budget shortfall to \nreplace and repair thousands of war-battered tanks, aircraft, and \nvehicles. This provision was approved unanimously and enacted in law.\n  That is support--support that can be measured, support that carries a \ncost beyond words.\n  And it is support that will continue, even if this supplemental \nfails, as it should. The Defense Department has ample funds to maintain \nour combat troops in Iraq until they can be withdrawn responsibly. The \nfailure of this bill will not turn funds off like a spigot--the \nmilitary simply does not work like that. Instead, our troops are \nsupported by the more than $150 billion in the Pentagon's regular \noperations and maintenance account--and in the meantime, we might \nnegotiate with the President for a responsible drawdown of combat \ntroops. Any implication that we are stranding our soldiers in the \ndesert--without fuel or bullets or rations--is totally specious.\n  And it follows that the President's Memorial Day deadline is totally \narbitrary. The lives of our troops are more important than the \nPresident's vacation schedule. Why should he set timelines for \nDemocrats but not for Iraqis?\n  Instead, let us vote down this bill and then join President Bush at \nthe table, with the dignity befitting an equal branch of government, \nand the authority vested in us by the American people and our \nConstitution. Let us bring this disastrous war to a responsible end. \nAnd after 4 years of failed policy, let our voice be loud and \nunmistakeable: This far, and no further.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will vote against the fiscal year 2007 \nemergency supplemental conference report. Although there are many sound \nand worthy provisions in this bill--such as assistance for Afghanistan \nand other countries, and additional funds not requested by the \nadministration to help address the backlog of equipment for the \nNational Guard--the inescapable fact is that this legislation would not \nreverse this administration's disastrous Iraq policy. I simply cannot \nvote in favor of a bill, containing tens of billions of additional \ndollars for the President's policy in Iraq, that does not begin to \nbring our troops home.\n  As one of the 23 Senators who opposed authorizing this war, I believe \nit is vital that we send a strong signal that Congress is going to \nexercise its article I constitutional powers and end our central \ninvolvement in Iraq's civil war. Every Senator--for or against this \nmilitary adventure--must take a stand on whether to continue the status \nquo or change course. That, at the end of the day, is what this vote \nrepresents.\n  Congress had a workable and I believe widely acceptable plan in the \noriginal version of this supplemental bill. Taking a page from the Iraq \nStudy Group recommendations, the plan was to end the military mission \nin Iraq as we currently know it. We would reduce American forces to the \ncontingent necessary for limited Iraqi troop training, counterterrorism \noperations, and protecting remaining American personnel.\n  I and others joined with Senator Feingold in an effort to strengthen \nthat position by ensuring that no funding could go toward deployment, \nbeyond those narrow purposes. About a month ago, we all saw the \nPresident veto the supplemental bill. Then last week, the President \nmuscled his congressional allies to vote against the stronger Feingold-\nReid-Leahy provision.\n  So what we are left with is this new version of the supplemental--the \nstatus quo, more of the same old stay the course. The reality is that \nthis new conference report does nothing to stop the President's open-\nended escalation. It will not force the Iraqis to make the difficult \npolitical compromises which they need to make. Nor will it begin a \nredeployment of American forces. The final legislation drops the \nmandatory timetable for planning and commencing redeployment with a \ntargeted completion date. Beyond some reporting requirements, there is \nno limitation on troop levels.\n  What the legislation does do is limit our aid to the Iraqi government \nif actions toward reconciliation are not taken, although the President \nmay waive these limitations.\n  I agree that we should tie our aid to the Iraqi government to clear \nbenchmarks. But that alone is not sufficient. The reality is that \ndespite spending hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq, the violence \nhas increased. We all know that the trends are going in the wrong \ndirection. This piecemeal approach assures that our troops will remain \nin the middle of harm's way for the foreseeable future.\n  And when it comes to changing the dynamic in Iraq, it is troop levels \nthat matter. The introduction of more forces through this open-ended \nescalation that the President calls the surge is sending the wrong \nsignal to the Iraqis and to countries in the region that have interests \nthere. It says they do not have to make the tough decisions because the \nAmerican forces are there to do the dirty work, to spill their blood \nand to contain sectarian militias or deal with unwelcome foreign \nfighters.\n  Rory Stewart, a perspicacious observer with hands-on experience in \nIraq, rightly pointed out in a recent public forum that our presence \nthere is fundamentally undermining Iraq's political system, \n``infantilizing'' Iraq politics, to use his phrase. He notes that Iraqi \npoliticians are far more capable of making deals and reaching \ncompromise than we think, but that our troop presence allows them to \nplay hardball with each other. ``Were we to leave,'' Mr. Stewart says, \n``they would be weaker and under more pressure to compromise.''\n  As I have said, there are many aspects of this supplemental that I \nsupport. We have, for example, included $1 billion in unrequested \nfunding to help rebuild our National Guard, which is suffering from \ndangerously low equipment stocks because so much of the Guard's \nequipment has been sent to Iraq. We have funded the Marla Ruzicka Fund \nto aid innocent Iraqi civilians who have suffered casualties, and a \nsimilar program to aid civilian victims of war in Afghanistan. There is \nother funding for refugees and humanitarian assistance in Africa and \nthe Middle East, as well as for Kosovo. I am gratified that we have \nbeen able to include funding for elections in Nepal, to support \nreintegration of former combatants in northern Uganda, and to begin the \nclean up of dioxin-contaminated sites in Vietnam and for health \nprograms in nearby communities.\n  These are just a few of the things carried over from the original, \nvetoed version of the bill that I support and for which I have worked \nhard. I thank Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the State, Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, and our counterparts in the House, Chairwoman \nLowey and Ranking Member Wolf, for working together in a bipartisan way \nto allocate the foreign assistance funding in this bill.\n  Yet there is a central fact that we must meet head on. This war has \nbeen a costly disaster for our country. Our ability to fight terrorism, \npursue our larger national security and foreign policy goals, and \nsecure the welfare of every American has been diminished because of it. \nThousands of our troops have lost their lives or suffered grievous, \nlife-altering injuries. Tens of thousands--and possibly hundreds of \nthousands--of innocent Iraqis have lost their lives. We have opened a \ngaping wound in the Middle East and severely damaged our image and our \ninfluence. This war has been a foreign policy failure of epic \nproportions.\n  It is time to bring our troops home. It is time to show the Iraqi \npeople that they cannot expect us to make these sacrifices if they \nwon't make the hard decisions that are spread before them. I regret \nthat this legislation whitewashes what was a reasonable, good faith \neffort to bring real pressure to bear in Baghdad and beyond. I cannot \nin good conscious vote for it.\n\n\n                      defense subcommittee funding\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senate is about to act on H.R. 2206, \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007, \nwhich will fully fund the needs of our men and\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\nwomen in uniform. The process that we have used to reach this point has \nbeen somewhat different from our normal course of business. As such, I \nwanted to engage my cochairman of the Defense Subcommittee, the Senator \nfor Alaska, in a colloquy on the defense portion of this bill. The bill \nbefore the Senate is not accompanied by the customary report because of \nthe way the process unfolded. However, it is also true that for matters \ninvolving the allocation of funding and direction for those matters \nunder the jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee, the bill closely \nmirrors the conference report to accompany H.R. 1591 as printed in \nHouse Report 110-107 that the Senate passed on April 26, 2007. Would my \nfriend from Alaska agree that in terms of funding, the bill is nearly \nidentical to that which the Senate previously approved?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to my friend from Hawaii that it is my \nunderstanding that the Senator is correct. I am advised that the \nfunding in this bill for Defense Subcommittee matters is identical to \nthat agreed to by the Senate on April 26, 2007, except in three areas. \nThe increase in this bill for the Defense Health program is nearly \n$1.876 billion while the previous bill would have increased the health \nprogram by $2.126 billion. In addition, this bill has reduced funding \nfor the Defense Working Capital Fund by $200 million and reduced the \ninitiative for the Strategic Reserve Readiness Fund by $385 million. \nAside from these changes the funding in this bill is exactly the same \nas previously passed.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleague for that clarification. Therefore, I \nask my friend whether he agrees that the allocation of funds that the \nCongress provided for these defense programs as described in the joint \nexplanatory statement of the committee of conference to accompany H.R. \n1591, except for those three areas that he just specified, is exactly \nthe intent of this bill that we are about to pass?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree completely with my good friend. The intent of \nthose of us who oversee the Defense Department and the drafting of this \nbill was to provide funds as specified in the joint explanatory \nstatement which accompanied H.R. 1591.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Again, I thank my colleague. If I could make another \ninquiry, the Congress also included items in House Report 110-60 and \nSenate Report 110-37 which provided guidance to the Defense Department \non several items in this bill. Would the Senator from Alaska agree with \nme that the intent of the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense was that the guidance in these \nreports should be adhered to except in those areas that were altered in \nthis bill or those areas that were addressed to the contrary in the \njoint explanatory statement to H.R. 1591?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur in the Senator's assessment. The Defense \nSubcommittee reviewed many matters before it prepared Senate Report \n110-37 regarding the supplemental appropriations request before the \nSenate. In putting together H.R. 2206, our intent was to continue the \nguidance that the Senate included in its report. In addition, we have \nconcurred in the guidance of House Report 110-60 except in those areas \nspecifically noted in the joint explanatory statement which accompanied \nH.R. 1591.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my friend. Then would you agree with me that it \nis our intent that the Defense Department should adhere to the guidance \nunder the conditions which you and I have described above?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to my friend I agree with his assertion. I share \nhis view that the Department of Defense should use the two committee \nreports and the joint explanatory statement of the committee of \nconference accompanying H.R. 1591 to discern the will of Congress in \nrespect to this bill H.R. 2206.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate the comments of my friend, the Senator from \nAlaska, and concur. It is our view and intent that the Defense \nDepartment shall adhere to the funding allocation and comply with the \nguidance in the above described reports in interpreting the will of the \nCongress with respect to H.R. 2206, except in those few areas which are \nalso described above. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his time and \ncooperation in this matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, our service men and women on the front \nlines in the war on terror have been waiting too long for the funding \nthis bill provides. Our soldiers, airmen, and marines need this \nappropriation to carry out their vital work, and we should have \nprovided it months ago. The Congress, which authorized the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, has an obligation to give our troops everything they \nneed to prevail in their missions. As such, I will vote for its \npassage. But I do so with deep reservations. The legislation we are \nconsidering now is the wrong way to fund this war, and it fails the \nmost basic tests imposed on us as stewards of taxpayer dollars.\n  This emergency supplemental appropriations bill contains $120 billion \nin funding, approximately $17 billion above the President's request. It \nis filled with billions of dollars in non-emergency spending that has \nnothing to do with funding the troops. In a time of war, with large \nfederal budget deficits, we should be constraining our Federal \nexpenditures. Sadly, we have chosen, once again, to do the opposite, \nand loaded this bill with billions of dollars in spending we don't \nneed, spending that was not requested, spending that will only add to \nthe already excessive size of government.\n  The President submitted his supplemental funding request on February \n5 nearly 4 months ago. The Senate finally passed a very flawed version \nof a bill on March 29 a bill that everyone knew was nothing more than a \npolitical stunt, one that was dead before arrival to the President. \nInstead of putting our country first and providing the troops with full \nfunding as expeditiously as possible, we let partisan politics rule the \nday. While some may believe that they scored political points by \nforcing meaningless procedural votes, I would ask them to reflect for a \nmoment. What gain inheres in playing partisan politics with the lives \nof our honorable warriors and their families? How can we possibly find \nhonor in using the fate of our servicemen to score political advantage \nin Washington? There is no pride to be had in such efforts. We are at \nwar, a hard and challenging war, and we do no service for the best of \nus--those who fight and risk all on our behalf--by playing politics \nwith their service.\n  So now, nearly 4 months after the supplemental funding request was \nsubmitted, here we are, with money literally running out to fund this \nwar. We are about to pass a bill that while better than the last \nversion, still contains billions of dollars that have nothing to do \nwith the war on terror. We can do better than this. The American \ntaxpayers deserve and expect more.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been meeting with citizens across the \ncountry, and let me assure you, they are not happy with the workings of \nCongress. There is a reason that the poll results on Congress's \nfavorability rating are at such lows the latest at 31 percent. It is \nbecause of partisan politics having a greater priority in Washington \nthan doing the people's business. It is because we are not making the \ntough choices to halt deficit spending and fix the out of control \nentitlement programs. It is because we seem to care more about our own \nreelections than about reforming government. This is not the way the \nAmerican public wants their elected officials to behave. What will it \ntake for that to sink in?\n  Let me mention some of the unrequested and unauthorized items \ncontained in this bill: $110 million in aid to the shrimp and fisheries \nindustries; $11 million for flood control projects in New York and New \nJersey; $37 million to modernize the Farm Service Agency's computer \nsystem; $13 million for the Save America's Treasures program; and, $3 \nbillion in agriculture disaster assistance, including $22 million to \nsupport the Department of Agriculture in implementing programs to \nprovide this un-requested and unauthorized funding.\n  There are also several items in this bill that seek to legislate on \nan appropriations bill rather than allowing such items to move through \nthe regular legislative process. Examples include language that: raises \nthe minimum wage; restricts the Department of Transportation from \nimplementing the North American Free Trade Agreement's, NAFTA, \nprovisions expanding cross-border trade between Mexico and the\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nUnited States with the introduction of a pilot program that would allow \na select group of Mexican trucking companies to make deliveries into \nour country beyond the 25 miles that current law permits; extends \nseveral tax credits, while setting forth new Internal Revenue Service \ndefinitions and exempting some programs from taxation; and, amends the \nFood Security Act to make adjustments to the Department of \nAgriculture's land and soil conservation program.\n  Another provision that seeks to legislate on this appropriations bill \nis a provision that would end-run the Defense Base Realignment and \nClosure, BRAC, process. The 2005 BRAC commission decided to close the \nNaval Air Station at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and the Department of \nNavy was in the process of closing the base in accordance with the law. \nThis bill, however, would transfer the land and facilities to the Air \nForce even though the Secretary of the Air Force stated on April 12, \n2007, that there is not a military need for the land it will be forced \nto receive. This provision was not requested by the administration, is \nnot an emergency, and is not a responsible way to legislate. It was not \nreviewed or debated in any committee, and the committee of jurisdiction \nhas had no say in the matter. Yet the American people will now be \nforced to continue to pay for the maintenance of this unwanted land \nwhen the Air Force receives it.\n  Despite these unacceptable earmarks and legislative language, I am \npleased that this bill does not contain a timeline for the withdrawal \nof American troops from Iraq, regardless of the conditions there. Such \na mandate would have had grave consequences for the future of Iraq and \nthe security of Americans. The President was right to veto the first \niteration of this legislation.\n  I do have concerns, however, with the way in which this measure \nconditions aid to the Iraqi Government by requiring the government to \nmeet benchmarks. Although I support benchmarks for the Iraqi \nGovernment, and I believe that we should encourage the Iraqi government \nto move ahead as rapidly as possible on a number of fronts, some of the \nbenchmarks contained in this bill are beyond the control of the Iraqi \nleadership. One of the benchmarks, for example, mandates that there \nwill be no safe haven for ``any outlaws.'' This should of course be an \naspiration, but if terrorists or insurgents hang on and hole up in \nBaghdad, should this constitute a reason why the United States \nwithholds economic aid to the government? Similarly, another benchmark \nrequires the Iraqi Government to reduce the level of sectarian \nviolence. But if sectarian violence does not decline as rapidly as we \nwould like, does this suggest that the answer is to cut off \nreconstruction aid? It's not at all clear to me that it does.\n  I believe that, instead of legislating a list of benchmarks that must \nbe met by the Iraqis, and imposing statutory penalties for \nnonperformance, it would be preferable for the administration to reach \nagreement on a series of benchmarks with the Iraqi government, a \ntimeline for implementation, and consequences attached to each. Such an \napproach would make clear to the Iraqis that they must make progress, \nbut would do so in a way that is specific, flexible, and realistic.\n  If this bill is to have benchmarks at all, it should be a benchmark \nthat Congress may not approve any earmark, no matter how valid the \ncause, without an authorization, an administration request or inclusion \nin the budget. The national debt grows $75 million an hour and $1.3 \nbillion a day. Congress should benchmark its spending sprees on zero \ndebt, but it won't. This body would rather set benchmarks for others \naround the world than take responsibility for its own actions. For \nthese reasons, this bill is flawed and irresponsible, but I will vote \nfor it nonetheless in order to support our brave men and women fighting \nfor freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the tax provisions included in this bill \nwould help small businesses to succeed. These provisions would spur \ninvestment and thus create jobs. They would provide greater opportunity \nfor workers looking for a job. They all enjoy strong support.\n  The bill helps businesses to provide jobs for workers who have \nexperienced barriers to entering the workforce by extending and \nexpanding the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, or WOTC.\n  WOTC encourages businesses to hire workers who might not otherwise \nfind work. WOTC allows employers a tax credit for wages that they pay \nto economically disadvantaged employees. WOTC has been remarkably \nsuccessful. By reducing expenditures on public assistance, WOTC is \nhighly cost-effective. The business community is highly supportive of \nthese credits. Industries like retail and restaurants that hire many \nlow-skill workers find it especially useful.\n  The bill would extend WOTC for more than 3 years, and the bill would \nincrease and expand the credit for employers who hire disabled \nveterans. The bill would also expand the credit to make it available to \nemployers who hire people in counties that have suffered significant \npopulation losses.\n  To carry out day-to-day activities, small business owners are often \nrequired to invest significant amounts of money in depreciable \nproperty, such as machinery. The bill would help business owners to \nafford these large purchases for their businesses. To do so, the bill \nwould extend for another year expensing under section 179 of the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  New equipment and property are necessary to successfully operate a \nbusiness. But large business purchases generally require depreciation \nacross a number of years, and depreciation requires additional \nbookkeeping.\n  Expensing under section 179 allows for an immediate 100-percent \ndeduction of the cost for most personal property purchased for use in a \nbusiness. The bill increases the expensing limit from $112,000 to \n$125,000, and the bill increases the phase-out threshold from $450,000 \nto $500,000 for 2007.\n  When small business owners are able to expense equipment, they no \nlonger have to keep depreciation records on that equipment. So \nextending section 179 expensing would ease small business bookkeeping \nburdens.\n  The bill includes a package of tax incentives to help recovery of \nsmall business and low-income housing in areas hit by Hurricanes \nKatrina, Rita, and Wilma. The bill also requires GAO to conduct a study \non how State and local governments have allocated and utilized the tax \nincentives that have been provided for these areas since 2005. We want \nto make sure that the tax incentives that Congress provided for \nhurricane recovery are being properly used, and we want to make sure \nthat these incentives are providing the much-needed help for which they \nwere created.\n  Tips received by restaurant employees are treated as wages for \npurposes of Social Security taxes. As such, employers must pay Social \nSecurity taxes on tips received by their employees. These employers \nreceive a business tax credit for taxes paid on tip income in excess of \nthe Federal minimum wage rate. The bill would prevent a decrease in the \namount of this business tax credit that restaurant owners may claim \ndespite an increase in the Federal minimum wage.\n  Currently, if a small business jointly owned by a married couple \nfiles taxes as a sole proprietorship, only the filing spouse receives \ncredit for paying Social Security and Medicare taxes. Furthermore, \nunless the married couple is located in a community property State, \nboth the married couple and the business are subject to penalties for \nfailing to file as a partnership.\n  The bill would allow an unincorporated business that is jointly owned \nby a married couple in a common law State to file as a sole \nproprietorship without penalty. The bill would also ensure that both \nspouses receive credit for paying Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n  Current law limits a small business' ability to claim WOTC and the \ntip credit by imposing a limitation that such credits cannot be used to \noffset taxes that would be imposed under the alternative minimum tax, \nor AMT. The bill would provide a permanent waiver for WOTC and the tip \ncredit and would allow WOTC and the tip credit to be taken under AMT.\n  The bill would help small businesses by modifying S corporation \nrules. These modifications reduce the effect of what some call the \n``sting tax.'' These modifications would improve the viability of \ncommunity banks.\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\n  The tax language included in the bill is a responsible package. It \nwould ensure the continued growth and success of small businesses.\n  And we have also paid for it.\n  The offsets include a proposal to discourage the practice of \ntransferring investments to one's child for the purpose of avoiding \nhigher tax rates.\n  The offsets also include proposals to improve tax administration.\n  The offsets would allow the IRS more time to notify the taxpayer \nabout a deficiency before it must stop charging interest and penalties. \nThe offsets include making permanent the fees that the IRS is \nauthorized to charge for private letter rulings and other forms of \nguidance.\n  The offsets also enhance penalties that the IRS may impose when \ntaxpayers and preparers do not comply with the law. The offsets would \nalso prohibit employers from using the collection due process to delay \nor prevent the IRS from collecting delinquent trust fund employment \ntaxes.\n  The hard-working American taxpayers whom we are trying to help in \nthis bill should not have to pay more in taxes because some taxpayers \nare abusing the tax system.\n  The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has made available to the \npublic a technical explanation of the tax provisions of H.R. 2206. The \ntechnical explanation expresses the committee's understanding and \nlegislative intent behind this important legislation. It will be \navailable on the Joint Committee's website at www.house.gov/jct.\n  These are sound tax policy changes. Let's finally enact an increase \nin the minimum wage, and let's also pass this useful package of tax \nbenefits to help America's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the following are additional explanatory \nmaterials regarding the appropriations for the Department of Defense \nmade by the House amendments to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2206.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Department of Defense--Military\n\n\n                           PROGRAM EXECUTION\n\n       The Department of Defense shall execute the appropriations \n     provided in this Act consistent with the allocation of funds \n     contained in the joint explanatory statement of the committee \n     of conference accompanying H.R. 1591 when such appropriations \n     (by account) are equal to those appropriations (by account) \n     provided in this Act. The Department is further directed to \n     adhere to the reporting requirements in Senate Report 110-37 \n     and House Report 110-60 except as otherwise contravened by \n     the joint explanatory statement of the committee of \n     conference accompanying H.R. 1591 or the following statement.\n\n                         reporting requirements\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall provide a report to the \n     congressional defense committees within 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this legislation on the allocation of \n     the funds within the accounts listed in this Act. The \n     Secretary shall submit updated reports 30 days after the end \n     of each fiscal quarter until funds listed in this Act are no \n     longer available for obligation. These reports shall include: \n     a detailed accounting of obligations and expenditures of \n     appropriations provided in this Act by program and \n     subactivity group for the continuation of the war in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan; and a listing of equipment procured using funds \n     provided in this Act. In order to meet unanticipated \n     requirements, the Department of Defense may need to transfer \n     funds within these appropriations accounts for purposes other \n     than those specified. The Department of Defense shall follow \n     normal prior approval reprogramming procedures should it be \n     necessary to transfer funding between different \n     appropriations accounts in this Act.\n\n\n                          CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS\n\n       Recommended adjustments to classified programs are \n     addressed in a classified annex.\n\n                       Operation and Maintenance\n\n\n                      SOAR VIRTUAL SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n       The Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Military Community \n     and Family Policy is directed to comply with the guidance \n     contained in the joint explanatory statement of the committee \n     of conference accompanying H.R. 1591 regarding the Student \n     Online Achievement Resources (SOAR Virtual School District) \n     program.\n\n\n                       IRAQ SECURITY FORCES FUND\n\n       The Department is directed to report to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of \n     enactment of this Act the accountability requirements DoD has \n     applied to the train-and-equip program for Iraq and the plans \n     underway to formulate property accountability rules and \n     regulations that distinguish between war and peace.\n\n\n             JOINT IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE DEFEAT FUND\n\n       The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization \n     (JIEDDO) shall report on JIEDDO staffing levels no later than \n     June 29, 2007.\n\n                              Procurement\n\n\n   SINGLE CHANNEL GROUND AND AIRBORNE RADIO SYSTEM (SINCGARS) FAMILY\n\n       The Department of the Army is directed to comply with the \n     guidance contained in the joint explanatory statement of the \n     committee of conference accompanying H.R. 1591 regarding \n     funding limitations and reporting requirements for the Single \n     Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems.\n\n                         Defense Health Program\n\n\nTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) \n                         TREATMENT AND RESEARCH\n\n       If a service member is correctly diagnosed with TBI or \n     PTSD, the better chance he or she has of a full recovery. It \n     is critical that health care providers are given the \n     resources necessary to make accurate, timely referrals for \n     appropriate treatment and that service members have high \n     priority access to such services. Therefore, $900,000,000 is \n     provided for access, treatment and research for Traumatic \n     Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). \n     Of the amount provided, $600,000,000 is for operation and \n     maintenance and $300,000,000 is for research, development, \n     test and evaluation to conduct peer reviewed research.\n       By increasing funding for TBI and PTSD, the Defense \n     Department will now have significant resources to \n     dramatically improve screening for risk factors, diagnosis, \n     treatment, counseling, research, facilities and equipment to \n     prevent or treat these illnesses.\n       To ensure that patients receive the best care available, \n     the Department shall develop plans for the allocation of \n     funds for TBI and PTSD by reviewing the possibility of \n     conducting research on: therapeutic drugs and medications \n     that ``harden'' the brain; and, testing and treatment for \n     tinnitus which impacts 49 percent of blast victims. The \n     Department also should consider in its planning the \n     establishment of brain functioning base lines prior to \n     deployment and the continued measurement of concussive \n     injuries in theater.\n       If the Secretary of Defense determines that funds made \n     available within the operation and maintenance account for \n     the treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic \n     Stress Disorder are excess to the requirements of the \n     Department of Defense, the Secretary may transfer excess \n     amounts to the Department of Veterans Affairs to be available \n     for the same purpose.\n       The Secretary of Defense shall notify the congressional \n     defense committees no later than 15 days following any \n     transfer of funds to the VA for PTSD/TBI treatment.\n\n\n              SUSTAINING THE MILITARY HEALTH CARE BENEFIT\n\n       Provided herein is $410,750,000 to fully fund the Defense \n     Health Program for fiscal year 2007. The Department is \n     expected to examine other ways to sustain the benefit without \n     relying on Congress to enact legislation that would increase \n     the out-of-pocket costs to the beneficiaries.\n\n\n  HEALTH CARE IN SUPPORT OF ARMY MODULAR FORCE CONVERSION AND GLOBAL \n                              POSITIONING\n\n       The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and \n     the Surgeon General of the Army shall coordinate an effort \n     and report back to the congressional defense committees \n     within 120 days after enactment of this Act on how these \n     anticipated costs will be funded to ensure soldiers and their \n     families affected by AMF and global positioning will have \n     access to the health care they deserve.\n\n\n                   MEDICAL SUPPORT FOR TACTICAL UNITS\n\n       The Department of the Army is directed to address medical \n     requirements for those tactical units currently deployed to \n     or returning from the Iraq or Afghanistan theaters. The \n     Department of the Army shall focus funding on the \n     replenishment of medical supply and equipment needs within \n     the combat theaters, to include bandages and the provision of \n     medical care for soldiers who have returned home in a medical \n     holdover status.\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\n                          MEB/PEB IMPROVEMENTS\n\n       The system for evaluating soldiers' eligibility for \n     disability benefits has diminished, causing the soldiers' \n     needs to go unmet. In particular, the thousands of soldiers \n     wounded in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have overwhelmed \n     the system leading to failure to complete reviews in a timely \n     manner. In some cases, lack of management, caseworkers, \n     specialists to help identify depression and post-traumatic \n     stress disorder, medical hold facilities and even wheelchair \n     access has meant that wounded soldiers have had to overcome \n     many obstacles during their medical care.\n       Therefore, within the funds provided, $30,000,000 is to be \n     used for strengthening the process, programs, formalized \n     training for personnel, and for the hiring of administrators \n     and caseworkers. The resources provided are to be used at \n     Walter Reed, Brooke, Madigan, and Womack Army Medical Centers \n     and National Naval Medical Center, San Diego.\n\n                     Summary and

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate, \nat 8:25 p.m., vote, without any intervening action or debate, on the \nmotion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n2206; that the time from 7:55 to 8:25 p.m. be equally divided between \nthe two leaders, with the majority leader in control of the last 15 \nminutes, and that no other amendments or motions be in order prior to \nthe vote, with the time allocated as follows: Senator Durbin, 5 \nminutes; Senator Levin, 5 minutes; Senator Landrieu, 5 minutes, and \nSenator Brown, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote on \na funding bill for the war in Iraq.\n  It is a historic vote and a very important one over which many of us \nhave anguished.\n  I come to this decision with sadness and anger--sadness that we are \nin the fifth year of this war, a war that has lasted longer than World \nWar II; sadness that we have lost 3,435 of our bravest, our American \nsoldiers; sadness that over 25,000 of these soldiers have been injured, \n8,000 or 9,000 grievously injured; sadness that we spent over $500 \nbillion on a war that is second only to World War II in its cost to our \nNation.\n  I also come to this floor with anger--anger that we do not have it in \nour power to make the will of the people of America the law of our \nland; anger that this President has vetoed a bipartisan bill carefully \ncrafted to start bringing America's troops home; anger that we continue \nto bury our Nation's heroes every day while this Congress fails to \nmuster the votes and some of the will to bring this war to an end.\n  In October of 2002, I stood on this Senate floor and joined 22 other \nSenators in casting my vote against this war. I felt then, and I \nbelieve today, that the invasion of Iraq was a serious mistake. I \nbelieve, as I stand here, it has been the most flawed and failed policy \nof any administration in our history.\n  That night when the vote was cast, this ornate Chamber was quiet. \nThere was a lonely feel about it in the closing moments of the session. \nThose of us who lingered knew that regardless of what the White House \nsaid, this President would waste no time invading Iraq--regardless of \nthe flawed intelligence, regardless of the lack of allies, regardless \nof a battle plan that left us in a position stronger after the invasion \nthan before.\n  Today, 4\\1/2\\ years later, 4\\1/2\\ years after that vote and after \nthis invasion, America is not safer, Iraq is in turmoil, and our \nposition as a nation in this world has been compromised by this tragic \ndecision by this administration.\n  I said at the time, and I will stand by it with my vote this evening, \nthat though I loathe this decision to go to war, I will not take my \nfeelings out on the troops who are in the field. I will continue to \nprovide the resources they need to be trained and equipped and rested \nand ready to go into battle and to come home safely.\n  The debate will continue over this policy, but our soldiers should \nnever be bargaining chips in this political debate. That is why I will \nvote this evening for this bill. But I want to make it clear with this \nvote that this bill is not the end of the debate on the war in Iraq. \nThis debate will continue until our Nation comes to its senses, until \nour troops come home, and until we put this sorry chapter in our \nNation's history behind us.\n  We have summoned our friends on the Republican side of the aisle to \njoin us in this effort. Two have had the courage to step forward. I \nhope that as they reflect on this war and its cost to America that more \nRepublicans will join us, that we will not have to wait until President \nBush walks out of the White House to see an end to this war.\n  I pledge to you, Mr. President, this Senator and so many others will \ncontinue this debate beyond today, beyond tonight, every day until \nthose troops come home safely. When we consider the Defense \nauthorization bill in just a few weeks, we will return to this national \ndebate. We will push for that timetable to bring these troops home. We \nwill stand by our soldiers and show our devotion to them with our \ncommitment to bringing them home safely, in an honorable way. The \ndebate will continue until the soldiers are safe and until they are \nhome.\n  I pray this will happen soon, happen before we lose more of these \ngreat men and women. This morning at my desk upstairs, I sat down and \npenned more notes to the grieving parents and spouses of fallen \nsoldiers in my State of Illinois. I never dreamed 4\\1/2\\ years ago that \nI would still be writing those notes today. It is a sad testimony to \nwhat this failed policy has cost our Nation.\n  With this vote tonight, the debate will not end; the debate will \ncontinue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I continue to believe that Congress must \nact to change course in Iraq because the Bush administration will not. \nCongress needs to force the Iraqi political leaders to accept \nresponsibility for their country's future. Four years of painful \nhistory have shown that the only way to accomplish that goal is to \nwrite into law a requirement that we reduce the number of U.S. troops \nin Iraq beginning in 120 days. That amount of time would give the Iraqi \nleaders the time to make the political settlements that are the only \nhope of ending the sectarian fighting.\n  Setting that beginning point would also force the Iraqi leaders to \nface the reality that we will not be their endless security blanket. \nThat approach got 51 votes in the Senate on March 29. It was sent to \nthe President. The President vetoed it. But pressure continues to build \nfor a change in course, even in the President's party.\n  We will renew the effort to force a change in course in June when we \ntake up the Defense authorization bill currently scheduled for late \nJune. The way we will do that is we will make and renew the effort to \nrequire the President to begin reducing American troops in Iraq within \n120 days.\n  I voted against the authorization to attack Iraq 4 years ago, and I \nwill continue to fight for a bill that forces the President to do the \none thing which will successfully change course in Iraq. Reducing our \npresence starting in 120 days is a way of telling the Iraqi leaders \nthat we cannot save them from themselves and that only they can make \nthe decision as to whether they want an all-out civil war or they want \na nation.\n  I cannot vote, however, to stop funding for our troops who are in \nharm's way. I simply cannot, and I will not do that. It is not the \nproper way we can bring this war to an end. It is not the proper way we \ncan put pressure on the Iraqi leaders. It is a way of sending the wrong \nmessage to our troops because now that they are there, and now that \nthey are in harm's way, I believe we must give them all of the support \nthey need.\n  It is not only the absence from this bill of a beginning point for \ntroop reductions, which is so troubling, I am also concerned about the \nbenchmarks in this bill because they are not only toothless, they may \nactually be counterproductive. Benchmarks with no consequences for \nfailure to achieve them will not put the necessary pressure on the \nIraqi leaders to reach a political settlement. Only a law requiring the \nreduction of our troops can do that.\n  The benchmarks as written in this bill are doubly problematic because \nthe schedule for reports, July 15 and September 15, could be used as a \nway of forestalling pressure on the administration and the Iraqi \nleaders since those reports are not due until after we are planning to \ntake up the Defense authorization bill in June.\n  Perhaps the supporters of the current course in Iraq will say that \nthose of us voting to fund the troops bill before us are also signing \non to the toothless benchmarks with their arguably momentum-slowing \nrequirements. So let me say plainly, I oppose the benchmarks and the \nreports as provided for in this bill.\n  Well, let me say plainly: I oppose the toothless benchmarks and \nmomentum-delaying reports in this bill. I agree\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\nwith the Iraq Study Group that continued U.S. military support for Iraq \n``depends on the Iraqi government's demonstrating political will and \nmaking substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on \nnational reconciliation, security and governance.''\n  It has been clear for a long time that there is no military solution \nin Iraq and that an Iraqi political settlement is necessary if there is \na chance of ending the violence in Iraq.\n  Most telling, perhaps, was Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's \nacknowledgement of this essential point when he stated in November:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle . . . of bloodletting of innocents are the [Iraqi] \n     politicians.\n\n  Apparently, the Iraqi leaders, however, will realize that their \nfuture is in their hands only when they are forced into that \nrecognition. That is one of the many reasons that we must pass a law \nrequiring our President to begin reducing U.S. troops in Iraq in 120 \ndays. We will continue our efforts to do so when the Defense \nauthorization bill is before us.\n  The Washington Post reported yesterday that General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker are working on a new strategy in Iraq. According to \nthe Washington Post: ``The end of 2008, is more political than \nmilitary: to negotiate settlements between warring factions in Iraq \nfrom the national level down to the local level. In essence, it is as \nmuch about the political deals needed to defuse a civil war as about \nthe military operations aimed at quelling a complex insurgency, said \nofficials with knowledge of the plan.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin by thanking majority leader \nHarry Reid for his extraordinary work in helping to negotiate the full \nKatrina-Rita package that many of us worked on to try to accelerate and \njump-start the recovery that is underway slowly, solidly in some \nplaces, and not so solidly in others along the entire gulf coast of \nthis Nation, America's energy coast. Louisiana sits in the middle of \nthis great coastline and was hit not by one but by two monstrous storms \n18 months ago. But, as my colleagues have heard me say many times, it \nwasn't just Katrina and Rita that did so much damage, it was the \ncollapse of a Federal levee system that should have held but didn't \nhold. In Louisiana alone, 200,000 homes were totally destroyed. In \nMississippi, it was over 65,000 homes because of the surge that came \nout of the gulf.\n\n  It is hard for people to comprehend what that means. It is still \ndifficult for those of us who live there to get a handle on the scope \nof the damage and devastation. We are grateful for the generosity of \nthis Nation. We are grateful for the private contributions, the many \nchurch groups and people of faith who have come to help us, and we are \nexcited about this package in this emergency supplemental.\n  When we began this journey 4 or 5 months ago, there were some on the \nopposition side that said we didn't need to include any of this; that \nthis is for an emergency overseas. But I really want to remind everyone \nthat we are still in a state of emergency on the gulf coast, and asking \nfor $3.7 billion in a $120 billion bill is really not too much to ask \nfor hard-working American taxpayers whose homes had never flooded \nbefore. Many of these home owners and business owners never had an inch \nof water in them, but they suddenly came home or woke up to 12 to 14 \nfeet of water, up to their roofs, ruining everything they had worked \nfor, sometimes everything their parents and grandparents had worked \nfor.\n  Briefly, what we have done, in this last minute as I summarize, is to \nwaive the 10-percent match, which is critical. It is not only the money \nthat is helpful, obviously, to not have to put up that 10 percent, but \nmostly by waiving the match we are waiving 90 percent of the redtape \nthat is keeping these hard-working people who are doing everything they \ncan to rebuild their lives.\n  There were some in the administration who wanted to play games with \nthe levees, and move levees from the east bank to the west bank and say \nwe will fund it later. Well, there is no later for us. There is now, \nand we are going to build these levees and protect the people in south \nLouisiana. That has been done.\n  One other part that is very important to me, and a provision I \nobjected to when it was first implemented 2 years ago, is the option \nfor the forgiveness of loans, which had been taken away. I said, on \nbehalf of the people I represent, we are entitled to the same response \nthat other communities have received, and this bill gives us justice on \nthe gulf coast.\n  In addition, there is some money for help for our criminal justice \nsystem that needs improvement, and to correct some of the teacher \nshortages as a result of the collapse and damage to many schools, and \nteachers who have had to move to higher ground but who want to come \nback to teach the children.\n  Finally, let me thank Senator Murray, who has been extraordinary in \nher efforts on our behalf. I also thank Senator Byrd, the chairman of \nour committee. They were not going to let this bill get through without \nKatrina and Rita being recognized and the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who are depending on this Congress to keep fighting for them and \nto at least meet them halfway. We do not look for charity, we look for \na hand up. We look for our Government to meet us halfway.\n  We can afford at least 10 to 15 days' worth of Iraq spending toward \nrebuilding the great energy coast of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it was important from the outset that \nthis supplemental, these funds, be provided to the troops by Memorial \nDay. The President told us the first week in February that he needed \nthe funds to support troops stationed overseas. A month and a half \nafter the Secretary of Defense stepped in, he said delays would \nseriously disrupt key military programs. The Army Chief of Staff told \nus if he didn't get the funds soon, he would have to take Draconian \nmeasures that would impact readiness and impose hardships on soldiers \nand their families. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nPace, said delays would force the Army to cut quality-of-life \ninitiatives.\n  Then the calls started coming from Iraq. The chief spokesman of the \nMultinational Forces, General Caldwell, told us that delays in funding \nhave already started to hamstring our efforts to train Iraqi security \nunits. That was more than a month and a half ago.\n  It was 108 days ago the President said he needed funds for the \ntroops. But since that first request in early February until today, \nCongress has voted more than 30 times on Iraq-related measures without \napproving a single dime. Mr. President, 108 days and more than 30 votes \nlater, Congress is finally sending these funds to the troops.\n  Many on this side of the aisle are disappointed that the final bill \ncontains billions of dollars in spending for items unrelated to the \nwar, but we are relieved the Democratic leadership has decided to strip \na reckless and nonsensical surrender date from the bill.\n  One other thing. It is important the Iraqi Government be held \naccountable. It needs to engage in political reconciliation, and this \nbill calls upon them to do just that. Members on both sides are deeply \nfrustrated with the Iraqi Government. Anything that puts pressure on \nthem without putting pressure on U.S. troops is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I have been saying since January that benchmarks would be a good \nidea. General Petraeus and General Pace have said the Baghdad security \nplan is a necessary precondition for political progress in Iraq. We \nneed to be sure Iraqi politicians are putting the same effort into \ntheir half of the bargain as our men and women in uniform.\n  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will report back to Congress \nat the end of the summer, and the success or failure of the security \nplan will be clear by the end of the year.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill, which \nfinally gives the troops the funds they need. We\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nshould remember as we return home to our families this weekend that \nthousands of American men and women will be fighting for us far away \nfrom their homes. The very least we can do for them this Memorial Day \nis to give them the tools they need to stay in the fight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6795-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6795-S6823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' CARE, KATRINA RECOVERY, AND IRAQ \n       ACCOUNTABILITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. REID.

(a) Findings Regarding Progress in Iraq, the \n     Establishment of Benchmarks to Measure That Progress, and \n     Reports to Congress.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 145,000 American military personnel are currently \n     serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, \n     with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the \n     finest traditions of the United States Armed Forces, and are \n     deserving of the strong support of all Americans.\n       (2) Many American service personnel have lost their lives, \n     and many more have been wounded in Iraq; the American people \n     will always honor their sacrifice and honor their families.\n       (3) The United States Army and Marine Corps, including \n     their Reserve components and National Guard organizations, \n     together with components of the other branches of the \n     military, are performing their missions while under enormous \n     strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. These deployments, and those that will follow, \n     will have a lasting impact on future recruiting, retention, \n     and readiness of our Nation's all volunteer force.\n       (4) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of \n     sectarian and intrasectarian violence based upon political \n     distrust and cultural differences among factions of the Sunni \n     and Shia populations.\n       (5) Iraqis must reach political and economic settlements in \n     order to achieve reconciliation, for there is no military \n     solution. The failure of the Iraqis to reach such settlements \n     to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to \n     the increasing violence in Iraq.\n       (6) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence rests with the sovereign \n     Government of Iraq.\n       (7) In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq, that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly.\n       (8) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists.\n       (9) It is essential that the sovereign Government of Iraq \n     set out measurable and achievable benchmarks and President \n     Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that ``America will change \n     our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet \n     these benchmarks''.\n       (10) As reported by Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy \n     Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of \n     political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006 that were: (A) \n     reaffirmed by Iraq's Presidency Council on October 6, 2006; \n     (B) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (C) posted on the \n     President of Iraq's Web site.\n       (11) On April 21, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n     stated that ``our [American] commitment to Iraq is long-term, \n     but it is not a commitment to have our young men and women \n     patrolling Iraq's streets open-endedly'' and that ``progress \n     in reconciliation will be an important element of our \n     evaluation''.\n       (12) The President's January 10, 2007, address had three \n     components: political, military, and economic. Given that \n     significant time has passed since his statement, and \n     recognizing the overall situation is ever changing, Congress \n     must have timely reports to evaluate and execute its \n     constitutional oversight responsibilities.\n       (b) Conditioning of Future United States Strategy in Iraq \n     on the Iraqi Government's Record of Performance on Its \n     Benchmarks.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) The United States strategy in Iraq, hereafter, shall be \n     conditioned on the Iraqi government meeting benchmarks, as \n     told to members of Congress by the President, the Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected in the Iraqi \n     Government's commitments to the United States, and to the \n     international community, including:\n       (i) Forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then \n     completing the constitutional review.\n       (ii) Enacting and implementing legislation on de-\n     Baathification.\n       (iii) Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people \n     of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to \n     ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, \n     Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable \n     manner.\n       (iv) Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to \n     form semi-autonomous regions.\n       (v) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission, provincial elections \n     law, provincial council authorities, and a date for \n     provincial elections.\n       (vi) Enacting and implementing legislation addressing \n     amnesty.\n       (vii) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing a \n     strong militia disarmament program to ensure that such \n     security forces are accountable only to the central \n     government and loyal to the Constitution of Iraq.\n       (viii) Establishing supporting political, media, economic, \n     and services committees in support of the Baghdad Security \n     Plan.\n       (ix) Providing three trained and ready Iraqi brigades to \n     support Baghdad operations.\n       (x) Providing Iraqi commanders with all authorities to \n     execute this plan and to make tactical and operational \n     decisions, in consultation with U.S commanders, without \n     political intervention, to include the authority to pursue \n     all extremists, including Sunni insurgents and Shiite \n     militias.\n       (xi) Ensuring that the Iraqi Security Forces are providing \n     even handed enforcement of the law.\n       (xii) Ensuring that, according to President Bush, Prime \n     Minister Maliki said ``the Baghdad security plan will not \n     provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of [their] \n     sectarian or political affiliation''.\n       (xiii) Reducing the level of sectarian violence in Iraq and \n     eliminating militia control of local security.\n       (xiv) Establishing all of the planned joint security \n     stations in neighborhoods across Baghdad.\n       (xv) Increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units \n     capable of operating independently.\n       (xvi) Ensuring that the rights of minority political \n     parties in the Iraqi legislature are protected.\n       (xvii) Allocating and spending $10 billion in Iraqi \n     revenues for reconstruction projects, including delivery of \n     essential services, on an equitable basis.\n       (xviii) Ensuring that Iraq's political authorities are not \n     undermining or making false accusations against members of \n     the Iraqi Security Forces.\n       (B) The President shall submit reports to Congress on how \n     the sovereign Government of Iraq is, or is not, achieving \n     progress towards accomplishing the aforementioned benchmarks, \n     and shall advise the Congress on how that assessment \n     requires, or does not require, changes to the strategy \n     announced on January 10, 2007.\n       (2) Reports required.--\n       (A) The President shall submit an initial report, in \n     classified and unclassified format, to the Congress, not \n     later than July 15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the \n     specific benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his \n     judgment, whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these \n     benchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n       (B) The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, the Secretary of Defense, the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces-Iraq, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare the \n     report and submit the report to Congress.\n       (C) If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include in the report, \n     the advisability of implementing such aspects of the \n     bipartisan Iraq Study Group, as he deems appropriate.\n       (D) The President shall submit a second report to the \n     Congress, not later than September 15, 2007, following the \n     same procedures and criteria outlined above.\n       (E) The reporting requirement detailed in section 1227 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     is waived from the date of the enactment of this Act through \n     the period ending September 15, 2007.\n       (3) Testimony before congress.--Prior to the submission of \n     the President's second report on September 15, 2007, and at a \n     time to be agreed upon by the leadership of the Congress and \n     the Administration, the United States Ambassador to Iraq and \n     the Commander, Multi-National Forces Iraq will be made \n     available to testify in open and closed sessions before the \n     relevant committees of the Congress.\n       (c) Limitations on Availability of Funds.--\n       (1) Limitation.--No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for the ``Economic Support Fund'' and available for \n     Iraq may be obligated or expended unless and until the\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n     President of the United States certifies in the report \n     outlined in subsection (b)(2)(A) and makes a further \n     certification in the report outlined in subsection (b)(2)(D) \n     that Iraq is making progress on each of the benchmarks set \n     forth in subsection (b)(1)(A).\n       (2) Waiver authority.--The President may waive the \n     requirements of this section if he submits to Congress a \n     written certification setting forth a detailed justification \n     for the waiver, which shall include a detailed report \n     describing the actions being taken by the United States to \n     bring the Iraqi government into compliance with the \n     benchmarks set forth in subsection (b)(1)(A).

government, acting in strict accordance with their \n     respective powers given by the Iraqi Constitution, reach a \n     consensus as recited in a resolution, directing a \n     redeployment of

Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment.\n  Mr. President, more than 4 years ago, the Bush administration took \nthis Nation to war in Iraq--took this Nation to war in Iraq without \nsufficient troops, without a plan to win the peace, and without truth \nregarding Saddam Hussein's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction or \nhis nonexistent links to al-Qaida.\n  Nearly 51 months later--6 months longer than it took this Nation to \ndefeat Germany and Japan in World War II--the violence in Iraq \ncontinues and the cost to our military and our Nation has been \nfrightening. More than 3,400 American troops have made the ultimate \nsacrifice--death. Nine were killed yesterday and two more today in this \nescalating violence across Iraq in which we are losing our brave men \nand women. Guard and Reserve units all across America lack equipment to \ndo their jobs at home and in Iraq. U.S. citizens have provided nearly \nhalf a trillion dollars to cover the cost of this intractable civil \nwar. And because of this war, our Nation has been totally distracted in \nits effort to defeat those who attacked us on 9/11. Indeed, more than 5 \nyears after 9/11, Osama bin Laden is still free, and al-Qaida remains \nan important force.\n  Throughout all this, our military has performed heroically. Our \ntroops have done everything asked of them and even more. Our troops \ntoppled a dictator and gave the Iraqis a chance to establish a new \ngovernment and a new way of life. Unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration did not provide them a strategy to match that sacrifice. \nIraq is now in a state of civil war, with no end in sight, and our \nvaliant troops are caught in the middle.\n  Instead of accepting this reality, President Bush has stubbornly \nrefused to change course. Instead of listening to his military \ncommanders who say there is no military solution in Iraq, he has \nplunged our forces further into sectarian fighting. Instead of \naccepting a bipartisan path in Iraq offered by Congress and even the \nIraq Study Group, this President stubbornly clings to his failed ``my \nway or the highway'' approach to governing America.\n  MG John Batiste, who commanded the First Infantry Division in Iraq, \nsays this about the President's failed Iraq policy:\n\n       Here is the bottom line: Americans must come to grips with \n     the fact that our military alone cannot establish a \n     democracy. We cannot sustain the current operational tempo \n     without seriously damaging the Army and Marine Corps. Our \n     troops have been asked to carry the burden of an ill-\n     conceived mission.\n\n  Earlier this year, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \nsaid: The problems in Iraq are more complex than Vietnam, and military \nvictory is no longer possible. Henry Kissinger said--and I repeat--the \nproblems in Iraq are more complex than Vietnam, and military victory is \nno longer possible.\n  GEN George Casey, former Commander of U.S. Forces in Iraq, and \ncurrently Chief of Staff of the Army, said:\n\n       It has always been my view that a heavy and sustained \n     military presence was not going to solve the problem in Iraq.\n\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\n\n  That was General Casey. Six months ago, the Iraq Study Group said the \nsituation in Iraq was grave and deteriorating. The civil war in Iraq \nhas only gotten more pronounced since then. Unfortunately, the \nPresident's escalation strategy has not produced the positive results \nwe seek. Attacks on U.S. forces have increased, not decreased. Since \nthe onset of this latest surge, more than three U.S. soldiers have been \nkilled every day. Nearly 90 soldiers have been killed this month so \nfar, and almost 400 since the escalation plan began. Sectarian killings \nhave increased to presurge levels.\n  According to today's Washington Post newspaper, over 300 unidentified \ncorpses, most dumped in streets and alleys and water sewer systems, \nshowing signs of torture and execution, were found all across the \ncapital of Iraq in the month of May. And the month of May is not over.\n  Four million Iraqis, including 1.6 million children, have fled their \nhomes because of the violence, setting the stage for a massive \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  Our military has been pushed to the breaking point. To make up for \nthe shortages of combat-ready forces, tours of duty have now been \nextended from 12 to 15 months, with many soldiers now in their third \nand fourth tours.\n  Mr. President, I spoke just last week to one Nevada family whose son \nwas killed in action last week. We all remember there were three \nhostages, prisoners of war. I called the father, and he said: I pray \nthat my boy is one of the three. There were four that were \nunidentified. Well, his prayers were not answered. His son was the one \nincinerated in the humvee, and they had to wait until they took DNA to \nfind out it was his son.\n  This soldier had survived four vehicle explosions during his four \ntours of duty. That is too much to ask of any soldier or his family. \nPerhaps, not surprisingly after all, this soldier expressed \nreservations about the war in Iraq, is what he told his best friend \nbefore he left for the fourth time. His grandfather said:\n\n       It is a waste of young lives. We should not be in the \n     middle of a civil war.\n  Meanwhile, our capacity to respond to other challenges around the \nworld has been greatly constrained. Terror attacks across the world are \nup, not down. U.S. influence and standing is down, not up. By focusing \non Iraq and doing little or nothing in the rest of the Middle East, \nthis critical region has been destabilized even further and stands even \ncloser to a broader regional war.\n  The American people saw all this unfolding last November and they \nreached a conclusion that enough was enough. That is why they sent this \nPresident and Congress a clear and unmistakable challenge and a direct \nmessage: Find a responsible end to this war.\n  That is what congressional Democrats have done. From the very first \nday of this democratically controlled Congress, we have made it clear \nto the President that the days of blank checks and green lights for his \nfailed policy are over. After 6 years of rubberstamping President \nBush's failed policy, Congress has reasserted its rightful position in \nour constitutional form of Government.\n  Democrats have held more hearings on Iraq in 4 months than the \nRepublican-controlled Congress held in 4 years. We have repeatedly \nforced our Republican colleagues in the Senate and in the House to \ndebate and vote on where people stand with respect to the President's \nfailed Iraq policy. With each step we have taken, the pressure on the \nPresident and his Republican allies to change course has grown.\n  The most important step we have taken occurred last month. In the \nface of heavy White House pressure and more misleading statements by \nadministration officials, Congress was able to pass a bill that did \nwhat the American people asked us to do: No. 1, fully fund our troops \nand, No. 2, immediately change the direction of the war in Iraq.\n  In addition, the bill provides much needed funds to procure \nadditional equipment for our Guard and Reserve and to provide health \ncare services for active-duty troops and America's heroic veterans.\n  As the Senate Democratic leader, I am very proud of Senate Democrats. \nIn less than 4 months of Democratic control, with virtual Democratic \nunanimity, Congress sent the President binding language that would \ntruly compel him to do what the American people desire. Unfortunately, \nthough, the President vetoed that important legislation, leaving him \nfurther isolated from the American people, military experts, and an \nincreasing number of his own political party.\n  In the days since that veto, we have had negotiations with the \nadministration about how to proceed. The President made it very clear \nas late as last night that he intended to veto any effort to implement \ntimelines, transition the mission, or ensure the readiness of our \ntroops before they are deployed. Furthermore, here in the Senate our \nminority colleagues made it clear they are determined to place \nprocedural hurdles, most notably requiring 60 votes rather than a \nsimple majority, in front of those who seek to significantly alter the \nPresident's Iraq policy. Democratic unanimity with a handful of \nRepublicans will not be sufficient to do what we believe must be done. \nUntil more Republicans develop the courage to step forward and insist \nthat the President change course in Iraq, Republican intransigence has \nleft us with no good options.\n  How to vote on this bill before us is a very difficult and personal \ndecision for each Member of this Senate. There are many thoughtful \nmembers of my caucus who believe we should vote no, and continue to \nvote no until the President and his supporters come to their senses. \nThere are equally thoughtful members who believe we must vote yes \nbecause this bill does take a step forward in holding the President and \nthe Iraqis accountable and it does increase pressure on this \nadministration and its supporters to change direction in Iraq.\n  Although this is a very close call for me, as I suspect it is for \nmany Senators, I have decided to support this measure. But let me say, \nI know those who oppose this bill care as deeply about the safety of \nour troops as I do. They know I care as deeply about changing the \ncourse in Iraq as they do.\n  This bill before us clearly does not go as far as a bipartisan \nmajority of Congress would like. But it goes a lot further than the \nPresident and his supporters were willing to go earlier this month. \nThat is why we saw this headline in a recent edition of the Los Angeles \nTimes. Here is what it said: ``Senate Tilting On Iraq Policies; \nRepublicans Show Their Strongest Willingness Yet To Rein In Bush.''\n  Here is what the bill requires of the administration and Iraqis, the \none before us tonight: It establishes 18 benchmarks on which to measure \nthe Iraqi Government's performance; restricts the use of foreign aid to \nthe Iraqi Government should they fail to make meaningful progress; \nrequires the President to certify that the Iraqi Government deserves \nthese funds even if they fail to perform as promised; requires the \nadministration to testify before Congress and an independent assessment \nby the Government Accountability Office on the performance of the Iraqi \nGovernment; requires the President submit a report on the combat \nproficiency of Iraqi security forces; requires the President to \nredeploy our troops if the Iraqi Government concludes our presence is \nno longer desired; restricts use of Defense Department funding until \nCongress receives information about contractors in Iraq; and states \nofficial U.S. policy precludes permanent military bases in Iraq, no \ntorture of detainees, and no designs on Iraqi oil.\n\n  When the President signs the bill, that will be the law. Some of this \nlanguage is taken from an amendment offered by Senator John Warner last \nweek. Senator Warner offered his amendment as an alternative to the \nFeingold-Reid amendment that would have immediately transitioned the \nmission in Iraq and required a phased redeployment by April 2008. \nNaturally I said the Feingold-Reid language was far superior to the \nWarner language. However, today we don't have the option of choosing \nbetween Feingold-Reid and Warner. I wish we did. Although the Warner \nlanguage is weak by comparison to Feingold-Reid, and I so stated on the \nSenate floor last week, I believe we can begin holding the \nadministration accountable if we adopt the Warner language plus the \nother Iraq-related provisions contained in this bill, which I have \noutlined.\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\n  I know none of these measures comes close to the timelines and \naccountability provisions I supported in the vetoed bill. However, I \nalso know these provisions will force the administration to do more \nthan they have ever done before. I also know the stakes are too high \nand our obligation to the troops and the country is too great for us to \nstop working to force the President and his supporters to change \ncourse. The burden for securing and governing Iraq must now rest with \nthe Iraqi people.\n  As General Abizaid said:\n\n       It is easy for Iraqis to reply upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  GEN Doug Lute, recently nominated by President Bush to be his war \nczar, said:\n\n       We believe at some point, in order to break this dependence \n     on the coalition, you simply have to back off and let the \n     Iraqis step forward.\n\n  As long as I am Democratic leader and this President persists in \npursuing the worst foreign policy blunder in this Nation's history, the \nAmerican people should know I am determined to fight for change in \nIraq. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported the fiscal year 2008 \nDefense authorization bill earlier today. We will move to it in our \nnext work period, which starts in about 10 days. This battle for \nresponsible and effective Iraq policy will be joined in the Senate no \nlater than when we take up that bill. Senate Democrats will not stop \nour efforts to change our course in this war until either enough \nRepublicans join us to reject President Bush's failed policy or we get \na new President.\n  In 1941, in an address at Harrow School, Winston Churchill said:\n\n       Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never. . . .\n\n  My colleagues here in the Senate, particularly my Republican \ncolleagues, should know this is precisely my attitude when it comes to \nbringing about a change in course in the intractable civil war in Iraq. \nAlthough I didn't get everything I sought in the bill before us, and \nthat is an understatement, I will not give up until the supporters of \nthe President's failed policy accept the realities on the ground in \nIraq, until they accept that the President's plan is not working, that \nthis war must come to an end, and that it is time for our troops to \ncome home in a safe and responsible way.\n  Paraphrasing the words of Winston Churchill, when it comes to forcing \nthe President to change course in Iraq, Senate Democrats will never \ngive in, never give in, never, never, never.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Had I been here I would have voted in favor of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill because I believe we must fund the \ntroops who are in harm's way. However, I believe just as strongly that \nwe must change our mission in Iraq away from policing a civil war and \ntoward a much more narrowly focused goal of counterterrorism, which \nrequires a much smaller number of troops. That is what the Feingold-\nReid amendment stood for and that is why I voted for it on May 16, \n2007. Unfortunately, it did not have enough votes to pass. Our effort \nto force the President to change the mission in Iraq will continue \nalmost immediately with the DOD authorization bill and will not end \nuntil we succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6823-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to \naddress the ongoing genocide in Darfur. I have been coming to the floor \nalmost every week to try to make certain we don't forget what is \nhappening in Sudan, even as we focus most of our energy on important \nissues such as the war in Iraq, immigration reform, and so many other \nthings on our Senate agenda. But the crisis in Sudan is simply too \ngreat for us to ignore. It has now been over 2\\1/2\\ years since the \nPresident quite rightly called the situation in Sudan what it is, a \ngenocide. It was September 9, 2004, when the President made that \ncourageous statement, and we all know a statement like that has \nhistoric importance.\n  The United States, under the 1948 U.N. Convention on Genocide, is \ncommitted to providing effective penalties against the killers if it \ndeems that genocide is taking place. We are compelled to act. Yet \nsadly, we have done precious little to change the situation to this \npoint.\n  It is true that Congress, the administration, the private sector, and \nthe nonprofit community have taken some steps to increase the pressure \non the Sudanese Government to stop the killings and mass displacement \nof innocent people. That is at least a start. In Congress, Members have \nspoken out against the killings. They have introduced resolutions of \ncondemnation, and they have proposed legislation in an effort to do \nsomething. I have introduced legislation that would support state \ngovernments which decide to encourage public funds to divest from \nSudan-related investments. That bill has attracted strong bipartisan \ncosponsorship from over 25 Members of the Senate. Some of us have tried \nto make the right personal decisions to divest from Sudan-related \ninvestments in our own savings as a gesture of solidarity with the \ndivestiture movement. But we have to do so much more.\n  As for the Bush administration, the Office of Foreign Assets Control \nwithin the Treasury Department, working with many agencies and \ndepartments,\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nhas worked hard to tighten economic and political sanctions against the \nleaders and supporters of the Sudanese regime. President Bush spoke out \nat the Holocaust Museum a few weeks ago. He has vowed to keep pushing \nfor change in Sudan. Yet the administration must do more.\n  In the private sector, I was pleasantly surprised to see that \nFidelity recently decided to sell part of its stake in PetroChina, a \ncompany listed on to the New York Stock Exchange, the parent of which \nis a state-owned Chinese oil company with massive operations in Sudan. \nFidelity sold 91 percent of its PetroChina holdings in the United \nStates and even though that only amounts to 38 percent of its global \nPetroChina holdings, this is nonetheless a positive sign. The \ndivestiture movement is under way. Other investment firms such as \nCalvert have gone a step further and promised to hold no shares of any \nfirm that operates to the benefit of the Government of Sudan. Yet the \nprivate sector must do more.\n  Within the nonprofit community, organizations such as the Sudan \nDivestment Task Force and the Genocide Intervention Network continue to \napply pressure to governments and to private firms to get them all to \ndo more to stop the genocide. Yet they too must do more. All of us must \nwork together to do more in Congress, in the private sector, among \nnonprofit organizations and, yes, individuals and families concerned \nabout this terrible situation. To that end, I am working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and House and with the Bush administration, \nwith private sector advisors, and with the advocacy community to craft \na new bill that will apply even more economic pressure on the Sudanese \nregime and those who support it.\n  My bill, which I will introduce when we return, is the Sudanese \nDisclosure and Enforcement Act. It would do the following: First, it \nexpresses the sense of the Congress that the international community \nshould continue to bring pressure against the Government of Sudan in \norder to convince that regime that the world will not allow this crisis \nto continue unabated.\n  Second, it requires more detailed SEC disclosures by U.S.-listed \ncompanies that operate in the Sudanese petroleum sector, in order to \nprovide more information to investors that are considering divestiture.\n  Third, it increases civil and criminal penalties for violating \nAmerican economic sanctions in order to create a true deterrent.\n  Fourth, it requires the administration to report on the effectiveness \nof the current sanctions regime and recommend other steps Congress can \ntake to help end the crisis.\n  Fifth, it authorizes greater resources for the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control within the Department of Treasury to strengthen its \ncapabilities in tracking Sudanese economic activity and pursuing \nsanctions violators.\n  I will introduce this bill when we return. I urge my colleagues to \nseriously consider it, and I hope they will join me.\n  I have recently written to President Bush urging him to support the \nbill but also to take the next step. He promised 5 weeks ago to take \naction. His speech was at an auspicious location, the Holocaust Museum \nin Washington, DC, a museum which notes the terrible tragedy that \nbefell 6 million people during World War II. The President said on that \nday:\n\n       You who have survived evil know that the only way to defeat \n     it is to look it in the face and not back down. It is evil we \n     are now seeing in Sudan--and we're not going to back down.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       No one who sees these pictures can doubt that genocide is \n     the only word for what is happening in Darfur and that we \n     have a moral obligation to stop it.\n\n  Those are the words of the President. They are words worth repeating. \nThe President declared that the current negotiations between the U.N. \nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon and President Bashir of Sudan are ``the \nlast chance'' for Sudan to do the following: Follow through on the \ndeployment of U.N. support forces, allow the deployment of a full joint \nU.N.-African Union peacekeeping force, end support for the Janjaweed \nmilitia, reach out to rebel leaders, allow humanitarian aid to reach \nthe people of Darfur, stop his pattern of destruction once and for all.\n  President Bush then declared that if Bashir does not follow these \nsteps, in a short time the Bush administration will take the following \nsteps, in the President's words: Tighten U.S. economic sanctions on \nSudan, target sanctions against individuals responsible for the \nviolence, and prepare a strong new United Nations Security Council \nresolution.\n  Five weeks later, a short time has passed, and now it is time to act. \nIn these 5 weeks, President Bashir has ignored the world. In fact, a \nspokesperson for the Secretary General of the United Nations has called \nrecently renewed bombing in Sudan indiscriminate and a violation of \ninternational law. While we wait, while we ponder, while we think, \nwhile we work, while we vacation, innocent people die, victims of a \ngenocide. How will history judge us? Will it judge us for having \nacknowledged this genocide and responding, or will it judge us for \nhaving acknowledged this terrible tragedy and responded with nothing?\n  It is time to act. We must do more. This is simply too important and \ntoo historic to ignore any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Illinois. He \nmight be interested to know I met with the Secretary General of the \nUnited Nations on Monday in his office. I indicated I wanted to know \nwhat he was prepared to propose. As you know, there are three phases to \nthe process whereby the Sudanese have agreed to the implementation of \nultimately 21,000 troops made up of the African Union as well as United \nNations forces. He indicated he would have an answer as to what he \nthought might be able to be done probably by the end of Memorial Day. \nMy point to him was similar to my friend from Illinois. If, in fact, \nthe Sudanese Government refuses to allow, on the basis of their \nsovereignty, the placement of U.N. forces on the ground, that it \nviolates their sovereignty.\n  I indicated I believed--and others believe as well--that the country \nforfeits its sovereignty when it participates and engages in genocide \nand that we, the United States, should push the Security Council to \nimplement the placement of those troops on the ground regardless of \nwhat Khartoum says. Further, if they don't, it is my view the United \nStates unilaterally should engage through a no-fly zone as well as the \nplacement of 2,500 troops on the ground to take out the Janjaweed. That \nis not a political settlement, but the point I made to the Secretary \nGeneral was, as we talk about the ultimate problem, the need for a \npolitical settlement, it is like talking about a patient who has cancer \nand on the way to the operating room falls off the gurney and slits his \njugular vein and is bleeding to death. Everybody says: We have to take \ncare of the cancer. But they are going to bleed to death.\n  I have been in those camps in Darfur, actually on the border of \nDarfur. I have visited them in Chad. One camp with 30,000 women and \nchildren in it, over 300,000 in that region, deteriorating rapidly. It \nis a human disaster. I hope if, in fact, the United Nations doesn't \nact, the Senate will be prepared to act to support pushing the \nPresident to have the United States lead.\n  The point I am making is, I compliment my friend for continuing to \nkeep this in the consciousness of our colleagues and the public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6824-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6824-S6826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. But, Mr. President, the reason I rise today is to speak \nbecause there was not time for me to speak on the supplemental we just \nvoted for.\n  Earlier this month, Congress sent the President an emergency spending \nbill for Iraq. It provided the President with every single dollar our \ntroops needed and the President requested, and then some.\n  It also provided the American people a plan to bring this war to a \nresponsible end, including the language Senator Levin and I wrote, \nwhich required to start to bring American troops home within 120 days, \nhave the bulk of our combat troops out of Iraq by March--it turned out \nto be April 1 of 2008, and to, most importantly, limit the mission of \nthe smaller number that would remain to fighting al-Qaida and training \nIraqi troops.\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\n  In vetoing that bill, the President denied our troops funding they \nneeded and the American people the plan they want. When the President \ndid that, I urged, like others, that we send the bill back to him again \nand again and again. But the hard reality is, we found out we did not \nhave the 53 votes we had the first time, that we did not have even 50 \nvotes, that we would not be able to send it back. And ultimately, even \nif we had the 50 votes, we probably did not have 60 votes to stop a \nfilibuster. We clearly do not have 67 votes to overcome another veto. \nWe do not have those votes either.\n  I do not like the bill we just voted on, the one I voted for. It \ndenies the American people a plan for a responsible way out of Iraq. It \nwould also start to cut off funds for the Iraqis if the benchmarks are \nnot met. What a silly idea. That would be self-defeating. We are trying \nto build the Iraqi Army so we can get out of harm's way, and we are \ngoing to tell the Iraqis, who have no possibility of getting themselves \ntogether, if they do not, we are going to stop training them.\n  I would like nothing better than to have voted against this bill, but \nI think we have to deal with the reality. The reality is, first, for \nnow, those of us who want to change course in Iraq do not have the 67 \nvotes to override a Presidential veto. As long as the President refuses \nto budge, the only way we can force him to change his policy in Iraq is \nwith 67 votes.\n  Well, we have 49 Democrats and one Independent on our side. We need \nto bring 17 Republicans along all the way to our thinking, to the way a \nstrong majority of the American people are thinking. We are making \nprogress, but we are not there yet. So it is nice to talk about taking \na stand on this, but we do not have the votes, though. We do not have \nthe votes yet to turn our rhetoric into reality. That is the reality.\n  Secondly, I believe as long as we have troops on the front lines, it \nis our shared responsibility to give them the equipment and protection \nthey need. The President may be prepared to play a game of political \nchicken with the well-being of our troops, but I am not, and I will \nnot.\n  For example, if we do not get the money this bill provides into the \npipeline right now, we are not going to have a chance to build and \nfield the mine-resistant vehicles that are being so dearly sought after \nby the Marine Corps and the rest of the services, and that I have been \nfighting for. If we build these mine-resistant vehicles, the facts show \nwe can cut the deaths and casualties on the American side as a \nconsequence of these bombings by two-thirds.\n  We just voted earlier on this bill--because we were going to drag out \nfor 2 years the construction of these vehicles. In 2 years, another \n2,000 people could die. They need to begin to be built now, and they \nall must be built by the end of this year.\n  Under anyone's plan for Iraq--even those who advocate pulling every \nsingle troop out of the country tomorrow--there is a reality: It would \ntake months to get them out. In the meantime, our troops are riding \naround in humvees that are responsible for these roadside bombs: 70 \npercent--70 percent--70 percent--of the deaths and 70 percent of the \ncasualties.\n  As long as there is a single soldier there, I believe we have an \nobligation, and speaking for myself, I will do everything to make sure \nhe or she has the best protection this country can provide. That is my \nreality.\n  Third, I am prepared to cut funding to get our troops out of the \nsectarian civil war in Iraq and to start bringing most of them home, \nwhile limiting the mission of those who remain. That is why I voted for \nthe Reid-Feingold amendment last week. But I am not prepared to vote \nfor anything that cuts off 100 percent of the funding for all troops in \nIraq because everyone in this room knows there is going to be a \nrequirement--no matter what happens--to leave some troops in Iraq for a \nwhile.\n  So what are we going to do? Cut funding off for them to satisfy what \nis a very difficult--difficult--thing to explain to the vast majority \nof the American people who do not understand why we are not out of this \nwar? We can and we must get most of our troops out by early next year. \nBut we still need a much smaller number. That is my reality as well.\n  I know this supplemental bill is a bitter pill to swallow for so many \nAmericans who believe, as I do, this war must end. I must tell you, in \nmy present pursuit, it is not a smart vote for me to make because it \nrequires explanation. But I do not believe people fully understand how \nit is that the people voted in the Democratic Party in November of last \nyear, in large part to end this war, but we have not been able to do so \nyet.\n  Well, like it or not, we have a system that protects the rights of \nthe minority and puts the burden on the majority in order to have its \nway. It also creates a balance of power between the President and the \nCongress. That is why it takes 60 votes in the Senate--not 51--to get \nsomething done if the minority is determined not to have it done. That \nis why it takes 67 votes in our Constitution to override a President's \nveto. That is a reality. Not my reality--that is a constitutional \nreality.\n  So where do those of us who are determined to end this war go from \nhere? Well, day after day, vote after vote, we must, and we will, work \nto keep pressure on the Republicans to stop reflexively backing the \nPresident and start supporting a responsible path out of Iraq--make \nthem vote against it again and again because, quite frankly, I do not \nexpect to change the President's mind. But I believe we can change the \nmind of 17 Republicans.\n  Until that day comes--until that day comes--as long as this President \nis President, the carnage and chaos and stupidity in the conduct of \nthis war is likely to continue. So I believe with every funding bill, \nwe are going to have to come back at every juncture and require people \nto vote time and again against the will of American people in order to \nchange the attitude of my colleagues on the Republican side. That is \nthe reality. That is the reality that will bring this war to an end.\n\n  Like the most distinguished Member who serves in this body, the \nSenator from West Virginia, I was here during the Vietnam war, at the \nend. We all talk about how we cut off funds. We did not cut off funds \nuntil the vast majority of the troops were already out. We did not cut \noff funds until 1975. The reality was--the reality was--we did not do \nit. It is an incredibly blunt instrument.\n  So I would have felt better, I would have had less to explain, and it \nwould have been easier, because I have been such a persistent critic, I \nthink most of my colleagues will acknowledge, for the 4\\1/2\\ years of \nthis war, to vote to cut off the funding. But as we head into the \nMemorial Day recess, I want to remind my colleagues it is clearly time \nfor us to do our part as well to support our troops.\n  We in the Senate, and our colleagues in the House, and the military \nleadership, the President, and the American people have an overriding, \noverarching moral obligation to provide our forces, who are in the \nmiddle of a war, with the full weight of this Nation's productive \ncapacity, and all that is humanly possible, as we send citizens to war, \nto protect them. We have not done that. This administration has not \ndone that and has not asked for the money to do that. But we have to, \nand we must. We must speak to one specific situation which I fear, if I \ndo not raise today and every day--as I have in the last 3 weeks--it \nwill not come to pass, it may not get done. It goes back to why I felt \nI had to vote for this funding.\n  The issue is these mine-resistant vehicles, but it is bigger than \nthat. The issue is giving the men and women on the front lines a \ndramatically better chance to survive. It is totally, completely within \nour power to do that. We have the technology to do that. We have the \ncapacity to do that. We have the money to do that. We need only the \nwill to do that.\n  We have proven technically that our technology can, in fact, meet \nthis glaring deficiency that is killing so many of our troops. When I \nsay proven, I mean it. Let me be specific.\n  At the Aberdeen Proving Center, those folks have been working 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, for the past 3 months to fully test every \ndesign and variation of the so-called MRAPs, mine-resistant ambush-\nprotected vehicles, vehicles that are out there. By next week, I am \ntold, they will have concrete test data that will back up the \npurchasing decision the military will have to make.\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n  We already know these mine-resistant vehicles give four to five times \nmore protection than uparmored HMMWVs. We already know the casualty and \ndeath rate will go down by two-thirds if we have these mine-resistant \nvehicles, which means we know we should be doing everything possible, \nas rapidly as possible, because every day we waste one more life is in \njeopardy. We can save two-thirds of the lives being lost there--3,400 \ndead plus, and almost 24,000 severely wounded.\n  But why did these amazing test efforts only begin to happen this \nyear? Why are we only now starting to build these mine-resistant \nvehicles? And why are we building them in such small quantities?\n  We learned this week the Marine commanders in Iraq in February of \n2005--February of 2005--realized they needed these vehicles that have a \nV-shaped hull. They are designed specifically to defeat what everybody \nin America, unfortunately, has come to know about: IED, improvised \nexplosive devices. They are the roadside bombs and mines that we know \ncause 70 percent of all the casualties and deaths.\n  Now, in February of 2005, the first characteristic these commanders \nasked for--and I am quoting from the statement they sent to the \nPentagon called a Universal Needs Statement--they said: We need a \nvehicle to ``protect the crew from IED/mine threat through integrated \nV-shaped monocoque hull designed specifically to disperse explosive \nblasts and fragmentary effects.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be able \nto proceed for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The bottom line, in simple English, for nonphysicists is, \nno matter how much you reinforce a flat-bottomed vehicle, when a bomb \ngoes off under the vehicle, it either penetrates the vehicle or \npenetrates the vehicle, bounces back, and comes back up off the ground \nagain.\n  With these V-shaped vehicles, what happens is, when the blast goes \noff--other than the very point of the V--it takes the blast and, \ninstead of it bouncing back on the ground and bouncing back up, it \nshoots it off to the side, thereby increasing by two-thirds the \nlikelihood of survival.\n  No one should give us any of the malarkey I have heard from some in \nthe military and the administration about how any uparmored humvee \nmight have satisfied the need. The bottom line is, they cannot do what \nthese V-shaped vehicles can do.\n  Now, not only have these mine-resistant vehicles been fully tested at \nAberdeen, but our allies have been using similar technologies for \nyears. We are going to get down to the bottom of what happened in 2005. \nBut for now, let me get right to the chase. We have an overwhelming \nmoral obligation to build as many of these vehicles as rapidly as \npossible and get them to the field as soon as possible--even if we are \npulling out every single troop in January. Between now and January, we \nhave an obligation to save lives. It is within our capability and \nwithin our power to do so.\n  One more thing I would bring to the attention of my colleagues. I \nalso learned today--and we will soon find out--I learned today they \nhave also developed, out at the Aberdeen Proving Center, the capacity \nto be able to thwart the ability of these things called EFPs, \nexplosively formed penetrators. That is going to cost a lot of money. I \nhope I do not hear from anyone on this floor or anyone in the Congress \nthat, notwithstanding the fact we now have the technology, we are going \nto wait down the road because it costs too much money to do it now or \nit will take too much time, and we may have to leave--as one military \nman said to me: We don't want to build all these. We are eventually \ngoing to be coming home. We will have to leave them behind. That is a \nlittle like Franklin Roosevelt saying, when asked to build landing \ncraft for the invasion of D-Day: We don't want to build too many of \nthese, it costs too much money, because we are going to have to leave \nsome behind.\n\n  I say to my colleagues and to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Secretary Gates ended his press conference today by saying \nthere were competing interests for dollars. That may be true. But when \nit comes to the life of an American soldier we know--we know--we know \nfor a fact we can protect, there is no other competing interest. There \nis no other competing interest. Competing interests may exist, but \nthere is only one interest, and that is as this foolish war continues \nunder this President, our sons and daughters are being killed, and we \nhave the capacity right now to begin to build vehicles that will \ndiminish by two-thirds the casualty rate. There are no other competing \ninterests.\n  So I am going to continue to talk about this, I say to my colleagues, \nand I hope once we get the final call from the Pentagon, no one here on \nthis floor will rise to tell me we can't afford to do this.\n  I thank my colleague from West Virginia for his extreme courtesy, as \nalways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6826-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6826-S6827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n     In Flanders fields the poppies blow\n     Between the crosses, row on row\n     That mark our place; and in the sky\n     The larks, still bravely singing, fly\n     Scarce heard amid the guns below.\n\n     We are the Dead. Short days ago\n     We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n     Loved and were loved, and now we lie\n     In Flanders fields.\n\n     Take up our quarrel with the foe:\n     To you from failing hands we throw\n     The torch; be yours to hold it high.\n     If ye break faith with us who die\n     We shall not sleep, though poppies grow\n     In Flanders fields.\n\n  John McCrae, who wrote ``In Flanders Fields,'' was a Canadian \nphysician. He fought on the western front in 1914 before he was \ntransferred to the medical corps and assigned to a hospital in France. \nHe died of pneumonia while on active duty in 1918, and his volume of \npoetry was published in 1919.\n  This Monday, in veterans cemeteries around the Nation, flags will be \nplaced, tenderly placed--tenderly placed--before gravestones that \ncarefully and simply mark the thousands of enlisted men and officers, \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who, like John McCrae, did not \ncome home to ticker tape parades but, rather, to slow caissons trailed \nby weeping families, final gunfire salutes, and the haunting melodies \nof ``Taps'' played by a lone bugler. Some of those graves will be lush \nwith sod, and the final dates will bring back great battles in the \ncampaigns from the Pacific, Africa, or Europe. Other graves will still \nbe raw Earth, with dates on the headstones that mark the ambushes and \nimprovised explosive devices of modern urban insurgent warfare. But on \nthis day, none--none--will be forgotten, and all will be honored for \ntheir sacrifice, whatever their rank, whatever their service, and \nwhatever their last proud moment. The red of the poppies and the red \nstripes in the flags recall the red badge of their courage.\n  The current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq have also given rise to \nsome new ways to remember and honor the fallen. On the Internet, each \nsoldier lost in Iraq has his or her name, his or her picture, and the \ndate and the place of their death listed on a number of Web sites, \nincluding those hosted by several newspapers. A traveling exhibit of \n1,319 portraits lets ``America's Artists Honor America's Heroes'' \nthrough their own talents--through their own talents. When the exhibit \nis over, those portraits will be given to the soldier's family. In \nthese ways, each of us can put a face to these statistics. We can see \nthe faces, young and old, just as their families remember them.\n  The Senate this week has also remembered those who have fallen and \nthose still in harm's way in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Appropriations \nCommittee has finalized the emergency supplemental bill to fund the \noperations of the military and provide more protective gear and \ntechnology to our troops in the field. I hope that this time the \nPresident, our President, will sign the bill and speed those funds to \nthe troops. Also this week, the Senate Armed Services Committee is \nmarking up the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill. This bill \ntoo will look after all of our Active-Duty, Guard and Reserve forces \nthat face the prospect of\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\nadditional and longer tours in Iraq in the months ahead. Like the \nemergency supplemental bill put together by the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Defense authorization bill will continue the work of \nensuring that the wounded from these conflicts receive the best care \nand support as they recover from their injuries.\n  In 430 BC, after the first year of the Peloponnesian War, the Greek \nhistorian Thucydides recorded the funeral oration delivered by \nPericles, the great Greek general. Thucydides records that Pericles did \nnot speak of the battles but, rather, of the glories--the glories--of \nAthens and what a privilege it was--what a privilege it was--for each \nAthenian to live in such a perfect place. Pericles said that the \nsacrifice of those fallen in battle to keep the nation strong left them \nwith the:\n\n       Noblest of all tombs--the noblest of all tombs, I speak not \n     of that in which their remains are laid, but of that in which \n     their glory survives.\n\n  Pericles felt there could be no better place to live than Athens and \nno place more deserving of a soldier's sacrifice. Almost 2,500 years \nlater, I feel confident that every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine \nwho has fought and died in Afghanistan and Iraq probably felt the same \nway--yes--about the United States.\n  They were proud to be in uniform and ready to serve the Nation that \nthey loved and held in such high regard. The Nation will ever mourn \ntheir loss and honor their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6827-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the President of the United States has \nrecently stated that we are remaining in Iraq in order to defeat al-\nQaida--a summary of a statement he made yesterday. Well, I wish to \nbriefly state what I think the facts are.\n  Iraq has become a Bush-fulfilling prophecy. Al-Qaida was not there \nbefore the war, and it is there now. It is a problem, but it is not the \nprimary problem. In my view, the President of the United States is \ninadvertently handing al-Qaida a propaganda victory here by vastly \nexaggerating its role in Iraq.\n  The sectarian war--the war between Sunnis and Shias, Sunnis and Shias \nkilling each other--is the core problem, and our troops are caught in \nthe middle of that war. New statistics from Iraq make it absolutely \nclear that sectarian violence is getting worse and now exceeds the \nlevels immediately prior to the surging of American forces over a month \nago.\n  The focus of the President of the United States on al-Qaida and Iraq, \nironically, supports exactly what I have been arguing for. We need to \ndramatically limit the mission of U.S. troops in Iraq, getting them out \nof the middle of this sectarian civil war and refocusing their mission, \nwhich should be battling al-Qaida from occupying territory in Anbar \nProvince and training Iraqi troops. That would require far fewer troops \nand allow us to begin to remove American troops immediately and get the \nvast majority of our combat troops out of Iraq early next year, \nconsistent with the Biden-Levin provision that was in the bill the \nPresident vetoed.\n  Our troops cannot end the sectarian war. Mr. President, 500,000 \nAmerican troops will not end the sectarian war. What is required is a \npolitical solution, even as we continue to take on al-Qaida, which is a \ngrowing but not the primary problem in Iraq.\n  The President continues to bank on a farfetched hope. His hope is \nwell-intended, but it is farfetched that the Iraqis will rally behind a \nstrong democratic central government in Baghdad. But there is no trust \nwithin the Government in Baghdad. There is no trust of the Government \nin Baghdad by the Iraqi people. And there is no capacity by that \nGovernment in Baghdad to deliver either services or security.\n  Instead, the President should throw his full weight--the full weight \nof his office--behind the solution based upon federalism in Iraq, \nallowing the Iraqis to have control over the fabric of their daily \nlives, helping them bring into reality the Iraqi Constitution, where \narticle 1 says: We are a decentralized federal system. We should not \nimpose this. We do not need to. It is already in the Iraqi \nConstitution.\n  The President should call for a U.N. summit to get the world's major \npowers and Iraq's neighbors to push for a political agreement. It is \nnot an answer to put up a straw man and say we remain there because of \nal-Qaida. What is an answer is to call for the permanent five of the \nUnited Nations to call for a regional conference; make Iraq the world's \nproblem. I met with the Security Council permanent four, with us being \nthe fifth, in New York on Monday. It is like pushing an open door. They \nare ready to respond to the President's request to do that. This is \ndoable. This is necessary. The President should begin to focus on the \nfacts, not the fiction of al-Qaida being our rationale for being there.\n  I will end where I began. Al-Qaida's presence in Iraq has become a \nBush-fulfilling prophecy. They were not there before. They are there \nnow. But they are not the primary problem. It is the vicious cycle of \nsectarian violence. It must end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6827-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6827-S6828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEMORIAL DAY TRIBUTE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, nearly 6 years after the worst \nterrorist attacks in American history, we have yet to be hit again on \nour soil. No one would have thought this possible immediately after the \n9/11 attacks. But it is true because America is on offense in the war \non terror.\n  Memorial Day is a time to reflect on the brave men and women of the \nArmed Forces who have made that achievement possible, and to honor \ntheir sacrifice. Since 2001, over 3,800 Americans have died fighting in \nIraq or Afghanistan. Over 60 were from Kentucky.\n  Our country must honor those who died in the line of duty as well as \ntheir families. The debt we owe them can never be repaid. I have had \nthe honor of meeting many of the families of these servicemembers, and \nI have told them their loved ones did not die in vain.\n  Many who fought in the war on terror live to tell their stories, and \nI recently heard one I had like to share involving soldiers from Fort \nCampbell, KY. Four soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry \nRegiment, 101st Airborne Division lived up to the warrior ethos of \nnever leaving a fallen or wounded comrade behind.\n  The city of Ramadi, Iraq, has seen some of the worst battles between \ncoalition forces and the terrorists. One night in March 2006, SGT \nJeremy Wilzcek, SGT Michael Row, PFC Jose Alvarez and PFC Gregory \nPushkin, among others, made their way through the city's narrow alleys \nback to base.\n  Suddenly Sergeant Row saw two figures run into a house. Immediately \nsuspicious, he stopped the team in its tracks just as machine-gun and \nsmall-arms fire and grenades erupted on the street in front of them. \nThe soldiers took cover and returned fire.\n  Private First Class Alvarez noticed a fellow soldier had been hit and \nwas lying in the middle of the storm of bullets. Without thinking \ntwice, he ran into the line of fire and threw himself over his comrade. \nBut he was too late. The soldier was dead.\n  Private First Class Alvarez kept firing until he had unloaded his \nweapon at the enemy, and then stood up and began to carry the soldier's \nbody to a safe area. Sergeant Row provided cover fire, while Sergeant \nWilzcek and Private First Class Pushkin ran into the firefight to help \nPrivate First Class Alvarez carry their colleague.\n  The three soldiers were nearing cover when two rocket-propelled \ngrenades exploded yards away from them, knocking all three down and \nslicing Private First Class Alvarez's knee with shrapnel. But the three \ncontinued, finally reaching a safe area out of the path of bullets.\n  Sergeant Wilzcek and Private First Class Pushkin then ran back into \nthe enemy's kill zone several times, rescuing more trapped soldiers. \nSergeant Row continued to lay down cover fire, even though the same \nexplosion that injured Private First Class Alvarez's knee had buried \nshrapnel deep in his elbow. Finally, every soldier made it to a safe \narea.\n  They were out of immediate danger. But gunfire all around them made \nclear the terrorists were still out to kill. Sergeant Wilzcek, Sergeant \nRow and Private First Class Pushkin made their way to the roof of a \nbuilding, and with the advantage of the high ground, successfully \nkilled, captured or drove off\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\nthe terrorists, enabling the squad to return to base safely.\n  This February, now-Staff Sergeant Wilzcek and now-Specialists Alvarez \nand Pushkin were awarded the Silver Star, the third-highest award given \nfor valor in the face of the enemy. Sergeant Row was awarded the Bronze \nStar for Valor.\n  Their acts of heroism rank them among the finest America has to \noffer. But what I find most amazing is that they are everyday people \nwho could be your neighbor, coworker or relative. And we have thousands \nmore brave Americans in uniform all willing to do the same.\n  So this Memorial Day, remember the courage of our servicemen and \nwomen, performing extraordinary feats just like the men of Fort \nCampbell. Remember the sacrifice of those who don't make it back home. \nAs long as America has fighters of such spirit, we can never be \ndefeated on the battlefield.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we are approaching Memorial Day, a time to \nhonor those servicemembers who gave their very lives--what Abraham \nLincoln described as ``the last full measure of devotion.'' When \nLincoln spoke those words, he was dedicating a modest ``soldiers \ncemetery'' in a Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg. Today Gettysburg \nand the address Lincoln gave there hold a special place in our national \nmemory. In fewer than 300 words, President Lincoln delivered one of the \nmost famous speeches in the history of this great Republic.\n  In that speech, Lincoln said what was known: that it is good and \nright to dedicate a place to honor the brave servicemembers who rest \nbeneath it. But more importantly, he put into words what was felt: that \nthe best way to honor the dead is to remember their sacrifices, and \ndedicate our lives to the Nation for which they gave their lives.\n  What we now call Memorial Day was begun in the aftermath of that war, \nwith two dozen cities and towns across the United States laying claim \nto being the birthplace of what was then called Decoration Day. \nGenerations later, America paused in the aftermath of World War I, a \nmassive conflict that inspired the poem, ``In Flanders Field,'' about \nthe lives the war took and the bond between the living and the dead. \nThat poem roused the convictions of an American teacher named Moina \nMichael, who clung to the image of the red poppies in Flanders Field, \nwhich grew above the graves of World War I servicemembers. Miss Michael \nvowed to ``keep the faith'' with those who had died and to wear a red \npoppy as a sign of that pledge. She recorded her commitment in a poem \nshe called ``We Shall Keep the Faith,'' which reads, in part:\n\n     We Cherish, too, the poppy red,\n     That grows on fields where valor led;\n     It seems to signal to the skies\n     That blood of heroes never dies\n\n  Miss Michael spent the rest of her life raising money for veterans \nand survivors in need, by selling red poppies to honor the men and \nwomen who gave their lives in the service of our Nation. Through the \nsale of poppies made by disabled veterans, she raised approximately 200 \nmillion dollars for veterans and their survivors.\n  Today our great Nation steps further into the fifth year of our \ncurrent conflict in Iraq, and our sixth year in Afghanistan. As we \nponder how best to honor those who have died in these conflicts and in \nall prior wars, we can look to our history to find words and actions to \nguide us. Just as Lincoln's Gettysburg Address turned sentiment into \nprose, Miss Michael turned it into poetry, and then into action. For \nourselves, we can look at the sacrifices of those who have served and \nthen look within ourselves to honor them with our lives.\n  For myself, I pledge my continued best effort to make certain that \nthose who serve receive the thanks and the benefits and services they \nearned by their service and for those who gave their all, that their \nsurvivors are likewise given all they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6828-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6828-S6829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the true \nstalwarts of this institution an indefatigable legislator, a tireless \nadvocate for his home State of Alaska, a public servant with a lifetime \nof contribution, and a treasured leader of this venerable Chamber, \nSenator Ted Stevens who, this past April 13, 2007, became the longest-\nserving Republican member of the U.S. Senate. Our good friend and \ncolleague has received countless, well-deserved accolades for a \ntremendous milestone indeed.\n  It is fitting that we pay tribute to an esteemed lawmaker whose \nongoing legacy and longstanding record of accomplishment over a \nremarkable span of nearly 39 years of service in the U.S. Senate stand \nas a testament to the courage, vigor, and sense of duty he feels toward \nthis country and the issues and policies shaping it. Ted is a force of \nnature, steadfast and resolute, in this time-honored body and in our \nnation's capital. His constituents wouldn't have him any other way, and \nwe wouldn't either.\n  His legacy of achievement on behalf of Alaskans is as large as the \nState they call home, and began even before he entered politics when he \nfirst moved to Washington, DC, to join the Eisenhower administration. \nWhile working for the Secretary of the Interior, he was not only \npresent at Alaska's creation as a State in 1959, but was also \ninstrumental in helping advocate for statehood. As a U.S. Senator, he \nwas essential in championing the development of the Alaskan pipeline \nwhich was critical to his state and to the energy future of the \ncountry. He successfully advanced Alaska's infrastructure and \ntransportation capabilities, especially vital to the state that is one-\nfifth the size of the entire lower 48. Alaska rightfully commemorated \nSenator Steven's indelible impact in these areas with the dedication of \nthe Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in 2000. With a far-\nreaching litany of accomplishments too numerous to mention, it comes as \nlittle surprise that the Alaska State Legislature--where he served as \nHouse majority leader in only his second term in the mid-1960s would \nname him at the millennium, the Alaskan of the Century.\n  The people of my State of Maine are especially grateful to Senator \nStevens for his landmark legislation that bears his name--the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act our Nation's \nindispensable fisheries act, which was reauthorized this past January \nand signed into law. First as the chair, and now the ranking member on \nthe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nsubcommittee handling fisheries issues, I had the pleasure of working \nwith full committee chairman and now ranking member Stevens throughout \nthe process to help bring this bill to fruition. From the 300 year-old \nfishing villages in downeast Maine to remote Aleutian Island outposts, \nSenator Stevens has always been bound by a commitment to sustain both \nfish and fishermen.\n  Through many Congresses, as both a chairman and ranking member, \nSenator Stevens has spearheaded and done much to shepherd improvements \nin the largely uncharted world of telecommunications policy that have \nbeen historic and consequential, and which will reverberate for \ngenerations. On a personal note, I want to express my debt of enormous \nthanks to Senator Stevens for his pivotal support in his Universal \nService Fund Reform bill of the E-rate program which provides \ndiscounted telecommunications services to schools and libraries. \nSenator Stevens has been a bulwark catalyst on this initiative, and, as \nwe recently commemorated the 10th anniversary since its inception, I \ncouldn't help but recall with gratitude his crucial role in the wiring \nschools in my State and across the country.\n  It must also be noted that in an era of increasing partisanship, \nSenator Stevens shares an unassailable bond with the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, a Democrat, Daniel Inouye a friendship, profoundly steeped \nin their mutual, heroic tours of duty in World War II, which continues \nto this day as a model example of collegiality, bipartisanship, and \ncomity that transcends politics.\n  This decorated Army Air Forces pilot in the storied ``Flying \nTigers,'' whose immense devotion to this land and its people extends \nacross six decades, is not one to move to the side or step away when he \nis fighting for what he believes in or on behalf of his State or in \ndefense of his country. That speaks volumes in explaining Senator \nStevens' well-known trademark as he prepares to debate on the Senate \nfloor and\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nhe dons his infamous tie emblazoned with the Marvel comic book \ncharacter, The Incredible Hulk!\n  With hallmark humor, strength, and aplomb, how could he approach his \nrobust role any differently--a man whose larger-than-life tenure in the \npublic arena reflects the enormity of his stunning and beloved Alaska, \na State with a name that means literally ``the object towards which the \naction of the sea is directed.'' For more than half century, the action \nof the sea of public policy has always found its way to this great \nAmerican and still does because he welcomes it, thrives on it, and \nseizes upon it in the name of The Last Frontier State and to the \nbenefit of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6829-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6829-S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that the Senate \nmay not consider the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National \nGovernment Act,'' the OPEN Government Act, S. 849, before it adjourns \nfor the Memorial Day recess. The Judiciary Committee favorably reported \nthis bipartisan bill. We have filed a committee report on this \nimportant legislation. Regrettably, an anonymous Republican hold is \nstalling this important Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, legislation, \nneedlessly delaying long-overdue reforms to strengthen FOIA and to \nprotect the public's right to know.\n  It is both unfortunate and ironic that this bipartisan bill, which \npromotes sunshine and openness in our government, is being hindered by \na secret and anonymous hold. This is a good government bill that \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, can and should work together to enact. \nI hope that the Senator placing the secret hold on this bill will come \nforward, so that we can resolve any legitimate concerns, and the full \nSenate can promptly act on this legislation.\n  The OPEN Government Act is cosponsored by 10 Senators from both sides \nof the aisle. This bill is also endorsed by more than 100 business, \npublic interest, and news organizations from across the political and \nideological spectrum, including, the American Library Association, \nConservation Congress, the Liberty Coalition, OpenTheGovernment.org, \nthe Sunshine in Government Initiative, the Republican Liberty Caucus \nand Public Citizen.\n  I thank all of the cosponsors of this bill and commend Senator Cornyn \nas our lead Republican sponsor. I also thank the many open government \norganizations that are working tirelessly to encourage the Congress to \nenact this bill this year. This measure is cleared for passage on the \nDemocratic side. It should be passed without further delay.\n  The OPEN Government Act promotes and enhances public disclosure of \ngovernment information under FOIA, by helping Americans to obtain \ntimely responses to their FOIA requests and improving transparency in \nthe Federal Government's FOIA process. During the recent hearing that \nthe Judiciary Committee held on this legislation, we learned that, \nalthough FOIA remains an indispensable tool in shedding light on bad \npolicies and government abuses, this open government law is being \nhampered by excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance. Today, Americans \nwho seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than \nduring any other time in FOIA's 40-year history. This bill would help \nto reverse this trend and to restore the public's trust in their \ngovernment.\n  Senator Cornyn and I both know that open government is not a \nDemocratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American issue. It is \nin this spirit that I urge the removal of the anonymous hold placed on \nthis bill. I also urge all Members of the Senate to join me in \nsupporting this important open government legislation.\n  We have received numerous letters of support from such organizations \nas the American Library Association, the National Press Club, Pubic \nCitizen, Sunshine in Government Initiative and OpenTheGovernment.org. I \nask unanimous consent that a letter in support sent to the majority and \nRepublican leaders of the Senate and endorsed by more than 100 \norganizations from across the political spectrum be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n      Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: We write on behalf \n     of the undersigned group of 100 business, public interest, \n     and historical groups and associations to endorse the OPEN \n     Government Act of 2007 (S. 849), as introduced by Senator \n     Patrick Leahy and Senator John Cornyn.\n       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is the public's most \n     significant tool for ensuring integrity and accountability \n     from the federal government. Unfortunately, FOIA's promise of \n     ensuring an open and accountable government has been \n     seriously undermined by the excessive processing delays that \n     FOIA requesters face across the government. The OPEN \n     Government Act would: Close loopholes in FOIA; Help the \n     public get timely responses to FOIA requests; and Improve \n     agency accountability and require better management of FOIA \n     programs.\n       The public's confidence in the executive branch has reached \n     a dramatic low point. The OPEN Government Act of 2007 would \n     demonstrate bipartisan congressional leadership to restore \n     public faith in government and to advance the ideals of \n     openness that our democracy embodies. The Senate Judiciary \n     Committee has reported favorably upon the bill without any \n     amendments.

Mr. President, last week the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives voted to adopt a budget resolution for the upcoming \nfiscal year. I was proud to support this budget, which, in my view, \nrepresents an important first step towards returning our nation to a \nhealthy and strong fiscal and economic course. Like the budget of any \nfamily or business, the federal budget provides a framework for \nresponsibly meeting our nation's most important priorities while \nensuring that we are living within our means. This year's budget \nrestores much-needed fiscal discipline while better targeting our \nresources towards the investments that will best promote economic \ngrowth, national security, and broad-based opportunity.\n  First, the budget resolution reinstates pay-as-you-go rules, which \nrequire that any new spending or tax cuts be paid for with spending \ncuts or new sources of revenue--rather than simply adding the cost to \nthe national debt for our children and grandchildren to repay with \ninterest. These rules played a major role in helping us to achieve \nFederal budget surpluses in the late 1990s. The resolution also puts a \nstop to procedural abuses that had been used by the previous leadership \nin the Congress, notably the use of budget reconciliation protections--\ndesigned for legislation that reduces the deficit--to ram through \npassage of budget-busting tax bills. These procedural improvements, \ncombined with reasonable and responsible spending limits and revenue \ntargets, provide for much-improved--and much-needed fiscal discipline \non both the spending and revenue sides of the ledger.\n  In the 1990s, we saw how responsible budget policies and economic \ngrowth reinforced each other in a cycle that lifted Americans' standard \nof living across the board. Under the current administration, by \ncontrast, Americans have seen the opposite effect, as irresponsible and \npoorly targeted fiscal policies have squandered the previous decade's \nfiscal gains while economic growth has accrued more and more narrowly \nto a smaller segment of the population. The Federal budget has declined \nfrom a surplus of $236 billion in 2000 to a deficit of $248 billion \nlast year, while the national debt has grown from $5.6 trillion to $8.8 \ntrillion. Over the same period, real median household income in our \ncountry has fallen by nearly $1,300.\n  Within the context of fiscal responsibility, the budget adopted last \nweek puts in place a framework for restoring the investments necessary \nfor broad-based economic growth and a return to budget surpluses. \nRather than leaving middle-class families behind, it focuses on \nstrengthening the middle class--the backbone of our economy.\n  This begins with promoting an agenda of innovation and \nentrepreneurship. The President's budget this year--for the second \nconsecutive year--proposed the largest cut to education in the history \nof the Department of Education, along with cuts to research and \ndevelopment and technology transfer. It would be hard to find a worse \nidea than to cut the investments that allow our children to fulfill \ntheir maximum potential and drive our nation's economic growth now and \nin the future. This budget rejects the president's cuts, providing an \nadditional $6.3 billion for education from preschool to graduate \nschool. As I have said numerous times before, we can be confident that \nthe investment we make here will be returned to us many times over.\n  This year's budget also directs more resources towards improving \nheath care quality and coverage, and reducing cost--an issue that \naffects every American family and businesses' bottom line. The \nresolution includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to help cover \nuninsured children and funds for health information technology and \ncomparative effectiveness to help reduce skyrocketing costs.\n  Just as importantly, with our military being stretched to its limits, \nthe budget includes full funding for restoring force readiness and \nadequately equipping our military personnel serving in harm's way. It \nalso includes $3.6 billion above the Bush administration's budget to \naddress the needs of veterans when they return home, because the brave \nAmericans who have served our country deserve much better than the \nconditions that were revealed in the recent Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter scandal.\n  The priorities laid out in the budget adopted last week contrast \nsharply with the agendas of recent years. Where the Bush administration \nand previous leadership in the Congress sacrificed all else at the \naltar of high-income tax cuts, this year's budget will keep taxes low \nwhile restoring the importance of education, health care, clean and \nrenewable energy, and the needs of our military. This change is a \nwelcome development that puts our Nation on a better, stronger, more \nprosperous, and more secure course for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6830-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AGING REPORT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to present to the Senate \nreport No. 110-71, titled ``Economic Developments in Aging,'' as \ncompiled by the Senate Special Committee on Aging for the 109th \nCongress. The Special Committee on Aging is required to report to the \nSenate at least once a Congress on findings from the work done by the \ncommittee. This report contains valuable insight uncovered by the \ncommittee over the past 10 years on the subject of the economics of \nretirement.\n  The Aging Committee has a long and distinguished history of \ninvestigating and debating issues of importance to America's aging \npopulation. Along with robust deliberations on retirement security, the \ncommittee also has initiated discussions on ways to strengthen Medicare \nand Medicaid, and to expose companies that prey upon seniors using \nfraudulent marketing scams. I was proud to serve as chairman of this \ncommittee in the 109th Congress, when we began the process of compiling \nthis report, and am pleased to continue my service as ranking member of \nthe committee in the 110th Congress.\n  The Aging Committee is tasked with a significant challenge to ensure \nthat we, as a nation, are prepared for the significant demographic \nshift with the aging of our population. In a few short years, a vast \nwave of Americans will begin to retire. In fact, between 2010 and 2030, \nthe number of people age 65 and older is projected to increase by 76 \npercent. This change will impact a wide range of social and economic \nissues, such as labor shortages, loss of experienced workers many of \nwhom have skills that simply are not replaceable--and put a significant \nstrain on the senior entitlement programs of Social Security, Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  To keep pace with the growing aging population, it is critical that \nCongress address these issues in a thoughtful manner that preserves \nbenefits for those in need. The report compiles relevant high-level \nsummaries of committee hearings related to retirement security that \ndemonstrate the ongoing debate within Congress regarding the best \napproach to address these important issues.\n  I look forward to continuing a healthy debate on ways to best prepare \nfor the challenges that await us with our aging nation. I hope this \nreport provides valuable insight as we continue these discussions \nthroughout this Congress.\n  I thank all the members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging from \nthe past 10 years for their participation in these vital discussions. I \nespecially want to thank the committee's current chairman, Senator Herb \nKohl, as well as the committee's past chairmen for their dedication to \nensuring a positive future for America's seniors.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6831-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n                             DEATH PENALTY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article \nentitled ``Remembering Victims Key to Death Penalty, Executing Justice: \nArizona's Moral Dilemma,'' by Steve Twist, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemembering Victims Key to Death Penalty--Executing Justice: Arizona's \n                             Moral Dilemma\n\n                     (By Steve Twist, May 20, 2007)\n\n       Opponents of the death penalty rarely want to talk about \n     the crimes of those sentenced to death. One commentator has \n     observed that this is ``a bit like playing Hamlet without the \n     ghost, reviewing the merits of capital punishment without \n     revealing just what a capital crime is really like and how \n     the victims have been brutalized.''\n       In the week ahead, the public will be riveted with news of \n     Robert Comer: his life, his struggles and his legal battles \n     borne by others to the very end. But what of his victims?\n       Let us hope, in the end, the law will speak for them. And \n     let us hope that those who excuse or minimize his crimes will \n     listen, if only for even a brief moment or so, to what Judge \n     Alex Kozinsky has rightly called ``the tortured voices of the \n     victims crying out for justice.'' It is in those voices that \n     we understand the morality of the death penalty, even when \n     they are raised in opposition, as they sometimes, albeit \n     rarely, are.\n       There are 112 murderers on Arizona's death row. Robert \n     Comer is one of them, having been sentenced to death almost \n     20 years ago, April 11, 1988.\n       The Department of Corrections reports, ``(O)n Feb. 23, \n     1987, Comer and his girlfriend . . . were at a campground \n     near Apache Lake. They invited Larry Pritchard, who was at \n     the campsite next to theirs, to have dinner and drinks with \n     them. Around 9 p.m., Comer shot Pritchard in the head, \n     killing him. \n     He . . . then stole Pritchard's belongings. Around 11 p.m., \n     Comer and (Juneva) Willis went to a campsite occupied by \n     Richard Brough and Tracy Andrews. Comer stole their property, \n     hogtied Brough to a car fender and then raped Andrews in \n     front of Brough. Comer and Willis then left the area, taking \n     Andrews with them but leaving Brough behind. Andrews escaped \n     the next morning and ran for 23 hours before finding help.'' \n     .\n       Donald Beaty is another. ``On the evening of May 9, 1984, \n     Christy Ann Fornoff, a 13-year-old news carrier, was \n     collecting from her customers at the Rockpoint Apartments in \n     Tempe. Beaty, who was the apartment custodian, abducted \n     Christy and sexually assaulted and suffocated her in his \n     apartment. Beaty kept the body in his apartment until the \n     morning of May 11, 1984, when he placed it behind the \n     apartment complex's trash dumpster.''\n       Richard Bible is another. ``On June 6, 1988, around 10:30 \n     a.m., 9-year-old Jennifer Wilson was riding her bike on a \n     Forest Service road in Flagstaff. Bible drove by in a truck, \n     forced her off her bike and abducted her. He took Jennifer to \n     a hill near his home where he sexually assaulted her. He then \n     killed her hitting her in the face and head with a blunt \n     instrument. Bible concealed the body and left the area. He \n     was arrested later that day. Jennifer's body was not found \n     until June 25, 1988.''\n       Shawn Grell is yet another. ``On Dec. 2, 1999, Grell took \n     his 2-year-old daughter, Kristen, to a remote area in Apache \n     Junction, doused her with gasoline and set her on fire. After \n     Kristen was engulfed in flames, she managed to walk around \n     and stomp her feet for up to 60 seconds before collapsing in \n     the dirt. Kristen (died suffering) third- and fourth-degree \n     burns over 98 percent of her body.''\n       And there are so many more. Repeating them is hard. \n     Thinking about the victims and their loved ones, left to \n     grieve, is heartbreaking. But think about them we must if we \n     are to truly understand the context of the death penalty \n     debate.\n       Those who agitate to abolish the death penalty for these \n     killers say the killers don't deserve to die because no crime \n     justifies death.\n       These arguments continue to find disfavor with large \n     portions of the public. Gallup consistently reports support \n     for the death penalty by wide margins (67 percent in favor, \n     28 percent opposed: 2006) when the question is asked in a \n     straightforward manner. When the question is asked whether \n     death or life imprisonment is the ``better'' penalty, 48 \n     percent choose life and 47 percent death. Yet, when the facts \n     of a case are cited, support for the death penalty grows \n     dramatically. Even among those who said they opposed the \n     death penalty, more than half of those supported the \n     execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.\n       Another issue the abolitionists like to avoid is \n     deterrence, which is of two kinds, specific and general. \n     Specific deterrence is the measure of the penalty's \n     effectiveness in deterring the sentenced murderer from ever \n     killing again.\n       General deterrence is the effect of the penalty on \n     deterring others from committing murder. Most recently, \n     Professor Paul Rubin of Emory University and his colleagues \n     have reported the results of the most extensive econometric \n     study of death penalty deterrence and concluded that every \n     execution saves on average 18 lives because of the murders \n     that are deterred. Rubin's results have been replicated by \n     others.\n       This is such an ``inconvenient truth'' for the \n     abolitionists that they prefer to ignore it. Professing to \n     revere life so dearly as to oppose even the taking of \n     depraved life, they nonetheless seem to care little that \n     their advocacy would result, if successful, in the slaughter \n     of more innocents.\n       This week, when the news is filled with Robert Comer, let \n     us pause to remember Larry Pritchard, Richard Brough and \n     Tracy Andrews. And let us remember also Christy Anne Fornoff, \n     Jennifer Wilson and, dear God, let us remember little Kristen \n     Grell and all the other victims.\n       In those memories, let us offer prayers for their families \n     and a steady, steel-eyed resolve that we will value their \n     innocent lives so dearly that we are willing to exact the \n     ultimate punishment for their murders, in order that we might \n     preserve justice and protect others from becoming victims. In \n     the wake of these decades-long delays to justice, let us \n     finally resolve to demand of our courts that they become more \n     respectful of the victims' constitutional rights to a \n     ``prompt and final conclusion of the case.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6831-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               Lance Corporal Christopher S. Adlesperger\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, each year, our Nation observes a holiday \nto honor the brave men and women who have given their lives in service \nto this country. New Mexicans have a strong tradition of serving in the \nArmed Forces, and sadly a great many have given their lives in defense \nof our Nation. Americans from every state and all generations have \nserved bravely and on Memorial Day we remember their sacrifice.\n  It is with particular poignancy that this Memorial Day, we reflect on \nthe sacrifice so many New Mexicans have made while serving in Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. I hope New Mexicans will \nthink of these individuals and their families and on this Memorial Day \nI would like to share one of their stories, that of Marine Corps LCpl \nChristopher S. Adlesperger of Albuquerque.\n  In late 2004, Lance Corporal Adlesperger, and his unit were deployed \nin Fallujah and involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. \nOn one particular mission, Adlesperger and his squad were ordered to \nstorm an insurgent-occupied building. While moving forward \nAdlesperger's squad began to receive heavy insurgent fire and several \nmembers of his squad were wounded and the rest were pinned down. \nAdlesperger took action and secured a path for the injured marines to \nbe evacuated. Despite the fact that he was also wounded, Adlesperger \ncontinued the assault on the building. Adlesperger is credited with \neliminating several insurgents and playing a pivotal role in the \nsuccessful assault.\n  Tragically, 1 month later, 20-year-old Christopher Adlesperger, was \nfatally shot while on patrol in the Anbar province west of Bahgdad.\n  This brave young soldier was one of the first New Mexicans to give \nhis life in the Iraq war and on April 13, 2007, Adlesperger was \nposthumously awarded the Navy Cross for valor.\n  Today, as we honor all the brave men and women who have fought and \ngiven their lives to defend this Nation throughout its history, I hope \nNew Mexicans will also pray for the safe return of those still serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6831-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6831-S6832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SAFETY OF AVANDIA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the last few days there have been \ncountless articles about the popular diabetes drug Avandia. For me, \nsome of the most important questions that need to be answered here are \nwhat did FDA know, when did it know it, and what did it do with the \ninformation.\n  Since The New England Journal of Medicine first reported on a new \nstudy by Cleveland Clinic Cardiologist Dr. Steven Nissen, my \ninvestigative staff has continued to gather information about both FDA \nand the drugmaker.\n  We are hearing a lot about what's called the ``RECORD'' study, which \nwas requested by the Europeans. There was talk at the FDA, before this \nweek's stories started appearing, that the agency wanted to wait for \nthat study to be completed before it made a decision about whether or \nnot to say anything about Avandia and the possible increased risk in \nheart attacks. Believe it or not, FDA officials have confirmed for my \ninvestigators this week that the\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n``RECORD'' study is not expected to be completed for 2 more years--\nuntil the summer of 2009. That's a long time from now when you have \nmillions of American's taking this drug.\n  Second, there is something I would like to clarify. We have been \nreading this week that the FDA was not in a position to tell the \nAmerican people about its concerns with Avandia because it needed \n``conclusive'' information. That doesn't make sense to me. The \npreliminary findings of the FDA's ongoing ``meta-analysis'' of the \nAvandia clinical trials have been consistent with Dr. Nissen's findings \nof an increased heart attack risk, as well as the drug maker's \nfindings. It goes like this: the drugmaker sees a 31-percent increased \nrisk of a heart attack; the FDA sees a 40-percent increased risk for \nheart attacks; and Dr. Nissen sees a 43-percent increased risk for \nheart attacks. Those numbers seem like a high enough threshold to me \nfor the FDA to warn the American people of the possibility of a \nproblem.\n  Third, several months ago, the Division of Drug Risk Evaluation, \nwhich sits within the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, \nrecommended a ``boxed'' warning for Avandia. Why? Because it was \nbelieved that Avandia increased the risk of heart attacks. To date, FDA \nhas not acted on upon this recommendation.\n  In a statement I released on Tuesday, I also pointed out that about a \nyear ago some FDA scientists recommended a black box warning for \ncongestive heart failure. There is still no black box warning for \ncongestive heart failure, and I understand that happened because the \noffice that put Avandia on the market in the first place wanted to look \ninto it further. America is still waiting for a decision.\n  It was also reported to me that the incidence of heart attacks with \nAvandia could be about 60,000 to 100,000 from 1999 to 2006. That is a \nlot. Just doing the math and using conservative numbers, that means \nabout 20 or more unnecessary heart attacks a day.\n  At a minimum, I think that the office responsible for post marketing \nsafety needs to have the ability to warn Americans when it thinks it \nneeds to do so. If not, we have what we have here today, delays in \ntelling the American people about a possible serious safety problem. It \nis not right, and I am going to keep working to change things once and \nfor all. The FDA legislation passed by the Senate two weeks ago dropped \nthe ball on this important reform. The Avandia case sets it up for the \nHouse of Representatives to give real clout to the FDA office that \nmonitors and assesses drugs after they are on the market and taken by \nmillions of people. If the Office of New Drugs continues to call all \nthe shots, like it does today, then it is more status quo and less \npublic safety from the FDA. Both the evidence and the experts \nunderscore the need for real reform here.\n  One opportunity to improve upon postmarketing drug safety stems from \nthe Access to Medicare Data Act that I filed today with Senator Baucus. \nThis bill is based on S. 3897, the Medicare Data Access and Research \nAct, which Senator Baucus and I introduced in the 109th Congress. The \npurpose of the bill is to provide federal health agencies and outside \nresearchers more sources of data for examining adverse events so that \nserious safety questions are identified promptly and timely action can \nbe taken to protect American consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6832-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6832-S6833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE SPOUSES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Tuesday, May 22 was a memorable day in the \nlife of the U.S. Senate. In keeping with longstanding tradition, each \nyear, Senate spouses gather to give a luncheon in honor of the First \nLady of the United States of America.\n  Last year, Landra Reid served as Chairman and Jeanne Warner served as \nco-chairman. The theme was a unique one, entitled, ``100 Dresses.'' \nThis year, Jeanne Warner became Chairman, Grace Nelson became co-\nchairman and Landra Reid, together with over 20 Senate spouses, \norganized another highly successful and enjoyable luncheon. This year's \nevent, entitled ``Heartfelt Safari,'' focused on the President and Mrs. \nBush's initiative to help alleviate the plight of malaria in Africa. \nThe number of deaths this year from malaria could be as high as two \nmillion, largely among children in Africa. Part of the proceeds from \nthe luncheon will be donated to a well-respected not-for-profit \ncharity--Malaria No More--that works to alleviate this tragic \nsuffering.\n  In the evening, our two Senate leaders presided over a dinner \nhonoring the Senate spouses. Senator Reid opened with a moving \nframework of remarks, humorously recounting how the esteemed author, \nRalph Waldo Emerson, once spoke for over 2 hours at a Harvard \nUniversity event in the 1830s. He quickly assured the audience he would \nnot seek to match Emerson, and he then proceeded to give a very warm \nintroduction of an honored guest, Placido Domingo. The renowned singer \nregaled the audience with anecdotes about his career and about \nAmerica's growing interest in opera.\n  Senator McConnell concluded the evening, reciting the vital role \nperformed by Senate spouses through the years. His remarks were warmly \nreceived by so many colleagues that I am privileged to offer for the \nRecord, on behalf of all Senators, his thoughts, and I ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Senate Leaders Honoring Spouses--Remarks as Prepared for Leader \n                               McConnell\n\n       A few weeks after marrying Grace Cavert in 1972, Bill \n     Nelso:n and his new bride hit the campaign trail for the \n     first time. Neither of them could have imagined that 35 years \n     later, Bill would be known throughout the halls of power in \n     Washington as the husband of Grace Nelson.\n       Grace is a real sign of contradiction in this town. She \n     believes in bringing people together, across party lines, and \n     she's backed that belief up with deeds. As head of the \n     Spouses of the Senate, she's been a model of how to practice \n     bipartisanship and how to make it work. In retrospect, we \n     probably should have consulted with her on the immigration \n     bill.\n       I happen to know firsthand that Grace and all the other \n     wives are a warm, welcoming group. Because my wife, who \n     happens to be a pretty busy woman in her own right, is a \n     regular at their Tuesday lunches. Elaine appreciates the \n     friendships she's formed there, and she counts on the advice \n     she can get from all of you on matters of vital concern, like \n     where to find a decent electrician.\n       Jeanne Warner, thanks for organizing the First Lady's lunch \n     today and for securing this beautiful garden for tonight's \n     event. To the performers: Joyce Bennett, Barbara Levin, and, \n     of course, our special guest, Placido Domingo, thanks. Thank \n     you for sharing your talented young artists with us tonight.\n       No less a historian than our own Robert Byrd has called the \n     Senate a place of ``resounding deeds.'' But any time one of \n     us writes a memoir, it's always the quiet deeds of a devoted \n     spouse that the senators themselves seem to marvel at the \n     most.\n       Senator Byrd himself can boast more milestones than any \n     other senator in U.S. history. But he'll tell you his \n     proudest achievement, his most resounding deed, was that he \n     married a coal-miner's daughter named Erma and that they \n     stayed together longer than any Senate couple in history.\n       One of Senator Reid's predecessors, Mike Mansfield, was a \n     high-school dropout when his wife Maureen convinced him to go \n     back to school--and then sold her own life insurance policy \n     to pay for it. More than 70 years later, after one of the \n     most distinguished political careers in U.S. history, \n     Mansfield was invited back to the Capitol to receive one last \n     honor. He could have recalled a thousand legislative deals. \n     But when it came his turn to speak, he praised Maureen \n     instead.\n       Here's what he said: ``The real credit for whatever \n     standing I have achieved in life should be given to my wife \n     Maureen. She was and is my inspiration. She gave of herself \n     to make something of me. She made the sacrifices and really \n     deserved the credits, but I was the one who was honored. She \n     has always been the better half of our lives together and \n     without her coaching, her understanding, and her love, I \n     would not be with you tonight. What we did, we did together. \n     In short, I am what I am because of her.''\n       Barry Goldwater was another one who knew where to place the \n     credit. He'd proposed to his future wife Peggy many times \n     before they found themselves in a phone booth on a cold New \n     Year's Eve night in Muncie, Indiana, in 1933. Peggy wanted to \n     call her mother to wish her a Happy New Year, and while they \n     were standing there, Barry said he was running out of \n     quarters and patience. He asked her to marry him one more \n     time, she said yes, and nearly half a century later, Barry \n     Goldwater wrote this postscript to a long and storied career:\n       ``There are many moments of triumph in a man's lifetime \n     which he remembers. I have been to the mountaintop of \n     victory--my first election to the Senate, and my reelection, \n     that night in Chicago, in 1960, when the governor of Arizona \n     put my name in nomination for the office of the President of \n     the United States; and another night in San Francisco when \n     the delegates to the Republican Convention made me their \n     nominee. But above all these I rate that night in Muncie.''\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\n       Ronald Reagan once said there was only one person in the \n     world that could make him lonely just by leaving the room. \n     And we learned earlier this week that Nancy still marvels at \n     her husband's devotion. She shouldn't. Those of us who are \n     fortunate to share this life of highs and lows, of forced \n     smiles and cancelled plans, of bland buffets and late night \n     calls, know we couldn't achieve much at all, much less \n     resounding deeds, without the person sitting next to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6833-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6833-S6834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACCOUNTABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, our country does not have just some of \nthe best colleges and universities in the world. It has almost all of \nthem. Our higher education system is our secret weapon in America's \ncompetition in the world marketplace. It is the cornerstone of the \nbrainpower advantage that last year permitted our country to produce \nthirty percent of the world's wealth, measured by gross domestic \nproduct-- for just 5 percent of the world's people.\n  Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, to her credit, established a \ncommission 2 years ago to examine all aspects of higher education to \nmake certain that we do all we can to preserve excellence in this \nsecret weapon and access to it. Among other things, the commission \ncalled for more accountability in higher education.\n  The commission got the part about accountability right. We in \nCongress have a duty to make certain that the billions we allocate to \nhigher education are spent wisely.\n  Unfortunately, the commission headed in the wrong direction when it \nproposed how to achieve accountability. In its report, and in the \nnegotiated rulemaking process, the Department of Education proposed a \ncomplex system of accountability to tell colleges how to accept \ntransfer students, how to measure what students are learning, and how \ncolleges should accredit themselves.\n  I believe excellence in American higher education comes from \ninstitutional autonomy, markets, competition, choice for students, \nfederalism and limited Federal regulation.\n  The Department is proposing to restrict autonomy, choice, and \ncompetition.\n  Such changes are so fundamental that only Congress should consider \nthem. For that reason, if necessary, I will offer an amendment to the \nHigher Education Act to prohibit the Department from issuing any final \nregulations on these issues until Congress acts. Congress needs to \nlegislate first. Then the Department can regulate.\n  Instead of pursuing this increased Federal regulation, I have \nsuggested to the Secretary a different course.\n  First, convene leaders in higher education--especially those who are \nleading the way with improved methods of accountability and assessment \nand let them know in clear terms that if colleges and universities do \nnot accept more responsibility for assessment and accountability, the \nFederal Government will do it for them.\n  Second, establish an award for accountability in higher education \nlike the Baldrige Award for quality in American business. The Baldrige \nAward, granted by the Department of Commerce, encourages a focus on \nquality in American business. It has been enormously successful, \ncausing hundreds of businesses to change their procedures to compete \nfor the prize. I believe the same kind of award--or awards for \ndifferent kinds of higher education institutions--would produce the \nsame sort of result for accountability in higher education.\n  Finally, make research and development grants to states, \ninstitutions, accreditors and assessment researchers to develop new and \nbetter appropriate measures of accountability.\n  This combination of jawboning, creating a Baldrige-type prized for \naccountability and research and development for better assessment \ntechniques will in, my judgment, do a better and more comprehensive job \nof encouraging accountability in higher education than anything Federal \nregulation can do.\n  If I am wrong, then we in Congress and the U.S. Department of \nEducation can step in and take more aggressive steps.\n  Are there some things wrong with the American higher education \nsystem? Of course.\n  And in my testimony in Nashville last year before the Secretary's \nCommission on the Future of Higher Education I detailed some of them.\n  One is the failure of colleges of education to prepare school leaders \nto raise our k-12 system to the level of our higher education system.\n  Two is the growing political one-sidedness that has infected many \ncampuses. Too often true diversity of thought is discouraged in the \nsame of a preferred brand of diversity.\n  Third, is the rising cost of tuition and large amount of students \ndebt although costs are lower than most Americans realize and the \nreason for the increase is primarily the State failure to fund higher \neducation because of all the money that is being soaked up by rising \nmedicaid costs.\n  Fourth, there is no doubt that colleges and universities are not as \nefficient as they should be. Campuses are too vacant in the summer. \nFaculty teaching loads are too light. And semesters are too short to \njustify the large expenditures.\n  Fifth, no one in Washington takes a coordinated look at the tens of \nbillions of dollars spent for higher education. Secretary Spellings is \nthe first to do this, and I applaud her for it, although I had hoped \nthe result would have been less regulation, not more.\n  Finally, deregulation. There is too much Washington DC, regulation.\n  Instead of debating how many more regulations we need, if we really \nare serious about excellence and opportunity, we should be debating \nwhich regulations we can get rid of.\n  The question is whether you believe that excellence in higher \neducation comes from institutional autonomy, markets, competition, \nchoice for students, federalism and limited Federal regulation or \nwhether you don't.\n  I believe it does. In fact, I have spent most of my public career \narguing that we should borrow these principles from higher education \nwhere we have excellence and try them in k-12 where we too often don't.\n  There is plenty of evidence that America's secret weapon is our \nsystem of colleges and universities. More Americans go to college than \nin any country. Most of the best universities of the world are in our \ncountry, attracting 500,000 of the brightest students from outside \nAmerica--many of whom stay to create more good jobs for Americans.\n  Just a few short weeks ago, after two years of work, the Senate \npassed the America Competes Act. It authorizes investing $62 billion \nover 4 years to help our country keep its brainpower advantage so we \ncan keep jobs from going to India and China.\n  In China, India, in Europe and Latin America countries seeking to \nimprove the incomes of their citizens are seeking to emulate our \ncollege and universities because they know that better schools and \ncolleges mean better jobs. The former Brazilian President, Fernando \nHenrique Cardoso, recently told a group of Senators that the strongest \nmemory of the United States he would take back to his country is the \nAmerican University. ``The uniqueness, strength and autonomy of the \nAmerican university,'' Dr. Cardoso said, ``There is nothing like it in \nthe world.'' ``Autonomy'' is the key word in Dr. Cardoso's response.\n  Deregulating higher education and preserving the autonomy of its \ninstitutions--not more Washington, DC, regulation--is the key to \npreserving the quality of this secret weapon in our effort to keep our \nhigh standard of living.\n  The United States system of higher education is a remarkable system \nof 6,000 autonomous institutions. Some are public, like the University \nof Tennessee of which I was once President. Some are private like \nVanderbilt and New York University, from which I graduated. Some are \nCatholic. Some are Jewish. Some are non profit. Some are for profit. \nSome, like UCLA, are research universities.\n  Some are trade schools like the Nashville Auto Diesel College which \ngraduate 1300 of the best auto mechanics in the world each year. Some \nare 2-year community colleges or technical institutes.\n  Some, like the University of Texas, have 100,000 students. Some, like \nValley College in West Virginia have 34 students.\n  Some like Harvard, have 20,000 applicants for 1,700 freshman places. \nSome,\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nlike University of Phoenix, accept every student who applies. Some \nteach sports management and some teach classics.\n  The largest university is online. In some colleges, most students \ngraduate in four years. In others, most never actually graduate because \nthey are there to learn skills on their way to a new job.\n  The average tuition private school is $22,218, for a public four year \ncollege the average is $5,836, for a public 2-year community college \nthe average is $2,272.\n  More than half the students who attend these 6,000 institutions have \na federal grant or a loan to help them to pay for college.\n  That means that this year taxpayers will spend $13 billion giving 5.2 \nmillion students Federal Pell grants providing up to $4,310 each--which \npays the entire cost of attending many 2 year schools and almost three-\nfourths the cost of a public four year school.\n  Many States and private institutions and individuals provide generous \nadditional scholarships and loans.\n  Mr. President, 56,000 Tennessee students each year receive up to \n$3,800 if they attend a 4-year institution or $1,900 if they attend a \nyear institution.\n  Georgia's HOPE scholarship and grant programs benefit over 200,000 \nGeorgia students a year, giving them grant and scholarship aid to \nattend a college or university.\n  In addition, 14 million students will borrow 66 billion more dollars \nthis year by taking out federal guaranteed loans to help pay for \ncollege.\n  I once asked David Gardner when he was president of the University of \nCalifornia why his institution was one of the world's finest. Without a \nmoment's hesitation he said, ``First, autonomy. Fundamentally the state \nof California gives us the money, then our board decides how to spend \nit. This authority has permitted us to set high standards.'' And then \nhe said, ``We have a large amount of federal and state dollars that \nfollow students to the educational institution of their choice.''\n  So, autonomy, excellence choice--Federal dollars following students \nto the schools of their choice. That is the California formula for \nexcellence. It is the American formula for excellence since the GI bill \nfor Veterans was enacted in 1944, and veterans were given the \nopportunity to attend the college of their choice.\n  Congress could have given the dollars to institutions. Instead, it \ncreated this marketplace and fueled it even further with the addition \nof Pell grants and loans--all following students to the institution of \ntheir choice.\n  Who, then, is the regulator of this marketplace?\n  Well, first, the marketplace itself. Students armed with scholarship \ndollars may choose or reject courses and colleges. Colleges must \ncompete to attract faculty. Most Federal grants are awarded \ncompetitively after review by peers. Such competition and choice has \npermitted both excellence and a breadth responding quickly to a \nchanging world that a more highly regulated system never would have. \nFor example, the fastest growing institutions are 2-year colleges and \nfor-profit institutions--the institutions in the closest touch with the \nrapidly changing global workplace.\n  The second regulator is the Federal Government. This stack of \nregulations I have here represent the 7,000--yes, 7,000 regulations--\nthat each one of the 6,000 colleges and universities who accept federal \naid must deal with in order to accept students with Federal grants or \nloans.\n  The president of Stanford has estimated it costs 7 cents of every \ntuition dollar just to deal with federal regulations and loans. \nUniversities have compliance officers and divisions to keep track of \nregulations from almost every Cabinet agency in Washington.\n  Then there are the State regulators. The Governor is chairman of the \nboard of all Tennessee public universities. Of course, the State \nlegislature has its say when it passes budget funding public \nuniversities. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission reviews \nbudgets, duplicitous programs and standards--and it also has some rules \nfor private universities.\n  Fundamentally the autonomous college or university regulates itself. \nAs president of the University of Tennessee system of institutions, I \nhad overall responsibility for admissions and standards of quality for \nfaculty and students established by the board of trustees to which I \nreported. A chancellor supervised each campus. The faculty senate on \neach campus played a major role.\n  Then there is also the self-accreditation system--an elaborate, time \nconsuming review of programs in each department for the purpose of \ndetermining whether that department held true to its mission and its \nlevel of quality.\n  With these multiple layers of regulation, higher education needs \nless, not more regulation from Washington, DC. In fact, I believe the \ngreatest threat to excellence of higher education is overregulation, \nnot underfunding.\n  Not long ago, the president of the North Carolina higher education \nsystem--Erskine Bowles--visited me along with several of his presidents \nof public and private institutions. That system has for years been one \nof the Nation's best. Their message was, ``Of course accountability is \nimportant. We believe in it. But we are the ones to do it and we are \ndoing it.''\n  The best way for Congress to assure the quality of higher education \nis to determine that State regulators and accrediting agencies are \ndoing their jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6834-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6834-S6835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF BARBARA L. MILES\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Barbara Miles, a specialist in financial \ninstitutions retired from the Government and Finance Division of the \nCongressional Research Service, CRS, at the Library of Congress on May \n3, 2007. Including 32 years at CRS and her six years in the executive \nbranch as an economist and econometrician at the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis in the Department of Commerce, Ms. Miles devoted 38 years of \nservice to the American people. CRS and the Congress lost an \nexceptionally able and dedicated public servant with her departure.\n  A native of California, Ms. Miles earned a bachelor's degree in \neconomics from Occidental College in Los Angeles and a master of \neconomics degree from the University of Washington at Seattle. She \nbegan her CRS service in July 1975, as an economist. She was \nsuccessively promoted throughout her career, attaining the position of \nSpecialist in Housing in 1979, and that of Specialist in Financial \nInstitutions in 1995.\n  Ms. Miles' research was in the general area of housing. She is an \nexpert in a range of housing-related policy issues such as the housing \nindustry and finance, housing supply and prices, housing demand, \nmortgage interest rates and affordability, and federal policies toward \nhome ownership. Ms. Miles provided close support to numerous members of \nCongress and their staff, in the form of analysis, confidential memos, \nand reports during the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s. She \nworked closely with Congress as it drafted the Financial Institutions \nReform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 that established the \nResolution Trust Corporation, which liquidated the assets of insolvent \nsavings and loans, and reimbursed depositors and other creditors.\n  As her career developed, Ms. Miles also devoted her talents to the \nstudy of and analysis of public policy concerning government sponsored \nenterprises, or GSEs, which are stockholder-owned companies whose \nCongressional charters call on them to support the secondary mortgage \nmarket, especially lower income groups and geographic areas not well \nserved by lenders. She provided ever more insightful and detailed \nreports on the costs, benefits, and risks of various GSEs, advising \nCongress on the impact of the GSEs on different sectors of the housing \nmarket in particular, as well as on the nation's economy in general. \nThrough regular and ever expanding contacts, she helped to familiarize \nmembers and staff with the role of Congress in policy options and \noversight of the GSEs. She provided regular analyses of options for \nlegislation and oversight. Her work included in-person briefings, \ntelephone briefings, lectures, seminars, reports, confidential and \ngeneral distribution memoranda, and CRS reports for Congress. She \ntestified before Congress on\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nmany occasions. All of her work in the area of GSE-related oversight \nand legislation by Congress demonstrated an extremely detailed \nunderstanding of the complex, significant policy issues surrounding \nthese institutions and their operations. Her insights and perspective \nwere plain, and understandable; the clarity and rigor of her analyses \nwon praise from members and commendations at CRS.\n  In 2000, Ms. Miles assumed the position of Section Head of the \nBanking, Securities, Insurance, and Macroeconomics Section within the \nCRS Government and Finance Division. For the next five years she \nsupervised eight to ten economists, ranging from experienced veterans \nto newly-appointed staff hired from the private sector, other \ngovernment agencies, and from distinguished graduate programs. She was \ngenerous with her time and offered constructive advice working with \nstaff through multiple revisions to produce the most useful products \nfor members and staff. She challenged veteran staff to think and write \nin new ways to better serve Congress.\n\n  She emphasized the need for economists to write clearly and to \nconnect the micro economic foundations of financial markets to macro \neconomic policy to best assist Congress in its duties of scrutiny, \noversight, and legislation. Ms. Miles' own broad expertise and depth of \nexperience in her section's wide-ranging policy responsibilities \nprovided her with unique tools during her period as a section manager \nin CRS. She conducted knowledgeable oversight of section written \nmaterials and was regarded by her staff and management as a skilled \nreviewer whose insistence on the highest standards was matched by her \nability as a mentor and educator. She constantly worked with her staff \nto improve the precision and clarity of their writing and to produce \naccurate, balanced and insightful analysis of the issues of the day in \na timely manner. Ms. Miles led her section to new levels of \nintellectual excellence and dedicated service to Congress, while \ngaining the unquestioned respect and genuine affection of her staff.\n  Ms. Miles was an invaluable resource in many ways that did not always \nattract notice. Throughout the course of her career, other analysts \nfrequently consulted with her for her subject matter and economic \nexpertise. She tirelessly peer-reviewed papers. Ms. Miles managed a \nlong-running CRS cooperative ``Capstone'' project, initiated with \nstudents and faculty of the University of Texas, that examined \ncorporate governance policy issues and questions for Congress. She \ninitiated and nurtured a popular ``Brown Bag Luncheon'' series of \nlecture-discussions on policy issues. She selected topics and used her \nwide contacts to arrange for speakers for a program that has covered a \nvery broad range of issues, and continues to draw standing-room-only \naudiences. Ms. Miles was honored by her colleagues when they elected \nher president of the Congressional Research Employee Association.\n  CRS management recognized Ms. Miles for achieving and exceeding the \norganizational goals established for her section, leading her staff to \nnew levels of excellence that could not have been attained without her \nsteady and inspired guidance. Her mastery of technical skills, her \nunderstanding of and commitment to the mission and goals of the \nCongressional Research Service, coupled with her ability to communicate \nthese to her staff, helped lead her section to significantly improved \norganizational performance.\n  After stepping down as section head in 2005, Ms. Miles continued to \nmentor new staff. In stepping down, she planned to spend more time \nanalyzing and writing about government-sponsored enterprises, housing \nissues, and financial services. She also took on the role of division \nreviewer to ensure that all products met the highest CRS standards.\n  Ms. Miles won numerous awards and praise from members during her 32 \nyears at CRS. In 1995, a Senator praised one of her products for \n``explaining that the debate between the direct lending and the \nguaranteed loan program is fundamentally a debate over political \nphilosophy and not a debate over economics. . . . It is important to \nkeep in mind that these economists at the Congressional Research \nService are not individuals who work for the Republican Party, nor are \nthey individuals who have some hidden agenda, who have some connection \nto the banks or the guaranty agencies. They are simply economists who \nwork for the Congressional Research Service and provide us with \nobjective, nonpartisan analyses of the programs that Congress \ndevelops.'' In 1998, two Senators and a Representative praised her work \non the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.\n  She wrote numerous concise and complete reports for CRS. She also \ncontributed to the Joint Economic Committee's Demographic Change and \nthe Economy of the Nineties with ``Demography and Housing in the \n1990s,'' which turned out to be a classic work on housing.\n  Ms. Miles also testified before Congressional committees numerous \ntimes on housing and mortgage issues. The members of the House \nCommittee on Financial Services and the House Committee on the Budget \nwere the most frequent beneficiaries of her insights and wisdom.\n  In 1993, she received a CRS special achievement award for \n``extraordinary contributions to debate over the student loan program \nincluding the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.'' In 2000, \n2001, 2002, and 2004 she received incentive awards for sustained high \nperformance. In 2001 and 2002 she received honorary superior service \nawards. Upon her retirement, Ms. Miles received a meritorious service \naward.\n  Ms. Miles was active in professional associations, conferences and \nmeetings. She participated in conferences sponsored by the Chicago \nFederal Home Loan Bank, the Chicago Federal Reserve, the American \nEconomics Association, the American Real Estate and Urban Economics \nAssociation, and Women in Housing and Finance. In her private life, Ms. \nMiles remains an avid bicycle rider who has raced competitively. One of \nher goals after retirement is to ride a ``century'' or 100 miles. She \nis also an active member of the Episcopal Church, in which she served \nwith distinction on the Diocesan Council Episcopal of the Episcopal \nDiocese of Washington.\n  For the 32 years of her career at CRS--and her six years of previous \nfederal service--Ms. Miles won the respect, admiration, and thanks of \nher colleagues. Her steadfast dedication to service to Congress and the \nnation and her commitment to the highest standards of unbiased and \ntimely response to Congressional requests for information have made a \npositive and lasting contribution.\n  On behalf of the members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs, Senator Shelby and I express our deep appreciation \nto Ms. Miles for her many years of dedicated public service and wish \nher well as she goes on to other endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6835-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6835-S6836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HONORING KATHLEEN MCNAMARA\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I believe deeply that the well-being \nof our society depends on the contributions of committed individuals. \nWith that belief in mind, today I pay tribute to an individual who has \ngiven much to many, most especially to veterans in my home State of \nHawaii, Dr. Kathleen McNamara.\n  Dr. McNamara is a psychologist who has spent 18 years working full \ntime for veterans, with most of that time spent in Hawaii. Her full \ncareer spans longer than that, and includes impressive service across a \nrange of issues in psychology. Recently, the American Psychological \nAssociation presented Dr. McNamara with a Presidential Citation in \nrecognition of the more than 30 years she has dedicated to the American \npeople, including veterans. Dr. McNamara has served on many of the \nAPA's volunteer boards, including their board of directors.\n  I have interacted with Dr. McNamara both in her role as psychologist \nand in her work with the veterans' community. I have found her to be \nthorough and of strong conviction.\n  I recall a witness who was testifying at a January 2006 hearing of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs. This witness was speaking on behalf \nof veterans from the Hawaiian island of Molokai, where it can take over \n3 months to get an appointment with a visiting VA psychologist. This \nwitness told the committee about Dr. McNamara, who routinely travels to \nMolokai from a neighboring island. He called Dr. McNamara\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nthe ``Mother Theresa for the veterans,'' and noted that Molokai needed \nmore psychologists, because the demand to see Dr. McNamara was just so \ngreat.\n  I humbly offer Dr. McNamara my gratitude for what she has done for \nveterans, for Hawaii, and for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6836-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO TERESA KIRKEENG-KINCAID\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Teresa \nKirkeeng-Kincaid, a remarkable civil servant who dedicated her entire \ncareer to making her community, the Upper Mississippi River Region and \nour Nation a better place. Teresa passed away last week at the young \nage of 48, after a courageous battle against cancer. Her legacy, \nhowever, will continue long into the future. Teresa dedicated her \nentire professional life to working for the Federal Government. Teresa \njoined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a civil engineer with the \nRock Island District in 1981, and continued with the Corps for 26 \nyears. In that time, she served in many roles, including assistant \nchief of the planning, program and project management division.\n  During her two and a half decades of service, Teresa earned a \nreputation on the Upper Mississippi Region and across the Nation as a \nperson of great dedication and integrity. She played a leadership role \nin important projects including formulating navigation, flood damage, \nand ecosystem restoration projects throughout the entire Upper \nMississippi River basin. She was the ``go to person'' throughout the \nCorps of Engineers on numerous planning issues. The team she led \nreestablished the Corps' Planning Associates program to train future \nplanners for the Corps, a legacy that will last for many decades.\n  I had the occasion to meet Teresa several times, and know the very \nhigh regard in which she was held by her coworkers, her countless \nfriends, and her loving family.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \ncongratulate Monroe City, MO, on the 150th Anniversary of its founding.\n  Monroe City has had a long and proud history. The city was founded on \nJuly 4, 1857, by E.B. Talcott and John Duff at a picnic where town lots \nwere sold. In 1869 Monroe City became an incorporated town, owing its \nexistence to the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad and the Wabash \nRailroad. Due to the drive of the community's many entrepreneurs Monroe \nCity enjoyed continued economic, agricultural, and structural growth.\n  In the early 1870s an educational system was created with both public \nand parochial schools. In 1918, a Carnegie Library was built that is \nstill owned and supported by the city of Monroe City.\n  Throughout its 150-year history, Monroe City has continued to \nflourish and has striven to maintain its concern for, and involvement \nin, the lives of its citizens. Members of this community have often \nassumed leadership positions in the community through participation in \nfire, police, and administration departments, as well as with their \nwork with a variety of civic and church groups.\n  I am pleased to join with the State of Missouri in congratulating \nMonroe City on this important milestone and wishing them continued \ngrowth and success for the next 150 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6836-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RETIREMENT OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL DONALD WETEKAM\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr President, today I pay tribute to a great \nmilitary leader, officer, and good friend, LTG Donald Wetekam. After 34 \nyears of distinguished and honorable service, General Wetekam, the \nDeputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Installations and Logistics, \nwill retire from the U.S. Air Force.\n  General Wetekam began his active duty service in 1973 after \ngraduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy. As a career logistics \nofficer, he commanded three maintenance squadrons, a logistics group \nand a logistics center, and has served staff tours at both the major \ncommand and air staff levels.\n  General Wetekam's noteworthy service and responsibilities have been \nwidely recognized. He received the Distinguished Service Medal, the \nMeritorious Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters, the Legion of \nMerit with an oak leaf cluster, and the Air Force Commendation Medal \nwith an oak leaf cluster.\n  Prior to serving as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Installations and \nLogistics, General Wetekam served as Commander of the Warner Robins Air \nLogistics Center, at Robins Air Force Base, GA. He also served both as \nDirector of Maintenance and Logistics and Deputy Director of Combat \nWeapon Systems at Headquarters Air Combat Command, Langley Air Force \nBase, VA; and as Director of Logistics, Headquarters Pacific Air \nForces, Hickam Air Force Base, HI. Prior to that he served as Vice \nCommander and Director, Aircraft Management Directorate at the Oklahoma \nCity Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, OK; and commanded the \n49th Logistics Group at Holloman Air Force Base, NM.\n  General Wetekam has been a visionary leader, and among his most \nsignificant accomplishments, championed initiatives including Repair \nEnterprise 21, establishing a single enterprise-wide maintenance repair \nnetwork. He was a driving force behind the Global Logistics Support \nCenter moving from a base centric supply process to a centrally \nresponsive approach to improving supply chain management. During \nGeneral Wetekam's tenure, the Air Force saw the implementation of \nCentralized Asset Management, culminating in a $14 billion savings and \nthe elimination of complex and redundant financial processes. General \nWetekam worked extensively to increase the number of Security Forces \navailable for deployment and through this effort provided much needed \nsupport to our warfighters. He was successful in reducing career field \noperations tempo, and forged a ground breaking path for both privatized \nhousing and joint basing.\n  General Wetekam's leadership was instrumental to air and space forces \nengaged across a breadth of support activities in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. As the prime architect of Lean \nimplementation, his guidance enabled the Air Force to increase \nefficiency in a resource constrained, high operations tempo \nenvironment. His efforts provided the foundation for Air Force Smart \nOperations 21 and the ability to fund the recapitalization of an aging \nfleet and build the Air Force of tomorrow while fighting today's war.\n  The Nation will miss General Wetekam's commitment to duty, ceaseless \ndrive for improvement, and unwavering support to the U.S. Air Force. I \nwill miss having him in the U.S. Air Force, although I know he will \ncontinue to serve his Nation wherever he goes.

Mr. President, today I congratulate the \nJonesboro High School Mock Trial team of Clayton County, GA, for \nwinning the 2007 National High School Mock Trial Championships in \nDallas, TX. The championship consisted of 44 teams representing 40 \nStates, South Korea, and the North Mariana Islands.\n  The mock trial program is an excellent experience for students, \nallowing them to further their understanding of court procedure and the \nlegal system; to improve proficiency in basic skills such as listening, \nspeaking, reading and reasoning; to promote better communication and \ncooperation between the educational and legal community; to provide a \ncompetitive event in an academic atmosphere; and to promote cooperation \namong young people of various abilities and interests.\n  Jonesboro's long journey to the national championships began by \npracticing 3 days a week under the tutelage of prominent judges and \nlawyers in Clayton County. The team qualified for the National High \nSchool Mock Trial Championships by winning their fifth\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nGeorgia State Championship, and their fourth in the last 6 years, \ndefeating a very talented Grady High School team from Atlanta. After \nwinning the State championship, the team turned its focus to the \nnational championship, where the students presented their case in front \nof legal professionals in a courtroom environment.\n  En route to the final round, Jonesboro defeated the State \nchampionship teams from Hawaii, Idaho, Colorado, and Illinois. In the \nfinals, they played the defense side against Kalamazoo Central High \nSchool from Kalamazoo, MI, in a civil case based on the tragic events \nin Texas City, TX, in 1947. The team vigorously debated who was at \nfault for an accident that resulted in the sinking of several ships, \nalong with injuries and fatalities. Jonesboro did not back down from \nthe runners-up of the 2006 competition, and they defeated Kalamazoo to \nbring the national title back to the Peach State for the third time \nsince 1995, and tying Georgia with Iowa for the most national titles in \nthe Nation.\n  I would like to congratulate Kayla Delgado, Lindsay Hargis, Mathew \nMitchell, Sandra Hagans, Kyle Skinner, Lindley Curtis, Laura Parkhouse, \nBraedon Orr, Brian Cunningham, Jayda Hazell, Tabias Kelly, Jurod James, \nJoe Strickland, and team captain Brittne Walden for their hard work and \naccomplishments. I would also like to extend my gratitude to the \nparents and supporters of the team for reaching out to these students \nand providing them with the leadership and guidance to reach their goal \nof a championship. The team's successes would not have been possible \nwithout the guidance of their teacher coaches, Anna and Andrew Cox, \ntheir attorney coaches, the Honorable John Carbo, the Honorable Deborah \nBenefield, and Tasha Mosely, and their student coach from Mercer Law \nSchool, Katie Powers.\n  They have all made the State of Georgia proud\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6837-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING GALESBURG, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n   Mr. CONRAD.

Channing named the town for Mary \nBuckland Davenport, a friend from Massachusetts and the second wife of \nWilliam Claflin, who was the Governor of Massachusetts from 1869 to \n1872.\n  Davenport has plenty to offer its residents and visitors. Young \ncouples and families are drawn to Davenport as it offers an escape from \nthe big city, more affordable housing, and an opportunity to raise \nchildren in a more rural setting. Businesses in Davenport include a bar \nand restaurant, a beauty shop, and additional home-based businesses. \nThe town also has a park called Tuskind Park, named after the Davenport \nfamily that used to own the grocery store.\n  The 125th celebration in the town where Mayor Jason Lotzer notes, \n``everybody knows everybody,'' will include a ``Wagon Train,'' karaoke, \na parade, a silent auction, all school reunion, and a variety of \nactivities in Tuskind Park.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nDavenport, ND, and its residents on their first 125\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nyears and in wishing them well in the future.

COLSON\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to William E. \nColson, a great Oregonian, who devoted his entire life to building and \noperating quality senior housing. Beginning in 1971 in Salem, OR, Bill \nColson and his father Hugh built and operated independent living \ncommunities for seniors. The company they founded, Holiday Retirement \nCorp., earned a reputation for providing middle-income seniors access \nto outstanding housing and services. By steadily constructing and \nselectively acquiring senior housing properties, Holiday Retirement \nCorp. grew to become the largest owner and manager of senior housing in \nthe world.\n  Bill Colson and his partners, including his wife Bonnie, son Bart, \nand Dan Baty, Norm Brendan, Patrick Kennedy, Thilo Best, Mark Burnham, \nthe Hasso family, Bruce Thorn, and their loyal employees and investors \ncollectively built and managed over 80,000 senior living units in the \nUnited States, Canada, France and United Kingdom.\n  Bill Colson has been recognized as a founding father of seniors \nhousing by the American Seniors Housing Association, an organization he \nhelped create in 1991. With his passing at age 66, Bill Colson leaves \nhis wife, two sons, Brad and Bart, and three grandchildren, all of whom \nhe adored.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to Joan McKinney--journalist, advocate for the free press \nand accomplished shag dancer--who turned 60 this week, for her \noutstanding contributions to the State of Louisiana and to our country.\n  Joan McKinney, originally of Greenville, SC, came to Washington in \n1971 to work on the press staff of former Senator Fritz Hollings. As \nher career advanced, she chose to return to journalism, and she worked \nfor papers in both Louisiana and South Carolina before coming back to \nwork here at the Capitol, covering Washington for the Baton Rouge \nAdvocate, a position she held from 1979 to 2003. I came to know and \nrespect Joan in my many hallway meetings with her since I came to the \nSenate in 1997.\n  In her tenure as the advocate's congressional correspondent, Joan \nbeat the Capitol's marble floors and came to be well respected by the \nLouisiana delegation. The Members from my State knew there was nothing, \nnothing that could get by her. She was so skilled at asking the right \nquestions that she was able to draw from our elected officials\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\nsome truly famous zingers--such as when former Senator Breaux in 1981, \nwhile still a House Member, told her why he was voting for a particular \nplan President Reagan was putting forth. He said his vote could not be \nbought, but it was up for rent.\n  Joan's work as a reporter stayed true to the best tenets of \njournalism. She served the people of Louisiana for a quarter of a \ncentury by informing them about the personalities and policies of their \nelected representatives in Washington.\n  Through her work, Joan became an expert on the intricacies of the \nSenate and the Supreme Court. She has taken this knowledge with her \ninto her current role as a member of the Senate Daily Press Gallery \nstaff. Her Senate acumen on the institution and its procedure is of \ngreat value to the reporters roaming the gallery, cubs and veterans \nalike, who rely on her for deep insight about the Chamber they cover.\n  Joan, who has won reporting awards from the South Carolina and \nLouisiana press associations, is a longtime member of the 112-year-old, \nelite Gridiron Club of newspaper writers. She was one of the first \nwomen to become a member. Her storied career as a journalist, which \nearned her the respect of fellow members of the press and politicians \nalike, should be an example to all aspiring women journalists. And for \nthose lucky enough to gain a spot in the valued turf of the Senate \nDaily Press Gallery, I know Joan will offer them a helping hand. The \nsmart one will take it, and draw on the knowledge, experience and good \nheart, which has distinguished Joan among all who know her and the many \nmore who have benefited from her years of believing in and serving the \nbest ideals of our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6839-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOEL COGEN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, those of us who hold elected \noffice are accustomed to getting the recognition and praise that comes \nwith a career in public service. However, I think all of us would also \nrecognize that there are many equally dedicated public servants who \nwork behind the scenes and are just as deserving of the public's \ngratitude and recognition. I rise today to honor one such public \nservant.\n  In June, Joel Cogen, the executive director and general counsel of \nthe Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, will retire after 41 \nyears at CCM. Mr. Cogen's retirement marks the end of a highly \ndistinguished career in public service, one in which he became a \nfixture in Connecticut politics.\n  Mr. Cogen has been with CCM since its inception in 1966 and has been \nits executive director since 1968. With Mr. Cogen at the helm, CCM, an \norganization dedicated to both advocating for the interests of \nConnecticut municipal governments and promoting efficiency and \nresponsiveness within municipal government, has grown in both size and \ninfluence to the point where it is now the dominant voice for \nConnecticut's cities and towns. In addition to its advocacy work, CCM \nhas also provided its member municipalities with numerous services, \nincluding management assistance, individualized inquiry service, \nassistance in municipal labor relations, technical assistance and \ntraining, policy development, research and analysis, publications, \ninformation programs, and service programs such as workers' \ncompensation. These services, provided under Mr. Cogen's leadership, \nhave helped to greatly increase the level of service the people of \nConnecticut receive from their local officials.\n  In addition, Mr. Cogen also serves as corporate executive officer of \nCCM's Connecticut Interlocal Risk Management Agency. This agency allows \nCCM's member towns to pool their resources to purchase services, such \nas workers' compensation insurance, that many towns might otherwise \nfind too expensive.\n  Before his tenure at CCM, Mr. Cogen held numerous other public \nservice positions. He worked for 9 years at the New Haven Redevelopment \nAgency, while at the same time working as an assistant for then-mayor \nRichard C. Lee. Before that, he worked for the Ansonia Redevelopment \nAgency, the New York State Mediation Board, and the U.S. Wage \nStabilization Board. He also brought his skills to the U.S. Army, \nwhere, as an officer for 2 years, he handled various management \nassignments.\n  Given all of these accomplishments, I cannot help but think of Mr. \nCogen's retirement in bittersweet terms. While I am certainly happy for \nhim and wish him all the best, I cannot help but think about what a \nloss it will be for Connecticut when he steps down. I am sure, however, \nthat his dedication to the State will live on in all who know him and \nworked with him and that we will be left in good hands.\n  Thank you, Joel Cogen. Connecticut is a better place because of you \nand all you have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6839-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JAMES BURTON BLAIR\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I honor a man who has given so \nmuch of himself to public service, the State of Arkansas and the legal \ncommunity.\n  In 1957, James Burton (Jim) Blair was admitted to practice law in \nArkansas. A successful attorney, he was the only general counsel that \nTyson Foods had in the 20th century as the company grew from a regional \npoultry company to the second largest food producer in the Fortune 500.\n  Jim Blair has shared his success with contributions to his lifelong \nhometown of Fayetteville, The University of Arkansas, and the State \nthat we both call home. He has contributed to the education of others \nby establishing funds and chairs at the University of Arkansas. He gave \nthe largest private gift ever given to a public library in Arkansas; \nthe new Fayetteville Public Library is named The Blair Library in \nmemory of Jim's late wife Diane Divers Blair, his grandmother Bessie \nMotley Blair and his aunt Dr. Mary Grace Blair. A patron of the arts, \nJim established a sculpture room at the Walton Arts Center, donated the \nAnita Huffington sculpture ``Spring'' to the University of Arkansas and \nalso donated the Huffington sculpture ``Earth'' to the Arkansas Arts \nCenter in Little Rock.\n  Jim Blair also has a passion for politics and public service. He was \na delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1968, 1972, and \n1980. He served as campaign manager of Senator William J. Fulbright's \n1974 reelection campaign, was vice president of the Clinton for \nPresident Committee 1992 and is listed in ``Who's Who in American \nPolitics.''\n  Jim served for 10 years on the University of Arkansas Board of \nTrustees, including 2 years as chairman. He also served for 9 years on \nthe Arkansas Board of Higher Education, with 1 year as chairman. These \ndays Jim continues his public service by serving on the Fayetteville \nEducational Foundation Board, the Fayetteville Public Library Board, \nthe Tyson Family Foundation Board, the Arkansas Tennis Association \nBoard and the Northwest Arkansas Community Foundation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating \nJames Burton (Jim) Blair on his 50th anniversary in the legal \nprofession and many philanthropic contributions to Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6839-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6839-S6840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FRANK BUCKLES\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

At the age of 106, he resides in \nCharles Town, where he manages his 330-acre farm.\n  Mr. Buckles was only 16 years old when his country entered World War \nI. After unsuccessful attempts to join the Marines and the Navy, Mr. \nBuckles contacted the Army. He claimed that birth certificates had not \nbeen issued in Missouri at the time of his birth and started his \ntraining at Fort Riley, KS, where many soldiers were ill with \ninfluenza. With an irrepressible desire to serve his country, Mr. \nBuckles joined the Army Ambulance Service and went overseas, first to \nEngland and France. Later, Mr. Buckles became an escort for German \nprisoners of war.\n  Upon his return from Europe, Mr. Buckles held various jobs. He \naccepted a position with White Star Line Steamship Company, which took \nhim to Toronto, Canada. In 1921, he put his business education to use \nat Bankers Trust Company in New York City.\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\n  Mr. Buckles eventually realized that he cared most for the steamship \nindustry. While he was employed by Grace Line, he traveled along the \nwestern coast of South America. In 1940, the American President Lines \nhad a task for him in Manila--Mr. Buckles found himself trapped in the \nPhilippines when the Japanese invaded in December of the following \nyear. He spent 3\\1/2\\ years in Japanese prison camps, until on February \n23, 1945, a subsection of the 11th Airborne Division freed Mr. Buckles \nand 2,147 other prisoners in a daring raid on the Los Banes prison \ncamp.\n  After his liberation from Los Banes, Mr. Buckles returned to the \nUnited States. He married Audrey Mayo, a young lady, whom he had known \nbefore the war and in 1954, they settled down on the Gap View Farm in \nWest Virginia.\n  On this same farm, Mr. Buckles has remained mentally sharp and \nphysically active. Up to the age of 105, he drove cars and tractors on \nhis farm. Nowadays, he reads from his vast book collection and enjoys \nthe company of his daughter, Susannah Flanagan, who came to live with \nhim after his wife passed away in 1999.\n  Today, Mr. Buckles is one of three living World War I veterans in the \nUnited States, and his dedication and courage have not been overlooked \nin our Nation's Capital. In 1999, Mr. Buckles was presented with the \nFrench Legion of Honor at the French Embassy in Washington, DC. On May \n28, 2007, Mr. Buckles will represent his fellow World War I veterans as \na Grand Marshall at the National Memorial Day Parade.\n  We must cherish our last links to World War I. In the same vein, we \nowe Mr. Buckles and all the men and women, who have served our country, \na great debt of gratitude.\n  I ask the Senate to join me today in commending Frank Buckles, an \nAmerican whose service to our country deserves recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6840-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING CASTLEWOOD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Arizona urging Congress to \n     take immediate action to allow the Arizona Game and Fish \n     Commission to recover the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge \n     desert bighorn sheep population; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2008\n\n       Whereas, the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge was created \n     primarily in response to concerns for historic declines in \n     desert bighorn populations throughout the west, and the \n     refuge is critical to the health of desert bighorn sheep; and\n       Whereas, the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge desert bighorn \n     sheep population has declined from 812 sheep in 2000 to 390 \n     sheep in 2006, as documented through extrapolation of data \n     from surveys conducted by the Arizona Game and Fish \n     Commission and the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas, the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge is the primary \n     source of desert bighorn sheep, mexicana subspecies, \n     throughout the southwestern portion of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge has served as \n     the primary resource for repatriation of desert bighorn sheep \n     to mountain ranges in Arizona, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado \n     and has repatriated at least 513 desert bighorn sheep in 25 \n     of the past 49 years since transplanting began: and\n       Whereas, the decline in the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge \n     sheep herd coincides with periods of drought and a known \n     increase in the resident population of mountain lions on the \n     Kofa National Wildlife Refuge; and\n       Whereas, the current population of Kofa desert bighorn \n     sheep is inadequate to support continuing repatriation; and\n       Whereas, failure to take immediate action will likely \n     result in further decline and threaten the viability of the \n     Kofa herd,; and\n       Whereas, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission has a trust \n     responsibility under title 17, Arizona Revised Statutes, to \n     manage all wildlife in Arizona; and\n       Whereas, although the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service is mandated to manage the natura1 resources of the \n     Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System Improvement Act of 1997 which provides that the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall ensure effective \n     coordination, interaction and cooperation with the fish and \n     wildlife agency of the states in which the units of the \n     system are located; and\n       Whereas, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission and \n     Department are recognized for their body of expertise \n     relative to managing both desert bighorn sheep and mountain \n     lions, and immediate management action is needed to secure \n     the health and viability of the Kofa desert bighorn sheep \n     population.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1.

That the Arizona Game and Fish Commission employ, \n     without any unnecessary delays, burdens or obstacles, all \n     management tools and measures necessary to recover the Kofa \n     National Wildlife Refuge desert bighorn sheep population, \n     including the management of predators, water developments, \n     human intervention and the potential for disease epizootics.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of \n     Arizona and the Director of the Arizona Game and Fish \n     Department.\n       POM-99. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Arizona urging Congress to repeal federal tax \n     withholding on certain payments made by government agencies; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1001\n\n       Whereas, section 511 of the Tax Increase Prevention and \n     Reconciliation Act of 2005 imposes on certain governmental \n     agencies the duty to withhold and remit income taxes on \n     certain payments for providers of services or property; and\n       Whereas, many providers of covered transactions may be in \n     marginal businesses with little or no federal income tax \n     liability, thereby forcing an interest-free loan to the \n     federal government by the businesses that can least afford \n     them; and\n       Whereas, section 511 places an undue burden on governmental \n     agencies, creating yet another unfunded mandate to state and \n     local governments; and\n       Whereas, the Internal Revenue Service is barely able to \n     cope with the current level of tracking of withholding \n     payments, much less handle the exponential increase in such \n     payments that section 511 creates; and\n       Whereas, this withholding scheme will inevitably lead to \n     endless disputes between governmental agencies and their \n     service providers over billing and account balances.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States repeal section \n     511 of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n     2005, codified as section 3402(t) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code.\n       2.

A bill to authorize the issuance of Federal charters and \nlicenses for carrying on the sale, solicitation, negotiation, and \nunderwriting of insurance or any other insurance operations, to provide \na comprehensive system for the Federal regulation and supervision of \nnational insurers and national agencies, to provide for policyholder \nprotections in the event of an insolvency or the impairment of a \nnational insurer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nthat will bring our Nation's insurance regulatory system into the 21st \ncentury by providing uniformity, predictability, and greater efficiency \nto the way insurance is regulated in this country.\n  The National Insurance Act of 2007, which builds upon legislation \nSenator Johnson and I first introduced last year, provides for an \noptional Federal charter that would offer insurers the choice of being \nregulated under a new Commissioner of National Insurance or under the \ncontinued jurisdiction of the States.\n  I am pleased that Senator Johnson once again joins me as an original \ncosponsor of this bill. Since we introduced the initial National \nInsurance Act just over a year ago, momentum has been building for the \nreforms called for under our legislation and the question has become \nnot whether an optional Federal charter should be implemented, but \nwhen.\n  In an increasingly global financial services industry, numerous \nstudies have called for changes to the manner in which insurance is \nregulated in the United States as one of the ways to make our financial \nservices sector more competitive in the worldwide economy.\n  The bipartisan Bloomberg-Schumer report on financial services \nindustry competitiveness, for example, states, ``One priority, in the \ncontext of enhancing competitiveness for the entire financial services \nsector and improving responsiveness and customer service, should be an \noptional federal charter for insurance, based on market principles for \nserving customers.''\n  Furthermore, the Blue Ribbon Commission on Mega-Catastrophes states, \n``It (an optional federal charter for insurance) would lead to . . . \nconsistent regulation of insurer safety and soundness, and the \nelimination of duplicative regulation and supervision . . .In addition, \nan OFC should promote greater competition that would benefit \npolicyholders.''\n  In addition to the study recommendations, a number of other \nindicators suggest that the time is right for reform. The coalition in \nsupport of the bill continues to grow and the general acceptance of the \nconcept of reform we have proposed is also growing.\n  The arguments against the bill are increasingly seen for what they \nare: parochial in nature, rather than forward-looking and in the best \ninterests of consumers, our financial services sector, and the strength \nof our overall economy.\n  In 1999, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act--broad \nlegislation that modernized the rules that regulate banks and \nsecurities firms and provided a foundation for the financial services \nindustry to become more integrated, market-oriented, technologically \nadvanced, and global in nature. Since then, consumers have \nbenefited from improved industry competition and innovation, greater \nchoice of financial products, and more efficient delivery of services.\n\n  The insurance industry, however, has not enjoyed the same dynamic \nmarketplace within the global economy. Long subject to a patchwork of \nState regulations, the sector's menu of available services is not as \nrobust as it could be. An inefficient regulatory system spread across \nmore than 50 different jurisdictions imposes direct and indirect costs \non insurers in the form of higher compliance fees associated with non-\nuniform regulations and delayed market entry for new products from \nonerous approval barriers.\n  With advances in technology, insurance is increasingly a global \nproduct that cries out for a more consistent and efficient regulatory \nenvironment that allows new products to be brought to market in a much \nquicker fashion than the current system often allows. Under the State \nregulatory regime new product launches are consistently delayed up to 2 \nyears while they await the approval of an individual State regulator.\n  A more uniform regulatory environment, mirroring the highly \nsuccessful dual banking system, should substantially improve the \nclimate in several critical ways for those who buy, sell and underwrite \ninsurance, while also providing superior consumer protection.\n  As the Bloomberg-Schumer report puts it, our bill would allow best-\nin-breed regulations to ``rise to the top'' and become national \nstandards. A division of consumer protection, as created by the \nregulator, would oversee strict regulations and guard against unfair \nand deceptive practices by insurers and agents for the advertising, \nsale and administration of products. A division of insurance fraud, \nalso created under the bill, would make insurance fraud a Federal \ncrime.\n  While taking these cautionary steps to protect consumers, the bill \ndoes not, however, permit the Federal regulator to set rates or price \ncontrols for insurance. Instead, the National Insurance Act \nappropriately relies on competitive pricing within the marketplace.\n  Finally, the Office of National Insurance would be able to fill a \nvacuum and provide true national regulatory expertise and guidance on a \nnumber of issues Congress is legislating on that affect policyholders, \nthe health of the insurance industry, and the overall economy.\n  The only real substantive change to this year's bill in comparison \nwith the one introduced last year is that our updated legislation \nincludes language that would add surplus lines of insurance as a type \nof insurance that a person with a Federal producer's license would be \nauthorized to sell under the Federal charter program.\n  Other technical and clarifying changes were made, but by and large \nthis is last year's bill, with its spirit and purpose intact.\n  Former New York Insurance Commissioner, George Miller, who founded \nthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners, NAIC made the \nfollowing statement in 1871: ``The Commissioners are now fully prepared \nto go before their various legislative committees with recommendations \nfor a system of insurance law which shall be the same in all States, \nnot reciprocal but identical, not retaliatory, but uniform.\n  It's now been over 135 years since that statement was made, and \nunfortunately we are not much closer to Mr. Miller's goal.\n  In the months ahead, however, we look forward to making substantial \nprogress on this legislation as we build on the momentum to modernize \nthis country's insurance regulatory system and do what the State system \nhas failed to do for over 135 years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1472. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to create \na Bureau of Reclamation partnership with the North Bay Water Reuse \nAuthority and other regional partners to achieve objectives relating to \nwater supply, water quality, and environmental restoration; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nNorth Bay Water Reuse Program Act of 2007, together with my colleague \nSenator Boxer. This legislation authorizes Federal participation in a \nregional water reuse project that is the first of its kind in Northern \nCalifornia, and model for the West.\n   The program will allow urban water agencies to take treated \nwastewater now discharged into the sensitive bay-delta ecosystem and \nput it to productive use on water-short agricultural lands and \nenvironmentally valuable wetlands. It is an innovative ``win-win'' \nsolution that will protect the environment as well as meet the future \nwater needs of urban and agricultural\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\nwater users in the North Bay region of California.\n  Agricultural producers in the North Bay region are facing, and will \ncontinue to encounter, major water shortages. At the same time, as \nregulations continue to restrict and/or eliminate wastewater discharge, \nmany communities in the North Bay region will face challenges as they \ntry to determine the best way to discharge their treated wastewater.\n  The North Bay Water Reuse Program will address both problems and \nenhance the ecosystem of the San Francisco Bay. Specifically, the \nprogram will distribute reclaimed water through a conveyance system and \ndeliver it to agricultural growers, promising a permanent and dedicated \nsupply of about 30,000 acre-feet of water per year.\n  The use of reclaimed water for irrigation will reduce the demand on \nboth surface and groundwater supplies, and thus improve instream flows \nfor riparian habitat and fisheries recovery. Furthermore, in the off-\nseason when irrigation demand is diminished, the reclaimed water will \nbe used to increase surface water flows for the restoration of \nwetlands, creating habitat for migratory waterfowl and other wetland \nspecies.\n  Most notably, this program grew from a collaboration of the three \nmajor stakeholders in the region that vie for the same water. It is \nsignificant that the program is supported by the local governments in \nthree counties, Napa, Sonoma and Marin Counties; agricultural \norganizations, such as the Napa and Sonoma County Farm Bureaus, the \nCarneros Quality Alliance, the Winegrape Growers of Napa County, the \nNapa Vintners Association, the North Bay Agriculture Alliance; and \nenvironmental organizations, such as The Bay Institute.\n  Thus, the North Bay Water Reuse Program brings stakeholders that are \nusually at odds with one another to the table to find a solution that \nis beneficial to all.\n  Finally, I would like to note the energy benefits of this project. \nThe Sonoma Valley treatment plant, installing solar panels that will \ngenerate 40 percent of its energy needs. Another partner in the \nprogram, Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District, generates 90 percent of \nits operating energy using solar panels.\n  The North Bay Water Reuse Program will allow vineyard managers to \ncease or significantly reduce their use of gas and electric powered \npumps that currently deliver irrigation water. The program proponents \nexpect to see a net reduction of overall energy use for regional \nirrigation operations, as well as a net reduction in the emissions of \ncarbon dioxide from irrigation operations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, to enter into a cooperative \nagreement with the Madera Irrigation District for purposes of \nsupporting the Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Madera \nWater Supply Enhancement Act. This legislation authorizes the Bureau of \nReclamation, Bureau, to participate in the design and construction of \nthe Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project, project, that is essential \nto\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\nimproving the water supply in the Madera Irrigation District, MID, in \nMadera County, CA, and in California's Central Valley.\n  Representative George Radanovich has introduced companion legislation \nto this bill in the House, and I look forward to working with him to \nget this bill enacted.\n  Agriculture is a multibillion enterprise in California, which \nproduces a significant portion of the Nation's food supply. To secure \nthis food supply, water is essential. When constructed, the project \nwill have the capacity to store up to 250,000 acre-feet of water and \nmove up to 55,000 acre feet in or out of storage each year.\n  With increasing demands on limited water supply, the project will \nenable water users to store excess wet year water supply and this \nstored water can then be used during dry years to meet demand. To \nensure the viability of the groundwater table and address overdraft \nproblems, 10 percent of the water placed in storage would be left in \nthe ground to replenish the aquifer over time.\n  This Project is also a useful complement to efforts to restore the \nSan Joaquin River. Restoring water to the San Joaquin River may reduce \nthe water supply available to agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley by \nup to 165,000 acre feet per year.\n  It is very important to me to do what I can to help make up this \nwater deficit. The Madera Water Bank is one project that can help, and \nI will be looking at it and other projects closely to prioritize \nlimited Federal appropriations to address this important need.\n  MID, the local agency that will build, own and manage the project has \nalready made a major financial commitment to making the water bank a \nreality. MID has spent $37.5 million to purchase the nearly 14,000 acre \nMadera Ranch, which will be the site of the water bank, and millions \nmore on studies. This land is ideal for storing water in the aquifer. \nOver 11,000 acres of the ranch also constitute valuable habitat for \nnumerous species and contain large sections of the region's native \ngrasslands that will be preserved.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the \npredecessor legislation, H.R. 3897, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives in the 109th Congress. As a result of that hearing, two \nchanges were made to the legislation.\n  First, the total cost of the project is capped at $90 million. Under \nthe legislation, the maximum Federal contribution will be $22.5 million \nor 25 percent of the total cost of the project, whichever is less. This \nchange provides certainty and limits the Federal Government's financial \nexposure in supporting this project.\n  The second change to last year's legislation is the decision to \ndeclare the project ``feasible'' without further study. The reason for \nthis approach relates to the project's unusual history.\n  The feasibility of constructing a water bank on the Madera Ranch \nproperty has been under consideration for over a decade. In 1996 the \nBureau began studying this possibility, and in 1998 the Bureau \nfinalized plans to fund a water bank on the property. After conducting \nextensive studies regarding the feasibility of building a water bank on \nthe property, the Bureau was prepared to pay over $40 million for the \nproperty and $60-$70 million to construct the water bank. This total \namount, in excess of $100 million, is significantly more than the cost \nof MID's water bank almost 10 years later. Although the Bureau \neventually withdrew from the project because of local concerns \nregarding sizing, water quality, and nonlocal ownership issues, no one \nhas ever disputed the suitability of the site for a water bank.\n  After the Bureau's involvement ended, Azurix, an Enron subsidiary, \nattempted to build a water bank but was unable to complete the project \nbecause of many of the same concerns raised during the Bureau's \nefforts. However, many more studies were done during this phase for the \nreformulated project. MID has also conducted further studies. To date, \nover $8 million has been spent on studies related to the  Project, \nexclusive of the Bureau's own extensive studies of the project.\n\n  The legislation identifies 18 specific studies done over the past \ndecade on this project, many by the Bureau itself and others by private \nparties and MID, all with the Bureau's full knowledge and involvement. \nIn many cases, the same engineering consulting firms used by the Bureau \nwere retained to conduct these further studies.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to plan, \ndesign and construct facilities to provide water for irrigation, \nmunicipal, domestic, and other uses from the Bunker Hill Groundwater \nBasin, Santa Ana River, California, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto authorize the Riverside-Corona feeder. This project, which is being \nundertaken by Western Municipal Water District, would provide one of \nCalifornia's fastest growing but drought prone regions, with 40,000 \nacre-feet of new supply at a reasonable cost of approximately $370 per \nacre foot. The project would efficiently integrate groundwater storage \nwith existing surface supply management.\n  The purpose of the Riverside-Corona feeder water supply project is to \ncapture and store new water in the underground aquifer in wet years in \norder to increase water supply, reduce water costs, and improve water \nquality. The project will include about 20 wells and 28 miles of \npipeline. Studies have shown the safe annual yield of the aquifer is \nabout 40,000 acre-feet.\n  The project would allow locally stored water to replace the need to \nimport water from Colorado River and State water project sources in \ntimes of drought or other shortages. The project proposes to manage the \nground water levels by the construction of ground water wells and \npumping capacity to deliver the pumped ground water supply to water \nusers. A new water conveyance pipeline is also proposed that will serve \nwestern Riverside County.\n  For water users, dependence on imported water in dry years will be \nreduced, water costs will be reduced, and water reliability will be \nimproved.\n  There are also very important environmental remediation aspects of \nthe project. Up to half of the wells would be placed within plumes of \nVOCs and perchlorate. These wells could remediate about 20,000 acre-\nfeet of currently contaminated water per year. Detailed feasibility \nstudies and environmental reports have been prepared and approved by \nWestern Municipal Water District and certified by the State of \nCalifornia.\n  The California State Water Resources Control Board recognizes that \nthe Riverside Corona feeder is an important project, recently awarding \nit $4.3 million from proposition 50 competitive grant funds.\n  Because water agencies understand that the project is integral to \nregional water planning, the Riverside-Corona feeder has the support of \nagencies upstream in San Bernardino County and downstream in Orange \nCounty. This bill is also supported by and fully consistent with the \nMetropolitan Water District of Southern California's Integrated \nResource Plan, the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority's Integrated \nWatershed Plan, and the water management plans for the cities of \nRiverside, Norco and Corona as well as the Elsinore Valley Municipal \nWater District.\n  This is a bipartisan initiative, as witnessed by the list of \ncosponsors of the House version of the bill I introduce today. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill to help meet the West's water supply \nneeds and to reduce our dependence on the Colorado River.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Bay Area Regional Water \nRecycling Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, together with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, Chairman of the Committee on the \nEnvironment and Public Works, I am pleased to introduce today \nlegislation to help the San Francisco bay area a region with a growing \npopulation, limited\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\nwater resources, and a unique environmental setting, address its \ncritical water needs.\n  The bill, the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program Authorization \nAct of 2007, would help seven bay area communities increase their \nmunicipal water supplies through innovative and much-needed water \nrecycling projects.\n  These projects offer significant benefits. For California and the \nFederal Government such benefits include: the preservation of State and \nFederal reservoir supplies for higher uses rather than for urban \nlandscape irrigation, particularly in drought years; and, a cost \neffective, environmentally friendly, implementable solution for \nincreased dry year yield in the sensitive bay-delta region. Regional \nand local benefits include: the preservation of ever declining water \nsupplies from the Sierra and delta for higher uses; assistance in \ndrought-proofing the region through provision of a sustainable and \nreliable source of water; and reduction in wastewater discharges to the \nsensitive bay-delta environment.\n  The Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program is a partnership \nbetween 17 local bay area water and wastewater agencies, the California \nDepartment of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation that \nis dedicated to maximizing water recycling throughout the region. The \nregional approach taken by the bay area project sponsors ensures that \nprojects with the greatest regional, statewide, and national benefits \nreceive the highest priority for implementation.\n  This bill would authorize the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to \nparticipate in seven bay area water recycling program projects that are \nclosest to completion. Each community with a project would be eligible \nto receive 25 percent of the project's construction cost. The total \ncost of the seven projects is $110 million, but the Federal \nGovernment's share is only $27.5 million. State funding is available \nfor these projects.\n  For the most part, the projects are ready to proceed and start \ndelivering their benefits the projects having been repeatedly vetted, \nboth internally at the local level and through the various steps of the \nFederal review process but Federal funding is needed to make \nimplementation a reality and to allow the many benefits of these \nprojects to be realized.\n\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior \nto participate in the following bay area water reuse projects: Antioch \nRecycled Water project--Delta Diablo Sanitation District, city of \nAntioch; North Coast County Water District Recycled Water project--\nNorth Coast County Water District; Mountain View/Moffett Area Water \nReuse Project--city of Palo Alto, city of Mountain View: Pittsburg \nRecycled Water Project-Delta Diablo Sanitation District, city of \nPittsburg; Redwood City Recycled Water project--city of Redwood; South \nSanta Clara County Recycled Water Project-Santa Clara Valley Water \nDistrict, South County Regional Wastewater Authority; and, South Bay \nAdvanced Recycled Water Treatment Facility--Santa Clara Valley Water \nDistrict, city of San Jose.\n  These seven projects are estimated to make 12,205 acre-feet of water \navailable annually in the short term, and 37,600 acre-feet annually in \nthe long term, all while reducing demand on the delta and on existing \nwater infrastructure.\n  Congressman George Miller introduced a companion bill, H.R.1526, in \nthe House on March 14, 2007. The bill was cosponsored by other bay area \nlawmakers, including Representatives Anna Eshoo, Ellen Tauscher, Jerry \nMcNerney, Tom Lantos, Mike Honda; Zoe Lofgren, and Pete Stark.\n  Water recycling offers great potential to States like California that \nsuffer periodic droughts and have limited fresh water supplies. To \naddress these issues, the bill would establish a partnership between \nthe Federal Government and local communities to implement a regional \nwater recycling program in the bay area. I urge my colleagues to join \nin support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1475\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Roosevelt signed Executive Order \n9066 to authorize the U.S. military to incarcerate Japanese American \nfamilies from California and other west coast States, in violation of \ntheir due process rights afforded to all Americans.\n  Over the years, California's political leaders have led a national \nbipartisan effort to ensure that this chapter in American history is \nnot forgotten.\n  In 1992, my colleagues in the California congressional delegation \npassed bi-partisan legislation to establish the Manzanar National \nHistoric Site, the Nation's first unit of the National Park System \ndedicated to telling the story of the wrongful internment of the \nJapanese American community during World War II.\n  I am pleased to say that Manzanar has been a terrific success story. \nMy colleague Representative Jerry Lewis and I were able to secure \nFederal appropriations to refurbish the camp auditorium to accommodate \nthe tens of thousands of visitors to the site. Last year, nearly 90,000 \npeople visited the Manzanar National Historic Site to learn about this \nunfortunate chapter in United States history.\n  As part of the Manzanar legislation, Congress directed the National \nPark Service to conduct a study of the other camp sites and to \nrecommend National Historic Landmark designation for these sites. Based \non this study, the Department of the Interior designated Tule Lake as a \nNational Historic Landmark last year, upon finding that the remaining \n42 acres of federally owned land at the site possesses national \nsignificance.\n  Of all of the camp sites, Tule Lake has retained some of the most \nsignificant historic features dating back to the internment. The \nfederally owned lands include numerous camp buildings in their original \nlocations, most notably the camp stockade, which was a ``jail within a \njail.'' The finding of the site's national significance by the \nSecretary of the Interior last year is a key step forward in the \nprocess to evaluate the site's potential for management by the National \nPark Service.\n  Over the past several years, the Tule Lake Preservation Committee, \nthe Japanese American Citizens League, the Japanese American National \nMuseum and other local, regional and national partners have worked with \nModoc County and the local community to develop a recommendation to \nstudy the potential for designation of the Tule Lake Segregation Center \nas a National Historic Site. I am pleased that this legislation has \nbeen endorsed by the Modoc County Board of Supervisors.\n  Although the Tule Lake Segregation Center is already a National \nHistoric Landmark, the 42-acre site is not managed by the National Park \nService. This bill would authorize the National Park Service to study \nthe feasibility and suitability of managing the Federal lands at Tule \nLake as a 42-acre National Historic Site, to be managed as part of the \nLava Beds National Monument. Through this legislation, the NPS will \ndevelop various management alternatives for the site and give the \npublic an opportunity to comment on the alternatives, through a public \nprocess. In light of the recent National Park Service work to prepare \nthe national historic landmark designation, the cost to complete this \nstudy is quite modest. Upon completion of the study, the NPS would \ntransmit the study to Congress for review.\n\n  This year marks the 65th anniversary of the internment of Japanese-\nAmericans, when the Federal Government ordered Japanese American men, \nwomen and children to report to temporary assembly centers, including \n13 centers in California. Many families were broken up as fathers were \nsent to prisons, work camps and Department of Justice camps hundreds of \nmiles away. Without hearings or any evidence of disloyalty, Japanese-\nAmerican families were transported to assembly centers in April and May \nof 1942. The largest assembly center was at the Santa Anita racetrack, \nwhich held over 18,000 people in horse stalls and other makeshift \nquarters.\n  Deprived of their basic constitutional rights, Japanese-American \ncitizens and resident aliens were held in these centers until the U.S. \ngovernment built more permanent camps in 10 locations in California and \nthroughout the Western States and Arkansas. Together, these camps held \nover 120,000 Japanese Americans, of which about three quarters were \nliving in California before the war.\n  My good friend, the late-Representative Robert Matsui, was just an \ninfant when his family was ordered from their home in Sacramento to the \nPinedale Assembly Center. From there, he was sent to the Tule Lake, \nSegregation Center in Modoc County, CA not far from the Oregon border.\n  Like the other camps, the Tule Lake Relocation Center was constructed \nin a remote area, on a large tract of federally owned land, managed by \nthe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Prisoners there held frequent \ndemonstrations and strikes, demanding their rights under the U.S. \nConstitution. As a result, Tule Lake was made a ``segregation camp,'' \nand internees from other camps who had refused to take the loyalty oath \nor had caused disturbances were sent there.\n  Despite these injustices, many young men in camp answered the call to \nserve in the U.S. Army and demonstrated their loyalty to the United \nStates and to defend the same basic constitutional freedoms that had \nbeen violated by the U.S. Government's actions. Japanese Americans \nserved with great valor and bravery in Europe, including our colleague \nSenator Daniel Inouye.\n  During its operation, Tule Lake was the largest of the 10 camps, with \n18,789 people housed in makeshift barracks. Opened on May 27, 1942, \nTule Lake was one of the last camps to be closed, staying open until \nMarch 20, 1946, 7 months following the end of World War II.\n  Following World War II, our Nation has recognized that the forced \nevacuation and incarceration of Japanese Americans was wrong and that \nthere was no basis to question the loyalty and patriotism of Japanese \nAmericans.\n  The internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was a grim \nchapter in America's history. Conducting this special resources study,\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\nand the potential creation of the Tule Lake National Historic Site, \nwill help ensure that we honor surviving internees during their \nlifetime and will serve as a lasting reminder of our ability to inflict \npain and suffering upon our fellow Americans.\n  It is important that we recognize the historic significance of Tule \nLake Segregation Center within the lifetimes of the few surviving \nJapanese-American internees, before many of their stories are lost.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after funds are made available for \n     this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on \n     Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a \n     report describing the findings, conclusions, and \n     recommendations of the study.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1477. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to carry \nout the Jackson Gulch rehabilitation project in the State of Colorado; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today Senator Allard and I introduced the \nJackson Gulch Rehabilitation Act of 2007, which would authorize $6.4 \nmillion, subject to appropriations, to pay an 80-percent Federal cost-\nshare for rehabilitation of the Jackson Gulch Canal system and related \ninfrastructures in southwest Colorado.\n  Nearly 60 years ago, the Mancos Project canal was built, delivering \nwater from Jackson Gulch Dam to residents, farms and businesses in \nMontezuma County. Since its construction, the Mancos Project has been \nmaintained by the Mancos Water Conservancy District and inspected by \nthe Bureau, but has outlived its expected life and is now badly in need \nof rehabilitation.\n  The people of Montezuma County have shown great patience on the \nMancos Project, but the situation is turning dire. Washington must not \nforget the needs of people in rural areas, and in the rural areas of \nthe West, water is one of the most important needs they have.\n  The Mancos Project and the Jackson Gulch Dam provide supplemental \nagricultural water for about 8,650 irrigated acres and a domestic water \nsupply for the Mesa Verde National Park. The Mancos Project also \ndelivers water to the more than 500 members of the Mancos Rural Water \nCompany, the town of Mancos, and at least 237 agricultural businesses.\n  The project was build in 1949, and although it has been maintained \nsince then by the district and inspected by the Bureau of Reclamation, \nthe project has outlived its expected life and is badly in need of \nrehabilitation. The estimated cost to rehabilitate the canal system is \nless than one-third the cost of replacement.\n  If the Jackson Gulch Canal system experienced a catastrophic failure, \nit could result in Mesa Verde National Park being without water during \nthe peak of their visitation and fire season, the town of Mancos \nsuffering a severe municipal water shortage, and the possible loss of \nup to approximately $1.48 million dollars of crop production and sales \nannually.\n  Mr. President, the Mancos Water Conservancy District has already \nobtained a loan from the Colorado Water Conservation Board, which, when \ncombined with a recent mill levy increase, will enable the district to \nmeet its share of the project costs. The Federal Government through the \nBureau of Reclamation has an important role to play as well. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1481. A bill to restore fairness and reliability to the medical \njustice system and promote patient safety by fostering alternatives to \ncurrent medical tort litigation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for years, Congress has not been able to \nanswer the question, ``What can be done about rising medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums?'' Today, Senator Enzi and I begin a \nprocess we hope will end with action by Congress to resolve the \nproblem.\n  The discussions the Senate has had about medical malpractice premiums \nuntil now have centered around imposing caps on noneconomic damages. \nThe debate over caps has occurred several times in recent years, and \nhas always ended with a failure to invoke cloture to vote on the \nlegislation.\n  I have consistently opposed caps legislation because caps have been \nunsuccessful in preventing increases in medical malpractice premiums in \nmy home State of Montana, as well as several other States. Clearly, it \nis time for a different approach.\n  The problem of rising insurance premiums affects the medical \ncommunity, the legal community and, most importantly, patients. \nDoctors, burdened with continually-increasing insurance costs, have \nchosen to retire early, relocate their practices, or limit the services \nthey provide to avoid high-risk procedures. Lawyers are concerned that \nreforms limit patients' ability to be compensated for their injuries. \nWhile patients find themselves caught in the middle, with ever-\ndecreasing access to medical and legal services.\n  One of the reasons caps do not offer significant hope for improving \nthe situation is that they treat the symptom of increasing premiums but \nnot the underlying disease. We need to look for solutions that get to \nthe root of the problem.\n  Any successful resolution to the problem must focus on compensating \ninjured patients and on attempting to prevent similar injuries in the \nfuture. A 1999 Institute of Medicine study, To Err is Human, estimated \nthat medical errors cause as many as 98,000 deaths per year in our \nNation's hospitals alone. Even more deaths occur over the long-term and \noutside hospitals.\n  I think a new approach is in order. As such, Senator Enzi and I \nintroduced the Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act in the 109th \nCongress, and we are here today to reintroduce it. Our bill is \ninnovative in how it confronts the problem.\n  We believe that a solution to this complex problem requires \nflexibility. We believe that because the civil justice system is \nlargely a function of State law, the States are best situated to decide \nhow their systems can be improved to work better for patients. We also \nbelieve that changes of this order should be tested and well thought \nout rather than simply mandated. There is no one size fits all answer.\n  So, our bill provides flexibility, leaves the decision-making to \nStates and provides for demonstration programs to implement change in a \nthoughtful way. We owe a debt of gratitude to the experts at the \nInstitute of Medicine for their 2002 report entitled, Fostering Rapid \nAdvances in Health\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\nCare: Learning from System Demonstration, for helping shape the Fair \nand Reliable Justice Act.\n\n  Our bill promotes State-based demonstrations of alternatives to \ncurrent medical liability litigation. It aims to increase the number of \npatients who receive compensation for their injuries. It also tries to \nimprove the speed with which they receive such compensation. The bill \nalso encourages patient safety by promoting disclosure of medical \nerrors, unlike the current tort system which encourages doctors to \ncover up medical mistakes.\n  Because the insurance premium problem and civil justice remedies vary \nby state we feel that the States are best positioned to analyze their \nunique situations and most capable to implement an effective solution. \nTherefore, the Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act would establish \nState-based demonstration programs. The bill allows States to develop \nnew ways to address and resolve their health care dispute issues.\n  There are innovative efforts already in effect in the private sector \nand some States that have achieved some success. I think it is time to \nencourage more innovation, to expand the range of options, and to \nempower the states to experiment and learn how to solve this persistent \nproblem.\n  I want to thank Senator Enzi for his leadership on this issue. I am \nproud to have worked with him. I also want to recognize Representatives \nCooper and Thornberry, who are dropping a companion bill in the House \ntoday. This bill approaches the medical liability insurance premium \nproblem from a new perspective, through a set of common-sense pilot \nprojects centered on improving patient safety. Rather than mandating a \nFederal band-aid for this recurring problem, this bill encourages the \nStates to be innovative and creative to solve the problem while giving \nthem flexibility and Federal support to implement their cures.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill that I will \nintroduce today with Senator Baucus--the Fair and Reliable Medical \nJustice Act of 2007. This legislation recognizes the current disrepair \nof our medical liability system and puts into place a process that will \nprovide better results for patients and for doctors.\n  Our legislation is designed to encourage States to rethink the way \nthe system works so that injured patients receive fair and just \ncompensation in a more timely manner. The new system would also provide \nconsistent and reliable results so that doctors can eliminate the \npractice of defensive medicine and instead focus on the needs of each \nindividual patient. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen right now \nbecause our system is broken.\n  I know we debate medical litigation frequently here on the floor, but \nthroughout those debates I have noticed something interesting. Whenever \nwe argue the pros and cons of the bills before us, no one ever stands \nup to argue that the system doesn't need any reform. In fact, everyone \nin the Senate agrees that our medical litigation system needs to be \nchanged.\n  Why doesn't anyone try to defend our current medical litigation \nsystem? Because it doesn't work. No one--not patients or health care \nproviders--are appropriately served by our current procedures. Right \nnow, many patients who are hurt by negligent actions receive no \ncompensation for their loss. Those who do receive a mere 40 cents of \nevery premium dollar, given the high costs of legal fees and \nadministrative costs. That is simply a waste of medical resources. The \nrandomness and delay associated with medical litigation does not \ncontribute to timely, reasonable compensation for most \ninjured patients. Some injured patients get huge jury awards, while \nmany others get nothing at all. It is important to patients and doctors \nthat our justice system is perceived as both efficient and fair. \nFurthermore, the likelihood and the outcomes of lawsuits and \nsettlements bear little relation to whether a healthcare provider was \nat fault. Consequently, we are not learning from our mistakes. Rather, \nwe are simply diverting our doctors. When someone has a medical \nemergency they want to see a doctor in an operating room, not a court \nroom.\n\n  The medical liability system is losing information that could be used \nto improve the practice of medicine. Although zero medical errors is an \nunattainable goal, the reduction of medical errors, should be the \nultimate goal in medical liability reform. The Institute of Medicine, \nin its seminal study, ``To Err is Human,'' estimated that preventable \nmedical errors kill somewhere between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans each \nyear. That study further emphasized that to improve our health care \noutcomes, we should no longer focus on individual situations but on the \nwhole systems of care that are failing American patients. In the 8 \nyears since that study, little progress has been made. Instead, the \npractice of medicine has become more specialized and complex, while the \ntort system has forced more focus on individual blame than on system \nsafety.\n  To mitigate that individual blame, doctors practice ``defensive \nmedicine.'' Simply stated, ``defensive medicine'' occurs when a doctor \ndeparts from doing what is best for the patient because of fear of a \nlawsuit. Defensive medicine can mean ordering more tests or providing \nmore treatment than necessary. For instance, a doctor might order an \nunnecessary and painful biopsy. Some estimates suggest that Americans \nwill pay $70 billion for defensive medicine this year. Even if it is \nhalf that, it is still way too much.\n  Let's face it. Our medical litigation system is in need of repair. It \nfails to achieve its twin objectives. It doesn't provide fair and fast \ncompensation to injured patients, and it doesn't effectively deter \nfuture mistakes. Even worse, it replaces the element of trust that is \nso vital to the provider-patient relationship with distrust. We can \nmake it better.\n  That is why I am introducing this key legislation with Senator Baucus \ntoday. Our bill would provide $5 million to 10 States to initiate, \nfund, and evaluate demonstration projects that offer alternatives to \ntraditional tort litigation. It will not pre-empt State law. It will \nallow States to find creative alternatives that will work much better \nfor patients and providers in each State. The States have been policy \npioneers in many areas before, including workers' compensation, welfare \nreform, and electricity deregulation. Medical litigation should be the \nnext item on the agenda of the laboratories of democracy that are our \n50 States. Let's take a step forward for American patients and their \ndoctors by allowing this framework to move forward and make the changes \nthat we all know are needed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1482. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct \nresearch on indicators of child well-being; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation today along with my distinguished colleague, Senator \nOlympia Snowe, known as the State Child Well-Being Research Act of \n2007. This bill is designed to enhance child well-being by requiring \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to facilitate the collection \nof State-specific data based on a set of defined indicators. The well-\nbeing of children is important to both the national and State \ngovernments and data collection is a priority that should not be \nignored.\n  In 1996, Congress passed bold legislation to dramatically change our \nwelfare system, and I supported it. The driving force behind this \nreform was to promote work and self-sufficiency of families and to \nprovide flexibility to States--where most child and family legislation \ntakes place--to achieve these goals. States have used this flexibility \nto design different programs that work better for families who rely on \nthem. Other programs that serve children, ranging from the Children \nHealth Insurance Program, CHIP, to child welfare services, can vary \namong States.\n  It is obvious that in order for policy makers to evaluate child well-\nbeing, we need State-by-State data on child well-being to measure the \nresults. Current survey methods can provide minimal data on some \nindicators of child well-being, but insufficient data is provided on \nlow-income families, geographic variation, and young children. \nAdditionally, the information is not provided in a timely manner, which \nimpedes legislators' ability to effectively\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\naccomplish the goals set forth in welfare reform.\n  The State Child Well Being Research Act Of 2007 is intended to fill \nthis information gap by collecting up-to-date, State-specific data that \ncan be used by policymakers, researchers, and child advocates to assess \nthe well-being of children. It would require that a survey examine the \nphysical and emotional health of children, adequately represent the \nexperiences of families in individual States, be consistent across \nStates, be collected annually, articulate results in easy to understand \nterms, and focus on low-income children and families. This legislation \nalso establishes an advisory committee which consists of a panel of \nexperts who specialize in survey methodology, indicators of child well-\nbeing, and application of this data to ensure that the purpose is being \nachieved.\n  Further, this bill avoids some ofthe other problems in the current \nsystem by making data files easier to use and more readily available to \nthe public. As a result, the information will be more useful for \npolicy-makers managing welfare reform and programs for children and \nfamilies.\n  Finally, this legislation also offers the potential for the Health \nand Human Service Department to partner with several private charitable \nfoundations, including the Annie E. Casey, John D. and Catherine T. \nMacArthur, and McKnight foundations, who are interested in forming a \npartnership to provide outreach and support and to guarantee that the \ndata collected would be broadly disseminated. This type of public-\nprivate partnership helps to leverage additional resources for children \nand families and increases the study's impact. Given the tight budget \nwe face, partnerships make sense to meet this essential need. I hope my \ncolleagues review this legislation carefully and support it so that we \nand State policy makers and advocates have the information necessary to \nmake good decisions for children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1483. A bill to create a new incentive fund that will encourage \nStates to adopt the 21st Century Skills Framework; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto create a 21st Century Skills Incentive Fund, and I am proud to have \nthe bipartisan support of my colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe. We have \na tradition of working together, especially on education and \ntechnology.\n  This legislation is designed to support and encourage those States \nthat are willing to accept the bold challenge of the Partnership for \n21st Century Skills to teach the core subjects, but to also go beyond \nthe basics to include 21st Century themes like global awareness and \nentrepreneurial literacy. The partnership's framework emphasizes skills \nlike critical thinking, innovation and communication skills. It also \npromotes information and communications technology literacy, known as \nICT literacy, and life and career skills such as self direction and \nleadership. This bold agenda needs to be woven into State education \nstrategy at every level, including standards and assessments, \ncurriculum, professional development, and learning environments.\n  Every State willing to accept and work to implement such a \nprogressive model and agenda deserves encouragement and support. That \nis why this bill would create a 21st Century Skills Incentive Fund to \nprovide Federal matching dollars for new State investments and \nfoundation donations to 21st Century Skills. There would also be a \nFederal tax incentive for corporate donations. The Federal Government \nwon't put up a dime until a state's plan is approved by the Partnership \nfor 21st Century Skills, a nonprofit organization of leading technology \ncompanies and education leaders. But the Federal Government will offer \nmatching grants to help States that are willing to make an investment \nin such quality education.\n  This is an important investment, and the next step to enhance \neducation and prepare our students for the new, competitive workforce. \nThis initiative also will emphasize global awareness, civic literacy \nand life skills so young people understand our place in the world and \nare ready to take on greater responsibilities in understanding and \nimproving their own communities.\n  The Partnership for 21st Century Skills Partnership has introduced a \nnew model for education. It represents a bold and important new \ndirection for the future of education in this country. This legislation \nis designed to help the Federal Government become a partner and play a \npositive role in preparing our students for their future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1488. A bill to amend the definition of independent student for \npurposes of the need analysis in the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \ninclude older adopted students; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, as U.S. Senators, we are well aware of \nthe difficulty in making tough decisions. But, a tough decision for 13-\nyear-old foster care child shouldn't be choosing between being adopted \nand having a permanent loving, stable, and secure family, or attending \ncollege for a promising future. Today, I am proud to be joined by my \nfriend, Senator Mary Landrieu from Louisiana, in introducing the \nFostering Adoption To Further Student Achievement Act because we \nbelieve all youth deserve both a loving family and a future of hope.\n  Our legislation promotes older adoptions of foster care youth by not \nlater penalizing the adopting family when their student applies for \nstudent Federal financial aid.\n  We have heard from former foster teens across our Nation who have \nstated that they were better off ``aging'' out of the foster care \nsystem than being adopted by a family because of a fear of losing \nstudent Federal financial aid because as a foster student they don't \nhave to report any parental income on their student financial aid \napplication.\n  Our legislation provides a solution by amending the definition of \n``independent student'' to include foster care youth who were adopted \nafter the age of 13 in the Higher Education Act of 1965. Thus, the \nfamily and student would not be penalized on their Federal financial \naid as their classification would be determined by only the student's \nability to pay. Most prospective adopting parents would not have \nfinancially planned for an older teen becoming part of their family. \nOur legislation offers an incentive to promote older adoptions rather \nthan having the teen stay in foster families until they ``age out.''\n  The numbers are startling and its time we act. Currently, 20,000 \nyouth ``age'' out of the foster care system each year with 30 percent \nof these youth incarcerated within 12 months of doing so. There are \n513,000 children in foster care with nearly half the kids over the age \nof 10. Children in foster care are twice as likely as the rest of the \npopulation to drop out before finishing high school. Several foster \ncare alumni studies indicate that within three years after leaving \nfoster care: only 54 percent had earned their high school diploma, only \n2 percent had graduated from a four-year college, and 25 to 44 percent \nhad experienced homelessness.\n  Statistics show youth that are adopted out of the foster care system \nattend college, have stable lives, have a permanent family, and have a \nfuture of hope. One to two years of community college coursework \nsignificantly increases the likelihood of economic self-sufficiency. A \ncollege degree is the single greatest factor in determining access to \nbetter job opportunities and higher earnings.\n  The Fostering Adoption To Further Student Achievement Act ensures \nthat children don't have to make a tough decision between choosing to \nhave a family or an education.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1488\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the establishment and maintenace of \nelectronic personal health records for individuals and family members \nenrolled in Federal employee health benefits plans under chaper 89 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Govermental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a piece of \nlegislation that Senator Voinovich and I have been working on for over \na year now.\n  The Federal Employees Electronic Personal Health Records Act of 2007 \nmakes available electronic personal health records for every enrollee \nof a Federal health benefits plan who wishes to have one.\n  Americans will probably spend more than $2 trillion on health care \nthis year alone. Over the next 10 years, health care costs will more \nthan double, topping $4 trillion in 2015.\n  We spend $6,700 per person on health care, more than twice of what \nother industrialized nations spend; and for the most part, we are not \nreceiving the gold standard of treatment in care.\n  A 2005 survey found that medical error rates in the United States far \nexceed those of other Western countries.\n  And in that survey, one in three Americans reported getting the wrong \ndosage of medication, incorrect test results, mistakes in treatment, or \nlate notification of a test result. That is nearly 15 percent higher \nthan similar results in Britain and Germany.\n  Our excessive reliance on paper record keeping makes our health care \nsystem less efficient, more costly and more prone to mistakes.\n  Doctors diagnose patients without knowing their full medical history, \nwhat they are allergic to, what kind of surgeries they have had, \nwhether they have complained about similar symptoms before.\n  Time constraints, or medical necessity, often force doctors to form a \nquick diagnosis. Sometimes that diagnosis is wrong and sometimes it \nproves to be a costly error.\n  The widespread use of health information technology, the ability to \nimmediately grab someone's full medical history off of a computer, can \nhelp doctors provide better care more cheaply. It has the potential to \ndrastically transform the way we provide health care.\n  If we are looking for success stories on how health care \nprofessionals have integrated the use of electronic health records into \ntheir daily routines, we don't have to look any further than our own \nDepartments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.\n  Times have certainly changed since I retired from the Navy some 16 \nyears ago. I used to keep all my medical records in a brown manila \nfolder.\n  I carried this manila folder with me from the time I left Ohio State, \non to Pensacola, Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, out to California, \nacross the seas and back again, and finally, getting off of active duty \nand coming to Delaware to enroll in business school, on the GI bill, at \nthe University of Delaware.\n  Over a decade ago, the DOD and the VA decided there was a better way. \nAnd the results have been nothing short of phenomenal.\n  Today, when a patient enrolls in DOD's Military Health System, they \nget an electronic health record, not a brown manila folder in which to \ncarry years of paper medical records. Your electronic record will \nfollow you wherever you go, both during your time when you are serving \nin the military and when you leave to join our veterans' community.\n  Researchers and doctors now laud the VA for having the foresight to \nuse electronic health records to improve patient care and transform \nitself into one of the best health care operations in the country.\n  And the cost? About $78 per patient, roughly the cost of not \nrepeating one blood test. In other words, money well spent.\n  I have witnessed that new-found satisfaction right in my own back \nyard, at our Veterans Medical Center in Elsmere, DE. Veterans from \nneighboring States are now coming to Elsmere to seek care instead of \ngoing to regular civilian hospitals near them.\n  So what is keeping the rest of the Nation's health care system from \nfollowing the lead of the DOD and the VA?\n  The answer is the high cost of implementing the latest information \ntechnologies, as well as the lack of uniformity among various \ntechnology products.\n  A physician can spend up to $40,000 implementing an electronic health \nrecords system. A hospital can spend up to five times that amount.\n  If that weren't enough of a reason to say ``no thanks,'' there is \nanother. We don't have a set of national standards in place to make \nsure that once health care providers have made the switch, their new \nsystems can communicate with the hospital or doctor on the other side \nof town.\n  As a nation, we cannot afford to rely solely on health care providers \nto bring the health care industry into the 21st century.\n  While I was Governor, I signed legislation that would call for the \ncreation of a statewide information network to bring our health care \nsystem into the 21st century. Delaware is well underway toward meeting \nour goal of establishing the first statewide health information \ninfrastructure.\n  We must think outside of the box and build on health information \ntechnology initiatives that are all already underway in other areas of \nthe health care industry.\n  The Federal Employees Electronic Personal Health Records Act of 2006 \nwill require all Insurance Plans that contract with the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, to make available an \nelectronic personal health record for enrollees in the program.\n  Via the Internet, an enrollee will be able to log-on to his or her \nelectronic personal health record to keep track of such things as their \nmedications, cholesterol and glucose levels, allergies, and \nimmunization records. An enrollee will also be able to view a \ncomprehensive, easily understood listing of their health care claims.\n  An enrollee can easily share sections of the electronic personal \nhealth record with their health care provider, ensuring that their \nhealth care provider has the most up-to-date and accurate health \ninformation when making clinical decisions.\n  Having health information readily available will increase the \nefficiency and safety of health care for an enrollee by eliminating \nunwarranted tests, procedures, and prescriptions.\n  Most importantly, the legislation ensures that the electronic \npersonal health records provided for through this act are kept private \nand secure.\n  The electronic personal health records are required to include a \nnumber of security features, such as a user authentication and audit \ntrails.\n  The legislation also requires that insurance plans comply with all \nprivacy and security regulations outlined in the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act.\n  This bill is designed to jumpstart this new technology by requiring \nsome of the largest health insurance companies to offer electronic \npersonal health records, which many are already doing.\n  As more insurance companies, health care providers and consumers use \nthis new technology, I am convinced that more people will recognize its \nadvantages and we can more quickly move America's health care industry \ninto the 21st century.\n  And as the Nation's largest employer-sponsored health insurance \nprogram, who better than the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program \nto lead the way in this endeavor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Employees Electronic \nPersonal Health Records Act of 2007.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1490\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Employees Electronic \n     Personal Health Records Act of 2007''.\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about a bill my \ncolleague Senator Carper and I introduced today, the Electronic \nPersonal Health Records Act. The purpose of this legislation is to \nprovide for the establishment and maintenance of electronic personal \nhealth records for individuals and family members enrolled in the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Plan, FEHBP.\n  The widespread adoption of health information technology, such as \nelectronic health records, EHR, will revolutionize the health care \nprofession. In fact, the Institute of Medicine, the National Committee \non Vital and Health Statistics, and other expert panels have identified \ninformation technology as one of the most powerful tools in reducing \nmedical errors and improving the quality of care. Unfortunately, our \ncountry's health care industry lags far behind other sectors of the \neconomy in its investment in IT.\n  The Institute of Medicine estimates that there are nearly 98,000 \ndeaths each year resulting from medical errors. Many of these deaths \ncan be directly attributed to the inherent imperfections of our current \npaper-based health care system. This statistic is startling and one \nthat I hope will motivate my colleagues to take a close look at the \ngoals of our legislation.\n  The voluntary EHRs that would be established through the Electronic \nPersonal Health Records Act will provide clinicians with real-time \naccess to their patient's health history. Each EHR would contain claims \ndata, contact information for providers of health care services, and \nother useful information for diagnosis and treatment. The records will \nbe available cost-free to FEHBP participants and will maintain strict \nadherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, \nHIPAA.\n  Under the bill, the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, would be \nrequired to ensure that all carriers who participate in FEHBP educate \ntheir members about the implementation of the EHR, as well as give \ntimely notice of the establishment of the record and an opportunity for \neach individual to elect not to participate in the program.\n  OPM, through their carriers, would also have to ensure that all \nrecords\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\nwould be available for electronic access through Internet, fax, or \nprinted method for the use of the individual, and that to the extent \npossible, records could be transferred from one plan to another. The \nbill would require EHRs to be made available 2 years after the passage \nof the legislation or earlier at the discretion of OPM in consultation \nwith the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information \nTechnology within HHS.\n  Not only can EHRs save lives and improve the quality of health care, \nthey also have the potential to reduce the cost of the delivery of \nhealth care. According to Rand Corporation, the health care delivery \nsystem in the United States could save approximately $160 billion \nannually with the widespread use of electronic medical records. As a \nresult, the private market is already moving toward implementing \nelectronic medical records.\n  This bill, simply encourages the health care industry to continue in \nthat direction and take their use of technology in the delivery of care \nto the next step. I urge my colleagues to consider not only the benefit \nit will provide to the 8 million individuals who receive their health \ncare through the FEHBP, but also to our Nation's overall health care \nsystem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Ms. Klobuchar,  and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1492. A bill to improve the quality of federal and state data \nregarding the availability and quality of broadband services and to \npromote the deployment of affordable broadband services to all parts of \nthe Nation; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, broadband communications are quickly \nbecoming the great economic engine of our time. Broadband deployment \ndrives opportunities for business, education, and healthcare. It \nprovides widespread access to information that can change the way we \ncommunicate with one another and improve the quality of our lives. From \nour smallest rural hamlets to our largest urban centers, communities \nacross this country should have access to the opportunities ubiquitous \nbroadband can bring. The state of our broadband union should be \nbroadband for all.\n  But the news on this front is not all good. Last month, the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported that the \nUnited States has fallen to 15th in the world in broadband penetration. \nIn some Asian and European countries, households have high-speed \nconnections that are 20 times faster than ours, for half the cost. \nWhile some will debate what, in fact, these rankings measure, one thing \nthat cannot be debated is the fact that we continue to fall \nprecipitously down the list. In 2000 the United States ranked 4th; last \nyear we dropped to 12th; and just last month we dropped to 15th. The \nbroadband bottom line is that too many of our international \ncounterparts are passing us by. For this we are paying a price. Some \nexperts estimate that universal broadband adoption would add $500 \nbillion to the U.S. economy and create more than a million new jobs.\n  In a digital age, the world will not wait for us. It is imperative \nthat we get our broadband house in order and our communications policy \nright. But we cannot manage what we do not measure. So the first step \nin an improved broadband policy is ensuring that we have better data on \nwhich to build our efforts.\n  That is why I am here today to introduce the Broadband Data \nImprovement Act. This legislation will improve the quality of Federal \nand State data regarding the availability of broadband service. This, \nin turn, can be used to craft policies that will increase the \navailability of affordable broadband service in all parts of the \nNation. This legislation will improve broadband data collection at the \nFederal Communications Commission and Bureau of the Census. It will \ndirect the Comptroller General and the Small Business Administration to \nstudy our broadband challenge. It will encourage State initiatives to \nimprove broadband adoption by establishing a State broadband data and \ndevelopment grant program that will authorize $40 million for each of \nfiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n  With too many of our industrial counterparts ahead of us, we sorely \nneed the kind of granular data that will inform our policies and propel \nus to the front of the broadband ranks. I believe that the Broadband \nData Improvement Act will give us the tools to make this happen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Broadband Data Improvement \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The deployment and adoption of broadband technology has \n     resulted in enhanced economic development and public safety \n     for communities across the Nation, improved health care and \n     educational opportunities, and a better quality of life for \n     all Americans.\n       (2) Continued progress in the deployment and adoption of \n     broadband technology is vital to ensuring that our Nation \n     remains competitive and continues to create business and job \n     growth.\n       (3) Improving Federal data on the deployment and adoption \n     of broadband service will assist in the development of \n     broadband technology across all regions of the Nation.\n       (4) The Federal Government should also recognize and \n     encourage complementary state efforts to improve the quality \n     and usefulness of broadband data and should encourage and \n     support the partnership of the public and private sectors in \n     the continued growth of broadband services and information \n     technology for the residents and businesses of the Nation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote innovation and basic research in advanced \ninformation and communications technologies that will enhance or \nfacilitate the availability and affordability of advanced \ncommunications services to all Americans; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the telecommunications industry started in \nthis country as a series of wires criss-crossing the country to provide \nsimple telegraph service. The telegraph allowed people to communicate \nfrom coast to coast in a matter of minutes, which was a marked \nimprovement over the days required to deliver postal correspondence via \nthe pony express. The industry quickly evolved from those initial \ntelegraph lines with Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the \ntelephone. This revolutionized telecommunications and created a multi-\nbillion dollar industry.\n  Today, telecommunications accounts for 3 percent of this country's \ngross domestic income, or roughly $335 billion. It employs over 1.25 \nmillion U.S. workers. The industry is a critical driver of U.S. \neconomic growth and innovation. Historically, advances in \ntelecommunications resulted from AT's steady funding of Bell \nLaboratories, the world-famous research facility that discovered the \ntransistor, the laser, radar and sonar, digital signal processors, \ncellular telephone technology, and data-networking technology. Indeed, \nresearch in this last field, data-networking, is the basis of the 21st \ncentury's greatest resource, the Internet.\n  However, today, the pace of innovation in the United States is no \nlonger as swift or as certain. For example, much of the world's \nwireless technologies come from Europe, and many of the handsets are \ndesigned and manufactured in other countries like China and South \nKorea. Part of the problem is the decline of Bell Labs, but financial \npressures from Wall Street to perform in the short-term are also partly \nto blame. Companies can no longer afford to invest in basic, \nfundamental telecommunications research with project horizons beyond 5 \nyears. Unless we can reverse this trend, I fear that the United States \nmay fall permanently behind in the telecommunications innovation race.\n  That is why I am here today, to introduce the advanced Information \nand Communications Technology Research Act. By rededicating our efforts \nto the pursuit of innovation through basic, fundamental research, we \ncan begin to restore our Nation's historic leadership in this critical \nindustry. Toward that end, the legislation that I am introducing today \nwill establish a telecommunications program within the National Science \nFoundation to focus research on the development of affordable advanced \ncommunications services in America. It would authorize $40 million in \nfiscal year 2008, increasing in $5 million increments to reach $60 \nmillion in FY 2012. The bill would also establish a Federal Advanced \nInformation and Communications Technology Board within NSF to advise \nthe program on appropriate research topics. Finally, the bill would \naccelerate efforts initiated almost 4 years ago to promote spectrum \nsharing technologies. It would require NTIA and the FCC to initiate a \npilot program within 1 year that would make a small portion of spectrum \navailable for shared use between Federal and nonFederal government \nusers.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation in \nthe weeks ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Advanced Information and \n     Communications Technology Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nthe special diabetes programs for Type I diabetes and Indians under \nthat Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nDorgan, to introduce a bill to reauthorize and expand two very \nimportant public health programs created by the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997; The Special Diabetes Program for Indians and the Special Funding \nProgram for Type I Diabetes Research. I want to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Baucus, Senator Collins, Senator Lincoln, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Bingaman for joining us as original \ncosponsors of this bill. This type of bipartisan support clearly shows \nthat addressing this disease and its consequences is an important \nhealth priority for our Nation.\n  Diabetes is one of the most serious and devastating health problems \nof our time. The American Diabetes Association estimates that 20.8 \nmillion Americans have diabetes; more than 7 percent of our population. \nThe number of U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes has increased by more \nthan 60 percent since 1991 and is projected to more than double by \n2050. It ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in America. This has \nserious national implications; it is overwhelming health systems in the \nstates and the Nation.\n  Although diabetes occurs in people of all ethnicities, the diabetes \nepidemic is particularly acute in our Native American populations. \nAmong some tribes, as many as 50 percent of the adult population have \nthe disease. That is why during the negotiations on the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Act, I helped craft an agreement to finance diabetes programs of \nthe Indian Health Service and help raise the profile of tribal health \nprograms. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians began with funding \nof $30 million annually for 5 years and was later expanded to $150 \nmillion a year. This funding has been used widely in Indian country, \nincluding among the Navajo Nation and the 19 Pueblos in New Mexico.\n  Federally supported treatment and prevention programs are showing \nreal results in the Native American populations. The current funding \nhas established almost 400 new diabetes treatment and prevention \nprograms in Native communities. It has helped to provide critical \nresources such as medications and therapies, clinical exams, \nscreenings, and resources to prevent complications. It has provided \nprimary prevention activities such as physical fitness programs, \nmedical nutrition therapy, wellness activities, and programs that \ntarget children and youth. The experiences of these programs have \nprovided many important lessons learned that will benefit other \nminority communities and all people affected by diabetes.\n  Despite all the positive results we have seen from these efforts, \nthere is still much more work to be done. I have traveled extensively \non the Navajo reservation and other parts of Indian country and seen \nthose who still need help. I have visited the dialysis centers and met \nwith those who are suffering from the effects of this disease. Due to \nthe prevalence of this problem, it will take years for us to achieve \nour ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating diabetes and its \ncomplications. But, unless Congress reauthorizes and expands this \nprogram, the funding for these efforts and activities will end next \nyear. We can't let that happen. The Special Diabetes Program for \nIndians has made an enormous and substantial impact on the problem of \ndiabetes in Indian communities. The loss of funding now would be \ndevastating. We must continue to focus specific resources to address \nthe epidemic of diabetes in the Native American communities. That is \nwhy the bill we are introducing today will reauthorize the Special \nDiabetes Program for Indians for an additional 5 years and increase the \nfunding from $150 million to $200 million each year. This will provide \na billion dollars over the next 5 years for this program, $250 million \nmore than we are currently authorized to spend. Reauthorization of this \nvital program will help save lives. It is the right thing to do and it \nis a smart investment of our health care dollars.\n  In addition to the reauthorization of the Special Diabetes Program \nfor Indians, this bill will also reauthorize another important tool in \nour battle against diabetes, the Special Funding Program for Type I \nDiabetes Research. Like the Indian program, this program is set to \nexpire next year, and this bill will provide an authorization for an \nadditional 5 years and increase the funding from $150 million to $200 \nmillion each year.\n  The Type I Diabetes research program which was also created in 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act has allowed the Federal Government to make dramatic \nadvances in research and treatment since its inception. This funding \nhas helped support research into the identification of genes that \nincrease susceptibility to diabetes. It has helped with the development \nof therapies that have helped slow the progression and in some cases \neven reverse the progression of this disease. And it has helped develop \ntools and methods that help people manage the disease long term.\n  Again though, there is still much more work to be done. Continued \ninvestment in this program will help to maintain support for research \nthat is truly helping those who are living with diabetes and help \nprevent the onset of diabetes in others. The Federal investment in \nresearch has produced tangible\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nresults that I believe justify its continued support. Diabetes is \ntaking too heavy a toll on too many Americans and their families. \nContinued funding is vital to the continuation of our fight against \ndiabetes.\n  The prevention and treatment of diabetes has improved greatly over \nthe past decade and I believe it is in large part due to the funding \nand research accomplished through these two programs. Complications of \ndiabetes can be prevented and the costs of this disease to our society \ncan be contained. Research, early detection and treatment, however, are \nthe keys. I hope that Congress will join together to reauthorize these \nprograms and also provide to them the increase in funding that they \nneed to keep making advances.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF SPECIAL DIABETES PROGRAMS FOR \n                   TYPE I DIABETES AND INDIANS.\n\n       (a) Special Diabetes Programs for Type I Diabetes.--Section \n     330B(b)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254c-\n     2(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through \n     2013.''.\n       (b) Special Diabetes Programs for Indians.--Section \n     330C(c)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254c-\n     3(c)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through \n     2013.''.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague \nfrom New Mexico in introducing legislation to reauthorize two very \nimportant efforts to address diabetes prevention and treatment and \nresearch: the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, which is \nadministered by the Indian Health Service's Division of Diabetes \nTreatment and Prevention, and the Special Diabetes Programs for \nChildren with Type I Diabetes Research, which is administered by the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  The Indian Affairs Committee held an oversight hearing on diabetes in \nIndian country this past February. Diabetes is an illness that afflicts \nNative Americans more than any other ethnic/racial group in the United \nStates, and some tribes have the onerous distinction of having the \nhighest diabetes rate in the world. Indian people are 318 percent more \nlikely to die from diabetes than the general population.\n  The Special Diabetes Program for Indians is recognized as the most \ncomprehensive rural system of care for diabetes in the United States. \nGrants under this program have been awarded by the Indian Health \nService to nearly 400 IHS, tribal and urban Indian programs within the \n12 IHS Areas in 35 States. The program serves approximately 116,000 \nNative American people with various prevention and treatment services.\n  While each of the Special Diabetes Program grants reflects the unique \ntribal community that conducts the program, here are some examples of \nthe kinds of activities the program provides: teaching Indians living \nwith diabetes how to examine and take care of their feet; helping young \nmothers learn how to eat healthy using commodity foods issued under the \nUSDA's Food Distribution Program on Indian reservations, and how to \nlearn the value of breastfeeding their babies to reduce the incidence \nof diabetes as the children grow older; enabling diabetics to have \naccess to regular eye screening exams; helping Native Americans know \nthe connection between eating healthy and preventing diabetes by \nadapting materials of the National Institutes of Health-funded clinical \ntrial, called the Diabetes Prevention Program, to be culturally-\nappropriate; promoting physical activity in the reservation \nenvironment, such as building walking trails and displaying signs that \nsay, ``Walk, don't take the elevator;'' and enabling Indian Health \nService, tribal and urban Indian health programs to offer new \nmedications for diabetes, such as glitazone, which helps increase \ninsulin sensitivity.\n  Reauthorization of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians is both a \nlegislative and a medical priority for Indian country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the measure that we are introducing today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1495. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe application of the tonnage tax on vessels operating in the dual \nUnited States domestic and foreign trades, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, foreign registered ships now carry 97 \npercent of the imports and exports moving in the U.S. international \ntrade. These foreign vessels are held to lower standards than U.S. \nregistered ships, and are, virtually, untaxed. Therefore, their costs \nof operation are lower than U.S. ship operating costs, which explains \ntheir 97 percent market share.\n  Three years ago, in order to help level the playing field for U.S. \nflag ships that compete in international trade, Congress enacted, under \nthe American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Public Law 108-357, Subchapter \nR, a ``tonnage tax'' that is based on the tonnage of a vessel, rather \nthan taxing the U.S. flag ship's international income at a 35 percent \ncorporate income tax rate. However, during the House and the Senate \nconference, language was included, which states that a U.S. vessel \ncannot use the tonnage tax on international income if that vessel also \noperates in U.S. domestic commerce for more than 30 days per year.\n  This 30-day limitation dramatically limits the availability of the \ntonnage tax for those U.S. ships that operate in both domestic and \ninternational trade and, accordingly, severely hinders their \ncompetitiveness in foreign commerce. It is important to recognize that \nships operating in U.S. domestic trade already have significant cost \ndisadvantages vis-a-vis U.S. ships operating in international trade. \nSpecifically, U.S-flag ships that operate solely in international \ntrade: 1. are built in foreign shipyards at one-third U.S. shipyard \nprices; 2. receive $2.6 million per ship per year in Federal maritime \nsecurity payments in return for making these vessels available to the \nDepartment of Defense in time of national emergency; and 3. are owned \nby U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations. By contrast, U.S. flag \nships that operate both in international trade a domestic trade are: 1. \nbuilt in higher priced U.S. shipyards; 2. do not receive maritime \nsecurity payments, even when operated in international trade, but have \nthe same commitments to the Department of Defense; and 3. are owned by \nU.S.-based American corporations. Furthermore, the inability of these \ndomestic operators to use the tonnage tax for their international \nservice is an unnecessary burden on their competitive position in \nforeign commerce.\n  When windows of opportunity present themselves in international \ntrade, American tax policy and maritime policy should facilitate the \nparticipation of these American-built ships. Instead, the 30-day limit \nmakes them ineligible to use the tonnage tax, and further handicaps \nAmerican vessels when competing for international cargo. Denying the \ntonnage tax to coastwise qualified ships further stymies the operation \nof American built ships in international commerce, and further \nexacerbates America's 97 percent reliance on foreign ships to carry its \ninternational cargo.\n  These concerns were of such sufficient importance that in December \n2006, the Congress repealed the 30-day limit on domestic trading but \nonly for approximately 50 ships operating in the Great Lakes. These \nships primarily operate in domestic trade on the Great Lakes, but also \ncarry cargo between the United States and Canada in international trade \nSection 415 of P.L. 109-432, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of \n2006.\n  The identifiable universe of remaining ships other than the Great \nLakes ships that operate in domestic trade, but that may also operate \ntemporarily in international trade, totals 13 U.S. flag vessels. These \n13 ships normally\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\noperate in domestic trades that involve Washington, Oregon, California, \nHawaii, Alaska, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana. In the interest of \nproviding equity to the U.S. corporations that own and operate these 13 \nvessels, my bill would repeal the tonnage tax 30-day limit on domestic \noperations and enable these vessels to utilize the tonnage tax on their \ninternational income so they receive the same treatment as other U.S. \nflag international operators. I stress that, under my bill, these ships \nwill continue to pay the normal 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate on \ntheir domestic income.\n  Repeal of the tonnage tax's 30-day limit on domestic operations is a \nnecessary step toward providing tax equity between U.S. flag and \nforeign flag vessels. I strongly urge the tax writing committees of the \nCongress to give this legislation their expedited consideration and \napproval. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE TONNAGE TAX \n                   ON VESSELS OPERATING IN THE DUAL UNITED STATES \n                   DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TRADES,.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (f) of section 1355 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to definitions and \n     special rules) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(f) Effect of Operating a Qualifying Vessel in the Dual \n     United States Domestic and Foreign Trades.--For purposes of \n     this subchapter--\n       ``(1) an electing corporation shall be treated as \n     continuing to use a qualifying vessel in the United States \n     foreign trade during any period of use in the United States \n     domestic trade, and\n       ``(2) gross income from such United States domestic trade \n     shall not be excluded under section 1357(a), but shall not be \n     taken into account for purposes of section 1353(b)(1)(B) or \n     for purposes of section 1356 in connection with the \n     application of section 1357 or 1358.''.\n       (b) Regulatory Authority for Allocation of Credits, Income, \n     and Deductions.--Section 1358 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to allocation of credits, income, and \n     deductions) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``in accordance with this subsection'' in \n     subsection (c) and inserting ``to the extent provided in such \n     regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe \n     regulations consistent with the provisions of this subchapter \n     for the purpose of allocating gross income, deductions, and \n     credits between or among qualifying shipping activities and \n     other activities of a taxpayer.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 1355(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     is amended by striking ``exclusively''.\n       (2) Section 1355(b)(1)(B) of such Code is amended by \n     striking ``as a qualifying vessel'' and inserting ``in the \n     transportation of goods or passengers''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 1497. A bill to promote the energy independence of the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, for the sake of our security, economy and \nenvironment, America needs a comprehensive energy policy that is \nindependent of foreign energy sources and weans America off of fossil \nfuels.\n  Last year, I introduced comprehensive energy legislation that would \naddress the many challenges across our economy to achieving sustainable \nenergy independence. I am very hopeful that this Congress will soon \ntake steps to bring forward a comprehensive energy bill that will \naddress many of the areas I believe are essential to this effort. I \nhave cosponsored many of the individual planks of this comprehensive \neffort, and today I want to address how we can ensure that this energy \npolicy does not have an expiration date or fall short of its laudable \ngoals.\n  Today I am introducing the Energy Independence Act.\n  The Energy Independence Act will deliver energy independence to \nAmericans by providing an energy plan that has the capacity to change \nwith innovation. My bill will ensure that our energy policy will \nincrease the efficiency and decrease the environmental impact of \nAmerica's energy policy, and encourage our energy policy to adapt to \nour needs and abilities.\n  My bill will set a congressional goal of achieving energy \nindependence by 2017. ``Energy independence'' is defined as meeting all \nbut 10 percent of our energy needs from domestic energy sources. The \nbill will also set a congressional goal of achieving independence from \nfossil fuels by 2037.\n  My bill will also create a Blue Ribbon Energy Commission, which will \nmeet every two years starting in 2009, to evaluate our progress in \nefforts to become energy independent, and to recommend changes to be \nmade in reports to Congress.\n  These are achievable goals.\n  Petroleum, mostly used for transportation, accounts for 84 percent of \nour imported energy. Transportation accounts for roughly 28 percent of \nour energy use. I support raising CAFE standards, and have cosponsored \nS. 357, legislation by Senator Feinstein which would raise these \nstandards to 35 miles per gallon by 2019. Studies show that raising \nCAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon would save over 36 billion \ngallons of gas per year, and creating efficiency standards for \nreplacement tires would save more than 7 billion barrels of oil over \nthe next 50 years. Creating incentives for commuting by train or bus, \nand funding upgrades and new starts in public transit services, such as \nthe purple line of the DC metro, will also make a difference--in an \naverage year, the round trip to work uses over 250 gallons of gas and \ncreates about 5,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.\n  As part of a comprehensive energy bill we should also be mindful of \nthe long-term effects of our energy policy on the environment, our \nlandscape, and our health. I cosponsored S. 309, legislation by \nSenators Sanders and Boxer that provides for an economy-wide emissions \ncap and trade program. Enacting an economy-wide cap and trade program \nwill ensure that our energy policy will be truly sustainable.\n  America currently gets only 6.3 percent of its energy from renewable \nenergy sources. Current ideas for addressing this problem focus on \ntrying to make the large up-front investment in infrastructure required \nto produce renewable energy less daunting, by creating a long-term \nmarket for renewable energy through increasing the Federal Government's \nuse of renewables and creating a Federal renewable portfolio standard \nto make utilities offer renewable energy to American consumers, and by \nmaking incentives like the renewable production tax credit permanent. I \nsupport creating Federal renewable portfolio standard, and will \ncosponsor legislation to be offered by Senator Bingaman to do so. I \nhave also cosponsored S. 590, Senator Smith's legislation that would \nextend solar tax incentives through 2016, while expanding these \nincentives to cover more of the up-front investment required to use \nsolar energy.\n  In order to get to energy independence we must substantially increase \nour investment in energy research. I cosponsored S. 761, Senator Reid's \nAmerica COMPETES Act, which will increase R funding for the \nDepartment of Energy, increase the DOE's emphasis on advanced energy \nresearch to overcome the long-term and high-risk technological barriers \nto the development of energy technologies, and implement \nrecommendations made by the National Academies of Sciences report \nRising Above a Gathering Storm.\n  I will be advocating other areas of energy policy reform, including \nincreasing funding for weatherization, providing incentives for \ntelecommuting, and providing additional energy efficiency standards for \nappliances.\n  We can do better, and the one overarching theme in the quest for a \nsustainable, long-term energy policy is the need to be able to be \nflexible and change our energy policy to suit our needs, capacity, \nresearch and development. My bill will give us the ability to provide \nlong-term, bipartisan solutions that will address our energy policy \ngoing forward, and give us the flexibility, and the considered \nsolutions of experts, to give the American people the energy policy \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n                                S. 1497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to prohibit \nthe import, export, transportation, sale, receipt, acquisition, or \npurchase in interstate or foreign commerce of any live animal of any \nprohibited wildlife species, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Captive \nPrimate Safety Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Vitter, \nLieberman, Lautenberg, and Menendez. An almost identical bill passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent in the 109th Congress.\n  This bipartisan bill amends the Lacey Act to prohibit transporting \nmonkeys, great apes, lemurs, and other nonhuman primates across State \nlines for the pet trade, much like the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, \nwhich passed unanimously in 2003, did for tigers and other big cats.\n  This bill has no impact on trade or transportation of animals for \nzoos, medical and other licensed research facilities, or certain other \nlicensed and regulated entities. The prohibitions in the Lacey Act only \napply to the pet trade.\n  I am proud that this legislation is supported by the Humane Society \nof the United States, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, the \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association, Defenders of Wildlife and the \nWildlife Conservation Society and many other organizations.\n  I look forward to working with all my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 1503. A bill to improve domestic fuels security; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Gas \nPetroleum Refiner Improvement and Community Empowerment Act or Gas \nPRICE Act. While chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, I sought to move a similar measure. Unfortunately, my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle managed to block the bill at that time.\n  Today, motorists are facing record high gas prices and according to \nLabor statistics, those higher fuel prices are hurting the national \neconomy as a whole. Unfortunately, the pain at the pump, the grocery \nstore, and the shopping mall were predicted long ago and are largely a \nfunction of politicking, rhetoric, and finger pointing, actions that \ncontinue today.\n  According to Deutsche Bank energy experts Paul Sankey and Rich \nVolina, who testified May 15, 2007 before the Senate Energy Committee, \n``Anybody who blames record high U.S. gasoline prices on ``gouging'' at \nthe pump simply reveals their total ignorance of global supply and \ndemand fundamentals.'' Yet yesterday the House narrowly passed a bill \nthat; goes just that; goes after so called ``gougers'' while doing \nnothing to affect supply.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate will join me and \nquickly pass the bill I am introducing today. Our constituents elected \nus to solve problems and make their lives better, not to name call and \ndemagogue.\n  I have been talking about the lack of adequate refining supplies for \nsome years. In May 2004, while chairman of the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works, I held a hearing on the environmental issues \nregarding oil refining. The committee received testimony about the lack \nof adequate refining capacity and the obstacles the industry faced in \norder to meet consumer demand.\n  In a May 2005 speech, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nstated, ``The status of world refining capacity has become worrisome as \nwell. Of special concern is the need to add adequate coking and \ndesulphurization capacity to convert the average gravity and sulphur \ncontent of much of the world's crude oil to the lighter and sweeter \nneeds of product markets, which are increasingly dominated by \ntransportation fuels that must meet ever-more stringent environmental \nrequirements.''\n  The fact of the matter is that, like it or not, the U.S. needs to \nincrease its\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nrefining capacity if we are to solve the economic struggles facing \nevery family.\n  The bill I am introducing today redefines and broadens our \nunderstanding of a ``refinery'' to be a ``domestic fuels facility.'' \nOil has been and will continue to play a major role in the U.S. \neconomy, but the future of our domestic transportation fuels system \nmust also include new sources such as ultra-clean syn-fuels derived \nfrom coal and cellulosic ethanol derived from home-grown grasses and \nbiomass.\n\n  Expanding existing domestic fuels facilities like refineries or \nconstructing new ones face a maze of environmental permitting \nchallenges. The Gas PRICE Act provides a Governor with the option of \nrequiring the Federal EPA to provide the state with financial and \ntechnical resources to accomplish the job and establishes a certain \npermitting process for all parties. And it does so without waiving \nenvironmental laws and working with local governments.\n  The public demands increasing supplies of transportation fuel, but \nthey also expect that fuel to be good for their health and the \nenvironment. To that end, the bill requires the EPA to establish a \ndemonstration to assess the use of Fischer-Tropsch FT diesel and jet \nfuel as an emission control strategy. Initial tests have found that FT \ndiesel emits 25 percent less NOX, nearly 20 percent less \nPM1O, and approximately 90 percent less SOX than low sulfur \npetroleum diesel. Further, U.S. Air Force tests at Tinker base in my \nhome state found that blends of FT aircraft fuel reduced particulate \n47-90 percent and completely eliminated SOX emissions over \ncontemporary fuels in use today.\n  Good concepts in Washington are bad ideas if no one wants them at \nhome. As a former Mayor of Tulsa, I am a strong believer in local and \nstate control. The Federal Government should provide incentives to not \nmandate on local communities. Increasing clean domestic fuel supplies \nis in the nation's security interest, but those facilities can also \nprovide high paying jobs to people and towns in need. My bill provides \nfinancial incentives to the two most economically distressed \ncommunities in the Nation, towns affected by BRAC and Indian tribes \nconsider building coal-to-liquids and commercial scale cellulosic \nethanol facilities.\n  I am very proud that my home state of Oklahoma is a leader in the \ndevelopment of energy crops for cellulosic biofuels, and specifically \ncoordinated programs through the Noble Foundation in Ardmore. The key \nnow is to promote investment in this exciting area, and nothing would \nspeed the rapid expansion of the cellulosic biofuels industry more than \ninvestment by the Nation's traditional providers of liquid \ntransportation fuels.\n  Many integrated oil companies have formed or substantially expanded \ntheir biofuels divisions within the past year to prepare for the \neventuality of cost-competitive cellulosic biofuels. Cellulosic \nbiorefineries will want to create an assured supply of feedstock and \nwill enter into long-term contracts with surrounding biomass producers.\n  One of the incentives for oil companies to invest in exploration is \nthat their stock prices are affected by their declared proved reserves. \nCreating a definition of renewable reserves would create a similar \nincentive for them to invest in cellulosic biofuels.\n  In 1975, Congress directed the SEC to promulgate a definition of \nproved reserves. At that time, the SEC based its definition upon \nbroadly-accepted industry standards established by the Society of \nPetroleum Engineers 1978 FASB System. While no broadly \naccepted industry standards yet exist for thinking about dedicated \nenergy crops, industry, growers and agronomists could be brought \ntogether to agree on standards and practices. Agronomists could play a \nsimilar role in estimation of renewable reserves to that of petroleum \nengineers in proved reserves by providing independent projections of \nbiomass yields.\n\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed the Department of Energy to \naccelerate the commercial development of oil shale and tar sands. As \nthese unconventional fuel sources reach viability, the SEC will be \npressured to develop methodology to incorporate them into its reserves \nhierarchy. Given the country's interest in developing renewable \nalternatives to fossil fuels, it is logical that the SEC would develop \ncriteria for the incorporation of biomass feedstock sources into its \nhierarchy at the same time.\n  This is Congress's least expensive way to jumpstart the cellulosic \nbiofuels industry.\n  Much has changed in Washington since I was chairman of the \nEnvironment Committee and held hearings on the need to improve our \ndomestic transportation fuels system. I hope that the new majority \njoins me in quickly passing the Gas PRICE Act doing so would be a \nmaterial and substantive action toward their stated goal of ``energy \nindependence'' and would go far beyond more partisan symbolism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 1505. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe approval of biosimilars, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, next month the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee is expected to markup legislation \ncreating a regulatory pathway for the approval of follow-on biologics, \nor ``biosimilars''. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthis important issue and would especially like to thank Senator Hatch \nfor his leadership in this area.\n  There are significant differences between small molecule drugs and \nlarger protein derived therapeutic biologics. These differences are \ngoing to require a much more detailed and a much more complex approval \npathway than the generic drug approval process. To protect patient \nsafety, the FDA must be empowered to apply rigorous scientific \nstandards to biosimilars seeking approval, while at the same time \navoiding duplicative testing and unnecessary expense.\n  Biological products are among the most promising and effective \nmedicines for the treatment of serious and life-threatening diseases. \nUnfortunately these medicines are often very expensive, and current \nU.S. law does not provide an abbreviated approval pathway for ``follow-\non'' versions of these innovative products after key patents expire. \nTherefore, Congress should act so that patients can have access to less \nexpensive versions of biologics, just as they do with generic small \nmolecule drugs.\n  In addition to the great benefits associated with biologic products, \nthe American biotech industry has become the world leader in \ndevelopment of new therapies for serious or life-threatening illnesses. \nThis will only continue as there are now at least 400 biologics \ncurrently in development. To preserve this incredibly innovative \nindustry, biotechnology companies need to have a meaningful period of \ntime to recoup the extraordinary expenses incurred in bringing these \nlife-saving medicines to market. If not, U.S. based research and \ndevelopment of new biotech medicines will be threatened.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the Affordable Biologics for \nConsumers Act of 2007. It requires the FDA develop science-based rules \nfor approval of biologics on a product-class basis. The legislation \nalso provides 14 years of data exclusivity for innovator drug \nmanufacturer products, with an additional 2 years available if the \nSecretary approves a new indication for the reference product. This \nlegislation will ensure that patients have access to safe and \naffordable biologics, while protecting innovation and spurring the \ndevelopment of new life-saving therapies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, and the many patient groups that \nhave endorsed this legislation, in supporting this crucial piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commend our colleagues, Senators \nGregg, Burr, and Coburn, for their introduction today of the Affordable \nBiologics for Consumers Act, S. 1505.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I am the original author with \nRepresentative Henry Waxman of the Drug Price Competition and Patent \nTerm Restoration Act, a law which gave rise to today's generic drug \nindustry. And so, I have a long-standing interest in making certain \nthat consumers have access to affordable medications and that we \nprovide the appropriate incentives for development of the new products \nthat are eventually to be copied.\n  We must rectify the fact that there is no clear pathway for follow-on \ncopies\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\nof biological products, such as human growth hormone or insulin, to \ntake two easy examples. And it must be rectified on a priority basis.\n  That the Hatch-Waxman law did not cover these biologic products was \nnot a simple omission. Indeed, the market for biologicals really did \nnot develop until after enactment of Waxman-Hatch in 1984.\n  For many years, I have worked toward development of a pathway for \nthese ``follow-on'' products, but it was not until recently that I \nbelieve we have developed a public consensus that there is the \nscientific and regulatory underpinning necessary to write a good law.\n  Comes now the Gregg-Burr-Coburn bill, which must be seen as an \nimportant contribution to the necessary dialog on follow-on biologics.\n  The Gregg-Burr-Coburn proposal addresses elements which I believe are \nkey to any law we enact. First, there must be sufficient incentive for \nthe development of biologic products. That incentive is tied inherently \nto an appropriate protection of the innovator's intellectual property. \nAnd the protection must be for a sufficient length of time to allow \ninventors of the molecule and others who have a financial stake in its \ndevelopment to recoup the substantial time and investment necessary to \ninvent a biologic. Such protections are key for biotechnology \ncompanies, large and small, but also for universities that conduct much \nof the research on new molecules and the other investors who support \nthat promising research.\n  Second, we should not create unnecessary barriers to marketing of \nlower-cost, successor biologic products. While the law must contemplate \nthat the follow-on products be subjected to a rigorous scientific \nreview to ensure they are safe, pure and potent, that review, however, \nshould be flexible enough to make certain there are not unnecessary \nbarriers to market entry for the lower-cost alternatives.\n  Third, past history should inform our decision-making when it can, \nbut any law we write must reflect the emerging realities of today's \npharmaceutical market.\n  And, finally, the law must reflect a careful balance. We all want \nconsumers to have access to more affordable medications, and surely \nthere is a need to allow patients to buy less expensive biological \nproducts. At the same time, we want to make certain that the \nabbreviated pathway for these follow-on biologics contemplates review \nof products which are truly follow-ons to the innovators' products, and \nnot new biologics. This is tied inherently to the standard which is \ndeveloped for ``similarity'' of the follow-on to the innovator.\n  As many are aware, Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Clinton and I have been \nmeeting for some time to discuss the elements that must be included in \nany follow-on biologics legislation. While I have been working on draft \nlegislation for some time, I have not introduced a proposal pending a \nsuccessful conclusion to those discussions. It has been our hope, and \nit remains our hope, that our meetings will lead to development of a \nconsensus document that will provide the basis for the expected HELP \nCommittee markup on June 13th.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the Gregg-Burr-Coburn proposal will \nhelp inform the discussions of we four Senators, and indeed the HELP \nCommittee's deliberations on this issue. Senators Gregg, Burr and \nCoburn have a proven record in contributing greatly to the body of law \nwe call the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Their bill is a thoughtful and \nserious contribution and it is a significant work that this body should \nrecognize.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 1506. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nmodify provisions relating to beach monitoring, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would increase protections for the Nation's beaches and the \npublic.\n  This bill, the Beach Protection Act, will amend the sections of the \nClean Water Act that were enacted in the Beaches Environmental \nAssessment and Coastal Health, BEACH, Act, which I wrote in 1990, and \nwhich was enacted and signed by President Clinton in 2000.\n  The BEACH Act required states to adopt the Environmental Protection \nAgency's 1986 national bacteria standard for beach water quality and \nprovided incentive grants for States to set up beach monitoring and \npublic notification programs. At the time Congress passed the BEACH \nAct, only 7 States had adopted water quality standards for bacteria at \nleast as stringent as those recommended by EPA in 1986. Only 9 States \nhad programs in place to monitor all or most of their beaches for \npathogens, and to close the beaches or issue advisories when coastal \nwaters are not safe. Only 5 States compiled and publicized records of \nbeach closings and advisories. New Jersey was one of the leaders in all \nthree of these categories.\n  Now, thanks to the BEACH Act, every coastal State except Alaska has a \nmonitoring program and a program for public notification of \ncontamination of beach waters. In addition, every State has adopted \nstandards at least as stringent as those set by EPA.\n  The Beach Protection Act would build upon the progress we have made \nsince passage of the BEACH Act, to improve monitoring and notification \nrequirements, and improve the protection of our beaches.\n  The Beach Protection Act will reauthorize the Federal grants created \nunder the BEACH Act, and make several improvements to the program, \nbased upon the lessons learned over the last 7 years. These amendments \nwill increase protections and help reduce the water pollution that \nthreatens the environment and public health.\n  First, the Beach Protection Act will increase the funds available to \nStates, and expand the uses of those funds to include tracking the \nsources of pollution that cause beach closures, and supporting \npollution prevention efforts. It will also require EPA to develop \nmethods for rapid testing of beach water, so that results are available \nin 2 hours, instead of 2 days.\n  Secondly, this legislation will strengthen the requirements for \npublic notification of health risks posed by beach water contamination, \nand ensure that all State and local agencies that play a role in \nprotecting the environment and public health are notified of violations \nof water quality standards.\n  Finally, the Beach Protection Act will improve accountability for \nstates that fail to comply with the requirements of the Act.\n  These measures will improve the public's awareness of health risks \nposed by contamination of coastal waters, and create additional tools \nfor addressing the sources of pollution that cause beach closures, \nincluding leaking or overflowing sewer systems and stormwater runoff.\n  Clean water is an economic and public health necessity for New Jersey \nand other coastal states. I have devoted my career to keeping New \nJersey's waters clean and safe for swimming and fishing. The original \nBEACH Act I authored was an important step toward ensuring cleaner, \nsafer beaches. The Beach Protection Act will further strengthen \nprotections for the public and our beaches.\n  I am pleased that Senator Menendez is joining me as an original \ncosponsor of this legislation. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to move this legislation forward toward passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1507. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for drug and health care claims data release; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Baucus in introducing the Access to Medicare Data Act \nof 2007. This legislation is based on S. 3897, the Medicare Data Access \nand Research Act, which Senator Baucus and I introduced in the 109th \nCongress.\n  The bill we are introducing today establishes a framework under which \nFederal agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services \nwould have access to Medicare data, including data collected under the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, to conduct research consistent with \nthe agencies' missions. The legislation also creates a process through \nwhich university-based and other researchers who\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\nmeet a strict set of requirements would be permitted to use Medicare \ndata for research purposes.\n  As I said last year, Medicare data, particularly prescription drug \ndata, are an immense resource that can support critical health services \nresearch, especially research on drug safety. Examining Medicare data \ncould help the FDA identify situations, such as the one involving Vioxx \nmore quickly and to take quick action to protect the public's health \nand safety.\n  But the FDA isn't the only place that this important research can and \nshould occur. The study issued earlier this week in the New England \nJournal of Medicine regarding the prescription medicine Avandia clearly \ndemonstrates that point. Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic found \nthat there are serious problems with Avandia a drug that has been on \nthe market for 8 years and is used to treat diabetes. Specifically, the \nresearchers believe that taking Avandia increases the likelihood that a \ndiabetic patient will have a heart attack and maybe even die. The \nresearchers came to this conclusion after reviewing information from 42 \nclinical trials. Making Medicare data available to researchers like \nthose at the Cleveland Clinic will offer another avenue for them to \ntake in conducting research like this.\n  I want to be clear that, similar to last year's bill, the Access to \nMedicare Data Act won't permit just anyone to get the Medicare data. In \napplying for data access, researchers at universities and other \norganizations will have to meet strict criteria. They must have well-\ndocumented experience in analyzing the type and volume of data to be \nprovided under the agreement. They must agree to publish and publicly \ndisseminate their research methodology and results. They must obtain \napproval for their study from a review board. They must comply with all \nsafeguards established by the Secretary to ensure the confidentiality \nof information. These safeguards cannot permit the disclosure of \ninformation to an extent greater than permitted by the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Privacy Act of 1974.\n  I am hopeful that we can get this bill approved soon. I, for one, \ndon't want to be standing here next year talking about another Vioxx or \nanother Avandia. We need to improve and create more opportunities for \nthe government, as well as other researchers, to spot potential trouble \nwith a drug more quickly and to take swifter steps to protect the \npublic's health and safety. The Access to Medicare Data Act will help \nus accomplish that critical goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n        and Mr. Martinez):\n  S. 1509. A bill to improve United States hurricane forecasting, \nmonitoring, and warning capabilities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \na very important, and timely issue, for constituents all along the Gulf \nCoast, as well as coastal residents along the Atlantic seaboard, the \nneed for accurate hurricane forecasting and tracking. This issue is \nparticularly timely with the 2007 Atlantic Hurricane season beginning \nnext week. According to the National Hurricane Center, 2007 is \nestimated to have between 13 to 17 named storms, 7 to 10 hurricanes, \nand 3 to 5 major hurricanes. When I hear ``three to five major \nhurricanes'' I have to admit it makes me and my constituents a little \nnervous because, in 2005, as the world is well aware, we had another \nactive hurricane season with three major storms, Katrina, Rita and \nWilma impacting the Gulf Coast States. Two of these powerful storms, \nKatrina and Rita, slammed into my State of Louisiana. We lost hundreds \nof lives and thousands of businesses as a result. To this day, the \nregion is still slowly recovering, but by all accounts, the loss of \nlife and property could have been much worse had we not had top notch \nforecasting and tracking of these storms. Accurate monitoring of these \nstorms, from their development in the Gulf and Atlantic Ocean, until \nthey slammed into the Gulf Coast, literally saved lives as thousands of \nresidents were able to evacuate from the impacted areas. This accurate \nforecast, showing residents if they are in the possible ``danger \nzone,'' is provided by the experts in the National Hurricane Center but \nthey cannot do their job without the necessary data. Such data is \nprovided via buoys in the water, Hurricane Hunter Aircraft, radar \nstations on the ground, as well as satellites.\n  With recent advances in technology, I believe sometimes we take for \ngranted these satellites, which are so far removed from our daily \nexistence as to be ``out of sight, out of mind.'' However, they are a \nmajor part of our daily lives as satellites now provide us with our \nradio stations, give us driving directions, bring us our favorite \ntelevision shows. These same satellites also give us views of distant \ngalaxies/stars and allow us to see weather patterns days before they \ncome through our towns. It is this use of weather tracking satellites \nof which I would like to highlight with the upcoming hurricane season. \nAs Hurricane Katrina showed us, Federal and State response plans are \nnot worth the paper they are printed on if you do not know where or \nwhen the disaster might strike. No amount of satellite phones or \nstockpiles of supplies are helpful if they are on the other side of the \ncountry when a disaster hits. Pre-positioning personnel and supplies \nahead of a disaster, as well as efficient evacuations of residents from \na possible disaster area depends just as much on accurate weather \nforecasting as it does on efficient planning. That is why these weather \nsatellites are so key, they allow experts to say with some certainty \nthat one area will be out of harm's way while another area is in \npotential danger.\n  One of these weather satellites is the Quick Scatterometer, or \nQuikSCAT satellite. QuikSCAT is an ocean-observing satellite launched \nin June 1999 to replace the capability of the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration Scatterometer, NSCAT, satellite. The NSCAT lost \npower in 1997, 9 months after launch in September 1996. QuikSCAT has \nthe objective of improving weather forecasts near coastlines by using \nwind data in numerical weather-and-wave prediction. It also was \nlaunched with the purpose of improving hurricane warning/monitoring as \nwell as serving as the next ``El Nino watcher'' for NASA. This \nparticular satellite was instrumental in accurate tracking of Tropical \nStorm, later Hurricane Katrina, as it provided NOAA experts with \naccurate data on the wind speed and direction for Katrina. It gives \nexperts an estimate of the size of the tropical storm winds and the \nhurricane winds.\n\n  Given how important this satellite is for hurricane forecasting, many \nin Congress including myself are concerned as this essential satellite \nis currently 5 years over its intended 3 year lifespan and could fail \nat any moment. I am aware that there are ongoing discussions in terms \nof getting a replacement satellite for QuikSCAT but it is just that, \ndiscussions. As it stands today, there are currently no contingency \nplans in place should this satellite fail and no program in place to \nfast track a next-generation QuikSCAT. What would the impact be you ask \nif this satellite fails? Well, according to Bill Proenza, Director of \nthe National Hurricane Center, without QuikSCAT, hurricane forecasting \nwould be 16 percent less accurate 72 hours before hurricane landfall \nand 10 percent less accurate 48 hours before hurricane landfall. This \nloss of accuracy means a great deal for those impacted by future storms \nas experts would have to expand the area possibly impacted to fully \nensure those impacted were properly warned. For example, a 16 percent \nloss of accuracy at 72 hours before landfall would increase the area \nexpected to be under hurricane danger from 197 miles to 228 miles on \naverage. With a 10 percent loss of accuracy at 48 hours before \nlandfall, the area expected to be under hurricane danger would rise \nfrom 136 miles to 150 miles on average. Greater inaccuracy of this type \nwould lead to more ``false alarm'' evacuations along the Gulf Coast and \nAtlantic Coast and, as a result, decrease the possibility of impacted \npopulations sufficiently heeding mandatory evacuations. As someone who \nhas spent my whole life in Louisiana and who has been through many \nhurricanes, I can tell you that if someone evacuates and then the storm \nturns or does not impact their area,\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\nthey are less likely to evacuate for the next storm. It is human nature \nand although Katrina has left many in my part of the country more \nattentive to evacuation orders, as time passes certainly people will \nnot heed orders if inaccurate hurricane forecasts cause them to pack \ntheir belongings and rush away from their homes, only to have the storm \nhit another State. So it is essential to provide the National Hurricane \nCenter and NOAA with the tools they need to get the forecast right and \nbetter prepare coastal residents for future hurricanes and storms.\n  With this in mind, I am introducing today the Improved Hurricane \nTracking and Forecasting Act of 2007. I am proud to be joined on this \nlegislation by Senators Kerry, Bill Nelson, and Martinez. My colleagues \nfrom Florida spend much time working on hurricane preparedness and I am \nhonored to have their support on this bill, as well as the support from \nmy friend from Massachusetts. This broad array of support from senators \nfrom both the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast shows how essential this \nparticular satellite program is for our coastal residents. Furthermore, \nmy colleague from Louisiana, Representative Charlie Melancon, \nintroduced the House version of this bill along with Representative Ron \nKlein from Florida.\n  This is very straightforward bill as it authorizes $375 million for a \nnew satellite. QuikSCAT is 5 years past its projected lifespan and a \nnew replacement is needed so this bill fills the need. The funds would \ngo to NOAA for the design and launch of an improved QuikSCAT satellite. \nThis new satellite would take advantage of recent advances in \ntechnology and maintain continuity of operations for the current \nQuikSCAT weather forecasting and warning capabilities. To ensure that \nwe are not left in another position like this, with an ailing satellite \nin space and no contingency plans for a replacement, this bill also \ninstitutes some reporting requirements for the new QuikSCAT satellite. \nWhen this satellite is launched, NOAA would be required to update \nCongress on the operational status of the satellite and its data \ncapabilities. I believe this is a commonsense requirement which would \nput the Congress in a position in the future to fast track \nauthorization or funding should it be necessary, rather than having to \nplay catch up.\n  I strongly believe this bill is necessary to protect our coastal \nresidents from future hurricanes. This is because, according to the \nU.S. Census Bureau, close to 53 percent of the U.S. population resides \nwithin the first 50 miles of the coast. You also have to take into \naccount that although hurricanes usually hit the Gulf Coast or southern \nAtlantic Coast, hurricanes have and possibly will strike the more \npopulous northeast Atlantic Coast. Hurricane Katrina devastated \nAlabama, Louisiana and Mississippi but consider the same magnitude of \nstorm striking heavily populated New York, Massachusetts, or \nPennsylvania it would not only devastate the region but leave the \nNation's financial and commerce centers in ruins. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation since it will help improve hurricane \nforecasting and will maintain continuity of operations for current \nhurricane forecasting and warning capabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and articles \nrelating to QuikSCAT be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Hurricane Tracking \n     and Forecasting Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Scatterometers on satellites are state-of-the-art radar \n     instruments which operate by transmitting high-frequency \n     microwave pulses to the ocean surface and measuring echoed \n     radar pulses bounced back to the satellite.\n       (2) Scatterometers can acquire hundreds of times more \n     observations of surface wind velocity each day than can ships \n     and buoys, and are the only remote-sensing systems able to \n     provide continuous, accurate and high-resolution measurements \n     of both wind speeds and direction regardless of weather \n     conditions.\n       (3) The Quick Scatterometer satellite (QuikSCAT) is an \n     ocean-observing satellite launched on June 19, 1999, to \n     replace the capability of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration Scatterometer (NSCAT), an instrument which \n     lost power in 1997, 9 months after launch in September 1996.\n       (4) The QuikSCAT satellite has the operational objective of \n     improving weather forecasts near coastlines by using wind \n     data in numerical weather-and-wave prediction, as well as \n     improve hurricane warning and monitoring and acting as the \n     next ``El Nino watcher'' for the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration.\n       (5) The QuikSCAT satellite was built in just 12 months and \n     was launched with a 3-year design life, but continues to \n     perform per specifications, with its backup transmitter, as \n     it enters into its 8th year--5 years past its projected \n     lifespan.\n       (6) The QuikSCAT satellite provides daily coverage of 90 \n     percent of the world's oceans, and its data has been a vital \n     contribution to National Weather Service forecasts and \n     warnings over water since 2000.\n       (7) Despite its continuing performance, the QuikSCAT \n     satellite is well beyond its expected design life and a \n     replacement is urgently needed because, according to the \n     National Hurricane Center, without the QuikSCAT satellite--\n       (A) hurricane forecasting would be 16 percent less accurate \n     72 hours before hurricane landfall and 10 percent less \n     accurate 48 hours before hurricane landfall resulting in--\n       (i) with a 16 percent loss of accuracy at 72 hours before \n     landfall, the area expected to be under hurricane danger \n     would rise from 197 miles to 228 miles on average; and\n       (ii) with a 10 percent loss of accuracy at 48 hours before \n     landfall, the area expected to be under hurricane danger \n     would rise from 136 miles to 150 miles on average; and\n       (B) greater inaccuracy of this type would lead to more \n     ``false alarm'' evacuations along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic \n     Coast and decrease the possibility of impacted populations \n     sufficiently heeding mandatory evacuations.\n       (8) According to recommendations in the National Academies \n     of Science report entitled ``Decadal Survey'', a next \n     generation ocean surface wind vector satellite mission is \n     needed during the three year period beginning in 2013.\n       (9) According to the National Hurricane Center, a next \n     generation ocean surface vector wind satellite is needed to \n     take advantage of current technologies that already exist to \n     overcome current limitations of the QuikSCAT satellite and \n     enhance the capabilities of the National Hurricane Center to \n     better warn coastal residents of possible hurricanes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

NASA's QuikSCAT polar \n     satellite is running on borrowed time and may soon leave \n     forecasters--and therefore the general public--without the \n     best, most precise information about how powerful approaching \n     storms might become, a top hurricane official warned. And \n     there's nothing to replace it. ``We are already on its backup \n     transmitter,'' Bill Proenza, director of the National \n     Hurricane Center, told a crowd of about 4,000 Wednesday at \n     the first day of the Governor's Hurricane Conference in Fort \n     Lauderdale. ``When we lose that, that satellite is gone.''\n       Proenza said the QuikSCAT satellite, launched in 1999, \n     could take up to five years and $400 million to replace. The \n     satellite was only designed to operate for three to five \n     years, the new director of the hurricane center said. Proenza \n     recently replaced Max Mayfield as director. ``I came in and \n     was very concerned it wasn't being addressed,'' Proenza said \n     in an interview with Florida Today. Proenza said he has \n     emphasized the satellite's importance to top officials from \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n       QuikSCAT measures broad windfields, giving forecasters a \n     bigger picture of storms than ships or aircraft. Last year, \n     the satellite's data revealed that what forecasters thought a \n     weak tropical storm was really Hurricane Helene, a Category 2 \n     hurricane. Kinks in an infrared camera and $3 billion in cost \n     overruns have stalled the next generation of weather \n     satellites, threatening a three-year or longer gap in \n     coverage from orbiters that loop the Earth's poles and help \n     predict where the next big hurricane will hit. The gap could \n     worsen forecast errors from a few miles to a few hundred \n     miles.\n       The precision of the two-day forecast would drop 10 \n     percent, Proenza said, and the three-day forecast by 16 \n     percent. Either loss in accuracy would equate to landfall \n     predictions being off by potentially hundreds of miles in \n     Florida, since storms approach at a steep angle.\n       Officials rely on precise predictions for tracks to avoid \n     expensive, unnecessary evacuations--or worse, a failure to \n     evacuate those in harm's way. A QuikSCAT failure and less \n     precise predictions could lead to ``hurricane fatigue,'' with \n     more people deciding to take their chances against \n     approaching storms, officials said. ``There will be more \n     cries of wolf,'' said Charlie Roberts, senior emergency \n     management coordinator for Brevard County (Fla.) Emergency \n     Management. ``And the probability of us jumping the gun \n     increases.''\n       Launches of six replacement satellites were to start in \n     2009. But engineering difficulties with the satellites' \n     cameras, bureaucratic snags and other delays caused the cost \n     of the project to skyrocket to $10 billion--about 30 percent \n     over budget--triggering a Department of Defense review of the \n     project. Now, the earliest launch for the first replacement \n     satellites would be 2012.\n       Forecasters worry that if the last of a fleet of older-\n     generation satellites, planned for launch in late 2007, fails \n     at or shortly after liftoff--one in 10 do--they would have \n     insufficient satellite coverage beyond 2010. Longer high-\n     altitude aerial flights could help make up for breaks in \n     satellite forecast coverage. But airplanes are only good for \n     forecasting small regions surrounding the storms, not the \n     three- to five-day forecasts so vital for evacuation \n     planning, Proenza said. Other NASA or European satellites may \n     help compensate for some data lapses, too, but many of those \n     are designed to gather long-term climate data, not storm \n     information.\n       ``I would like to see something that would last 10 years,'' \n     Proenza said of a QuikSCAT replacement. ``NOAA needs to take \n     it as a top priority from here.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, March 16, 2007]\n\n      Expert Warns of Worse Hurricane Forecasts if Satellite Fails\n\n                          (By Jessica Gresko)\n\n       Miami.--Certain hurricane forecasts could be up to 16 \n     percent less accurate if a key weather satellite that is \n     already beyond its expected lifespan fails, the National \n     Hurricane Center's new director said Friday in calling for \n     hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding for expanded \n     research and predictions.\n       Bill Proenza also told the Associated Press in an wide-\n     ranging interview that ties between global warming and \n     increased hurricane strength seemed a ``natural linkage.'' \n     But he cautioned that other weather conditions currently play \n     a larger part in determining the strength and number of \n     hurricanes.\n       One of Proenza's immediate concerns is the so-called \n     ``QuikScat'' weather satellite, which lets forecasters \n     measure basics such as wind speed. Replacing it would take at \n     least four years even if the estimated $400 million cost were \n     available immediately, he said.\n       It is currently in its seventh year of operation and was \n     expected to last five, Proenza said, and it is only a matter \n     of time until it fails. Without the satellite providing key \n     data, Proenza said, both two- and three-day forecasts of a \n     storm's path would be affected. The two-day forecast could be \n     10 percent worse while the three-day one could be affected up \n     to 16 percent, Proenza said. That would mean longer stretches \n     of coastline would have to be placed under warnings, and more \n     people than necessary would have to evacuate.\n       Average track errors last year were about 100 miles on two-\n     day forecasts and 150 miles on three-day predictions. Track \n     errors have been cut in half over the past 15 years. Losing \n     QuikScat could erode some of those gains, Proenza \n     acknowlegded, adding he did not know of any plans to replace \n     It.\n       Proenza, 62, also discussed a series of other concerns, \n     naming New Orleans, the Northeast and the Florida Keys as \n     among the areas most vulnerable to hurricanes. Apart from \n     working with the media and emergency managers to help \n     vulnerable residents prepare, he proposed having students \n     come up with plans at school to discuss with their parents.\n       He said he believes hundreds of millions of dollars more \n     money is needed to better understand storms. At the same \n     time, he strongly opposed a proposal to close any of the \n     National Weather Service's 122 offices around the nation or \n     have them operate part time, saying ``weather certainly \n     doesh't take a holiday.''\n       Proenza took over one of meteorology's most highly visible \n     posts in January. His predecessor, Max Mayfield, had held the \n     top spot for six years.\n       Like Mayfield, Proenza stressed the importance of \n     preparedness, but he also set out slightly different \n     positions. Global warming was one of them. Last year, the \n     Caribbean and western Atlantic had the second-highest sea \n     temperatures since 1930, but the season turned out to be \n     quieter than expected, Proenza said. ``So there's got to be \n     other factors working and impacting hurricanes and tropical \n     storms than just sea surface temperatures or global \n     warming,'' he said.\n       His comments distinguished him from Mayfield, who had said \n     climate change didn't substantially enhance hurricane \n     activity, especially the number of storms. Both men talked \n     about being in a period of heightened hurricane activity \n     since 1995, as part of a natural fluctuation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       [From the Institute for Emergency Management, May 2, 2007]\n\n                  Failing Hurricane Tracking Satellite\n\n       Hurricanes take lives and destroy property along the Gulf \n     and Atlantic coasts virtually every year. The danger to lives \n     and property is increasing as more and more people move to \n     the coastlines. Over 50 percent of the U.S. population lives \n     within 50 miles of the coast. Of this population, 7 million \n     have moved to the coast since 2005--many of these people have \n     never faced a hurricane before.\n       As coastlines become more densely populated, longer lead \n     times are needed to evacuate each area threatened by a storm. \n     As a result, hurricane forecasting tools have become \n     increasingly important. The nation's principal forecast \n     agencies are the National Weather Service and the National \n     Hurricane Center. The National Hurricane Center uses a \n     variety of scientific instruments and tools, including \n     satllites, reconnaissance planes, radar, and weather-sensing \n     devices. One very crucial forecasting tool is the QuikSCAT \n     satellite.\n       The QuikSCAT satellite was launched in 1999 by NASA's Jet \n     Propulsion Laboratory, and was expected to last until 2002. \n     It includes an experimental sensor to determine a Hurricane's \n     intensity and wind patterns. It is like a storm's X-ray, \n     showing the inner structure of a hurricane. The QuikSCAT is \n     still functioning, but it is now 8 years old, five years past \n     its projected lifespan. If it fails, tbe consequences could \n     be dire.\n       There is considerable uncertainty about the path of a \n     hurricane. When a storm is far out at sea, a large section of \n     the coastline is identified as being a potential landfall \n     site. As the storm gets closer, the area of expected landfall \n     shrinks down. Since cities and communities have to evacuate \n     many hours before expected landfall, it is important to know \n     as early as possible where a storm might strike. Most cities \n     along the coast require more than 36 hours to safely evacuate \n     the majority of their residents. If there are large numbers \n     of citizens without cars or the ability to move, the time \n     needed to evacuate becomes considerably longer. In 2005, good \n     forecasting prompted timely evacuations of appropriate areas, \n     and was responsible for saving thousands of lives threatened \n     by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.\n       Without the QuikSCAT, the National Hurricane Center has \n     estimated that hurricane forecasting would be l6 percent less \n     accurate 72 hours before Hurricane landfall and 10 percent \n     less accurate 48 hours before landfall. With a 16 percent \n     loss of accuracy at 72 hours before landfall, the area \n     expected to be under hurricane danger would rise from 197 \n     miles to 228 miles, on the average. With a 10 percent loss of \n     accuracy at 48 hours before landfall, the average area under \n     hurricane danger would rise from 136 miles to 150 miles.\n       More communities being warned is not better. Greater \n     inaccuracy will lead to many\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\n     ``false alarms.'' If communities are evacuated multiple \n     times, but do not suffer a direct hit, people will stop \n     responding to evacuation mandates. There has been no \n     assessment of how the loss of forecasting accuracy would \n     impact deaths or damages from potential storms all along the \n     Gulf and Atlantic coasts.\n\n\n       Why Hurricane Hunter Aircraft Cannot Replace the QUikScAT\n\n       The valiant Hurricane Hunter aircraft, managed by the U.S. \n     Air Force Reserves, are important tools for assessing a \n     developing storm. Hurricane Hunter pilots fly directly into \n     the storm and gather data along the flight path. The crafts \n     have been provided with ``active microwave scatterometers,'' \n     technology similar to what is installed in the QuikSCAT. This \n     technology, installed at a cost of $10 million, allows the \n     aircraft to gather the same kind of data that the QuikSCAT \n     collects.\n       However, the Hurricane Hunter craft cannot replace the \n     QuikSCAT satellite. This is easiest to explain through \n     analogy. Hurricane Katrina's massive storm winds filled the \n     entire Gulf of Mexico and the storm system towered miles into \n     the atmosphere. Imagine that the whole area covered by such a \n     massive storm is an extremely large fishing pond. A single \n     plane gathering data is like a tiny fishing line collecting \n     data only along the single strand of the line. The satellite, \n     on the other hand, provides rich, detailed data horizontally \n     from one side of the storm to the other side, and vertically, \n     from the ocean surface to the top of the storm's swirling \n     winds. The QuikSCAT is like a detailed MRI.\n\n\n                            Looking Forward\n\n       Designing and launching a replacement satellite for the \n     aging QuikSCAT will take from three to five years and cost \n     approximately $375 million. No plans are currently in place \n     to replace the satellite, but if it stops functioning, we \n     will face serious consequences. Dr. William M. Gray, storm \n     forecaster, has predicted 17 named storms for 2007, including \n     nine hurricanes, with five of them being intense.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1510. A bill require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \npromulgate consumer product safety rules concerning the safety and \nlabeling of portable generators; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, over the last several years, \nhundreds of Americans have died from inhaling the poisonous carbon \nmonoxide emitted by portable, gas-powered generators. It is well past \ntime for Congress to step in and end these needless deaths. That is why \ntoday I am introducing the Portable Generator Safety Act of 2007.\n  As most of us know, portable generators are frequently used to \nprovide electricity during temporary power outages. These generators \nuse fuel-burning engines that give off poisonous carbon monoxide gas in \ntheir exhaust.\n  Every hurricane season, news stories come from Florida and elsewhere \nabout people killed or seriously injured by carbon monoxide poisoning \ncaused by portable generators. From 2000 through 2006, at least 260 \ncarbon monoxide poisoning deaths were reported to the U.S. Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. In the last 3 months of 2006 alone, 32 \npeople died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators. These \npeople died because portable generators are not manufactured to \nautomatically cut off when high carbon monoxide levels are reached, and \nbecause generators still do not have adequate carbon monoxide warning \nlabels.\n  Here is what is especially troubling about these senseless deaths: \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission has studied and known for years \nthat people were dying from carbon monoxide poisoning at an incredibly \nalarming rate. In study after study, Commission staff has recognized \nthe high death rate from portable generators, and found that current \nregulations are inadequate to protect consumers. In January of this \nyear, the Commission finally adopted warning label requirements for \nportable generators, nearly 10 years after they started looking into \nthe issue. While I appreciate this initial step, I remain very troubled \nthat the Commission again refused to take the most logical step, \nadoption of mandatory Federal safety standards.\n  Enough is enough. Industry self-regulation, which works in some \nsettings, clearly is not working in this area. Congress must now step \nin and do its part to eliminate these tragic and avoidable deaths.\n  My bill, the Portable Generator Safety Act of 2007, takes some \nsimple, common sense steps. The bill requires the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to pass tough Federal regulations within 180 days of \nenactment of this bill. The new regulations would have three key \ncomponents.\n  First, every portable generator would be required to have a sensor \nthat automatically shuts off the generator before lethal levels of \ncarbon monoxide are reached. Other products, such as portable heaters, \nalready contain these types of sensors, and they save lives.\n  Second, every portable generator must have clearly written warnings \non the packaging, in the instruction manual accompanying the generator, \nand on the generator itself. In January, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission issued new regulations requiring placement of warning labels \non generators. Unfortunately, these labels are not as clear as they \nshould be. This bill will require clear, easy-to-read warnings that \nconsumers will read both when they purchase the generators and when \nthey power them up in emergency situations.\n  Third, this legislation will require the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission to carry out a comprehensive education program warning the \npublic of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n  How many more innocent people must die before we require the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission and the portable generator industry to take \nsome sensible, pro-consumer steps? The National Hurricane Center just \nissued its 2007 hurricane season forecast, and it looks like we will \nhave an above-average year for hurricane activity. I hope we are not \nback here at the end of the year asking these same questions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text in the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Portable Generator Safety \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Portable generators are frequently used to provide \n     electricity during temporary power outages. These generators \n     use fuel-burning engines that emit carbon monoxide gas in \n     their exhaust.\n       (2) In the last several years, hundreds of people \n     nationwide have been seriously injured or killed due to \n     exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from portable \n     generators. From 2000 through 2006, at least 260 carbon \n     monoxide poisoning deaths related to portable generator use \n     were reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In \n     the last three months of 2006 alone, 32 carbon monoxide \n     deaths were linked to generator use.\n       (3) Virtually all of the serious injuries and deaths due to \n     carbon monoxide from portable generators were preventable. In \n     many instances, consumers simply were unaware of the hazards \n     posed by carbon monoxide.\n       (4) Since at least 1997, a priority of the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission has been to reduce injuries and deaths \n     resulting from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n       (5) On January 4, 2007, the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission adopted certain labeling standards for portable \n     generators (section 1407 of title 16, Code of Federal \n     Regulations), but such standards do not go far enough to \n     reduce substantially the potential harm to consumers.\n       (6) The issuance of mandatory safety standards and labeling \n     requirements to warn consumers of the dangers associated with \n     portable generator carbon monoxide would reduce the risk of \n     injury or death.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The warning label shall include \n     the word ``DANGER'' printed in a large font that is no \n     smaller than 1 inch tall, and shall include the following \n     information, at a minimum, presented in a clear manner:\n       (A) Indoor use of a portable generator can kill quickly.\n       (B) Portable generators should be used outdoors only and \n     away from garages and open windows.\n       (C) Portable generators produce carbon monoxide, a \n     poisonous gas that people cannot see or smell.\n       (2) Pictogram.--Each portable generator sold to the public \n     for purposes other than resale shall have a large pictogram, \n     affixed to the portable generator, which clearly states \n     ``POISONOUS GAS'' and visually depicts the harmful effects of \n     breathing carbon monoxide.\n       (3) Instruction manual.--The instruction manual, if any, \n     that accompanies any portable generator sold to the public \n     for purposes other than resale shall include detailed, clear, \n     and conspicuous statements that include the following \n     elements:\n       (A) A warning that portable generators emit carbon \n     monoxide, a poisonous gas that can kill people.\n       (B) A warning that people cannot smell, see, or taste \n     carbon monoxide.\n       (C) An instruction to operate portable generators only \n     outdoors and away from windows, garages, and air intakes.\n       (D) An instruction never to operate portable generators \n     inside homes, garages, sheds, or other semi-enclosed spaces, \n     even if a person runs a fan or opens doors and windows.\n       (E) A warning that if a person begins to feel sick, dizzy, \n     or weak while using a portable generator, that person should \n     shut off the portable generator, get to fresh air \n     immediately, and consult a doctor.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUBLIC OUTREACH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission shall establish a program of public outreach to \n     inform consumers of the dangers associated with the emission \n     of carbon monoxide from portable generators.\n       (b) Time.--The program required by subsection (a) shall \n     place emphasis on informing consumers of the dangers \n     described in such subsection during the start of each \n     hurricane season.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1511. A bill to promote the development and use of marine and \nhydrokinetic renewable energy technologies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \ncreate opportunities in the development and use of marine and \nhydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. I want to thank my \ncolleagues Senator Murkowski and Senator Snowe for cosponsoring this \nmeasure.\n  We must work to encourage the production of clean, nongreenhouse gas \nemitting renewable energy. Ocean energy has the potential to be one of \nthe largest sources of low-cost renewable energy in the United States \nby utilizing the power generated by waves in our oceans and major \nrivers, as well as tidal, current, and thermal power to generate \nturbine-powered electricity. As we look at ways to increase our \nrenewable energy portfolio as a Nation, and decrease our dependence on \noil, we would be remiss if we did not fully research and utilize the \npower that could be harnessed through water resources. I am acutely \naware of this need in Hawaii, as we are an island State with finite \nnatural resources, and who understand the necessity of environmentally \nfriendly solutions to our energy problems. The ocean sits at our \ndoorstep, providing us with sustenance in many different forms. To \nignore the potential it can offer as a major source of renewable clean \nenergy, not only in Hawaii, but for our entire country, would be a \nwaste.\n  While the Energy Policy Act of 2005 qualified ocean energy for \nresearch assistance, grants and the federal purchase credit, various \nforms of ocean energy projects have yet to receive equitable funding.\n  According to the Electric Power Research Institute, ocean energy has \nthe potential to generate 252 million megawatt hours of electricity. \nThis represents 6.5 percent of today's entire energy portfolio. \nEuropean nations, such as Portugal and Scotland, have successfully \nimplemented commercial wave farms that are consistently producing clean \npower for consumer use. While the technology is not developed to the \nfullest, there is great potential.\n  However, ocean energy projects do not enjoy a production tax credit, \nan investment tax credit, or any other financial incentive currently \nbeing utilized by wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other renewable \nenergy resources.\n  This bill levels the playing field allowing ocean energy projects to \nbe eligible for the financial and tax incentives that other renewable \ntechnologies receive. This will allow ocean energy projects to compete \nequitably in the future with other forms of renewable energy.\n  In order to work toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and our \ndependence on fossil fuels, we must do all that we can to encourage the \ndevelopment and production of many different renewable energy \ntechnologies, such as ocean, wind, geothermal, biomass, ethanol, and \nothers. Achieving our goals will only be possible if we approach the \nproblem from many angles, and together, we will make an impact. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Marine and Hydrokinetic \n     Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the term ``marine and \n     hydrokinetic renewable energy'' means electrical energy \n     from--\n       (1) waves, tides, and currents in oceans, estuaries, and \n     tidal areas;\n       (2) free flowing water in rivers, lakes, and streams;\n       (3) free flowing water in man-made channels, including \n     projects that utilize nonmechanical structures to accelerate \n     the flow of water for electric power production purposes; and\n       (4) differentials in ocean temperature (ocean thermal \n     energy conversion).\n\n     The term shall not include energy from any source that \n     utilizes a dam, diversionary structure, or impoundment for \n     electric power purposes, except as provided in paragraph (3).\n\n     SEC. 3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) Program.--The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, \n     shall establish a program of marine and hydrokinetic \n     renewable energy research focused on--\n       (1) developing and demonstrating marine and hydrokinetic \n     renewable energy technologies;\n       (2) reducing the manufacturing and operation costs of \n     marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies;\n       (3) increasing the reliability and survivability of marine \n     and hydrokinetic renewable energy facilities;\n       (4) integrating marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \n     into electric grids;\n       (5) identifying opportunities for cross fertilization and \n     development of economies of scale between offshore wind and \n     marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy sources;\n       (6) identifying, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, the environmental \n     impacts of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \n     technologies and ways to address adverse impacts, and \n     providing public information concerning technologies and \n     other means available for monitoring and determining \n     environmental impacts; and\n       (7) standards development, demonstration, and technology \n     transfer for advanced systems engineering and system \n     integration methods to identify critical interfaces.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy for carrying \n     out this section $50,000,000 for each of the fiscal years \n     2008 through 2017.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the use of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \n     technologies can avoid contributions to global warming gases, \n     and such technologies can be produced domestically;\n       (2) marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy is a nascent \n     industry; and\n       (3) the United States must work to promote new renewable \n     energy technologies that reduce contributions to global \n     warming gases and improve our country's domestic energy \n     production in a manner that is consistent with environmental \n     protection, recreation, and other public values.\n       (b) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy shall establish \n     an Adaptive Management and Environmental Fund, and shall\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\n     lend amounts from that fund to entities described in \n     subsection (f) to cover the costs of projects that produce \n     marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. Such costs include \n     design, fabrication, deployment, operation, monitoring, and \n     decommissioning costs. Loans under this section may be \n     subordinate to project-related loans provided by commercial \n     lending institutions to the extent the Secretary of Energy \n     considers appropriate.\n       (c) Reasonable Access.--As a condition of receiving a loan \n     under this section, a recipient shall provide reasonable \n     access, to Federal or State agencies and other research \n     institutions as the Secretary considers appropriate, to the \n     project area and facilities for the purposes of independent \n     environmental research.\n       (d) Public Availability.--The results of any assessment or \n     demonstration paid for, in whole or in part, with funds \n     provided under this section shall be made available to the \n     public, except to the extent that they contain information \n     that is protected from disclosure under section 552(b) of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n       (e) Repayment of Loans.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy shall require a \n     recipient of a loan under this section to repay the loan, \n     plus interest at a rate of 2.1 percent per year, over a \n     period not to exceed 20 years, beginning after the commercial \n     generation of electric power from the project commences. Such \n     repayment shall be required at a rate that takes into account \n     the economic viability of the loan recipient and ensures \n     regular and timely repayment of the loan.\n       (2) Beginning of repayment period.--No repayments shall be \n     required under this subsection until after the project \n     generates net proceeds. For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     term ``net proceeds'' means proceeds from the commercial sale \n     of electricity after payment of project-related costs, \n     including taxes and regulatory fees that have not been paid \n     using funds from a loan provided for the project under this \n     section.\n       (3) Termination.--Repayment of a loan made under this \n     section shall terminate as of the date that the project for \n     which the loan was provided ceases commercial generation of \n     electricity if a governmental permitting authority has \n     ordered the closure of the facility because of a finding that \n     the project has unacceptable adverse environmental impacts, \n     except that the Secretary shall require a loan recipient to \n     continue making loan repayments for the cost of equipment, \n     obtained using funds from the loan that have not otherwise \n     been repaid under rules established by the Secretary, that is \n     utilized in a subsequent project for the commercial \n     generation of electricity.\n       (f) Adaptive Management Plan.--In order to receive a loan \n     under this section, an applicant for a Federal license or \n     permit to construct, operate, or maintain a marine or \n     hydrokinetic renewable energy project shall provide to the \n     Federal agency with primary jurisdiction to issue such \n     license or permit an adaptive management plan for the \n     proposed project. Such plan shall--\n       (1) be prepared in consultation with other parties to the \n     permitting or licensing proceeding, including all Federal, \n     State, municipal, and tribal agencies with authority under \n     applicable Federal law to require or recommend design or \n     operating conditions, for protection, mitigation, and \n     enhancement of fish and wildlife resources, water quality, \n     navigation, public safety, land reservations, or recreation, \n     for incorporation into the permit or license;\n       (2) set forth specific and measurable objectives for the \n     protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife \n     resources, water quality, navigation, public safety, land \n     reservations, or recreation, as required or recommended by \n     governmental agencies described in paragraph (1), and shall \n     require monitoring to ensure that these objectives are met;\n       (3) provide specifically for the modification or, if \n     necessary, removal of the marine or hydrokinetic renewable \n     energy project based on findings by the licensing or \n     permitting agency that the marine or hydrokinetic renewable \n     energy project has not attained or will not attain the \n     specific and measurable objectives set forth in paragraph \n     (2); and\n       (4) be approved and incorporated in the Federal license or \n     permit.\n       (g) Sunset.--The Secretary of Energy shall transmit a \n     report to the Congress when the Secretary of Energy \n     determines that the technologies supported under this Act \n     have achieved a level of maturity sufficient to enable the \n     expiration of the programs under this Act. The Secretary of \n     Energy shall not make any new loans under this section after \n     the report is transmitted under this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.\n\n       The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall, in cooperation with the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission and the Secretary of Energy, and in consultation \n     with appropriate State agencies, jointly prepare programmatic \n     environmental impact statements which contain all the \n     elements of an environmental impact statement under section \n     102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4332), regarding the impacts of the deployment of \n     marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies in the \n     navigable waters of the United States. One programmatic \n     environmental impact statement shall be prepared under this \n     section for each of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     regions of the United States. The agencies shall issue the \n     programmatic environmental impact statements under this \n     section not later than 18 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act. The programmatic environmental impact statements \n     shall evaluate among other things the potential impacts of \n     site selection on fish and wildlife and related habitat. \n     Nothing in this section shall operate to delay consideration \n     of any application for a license or permit for a marine and \n     hydrokinetic renewable energy technology project.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nauthorize grant programs to enhance the access of low-income African-\nAmerican students to higher education; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, as a college education becomes ever more \nimperative for economic success, both for individual citizens and for \nour Nation, a growing number of African-American students enroll in \ncolleges whose mission includes a focus on educating minority students. \nAnd, over the years, Congress has acknowledged the important role of \nsimilar institutions, recognizing for example, Historically Black \nColleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions, by \nestablishing grant programs to support their missions. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation to recognize the importance of Predominantly \nBlack Institutions as an essential component of the American system of \nhigher education.\n  The Predominantly Black Institution designation recognizes urban and \nrural colleges, many of which are 2-year community or technical \ncolleges, which serve a large proportion of African-American students, \nmost of whom are the first in their families to attend college, and \nmost of whom receive financial aid. These students have already beaten \nthe odds to progress this far, and it is fitting that we offer some \nsupport to the institutions they attend, to ensure that the education \nthey receive is worthy of their efforts.\n  Whereas Predominantly Black Institutions and Historically Black \nColleges and Universities both serve African-American students, they \ndiffer in ways that necessitate this legislation. Historically Black \nColleges and Universities are not required to serve needy students, \nwhereas Predominantly Black Institution must serve at least 50 percent \nlow-income or first-generation college students. Historically Black \nColleges and Universities, by definition, were established prior to \n1964, whereas PBIs are of more recent origin.\n  Approximately 75 institutions, and more than a quarter of a million \nstudents, would benefit from grants awarded as a result of the \nPredominantly Black Institution designation. Grants could be used for a \nvariety of purposes, from acquiring laboratory equipment to supporting \nteacher education to establishing community outreach programs for pre-\ncollege students.\n  Legislation to establish Predominantly Black Institutions was \nintroduced last year by my good friend from Illinois, Congressman Danny \nDavis. I urge my Senate colleagues to consider the needs of these \nstudents, to support their colleges and universities, and to join me in \nthis effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1514. A bill to revise and extend provisions under the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a bill I am introducing \nwith my colleagues, Senator Smith and Senator Reed. The bill is a \nreauthorization of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, a landmark \nlegislation enacted nearly three years ago that significantly \nstrengthened our commitment as a Nation to reduce the public and mental \nhealth tragedy of youth suicide. I would like to take a moment to thank \nmy colleagues who joined me in this effort, particularly Senator Smith. \nWe all know the personal tragedy Senator Smith, his wife, Sharon, and \ntheir family suffered when their son and brother, Garrett, took his \nlife over 3 years ago. Since that time, Senator Smith and Sharon have \nbecome tireless advocates in advancing the cause of youth suicide \nprevention, and their work should be commended.\n  Three years after this important legislation became law, suicide \namong our Nation's young people remains an acute crisis that knows no \ngeographic, racial, ethnic, cultural, or socioeconomic boundaries. Each \nyear, almost 3,000 young people take their lives, making suicide the \nthird overall cause of death between the ages of 10 and 24. Young \npeople under the age of 25 account for 15 percent of all suicides \ncompleted. In fact, more children and young adults die from their own \nhand than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke and \nchronic lung disease combined.\n  Equally alarming are the numbers of young people who consider taking \nor attempt to take their lives. Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention figures estimate that almost 3 million high school students, \nor 20 percent of young adults between the ages of 15 and 19, consider \nsuicide every year. Furthermore, over 2 million children and young \nadults actually attempt suicide each year. Seventy percent of people \nwho die by suicide tell someone about it in advance. Yet, tragically, \nfew of these young people do not receive appropriate intervention \nservices before it's too late.\n  When it was enacted into law, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act \nbecame the first legislation specifically designed to prevent youth \nsuicide. The legislation established a new grant initiative for the \nfurther development and expansion of youth suicide early intervention \nand prevention strategies and the community-based services they seek to \ncoordinate. It additionally authorized a dedicated technical assistance \ncenter to assist States, localities, tribes, and community service \nproviders with the planning, implementation, and evaluation of these \nstrategies and services. It also established a new grant initiative to \nenhance and improve early intervention and prevention services \nspecifically designed for college-aged students. Lastly, it created a \nnew inter-agency collaboration to focus on policy development and the \ndissemination of data specifically pertaining to youth suicide. I am \npleased to say that to date, 29 States, 7 tribes, and 55 colleges and \nuniversities have benefitted from $63.4 million in resources to \nincrease their services to youth, provided by the Garrett Lee Smith \nMemorial Act.\n  The bill we introduce today seeks to continue the good work started \nby the initial legislation. First, it authorizes $210 million over 5 \nyears for continued development and expansion of statewide youth \nsuicide prevention and early intervention strategies. Second, it \nauthorizes $31 million over 5 years to continue assisting college \ncampuses meet the needs of their students. And third, it authorizes $25 \nmillion over 5 years to continue the vital research on suicide \nprevention for all age groups being conducted by the Suicide Prevention \nTechnical Assistance Center.\n  I continue to believe that finding concrete, comprehensive and \neffective remedies to the epidemic of youth suicide cannot be done by \nlawmakers on Capitol Hill alone. Those remedies must also come from \nindividuals, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, nurses, \nteachers, advocates, survivors, and affected families, who are \ndedicated to this issue or spend each day with children and young \nadults that suffer from illnesses related to suicide. Despite the goals \nwe have achieved with the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, I believe \nthat our work is not done. I hope that, as a society, we can continue \nworking collectively both to understand better the tragedy of youth \nsuicide and develop innovative and effective public and mental health \ninitiatives that reach every child and young adult in this country--\ncompassionate initiatives that give them encouragement, hope, and above \nall, life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, I rise with my colleagues Senator \nDodd and Senator Reed to introduce an important bill for our youth, the \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization of 2007. Nearly 3 years \nago, the Senate first passed this Act with 39 cosponsors. At that time, \nwe heard an outpouring of support and sharing from other members of the \nSenate who have lost members of their families. On September 9, 2004, \nmy son Garrett's birthday, the House and Senate passed the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act with overwhelming support. I remain thankful for \ntheir wisdom and support of the important programs this Act created \nthat focused on youth suicide prevention.\n  As I said in 2004, this Act represents the best of American \nGovernment, an opportunity when our Nation's elected officials can come \ntogether, put aside their political parties and politics, to debate and \npass legislation. During the last 3 years, this effort has resulted in \nnearly $65 million in suicide prevention and intervention funding to \nStates, tribes, and on our Nation's higher education institutions.\n  I also want to recognize and thank my colleagues who have championed \nthis cause for a great many years Senator Dodd, Senator Jack Reed, \nSenator Harry Reid and Senator Kennedy your work to raise awareness \nabout youth suicide has been significant and for that I thank you. I \nalso would like to thank Representative Patrick Kennedy for his support \non this and so many other issues affecting persons with mental illness. \nI look forward to continuing to work with all of you to ensure passage \nof this reauthorization bill.\n  As most of you know, I came to be a champion of this issue not \nbecause I volunteered for it, but because I suffered for it. In \nSeptember of 2003, Sharon and I lost our son Garrett Lee Smith to \nsuicide. While Sharon and I think about Garrett every day and mourn his \nloss, we take solace in the time we had with him, and have committed \nourselves to preserving his memory by helping others.\n  Sharon and I adopted Garrett a few days after his birth. He was such \na handsome baby boy. He was unusually happy and playful, and he also \nwas especially thoughtful of everyone around him as he grew older. His \nexuberance for life, however, began to dim in his elementary years. He \nstruggled to spell. His reading and writing were stuck in the \nrudiments. We had him tested and were surprised to learn that he had an \nunusually high IQ, but struggled with a severe overlay of learning \ndisabilities, including dyslexia.\n  However, it would be years later that we learned of the greatest \nchallenge to face Garrett, his diagnosis of bi-polar disorder. Bipolar \ndisorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder \nthat causes unusual shifts in a person's mood, energy and ability to \nfunction. Different from the normal ups and downs of life that everyone \ngoes through, the symptoms of bipolar disorder are severe. As his \nparents, we knew how long and how desperately Garrett had suffered from \nhis condition. Yet, tragically, over three years ago Garrett reached a \npoint where his illness took over and he could no longer fight.\n  In his memory, I have committed myself to helping prevent other \nfamilies from experiencing the tremendous pain that comes with the loss \nof a loved-one to suicide. We know that each year, more than 4,000 \nyouth aged 15 to 24 die by suicide. From this number we know that since \nGarrett's death more than 14,000 young people have lost their lives to \nsuicide. Too many young lives have been lost and continue to be lost.\n  While we can always do more, this Act has taken that first, \nsignificant step toward creating and funding an organized effort at the \nFederal, State and local levels to prevent and intervene when youth are \nat risk for mental and behavioral conditions that can lead to suicide. \nThe loss of a life to suicide at any age is sad and traumatic, but when \nit happens to someone who has just begun their life, has just begun to \nfulfill their potential the impact somehow seems harsher, sadder and \nmore pronounced.\n  Once signed into law, this bill will authorize $210 million in new \nfunding over 5 years to further support States and Native American \ntribes in building systems of State-wide early intervention and \nprevention strategies. This bill will continue the current practice of \nensuring that 85 percent of funding will be provided to entities \nfocused on identifying and preventing suicide at the State and \ncommunity level. Since the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act was signed \ninto law in 2004, 29-States and seven tribes have received grants to \nhelp them plan for and implement youth suicide prevention strategies. \nThe new and higher funding level will allow States that have never \nreceived a grant to receive funding. It also will allow States that \nhave received grants in the past to expand their efforts to include \nmore geographic areas and youth populations.\n  In my home State of Oregon, which has been especially active and \nforward-thinking in combating youth suicide, the Department of Human \nServices has been working in a number of counties throughout the State \nto increase referrals so care is available when needed, establish \nlinkages to care and improve knowledge among clinicians, crisis \nresponse workers, school staff, youth and lay persons related to youth \nwho are at-risk. The Native American Rehabilitation Association of the \nNorthwest, Inc. also has implemented the Native Youth Prevention \nProject, which serves nine tribes and tribal confederations in Oregon \nwhere American Indian youth have the highest suicide rate in the State. \nPrograms such as these can be important catalysts for change across the \nNation and we must continue to support them.\n  The bill also reauthorizes a Suicide Prevention Resource Center, \nwhich provides technical assistance to States and local grantees to \nensure that they are able to implement their State-wide early \nintervention and prevention strategy. It also collects data related to \nthe programs, evaluates the effectiveness of the programs, and \nidentifies and distributes best practices. Sharing technical data and \nprogram best practices is necessary to ensure that Federal funding is \nbeing utilized in the\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nbest manner possible and that information is being circulated among \nparticipants. The Center will receive $25 million over 5 years for \nthese purposes. Since 2004, the Center has done great work to support \nthe grantees under this Act as well as push forward broader science-to-\nservice efforts to combat youth suicide.\n  Finally, the bill will provide $31 million over 5 years to continue \nthe colleges and universities grant program. This program works to \nestablish mental health programs or enhance existing mental health \nprograms focused on increasing access to and enhancing the range of \nmental and behavioral health services for students. Entering college \ncan be one of the most disruptive and demanding times in a young \nperson's life, but for persons with a mental illness the changes can \nbecome overwhelming. Loss of their parental support system, and lack of \na familiar and easily accessed health care providers often can become \ntoo much of a burden to bear. We must ensure programs are in place to \nhelp them overcome these challenges.\n  So far, 55 colleges and universities have received grants through the \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, including two in my home State, helping \ncountless students. However, with more than 4,000 degree-granting \ninstitutions in the United States, there are many more campuses that \nwill be helped by this reauthorization.\n  I am pleased to be a champion of this cause and this bill and hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1515. A bill to establish a domestic violence volunteer attorney \nnetwork to represent domestic violence victims; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with my good friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, an innovative bill that will help \nthe lives of domestic violence victims. Sadly, domestic violence \nremains a reality for one out of four women in our country. Experts \nagree a pivotal factor to ending domestic violence is meaningful access \nto the justice system. Recent academic research finds that increased \nprovision of legal services is ``one likely significant factor in \nexplaining the decline [of domestic violence] . . . Because legal \nservices help women with practical matters such as protective orders, \ncustody, and child support they appear to actually present women with \nreal, longterm alternatives to their relationships.'' Stopping the \nviolence hinges on a victim's ability to obtain effective protection \norders, initiate separation proceedings or design safe child custody.\n  Yet thousands of victims of domestic violence go without \nrepresentation every day in this country. A patchwork of services do \ntheir best to provide represent domestic violence victims, law school \nclinics, individual State domestic violence coalitions, legal services, \nand private attorneys. But there are obvious gaps and simply not enough \nlawyers for victims and their myriad legal needs due to the abuse, \nincluding protection orders, divorce and child custody, immigration \nadjustments, and bankruptcy declarations. Experts estimate that current \nlegal services serve about 170,000 low-income domestic violence victims \neach year and yet, there are at least 1 million victims each year. At \nbest then, less than 1 out of 5 low-income victims ever see a lawyer.\n  I believe there is a wealth of untapped resources in this country, \nlawyers who want to volunteer. My National Domestic Violence Volunteer \nAct would harness the skills, enthusiasm and dedication of these \nlawyers and infuse 100,000 new volunteer lawyers into the justice \nsystem to represent domestic violence victims. We should make it as \nsmooth and simple for volunteer lawyers. My bill creates a streamlined, \norganized and national system to connect lawyers to clients.\n  I can't overemphasize the importance of having a lawyer standing \nshoulder-to-shoulder with a victim as she navigates the system. We must \nmatch a willing lawyer to a victim as soon as the victim calls the \nHotline, walks into a courtroom or involves the police. It is at that \ncrucial moment a victim needs to feel support, and if she doesn't, she \nmay retreat back into the abuse.\n  To enlist, train and place volunteer lawyers, my bill creates a new, \nelectronic National Domestic Violence Attorney Network and Referral \nProject that will be administered by the American Bar Association \nCommission on Domestic Violence.\n  There are five components of my legislation.\n  First, it creates a National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney \nNetwork Referral Project to be managed by the American Bar Association \nCommission on Domestic Violence. With $2 million of new Federal funding \neach year, the American Bar Association Commission on Dometic Violence \nwill solicit for volunteer lawyers and then create and maintain an \nelectronic network. It will provide appropriate mentoring, training and \ntechnical assistance to volunteer lawyers. And it will establish and \nmaintain a point of contact in each State, a statewide legal \ncoordinator, to help match willing lawyers to victims.\n  Second, it enlists the National Domestic Violence Hotline and \nInternet sources to provide legal referrals. The bill will help the \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline to update their system and train \nadvocates on how to provide legal referrals to callers in coordination \nwith the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic Violence. \nLegal referrals may also be done by qualified Internet-based services.\n  Third, it creates a Pilot Program and National Rollout of National \nDomestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network and Referral Project. The \nbill designs a pilot program to implement the volunteer attorney \nnetwork in five diverse States. The Office on Violence Against Women in \nthe Department of Justice will administer these monies to qualified \nstatewide legal coordinators to help them connect with the ABA \nCommission on Domestic Violence, the National Domestic Violence \nHotline, and the volunteer lawyers. After a successful stint in five \nStates, the bill will rollout the program nationally.\n  Fourth, the measure establishes a Domestic Violence Legal Advisory \nTask Force to monitor the program and make recommendations.\n  Fifth, the bill mandates the General Accounting Office to study each \nState and assess the scope and quality of legal services available to \nbattered women and report back to Congress within a year.\n  A terrific roundtable of groups reviewed and contributed to this \nlegislation, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence, \nthe Legal Resource Center for Violence Against Women, the National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Council of Juvenile \nand Family Court Judges, the American Bar Association, WomensLaw.org, \nthe National Domestic Violence Hotline, the Legal Services Corporation, \nthe American Prosecutors Research Institute, National Legal Aid and \nDefenders Association, National Center for State Courts, National \nAssociation for Attorneys General, Battered Women's Justice Project, \nNational Association of Women Judges, National Association of Women \nLawyers, National Crime Victim Bar Association and National Center for \nthe Victims of Crime.\n  I want to end today with a story about an American hero, a woman who \nhas been to hell and back and now is a tremendous advocate for domestic \nviolence victims, Yvette Cade. I want to tell it to you because I think \nit serves as such a powerful message about why battered women should \nhave legal assistance.\n  Yvette Cade, a Maryland resident, was doused with gasoline and set on \nfire by her estranged husband while she was at work. Half of her upper \nbody, including her entire face, suffered third-degree burns, the most \nserious level.\n  Just three weeks before the attack, a judge dismissed the protective \norder Yvette had against her husband, despite her protests that he was \nviolent. At the hearing in which the judge dismissed Cade's protective \norder, the judge told Cade he could not be her advocate, only the \n``umpire.'' Cade told him that she no longer wanted to be married to \nher abusive husband. The judge replied, ``well, then get a lawyer, and \nget a divorce. That's all you have to do,'' I believe that today's \nNational Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network Act would make \ngetting a lawyer a reality, not just good advice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act \nto reauthorize the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I introduce, along with Senators Allard, \nMikulski, Bond, Durbin, Collins, Schumer, Akaka, Clinton, Whitehouse, \nLevin, Brown, and Boxer, the Community Partnership to End Homelessness \nAct of 2007, CPEHA. This legislation would reauthorize and amend the \nhousing titles of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. \nSpecifically, our bill would realign the incentives behind the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's homelessness assistance \nprograms to accomplish the goals of preventing and ending homelessness.\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\n  According to the Homelessness Research Institute at the National \nAlliance to End Homelessness, as many as 3.5 million Americans \nexperience homelessness each year. On any one night, approximately \n744,000 men, women, and children are without homes.\n  Many of these people have served our country in uniform. According to \nthe National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, nearly 200,000 veterans \nof the United States armed forces are homeless on any given night, and \nabout one-third of homeless men are veterans.\n  Statistics regarding the number of children who experience \nhomelessness are especially troubling. Each year, it is estimated that \nat least 1.35 million children experience homelessness. Over 900,000 \nhomeless children and youth were identified and enrolled in public \nschools in the 2005-2006 school year. However, this Department of \nEducation count does not include preschool children, and over 40 \npercent of homeless children are under the age of five. Whatever their \nage, we know that children who are homeless are in poorer health, have \ndevelopmental delays, and suffer academically.\n  In addition, many of those who are homeless have a disability. \nAccording to the Homelessness Research Institute, about 23 percent of \nhomeless people were found to be ``chronically homeless,'' which \naccording to the current HUD definition means that they are homeless \nfor long periods of time or homeless repeatedly, and they have a \ndisability. For many of these individuals and families, housing alone, \nwithout some attached services, may not be enough.\n  Finally, as rents have soared and affordable housing units have \ndisappeared from the market during the past several years, even more \nworking Americans have been left unable to afford housing. According to \nthe National Low Income Housing Coalition's most recent ``Out of \nReach'' report, nowhere in the country can a minimum wage earner afford \na one-bedroom home. Eighty-eight percent of renters in cities live in \nareas where they cannot afford the fair market rent for a two-bedroom \nrental even with two minimum wage jobs. Low income renters who live \npaycheck to paycheck are in precarious circumstances and sometimes must \nmake tough choices between paying rent and buying food, prescription \ndrugs, or other necessities. If one unforeseen event occurs in their \nlives, they can end up homeless.\n  So why should the Federal Government work to help prevent and end \nhomelessness? Simply put, we cannot afford not to address this problem. \nHomelessness leads to untold costs, including expenses for emergency \nrooms, jails, shelters, foster care, detoxification, and emergency \nmental health treatment.\n  According to a number of studies, it costs just as much, if not more \nin overall expenditures, to allow men, women, and children to remain \nhomeless as it does to provide them with assistance and get them back \non the road to self-sufficiency.\n  It has been 20 years since the enactment of the Steward B. McKinney \nHomeless Assistance Act, and we have learned a lot about the problem of \nhomelessness since then. At the time of its adoption in 1987, this \nlegislation was viewed as an emergency response to a national crisis, \nand was to be followed by measures to prevent homelessness and to \ncreate more systemic solutions to the problem. It is now time to take \nwhat we have learned during the past 20 years, and put those best \npractices and proposals into action.\n  First and foremost, our bill would consolidate HUD's three main \ncompetitive homelessness programs, Supportive Housing Program, Shelter \nPlus Care, and Moderate Rehabilitation/Single Room Occupancy, into one \nprogram called the Community Homeless Assistance Program. The \nconsolidation would reduce the administrative burden on communities \ncaused by different program requirements. It also would allow funding \nto be used for an array of eligible activities maximizing flexibility, \ncreativity, and local-decision making.\n  Second, the bill would create a new prevention title that would allow \ncommunities to apply for funding to prevent homelessness. This would \nallow them to serve people who move frequently for economic reasons, \nare doubled up, are about to be evicted, live in severely overcrowded \nhousing, or otherwise live in an unstable situation that puts them at \nrisk of homelessness. The program could fund short- to medium-term \nhousing assistance, housing relocation and stabilization, and \nsupportive services. The program would be authorized for up to $250 \nmillion in fiscal year 2008.\n  Third, the bill would create a more flexible set of requirements for \nrural communities by modifying HUD's long-dormant Rural Homelessness \nGrant Program. Under the new requirements, a rural community could use \nfunds for homelessness prevention and housing stabilization, in \naddition to transitional housing, permanent housing, and supportive \nservices. The application process for these funds would be streamlined \nto be more consistent with the capacities of rural homelessness \nprograms.\n  Fourth, HUD would be required to provide incentives for communities \nto use proven strategies to end homelessness. These strategies would \ninclude permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless people, \nrapid rehousing programs for homeless families, and other research-\nbased strategies that HUD, after public comment, determines are \neffective.\n  Fifth, thirty percent of total funds available nationally would be \nallocated for permanent housing for individuals with disabilities or \nfamilies headed by a person with disabilities. At least 10 percent of \noverall funds would be allocated for permanently housing families with \nchildren.\n  Sixth, communities that demonstrate results, reducing the number of \npeople who become homeless, the length of time people are homeless, and \nrecidivism back into homelessness--would be allowed to use their \nhomeless assistance funding more flexibly and to serve groups that are \nat risk of becoming homeless.\n  Finally, leasing, rental assistance, and operating costs of permanent \nhousing programs would be renewed for 1 year at a time through the \nsection 8 housing voucher account, provided that the applicant \ndemonstrates need and compliance with appropriate standards.\n  There is a growing consensus on ways to help communities break the \ncycle of repeated and prolonged homelessness. If we combine Federal \ndollars with the right incentives to local communities, we can prevent \nand end long-term homelessness.\n  This bipartisan legislation seeks to do just that. It will reward \ncommunities for initiatives that prevent and end homelessness.\n  Groups that are endorsing the Community Partnership to End \nHomelessness Act include: The National Alliance to End Homelessness; \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors; the National Association of Counties; \nNational Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies; National \nCommunity Development Association; the National Housing Conference; the \nCorporation for Supportive Housing; National Alliance on Mental \nIllness; Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities Housing Task Force; \nHabitat for Humanity; Technical Assistance Collaborative; and the \nHousing Assistance Council.\n  The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act will set us on the \npath to meeting an important national goal. I hope my colleagues will \njoin us in supporting this bill and other homelessness prevention \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1518\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a transition to a new voluntary quality reporting program \nfor physicians and other health professionals; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Voluntary \nMedicare Quality Reporting Act of 2007. I thank my good friend, the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for joining me in this \neffort. This is an important bill for tens of millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, for the physicians, nurse practitioners and allied \nhealth professionals who treat them, and for the future of the Medicare \nprogram.\n  At the end of this year, providers will again face the prospect of an \nacross-the-board cut in their Medicare reimbursements. The scheduled \ncut for 2008 is the largest ever, 9.9 percent. These cuts are the \nresult of a flawed reimbursement system created in 1997 that uses the \nSustainable Growth Rate formula, or SGR, to determine an acceptable \nincrease in the growth of provider expenditures.\n  Medicare reimbursements increase when the previous year's payments do \nnot exceed a target level that is based on the growth of our economy. \nHowever, when the previous year's payments exceed that target level, \nreimbursements are cut. According to MedPAC, the SGR formula would \nreduce Medicare provider reimbursements by 40 percent over the next \neight years if Congress does not act. MedPAC is also concerned that \nover the next several years these reductions ``would threaten \nbeneficiary access to physician services over time, particularly those \nprovided by primary care physicians.'' MedPAC recognizes the importance \nof provider participation in the Medicare program, particularly in our \nrural and underserved urban areas where the decision to not accept new \nMedicare patients can make all the difference in seniors' access to \nmedical care.\n  Congress recognizes this as well, and so we have intervened to \nprevent scheduled cuts resulting from SGR from taking effect. For all \nexcept the newest members of this body, this process of enacting a \n``physician fix'' is a familiar scenario. For the past four years, \nCongress has acted to prevent these cuts to providers, usually through \na last-minute provision added to a must-pass bill.\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\n  In the 109th Congress, I introduced bipartisan legislation \nimplementing MedPAC's recommendations and calling for Congress to \nrepeal the SGR formula and update provider reimbursements by the cost \nof care. Replacing SGR will require a thoughtful and protracted process \ninvolving the input of lawmakers and the provider community, and it is \ncostly, but it is something that we must do.\n  The most recent ``fix'' was made to the 2006 Tax Relief and Health \nCare Act, Public Law 109-432. That law froze payment rates, staving off \nan across-the-board cut of 5.1 percent. Congress also added a quality \nreporting system called the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative \nprogram PQRI, which made providers eligible for a bonus payment of 1.5 \npercent of their total allowed Medicare charges if they report to HHS \non certain quality measures starting in July 2007.\n  This new system is also known as ``pay-for-reporting,'' and it is \nbased on the concept that physicians should receive an increase in \nMedicare reimbursement only once they have participated in extensive \nquality reporting. Across my State, I have heard serious concerns that \nthis will lead to a mandatory reporting system in the near future, and \nthat we will soon see an untested ``pay-for-performance'' system in \nplace.\n  Now, I think all my colleagues would agree that our seniors deserve \nthe highest quality care. But in our quest for improved quality, we \nmust answer two questions here: should we proceed with an untested \nsystem of reporting requirements just for the sake of reporting, and \nwill we actually achieve better care for our seniors via the PQRI.\n  I am very concerned about implementing reporting requirements that \nhave not been tested. I believe that we must have the right process in \nplace for defining a quality reporting system for services provided to \nMedicare beneficiaries by health care professionals. We should not be \nestablishing reporting requirements for health professionals just for \nthe sake of reporting, and we should not be moving forward with this \nsystem until we have adequate time to evaluate each stage of its \ndevelopment.\n  Current law does not provide sufficient time to assess the \nappropriateness and effectiveness of this new system. Nor do they take \ninto account the fact that most physicians and other health \nprofessionals have no experience in quality reporting and do not have \nin place the necessary health information technology and administrative \ninfrastructures to participate in a reporting system.\n  The bill I am introducing today will assure that health professionals \nwill be at the center of the process for defining areas where quality \nmeasures are needed, as well as for defining the relevant measures \nthemselves. Why is this important? Health professionals must be \nactively engaged in developing and implementing an effective reporting \nsystem because they are on the front lines of health care delivery, and \nthey best understand the nexus between care delivery and quality \nmeasurement. The development process for quality measures must be \ntransparent and consistent for all health professionals because they \nare the ones who will determine its successful implementation.\n  Additionally, quality measures should be tested across a variety of \nspecialties and practice settings before they are included in a \nreporting system because measures must be clinically valid to be \nrelevant for defining quality, and because physicians and health \nprofessionals practice in a variety of settings, for example: small vs. \nlarge practices, urban vs. suburban vs. rural locations, office-based \nvs. hospital-base practices.\n  Most importantly, we should not be using hastily devised quality \nmeasures to justify reimbursement cuts. There are some who advocate \npay-for-performance as a way to slow the growth of physician spending. \nThey think we can accomplish lower physician expenditures by setting \narbitrary standards and then cutting payments to physicians who fail to \nmeet them. But across America, there are practices that would face \ntremendous obstacles in meeting such standards: they lack of the \ninformation technology necessary to document and report standards in a \ntimely manner; they see patients with economic and language barriers \nthat will result in higher noncompliance rates; they treat a patient \npopulation for whom ethnic and racial differences require different \nclinical interventions than for other patients. Ignoring these \nconsiderations will not only fail to dramatically improve quality, it \nwill significantly penalize providers who treat traditionally \nunderserved populations.\n  This bill provides an opportunity to thoughtfully and carefully \ndevelop effective quality measures that reflect differences in practice \npatterns, to share our findings, and to determine and encourage the \nmost cost-effective methods of providing the highest quality care.\n  Rather than moving forward precipitously in 2008 with a permanent \nMedicare quality reporting system after a transitional 6-month period \nthis year, as current law requires, our bill, the Voluntary Medicare \nQuality Reporting Act of 2007, instead would establish a more realistic \ntimeline for quality measure reporting by health professionals. It does \nso by:\n  Requiring the Secretary first to evaluate the 6-month transitional \nreporting system and reporting findings to the Congress by June 1, \n2008;\n  Requiring the Secretary to undertake demonstrations for defining \nappropriate mechanisms whereby health professionals may provide data on \nquality measures to the Secretary through an appropriate medical \nregistry;\n  Allowing physicians and other eligible professionals to continue \nreporting to the Secretary quality measures developed for 2007, in \norder for the Secretary to refine systems for reporting quality \nmeasures;\n  After completion of the evaluation, phasing in a permanent Voluntary \nMedicare Quality Reporting Program, with implementation beginning \nJanuary 1, 2010, based on a consistent set of rules that define an \norderly and transparent process of quality measure development;\n  Requiring that the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement \nof the American Medical Association be the beginning point for the \ndesignation of clinical areas where quality measures are needed;\n  Having the Consortium, in collaboration with physician specialty \norganizations and other eligible professional organizations, develop \nand propose quality measures to a consensus organization such as the \nNational Quality Forum for endorsement; and\n  Prohibiting the Secretary from using any measures that have not been \nrecommended by the Consortium and endorsed by the consensus \norganization.\n  I am confident that with all of these measures we will achieve a \nsuccessful and effective quality reporting system that will truly make \na difference in the quality of care that our Medicare beneficiaries \nreceive. At the end of this year, as Congress moves forward to address \nthe physician reimbursement issue, I urge my colleagues to support this \nrational approach to promoting quality and guaranteeing access to care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1521. A bill to provide information, resources, recommendations, \nand funding to help State and local law enforcement enact crime \nprevention and intervention strategies supported by rigorous evidence; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD: Mr. President, today I will introduce the PRECAUTION \nAct the Prevention Resources for Eliminating Criminal Activity Using \nTailored Interventions in Our Neighborhoods Act. It is a long name, but \nit stands for an important principle that it is better to invest in \nprecautionary measures now than it is to pay the costs of crime both in \ndollars and lives later on. I am very pleased that the Senator from \nPennsyivania, Mr. Specter, will join me as a cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  As the Memorial Day weekend approaches, there is a particular urgency \nfor this bill. Last year, Milwaukee suffered a devastating surge of \nviolence over that holiday weekend. Just to take one example, a gunmand \nopened fire on a crowd of picnickers that included, according to news \nreports, almost 50 children. By the end of the weekend, nearly 30 \npeople were wounded in shootings around the city, many\n\n[[Page S6891]]\n\nof them fatal. Instead of spending their Memorial Day weekend \nremembering those who gave their lives in defense of this country, \nMilwaukee residents found themselves mourning the victims of a war-zone \nrising up in their own neighborhoods.\n  Violence has continued to dominate the news in Milwaukee ever since. \nBrandon Sprewer, a Special Olympian, was waiting at a bus stop when he \nwas shot and killed for his wallet. Wisconsin Department of Justice \nofficer Jay Balchunas was shot and killed for no apparent reason, the \nvictim of a random robbery that turned violent. Shaina Mersman was shot \nand killed at noon in the middle of a busy shopping area. She was 8 \nmonths pregnant, and she died in the middle of the street. And just \nthis very month, 4-year-old Jasmine Owens was shot and killed by a \ndrive-by shooter. She had been skipping rope in her front yard. These \nare but a few of the senseless deaths in a list of names that is far \ntoo long.\n  According to a report released by the Police Executive Research \nForum, Milwaukee's homicide rates have increased by 17 percent, robbery \nrates by 39 percent, and aggravated assault by 85 percent in the past 2 \nyears. While Milwaukee has been one of those cities hardest hit, cities \nacross America are struggling with rising crime rates. In fact, the \n2005 FBI Uniform Crime Report showed a startling increase in violent \ncrime, reporting the largest single year percent increase in violent \ncrime in 14 years. The FBI has also reported that crime increased \nanother 3.7 percent in the first half of 2006 when compared with the \nsame time frame in 2005.\n  These statistics are shocking, and they show that this is not a \nlocalized problem. Yet David Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime \nPrevention and Control at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, \nreported in an August 2006 Washington Post article that, ``State and \nlocal officials feel abandoned by the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment must return to its role as a real partner in conquering \ncrime by providing funding and crafting effective approaches to key \nproblems.'' Something must be done at the Federal level to stem the \ntide of violence threatening our Nation. Put very simply, we, as \nrepresentatives of our constituents, have an obligation to act.\n  At the same time, we have an obligation to act responsibly. The \nFederal government must work in concert with state and local law \nenforcement, with the non profit criminal justice community, and with \nother branches of State and Federal government. While we have an \nobligation to provide leadership and support, we do not have the right \nto unilaterally take control from the state and local officials on the \nground. We must also act wisely, investing our resources in crime-\nfighting measures that we are confident will work and whose \neffectiveness has been demonstrated. Sometimes, small and careful \nadvances are the ones that yield the most benefit.\n  The PRECAUTION Act is based on the premise that the cornerstones of \nFederal participation in crime fighting are threefold. First, the \nFederal Government should develop and disseminate knowledge to State \nand local officials regarding the newest and most effective law \nenforcement techniques and strategies. Second, the Federal Government \nshould provide financial support for innovations that our State and \nlocal partners cannot afford to fund on their own. With that funding, \nwe also should provide the guidance, training, and technical assistance \nto implement those innovations. Third, the Federal Government needs to \ncreate and maintain effective partnerships among agencies at all levels \nof government, partnerships that are crafted to address specific law \nenforcement challenges. And in its implementation, the PRECAUTION Act \nfulfills all three of these principles.\n  The PRECAUTION Act creates a national commission to wade through the \nsea of information on crime prevention and intervention strategies \ncurrently available and identify those programs that are most ready for \nreplication around the country. Over taxed law enforcement officials \nneed a simple, accessible resource to turn to that recommends a few, \ntop-tier crime prevention and intervention programs. They need a \nresource that will single out those existing programs that are truly \n``evidence-based,'' programs that are proven by scientifically reliable \nevidence to be effective. And the commission created by the PRECAUTION \nAct will provide just such a report, one written in plain language and \nfocused on pragmatic implementation issues, approximately a year and a \nhalf after the bill is enacted.\n  In the course of holding hearings and writing this first report, the \ncommission will also identify some types of prevention and intervention \nstrategies that are promising but need further research and development \nbefore they are ready for further implementation.\n  The National Institute of Justice then will administer a grant \nprogram that will fund pilot projects in these identified areas. The \ncommission will follow closely the progress of these pilot projects, \nand at the end of the three years of the grant program, the commission \nwill publish a second report, providing a detailed discussion of each \npilot project and its effectiveness. This second report will include \ndetailed implementation information will discuss frankly both the \nsuccesses and failures that arose over the course of the 3 years of the \ngrant program.\n  The PRECAUTION Act answers a call put out by police chiefs and mayors \nfrom more than 50 cities around the country during a national \nconference hosted by the Police Executive Research Forum. According to \na report on the event from the Forum, these law enforcement leaders \nagreed that while there is a desperate need to focus on violent crime \nin the law enforcement community, ``other municipal agencies and social \nservices organizations, including schools, mental health, public \nhealth, courts, corrections, and conflict management groups need to be \nbrought together to partner toward the common goal of reducing violent \ncrime.'' In the hearings held by the commission, these voices will all \nbe heard. In the reports filed by the commission, these perspectives \nwill be acknowledged. And in the pilot projects administered by the \nNational Institute of Justice, these partnerships will be developed and \nfostered.\n  The PRECAUTION Act, though modest in scope, is an important \nsupplement to the essential financial support the Federal Government \nprovides to our state and local law enforcement partners through \nprograms such as the Byrne Justice Assistance grants and the COPS \ngrants. When State and local law enforcement receive Federal support \nfor policing, they have difficult decisions to make on how to spend \nthose Federal dollars. We all know that prevention and intervention are \nintegral components of any comprehensive law enforcement plan. The \nPRECAUTION Act not only highlights the importance of these components, \nbut will also help to single out some of the best, most effective forms \nof prevention and intervention programs available. At the same time, it \nwill help to develop additional, cutting-edge strategies that are \nsupported by solid scientific evidence of their effectiveness. I am \npleased that the bill has been endorsed by the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, the Council for Excellence in Government, the American \nSociety of Criminology, and the Consortium of Social Science \nAssociations.\n  It is my sincere hope that Milwaukee is able to enjoy a peaceful \nMemorial Day weekend this year, but I will not rest on hopes alone. As \nTed Kamatchus, President of the National Sheriffs' Association, \ntestified in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSubcommittee on Crime and Drugs, this week, ``we need a coordinated \nnational attack on crime, recognizing that there is no single `silver \nbullet' solution. Political rhetoric must not prevail over action.'' I \nurge my colleagues to listen to this advice and to join Senator Specter \nand me in working to get this important piece of legislation passed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Bonneville Power Administration portions \nof the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000 to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal years 2008 through 2014, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by all \nMembers of the Senate from the Northwest: Senator Gordon Smith, Senator \nLarry Craig, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, Senator Jon \nTester, Senator Max Baucus and Senator Mike Crapo in introducing the \nFisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2007, or FRIMA. \nOur legislation extends a homegrown, commonsense program that has a \nproven track record in helping restore Northwestern salmon runs. \nDollar-for-dollar, the fish screening and fish passage facilities \nfunded by our legislation are among the most cost-effective uses of \npublic and private restoration dollars. These projects protect fish \nwhile producing significant benefits. That is why it is important that \nthis program be reauthorized and funding be appropriated now.\n  Since 2001, when the original Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation \nMitigation Act of 2000, FRIMA, was enacted, more than $9 million in \nFederal funds has leveraged nearly $20 million in private, local \nfunding. This money has been used to protect, enhance and restore more \nthan 550 rivers miles of important fish habitat and species throughout \nOregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana. For decades, State, \ntribal and Federal fishery agencies in the Pacific Northwest have \nidentified the screening of irrigation and other water diversions, and \nimproved fish passage, as critically important for the survival of \nsalmon and other fish populations.\n  This program is very popular and has the support of a wide range of \nconstituents, including community leaders, environmental organizations, \nand agricultural producers. Senator Smith and I are proud of the \nsuccessful collaborative projects that irrigators and members of the \nOregon Water Resources Congress have completed while putting this \nprogram to work in our home State. Our program also has the support of \nOregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, irrigators throughout the Northwestern \nStates, Oregon Trout, American Rivers and the National Audubon Society.\n\n  FRIMA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program \nto plan, design, and construct fish screens, fish passage devices, and \nrelated features. It also authorizes inventories to provide the \ninformation needed for planning and making decisions about the survival \nand propagation of all Northwestern fish species. The program is \ncurrently carried out by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on behalf \nof the Interior Secretary.\n  FRIMA provides benefits by: keeping fish out of places where they \nshould not be, such as in an irrigation system; easing upstream and \ndownstream fish passage; improving the protection, survival, and \nrestoration of native fish species; helping avoid new endangered \nspecies listings by protecting and enhancing the fish populations not \nyet listed; making progress toward the delisting of listed species; \nutilizing a positive, win/win, public-private partnership; and, \nassisting in achieving both sustainable agriculture and fisheries. \nSince FRIMA's enactment in 2001, 103 projects have been installed. This \nis a true partnership and fine example of how our fisheries and farmers \ncan work together to protect fish species throughout the Northwest.\n  While he was Governor of Idaho, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne \nsaid, ``. . . . the FRIMA program serves as an excellent example of \ngovernment and private land owners working together to promote \nconservation. The screening of irrigation diversions plays a key role \nin Idaho's efforts to restore salmon populations while protecting rural \neconomies.'' This is from ``Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation \nMitigation Programs, fiscal year 2002-2004'', U.S. Fish & Wildlife \nService, Washington, DC, July, 2005, page 13.\n  The bill that we are introducing today specifically extends the \nauthorization for tbis program through 2014; gives priority to projects \ncosting less than $2.5 million, a reduction in a targeted project's \ncost from $5,000,000 to $2,500,000; clarifies that any Bonneville Power \nAdministration, BPA, funds provided either directly or through a grant \nto another entity shall be considered nonFederal matching funds, \nbecause BPA's funding comes from ratepayers; requires an inventory \nreport describing funded projects and their benefits; and changes the \nadministrative expenses formula used by the Fish & Wildlife Service and \nthe States of Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho, so that \nadministrative costs may be held to a minimum while projects in the \nfield receive the majority of available funding.\n  Ultimately, it will take the combined efforts of all interests in our \nregion to recover our salmon. State and local governments, local \nwatershed councils, private landowners and the Federal Government need \nto continue working together. Initiatives such as the bill I am \nintroducing today help to sustain the partnerships upon which \nsuccessful salmon recovery will be based.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation \npass.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to develop \nstandards for general service lamps that will operate more efficiently \nand assist in reducing costs to consumers, business concerns, \ngovernment entities, and other users, to require that general service \nlamps and related products manufactured or sold in interstate commerce \nafter 2013 meet those standards, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senator Carper, \nSnowe, Lieberman, Murkowski, and Landrieu in introducing two important \ndomestic energy bills.\n  The Senate has an opportunity to save consumers $15 billion annually \nin energy costs, eliminate the need for hundreds of new power plants, \nprevent the release of tons of mercury into our environment annually, \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3 trillion pounds, lead the world in \nthe innovation of new technologies and increase domestic employment \nopportunities.\n  How? The good old fashion light bulb.\n  Thomas Edison was one of our Nation's greatest inventors. He holds \nnearly 1100 patents, including the light bulb. Over 125 years ago, he \ninvented the conventional incandescent light bulb. While most of his \nother inventions have been significantly improved upon since then, \nEdison's incandescent light bulb is still the most widely used bulb \ntoday. Unfortunately, only 10 percent of the electricity that goes into \nthis light bulb is actually used to produce light. The remaining 90 \npercent is often wasted as heat.\n  Just as another Edison invention, the phonograph, evolved into \ncompact discs and mp3 technologies, today, American innovation has \nimproved upon the light bulb. This innovation will continue. Light bulb \nmanufacturers and our hard-working Americans have developed \ntechnologies that are capable of reducing the electricity use \nassociated with conventional incandescent light bulbs from between 10 \nto over 50 percent. These bulbs are available today.\n  These technological and domestic manufacturing capabilities can save \nconsumers billions of dollars a year in energy costs.\n  My colleagues and I are proud to introduce two bills that will ensure \nthat we take advantage of these new technologies to save energy, save \nconsumers on their electricity bills and promote American ingenuity.\n  The first is the Bright Idea Act of 2007. This bill will establish \nefficiency targets for light bulbs that will cut light bulb energy \nconsumption by at least half in just 6 years and triple the efficiency \nof today's incandescent bulbs by 2018.\n  These efficiency standards are merely the beginning. The bill \nestablishes a working group of light bulb manufacturers, labor unions, \nenvironmentalists and consumer groups to evaluate the state of bulb \ntechnologies and domestic manufacturing capabilities every 3 years. If \nthe technology has advanced and our businesses are capable of higher \nstandards, the Secretary of Energy may raise these targets.\n  The bill also authorizes a technology-neutral research and \ndevelopment program to help our domestic manufacturers, in partnership \nwith our national laboratories and universities, advance new lighting \ntechnologies and directs the Secretary of Energy to educate consumers \nabout the benefits of using newer light bulbs.\n  We recognize the concerns related to new light bulbs such as mercury \nrelease and labeling requirements. The bill requires the Secretary, \ntogether with the EPA, to provide recommendations to Congress on how to \ndeal with these challenges.\n  The second component of this light bulb package that we are \nintroducing today is a bill that will ensure that our Nation is capable \nof taking full advantage of America's lighting innovation through the \ncreation of additional domestic employment opportunities. This bill \nprovides a construction tax credit for the costs associated with the \nrenovation and construction of domestic light bulb manufacturing \nfacilities designed to produce the next generation of lighting \ntechnology.\n  I urge Senators to join my colleagues and me in saving consumers \nbillions of dollars in electricity costs, reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions, tempering energy demand, eliminating the need for at least \ndozens of new power plants annually, preventing the release of tons of \nmercury into our environment each year and building upon our innovation \nby creating additional domestic employment opportunities for Americans \nby supporting the Bright Idea Act of 2007 and tax incentives for \ndomestic lighting technologies. I ask consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bright Idea Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR GENERAL SERVICE LAMPS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Establishment of standards.--As soon as practicable \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Energy shall initiate a project to establish technical \n     standards for general service lamps.\n       (2) Consultation with interested parties.--In carrying out \n     the project, the Secretary shall consult with representatives \n     of environmental organizations, labor organizations, general \n     service lamp manufacturers, consumer organizations, and other \n     interested parties.\n       (3) Minimum initial standards; deadline.--The initial \n     technical standards established shall be standards that \n     enable those general service lamps to provide levels of \n     illumination equivalent to the levels of illumination \n     provided by general service lamps generally available in \n     2007, but with--\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\n       (A) a lumens per watt rating of not less than 30 by \n     calendar year 2013; and\n       (B) a lumens per watt rating of not less than 45 by \n     calendar year 2018.\n       (b) Manufacture and Distribution in Interstate Commerce.--\n     If the Secretary of Energy, after consultation with the \n     interested parties described in subsection (a)(2), determines \n     that general service lamps meeting the standards established \n     under subsection (a) are generally available for purchase \n     throughout the United States at costs that are substantially \n     equivalent (taking into account useful life, lifecycle costs, \n     domestic manufacturing capabilities, energy consumption, and \n     such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate) to the \n     cost of the general service lamps they would replace, then \n     the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to \n     require that at least 95 percent of general service lamps \n     sold, offered for sale, or otherwise made available in the \n     United States meet the standards established under subsection \n     (a), except for those general service lamps described in \n     subsection (c).\n       (c) Exception.--The standards established by the Secretary \n     under subsection (a) shall not apply to general service lamps \n     used in applications in which compliance with those standards \n     is not feasible, as determined by the Secretary.\n       (d) Revised Standards.--After the initial standards are \n     established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult \n     periodically with the interested parties described in \n     subsection (a)(2) with respect to whether those standards \n     should be changed. The Secretary may change the standards, \n     and the dates and percentage of lamps to which the changed \n     standards apply under subsection (b), if after such \n     consultation the Secretary determines that such changes are \n     appropriate.\n       (e) Report.--The Secretary shall submit reports \n     periodically to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Technology, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, and the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce with respect to the development and \n     promulgation of standards for lamps and lamp-related \n     technology, such as switches, dimmers, ballast, and non-\n     general service lighting, that includes the Secretary's \n     findings and recommendations with respect to such standards.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy may carry out a \n     lighting technology research and development program--\n       (1) to support the research, development, demonstration, \n     and commercial application of lamps and related technologies \n     sold, offered for sale, or otherwise made available in the \n     United States; and\n       (2) to assist manufacturers of general service lamps in the \n     manufacturing of general service lamps that, at a minimum, \n     achieve the lumens per watt ratings described in section \n     2(a).\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $10,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2008 through 2013.\n       (c) Sunset.--The program under this section shall terminate \n     on September 30, 2015.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONSUMER EDUCATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy, in consultation \n     with the Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, shall \n     carry out a comprehensive national program to educate \n     consumers about the benefits of using light bulbs that have \n     improved efficiency ratings.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2008 through 2014.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to end benefit \nerosion, support working families with child care expenses, encourage \nretirement and education savings, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, throughout my time in the United States \nCongress, I have worked with my colleagues to promote the economic \nsecurity of low-income and working American families. In many respects, \nwe have made significant progress, but in others, much work remains to \nbe done. The last several years have been difficult ones for low-income \nAmericans. Since 2000, the number of Americans living in poverty has \nincreased by 5 million. At the same time, wages have stagnated for \nAmericans in the bottom tenth of earners. It's no surprise that more \nand more Americans have turned to vital Federal food assistance such as \nthe Food Stamp Program, which this year will serve 26 million \nAmericans.\n  The Food Stamp Program is our Nation's first line of defense against \nhunger, providing modest but vital benefits to millions of American \nfamilies, and also serving our country during times of extraordinary \nneed. In fact, the Food Stamp Program played a crucial role in helping \nmillions of Americans who were devastated by the Gulf Coast hurricanes \nof 2005.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has not taken action to modernize the program \nso that it addresses the current challenges that low-income Americans \nmust face. It is time for Congress to make such needed program \nimprovements. With the food stamp reauthorization pending as part of \nthe upcoming farm bill, we have an opportunity and an obligation to \ninvest in the Food Stamp Program and, in so doing, in the food security \nand health of our country's families.\n  Today I am joined by my good friend and colleague, Senator Lugar from \nIndiana, in introducing the Food Stamp Fairness and Benefit Restoration \nAct of 2007. I thank the Senator from Indiana for his long-time efforts \nto fight hunger in America, and for joining me today to introduce this \nlegislation.\n  The bill that we are introducing today contains several particular \nimprovements.\n  First and foremost, the legislation would halt food stamp benefit \nerosion that is occurring as a result of draconian cuts enacted in the \nmid-90s. As a result of these cuts, food stamp benefits are eroding \nwith every passing year and, as they do, the economic situations of \nfamilies receiving food stamps grows ever more precarious.\n  Second, the bill would enable families to deduct fully the costs of \nchild care for purposes of eligibility and benefit determination. \nCurrently, program rules allow families to deduct just $175 per month \nof the cost of child care. Not only has this deduction not been \nadjusted to account for increases in the cost of child care, but it \ncomes nowhere near covering the cost of child care, which nationwide \naverages almost $650 per month.\n  Third, the legislation would update archaic program rules regarding \nthe resources that a family may have and still receive food stamps. In \n1977, Congress established a program rule that said that a family may \nhave $1,750 in available liquid assets and still receive food stamps. \nHad this asset limit been adjusted for inflation, today a family would \nbe able to have nearly $6,000 in savings and still receive food stamps. \nInstead, we allow just $2,000. This makes no sense. Not only does it \nactively discourage families from saving for their future, it all but \nrequires families that experience an economic shock such as a job loss \nor a medical emergency to spend down their savings to hit absolute rock \nbottom just to receive meager food benefits. It is time to adjust this \nasset limit and stop discouraging families from doing what we tell \nevery other American that they must do--save. To that end, the bill \nalso exempts tax-preferred retirement and educational savings accounts.\n  Fourth, this bill restores food stamp eligibility for legal immigrant \nhouseholds. This too is nothing but a basic restoration of a principle \nof fairness that existed prior to the mid-1990s. Unfortunately, \nCongress chose, unwisely in my opinion, to take away benefits from \nthose legal immigrants who played by the rules and legally entered our \ncountry. Keep in mind these are families who work and are part of our \nsociety. I disagreed with the decision then and I disagree with it \ntoday. It is time to rectify this grave injustice and abide by the \nbasic principle that those who enter the country legally and play by \nthe same rules as the rest of us, should also be eligible for the same \nbenefits for which they pay taxes. Our bill would do that.\n\n  Fifth, the legislation would set more humane eligibility standards \nfor unemployed, childless adults. These individuals are among the \npoorest in our country and often have significant\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\nmental health and substance abuse problems. They are, in short, among \nthe people who need our help the most. But ironically, they are among \nthose who we deny the most basic of food assistance. Currently, such \nadults can receive food stamps for only 3 months out of every 3 years. \nThis legislation proposes a modestly more sympathetic standard of 6 \nmonths out of every 2-year period.\n  Finally, my bill would increase funding for commodity purchases for \nfood banks and community food providers. U.S. Government donations to \nfood banks have dropped dramatically in recent years, even as the \nnumber of Americans seeking help from community food providers has \nconsistently increased.\n  I know that the budget is tight and that Congress must be prudent in \ndecisions about how we allocate funding. But I also know that there is \nno function of the federal government as basic and as critical as \nensuring that low-income Americans, families with children, elderly \nliving on fixed incomes, and persons with disabilities, have enough \nfood for their next meal. It is past time for Congress to act in this \nregard, and I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \njoin me and the Senator from Indiana to enact the Food Stamp Fairness \nand Benefit Restoration Act of 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6897-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 214--CALLING UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAMIC \n      REPUBLIC OF IRAN TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE DR.

(referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Wilson Center'');\n       Whereas, for the past decade, Dr. Esfandiari has traveled \n     to Iran twice a year to visit her ailing 93-year-old mother;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, on her return to the airport \n     during her last visit to Iran, Dr. Esfandiari was robbed by 3 \n     masked, knife-wielding men, who stole her travel documents, \n     luggage, and other effects;\n       Whereas, when Dr. Esfandiari attempted to obtain \n     replacement travel documents in Iran, she was invited to an \n     interview by a representative of the Ministry of Intelligence \n     of Iran;\n       Whereas Dr. Esfandiari was interrogated by the Ministry of \n     Intelligence for hours on many days;\n       Whereas the questioning of the Ministry of Intelligence \n     focused on the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center;\n       Whereas Dr. Esfandiari answered all questions to the best \n     of her ability, and the Wilson Center also provided extensive \n     information to the Ministry in a good faith effort to aid Dr. \n     Esfandiari;\n       Whereas the harassment of Dr. Esfandiari increased, with \n     her being awakened while napping to find 3 strange men \n     standing at her bedroom door, one wielding a video camera, \n     and later being pressured to make false confessions against \n     herself and to falsely implicate the Wilson Center in \n     activities in which it had no part;\n       Whereas Lee Hamilton, former United States Representative \n     and president of the Wilson Center, has written to the \n     President of Iran to call his attention to Dr. Esfandiari's \n     dire situation;\n       Whereas Mr. Hamilton repeated that the Wilson Center's \n     mission is to provide forums to exchange views and opinions \n     and not to take positions on issues, nor try to influence \n     specific outcomes;\n       Whereas the lengthy interrogations of Dr. Esfandiari by the \n     Ministry of Intelligence of Iran stopped on February 14, \n     2007, but she heard nothing for 10 weeks and was denied her \n     passport;\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2007, Dr. Esfandiari honored a summons \n     to appear at the Ministry of Intelligence, whereby she was \n     taken immediately to Evin prison, where she is currently \n     being held; and\n       Whereas the Ministry of Intelligence has implicated Dr. \n     Esfandiari and the Wilson Center in advancing the alleged aim \n     of the United States Government of supporting a ``soft \n     revolution'' in Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate calls upon the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran to immediately release Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, \n     replace her lost travel documents, and cease its harassment \n     tactics; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the United States Government, through all appropriate \n     diplomatic means and channels, should encourage the \n     Government of Iran to release Dr. Esfandiari and offer her an \n     apology; and\n       (B) the United States should coordinate its response with \n     its allies throughout the Middle East, other governments, and \n     all appropriate international organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6897-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6897-S6898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 215--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 25, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL \n                   FIRST RESPONDER APPRECIATION DAY''\n\n  Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Casey, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nEnzi, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Graham, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \nInhofe) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 215\n\n       Whereas millions of Americans have benefited from the \n     courageous service of first responders across the Nation;\n       Whereas the police, fire, emergency medical service, and \n     public health personnel (commonly known as ``first \n     responders'') work devotedly and selflessly on behalf of the \n     people of this Nation, regardless of the peril or hazard to \n     themselves;\n       Whereas in emergency situations, first responders carry out \n     the critical role of protecting and ensuring public safety;\n       Whereas the men and women who bravely serve as first \n     responders have found themselves on the front lines of \n     homeland defense in the war against terrorism;\n       Whereas first responders are called upon in the event of a \n     natural disaster, such as the tornadoes in Florida and the \n     blizzard in Colorado in December 2006, the wildfires in the \n     West in 2007, and the flooding in the Northeast in April \n     2007;\n       Whereas the critical role of first responders was witnessed \n     in the aftermath of the mass shooting at the Virginia \n     Polytechnic Institute and State University, when the \n     collaborative effort of police officers, firefighters, and \n     emergency medical technicians to secure the campus, rescue \n     students from danger, treat the injured, and transport \n     victims to local hospitals undoubtedly saved the lives of \n     many students and faculty;\n       Whereas 670,000 police officers, 1,100,000 firefighters, \n     and 891,000 emergency medical technicians risk their lives \n     every day to make our communities safe;\n       Whereas these 670,000 sworn police officers from Federal, \n     State, tribal, city, and county law enforcement agencies \n     protect lives and property, detect and prevent crimes, uphold \n     the law, and ensure justice;\n       Whereas these 1,100,000 firefighters, both volunteer and \n     career, provide fire suppression, emergency medical services, \n     search and rescue, hazardous materials response, response to \n     terrorism, and critical fire prevention and safety education;\n       Whereas the 891,000 emergency medical professionals in the \n     United States respond to and treat a variety of life-\n     threatening emergencies, from cardiac and respiratory arrest \n     to traumatic injuries;\n       Whereas these 2,661,000 ``first responders'' make personal \n     sacrifices to protect our communities, as was witnessed on \n     September 11, 2001, and in the aftermath of Hurricane \n     Katrina, and as is witnessed every day in cities and towns \n     across America;\n       Whereas according to the National Law Enforcement Officers \n     Memorial Fund, a total of 1,649 law enforcement officers died \n     in the line of duty during the past 10 years, an average of 1 \n     death every 53 hours or 165 per year, and 145 law enforcement \n     officers were killed in 2006;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Fire \n     Administration, from 1996 through 2005 over 1500 firefighters \n     were killed in the line of duty, and tens of thousands were \n     injured;\n       Whereas 4 in 5 medics are injured on the job, more than 1 \n     in 2 (52 percent) have been assaulted by a patient and 1 in 2 \n     (50 percent) have been exposed to an infectious disease, and \n     emergency medical service personnel in the United States have \n     an estimated fatality rate of 12.7 per 100,000 workers, more \n     than twice the national average;\n       Whereas most emergency medical service personnel deaths in \n     the line of duty occur in ambulance accidents;\n       Whereas thousands of first responders have made the \n     ultimate sacrifice;\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, America's firefighters, law enforcement \n     officers, and emergency medical workers were universally \n     recognized for the sacrifices they made on that tragic day, \n     and should be honored each year as these tragic events are \n     remembered;\n       Whereas there currently exists no national day to honor the \n     brave men and women of the first responder community, who \n     give so much of themselves for the sake of others; and\n       Whereas these men and women by their patriotic service and \n     their dedicated efforts\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\n     have earned the gratitude of Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 25, 2007, as \n     ``National First Responder Appreciation Day'' to honor and \n     celebrate the contributions and sacrifices made by all first \n     responders in the United States.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution today \nthat will designate September 25 as National First Responder \nAppreciation Day. I am pleased to be joined by my good friends and \ncolleagues, Senators McCain, Casey, Cochran, Enzi, Stevens, Lindsey \nGraham, Craig and Chambliss.\n  The contributions that our Nation's 1.1 million firefighters, 670,000 \npolice officers and over 890,000 emergency medical professionals make \nin our communities are familiar to us all. We see the results of their \nefforts every night on our TV screens and read about them everyday in \nthe paper. From recent tornados in the Southeast and wildfires in the \nWest, the tragic events at Virginia Tech, and the wrath of Hurricane \nKatrina, our ``first responders'' regularly risk their lives to protect \nproperty, uphold the law and save the lives of others.\n  While performing their jobs many first responders have made the \nultimate sacrifice. Over 100 firefighters are killed in the line of \nduty every year. Tragically in 2006, 145 law enforcement officers were \nkilled in the line of duty as well. And though many might not think a \ncareer in the emergency medical services, EMS, is dangerous, EMS \nworkers actually have an occupational fatality rate that is comparable \nwith that of firefighters and police officers.\n  Yet to recognize our first responders only for their sacrifices would \nbe to ignore the everyday contributions that they make in communities \nthroughout America. In addition to battling fires, firefighters perform \nimportant fire prevention and public education duties, like teaching \nour children how to be ``fire safe.'' Police officers don't simply \narrest criminals, they actively prevent crime and make our \nneighborhoods safer and more livable. And if we or our loved ones \nexperience a medical emergency, EMTs are there at a moment's notice to \nprovide life-saving care.\n  In many ways, our first responders embody the very best of the \nAmerican spirit. With charity and compassion, these brave men and women \nregularly put the well-being of others before their own, oftentimes at \ngreat personal risk. Through their actions they have become heroes to \nmany. Through their example they are role models to all of us.\n  While various cities and towns have recognized the contributions made \nby their local first responders by declaring a ``first responder day,'' \nthere exists no national day to honor and thank these courageous men \nand women. The time has come to give our first responders the national \nday of appreciation that they deserve.\n  Designating September 25th as National First Responder Appreciation \nday provides an opportunity for this institution, and the people of the \nUnited States, to honor first responders for their contributions, \nsacrifices and dedication to public service.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting passage of this \nworthwhile resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6898-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 216--RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \nFOUNDING OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH AND DECLARING \n            THE MONTH OF MAY NATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 216\n\n       Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research, the \n     oldest and largest scientific cancer research organization in \n     the United States, was founded on May 7, 1907, at the Willard \n     Hotel in Washington, D.C., by a group of physicians and \n     scientists interested in research to further the \n     investigation into and spread new knowledge about cancer;\n       Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research is \n     focused on every aspect of high-quality, innovative cancer \n     research and is the authoritative source of information and \n     publications about advances in the causes, diagnosis, \n     treatment, and prevention of cancer;\n       Whereas, since its founding, the American Association for \n     Cancer Research has accelerated the growth and dissemination \n     of new knowledge about cancer and the complexity of this \n     disease to speed translation of new discoveries for the \n     benefit of cancer patients, and has provided the information \n     needed by elected officials to make informed decisions on \n     public policy and sustained funding for cancer research;\n       Whereas partnerships with research scientists and the \n     general public, survivors and patient advocates, \n     philanthropic organizations, industry, and government have \n     led to advanced breakthroughs, early detection tools which \n     have increased survival rates, and a better quality of life \n     for cancer survivors;\n       Whereas our national investment in cancer research has \n     yielded substantial returns in terms of research advances and \n     lives saved, with a scholarly estimate that every 1 percent \n     decline in cancer mortality saves our national economy \n     $500,000,000,000;\n       Whereas cancer continues to be one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns, killing 1 American every minute, and \n     12 individuals worldwide every minute;\n       Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research Annual \n     Meeting on April 14 through 18, 2007, was a large and \n     comprehensive gathering of leading cancer researchers, \n     scientists, and clinicians engaged in all aspects of clinical \n     investigations pertaining to human cancer as well as the \n     scientific disciplines of cellular, molecular, and tumor \n     biology, carcinogenesis, chemistry, developmental biology and \n     stem cells, endocrinology, epidemiology and biostatistics, \n     experimental and molecular therapeutics, immunology, \n     radiobiology and radiation oncology, imaging, prevention, and \n     survivorship research;\n       Whereas, as part of its centennial celebration, the \n     American Association for Cancer Research has published \n     ``Landmarks in Cancer Research'' citing the events or \n     discoveries after 1907 that have had a profound effect on \n     advancing our knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, \n     treatment, and prevention of cancer;\n       Whereas these ``Landmarks in Cancer Research'' are intended \n     as an educational, living document, an ever-changing \n     testament to human ingenuity and creativity in the scientific \n     struggle to understand and eliminate the diseases \n     collectively known as cancer;\n       Whereas, because more than 60 percent of all cancer occurs \n     in people over the age of 65, issues relating to the \n     interface of aging and cancer, ranging from the most basic \n     science questions to epidemiologic relationships and to \n     clinical and health services research issues, are of concern \n     to society;\n       Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research is \n     proactively addressing these issues paramount to our aging \n     population through a Task Force on Cancer and Aging, special \n     conferences, and other programs which engage the scientific \n     community in response to this demographic imperative: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the American Association for Cancer \n     Research on its 100 year anniversary celebration, ``A Century \n     of Leadership in Science - A Future of Cancer Prevention and \n     Cure'';\n       (2) recognizes the invaluable contributions made by the \n     American Association for Cancer Research in its quest to \n     prevent and cure cancer and save lives through cancer \n     research;\n       (3) expresses the gratitude of the people of the United \n     States for the American Association for Cancer Research's \n     contributions toward progress in advancing cancer research;

Res. 211\n\n       Whereas, for several months, the President of Venezuela, \n     Hugo Chavez, has been announcing over various media that he \n     will not renew the current concession of the television \n     station ``Radio Caracas Television'', also known as RCTV, \n     which is set to expire on May 27, 2007, because of its \n     adherence to an editorial stance different from his way of \n     thinking;\n       Whereas President Chavez justifies this measure based on \n     the alleged role RCTV played in the unsuccessful \n     unconstitutional attempts in April 2002 to unseat President \n     Chavez, under circumstances where there exists no filed \n     complaint or judicial sentence that would sustain such a \n     charge, nor any legal sanction against RCTV that would \n     prevent the renewal of its concession, as provided for under \n     Venezuelan law;\n       Whereas the refusal to renew the concession of any \n     television or radio broadcasting station that complies with \n     legal regulations in the matter of telecommunications \n     constitutes a transgression against the freedom of thought \n     and expression, which is prohibited by Article 13 of the \n     American Convention on Human Rights, signed at San Jose, \n     Costa Rica, July 18, 1978, which has been signed by the \n     United States;\n       Whereas that convention establishes that ``the right of \n     expression may not be restricted by indirect methods or \n     means, such as the abuse of government or private controls \n     over newsprint, radio broadcasting frequencies, or equipment \n     used in the dissemination of information, or by any other \n     means tending to impede the communication and circulation of \n     ideas and opinions'';\n       Whereas the Inter-American Declaration of Principles on \n     Freedom of Expression, approved by the Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights, states in Principle 13, ``The \n     exercise of power and the use of public funds by the state, \n     the granting of customs duty privileges, the arbitrary and \n     discriminatory placement of official advertising and \n     government loans; the concession of radio and television \n     broadcast frequencies, among others, with the intent to put \n     pressure on and punish or reward and provide privileges to \n     social communicators and communications media because of the \n     opinions they express threaten freedom of expression, and \n     must be explicitly prohibited by law. The means of \n     communication have the right to carry out their role in an \n     independent manner. Direct or indirect pressures exerted upon \n     journalists or other social communicators to stifle the \n     dissemination of information are incompatible with freedom of \n     expression.'';\n       Whereas, according to the principles of the American \n     Convention on Human Rights and the Inter-American Declaration \n     of Principles on Freedom of Expression, to both of which \n     Venezuela is a party, the decision not to renew the \n     concession of the television station RCTV is an assault \n     against freedom of thought and expression and cannot be \n     accepted by democratic countries, especially by those in \n     North America who are signatories to the American Convention \n     on Human Rights;\n       Whereas the most paradoxical aspect of the decision by \n     President Chavez is that it strongly conflicts with two \n     principles from the Liberator Simon Bolivar's thinking, \n     principles President Chavez says inspire him, which state \n     that ``[p]ublic opinion is the most sacred of objects, it \n     needs the protection of an enlightened government which knows \n     that opinion is the fountain of the most important of \n     events,'' and that ``[t]he right to express one's thoughts \n     and opinions, by word, by writing or by any other means, is \n     the first and most worthy asset mankind has in society. The \n     law itself will never be able to prohibit it.''; and\n       Whereas the United States should raise its concerns about \n     these and other serious restrictions on freedoms of thought \n     and expression being imposed by the Government of Venezuela \n     before the Organization of American States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its profound concern about the transgression \n     against freedom of thought and expression that is being \n     attempted and committed in Venezuela by the refusal of the \n     President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, to renew the concession \n     of the television station ``Radio Caracas Television'' (RCTV) \n     merely because of its adherence to an editorial and \n     informational stance distinct from the thinking of the \n     Government of Venezuela; and\n       (2) strongly encourages the Organization of American States \n     to respond appropriately, with full consideration of the \n     necessary institutional instruments, to such transgression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/24/senate-section/article/S6923-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6923-S6924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF STAN HYWET HALL AND GARDENS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
