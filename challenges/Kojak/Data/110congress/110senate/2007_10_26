Mr. President, this morning we will return to the Amtrak \nlegislation. I am not certain the managers have that many amendments to \ndeal with, so I don't think we will be in session for a long time \nworking on this bill, but we are open for business. While no rollcall \nvotes will occur today, the majority manager, working with Senator \nLott, is expected to be here to work with any Members who want to offer \namendments.\n  I am going to shortly file cloture on this bill. This cloture vote \nwill occur during Tuesday's session, and it is the expectations of the \nmanagers it can be concluded during Tuesday's session. Let me say, this \nis a rare cloture petition. It is signed by Democrats and Republicans \nin equal numbers. This is an extremely important bill for our country, \nand the Senate realizes that. I am hopeful and quite confident that we \nwill not need cloture, but if we do, we can go ahead and do that. If we \ndon't, that will save us some time. We have lots to do here that is so \nimportant.\n  I am also going to--unless something untoward comes--move to the farm \nbill a week from Monday or thereabouts. The reason for that is this is \na bill we need to do every 5 years. While I, like many, think the bill \ncould be better, I think the committee did a tremendously good job. \nThere are a lot of reforms in this bill. For some there are not enough, \nbut for the farm bill, I have seen a number of them come through here. \nIt is certainly an improvement. I look forward to having the managers \nwork through it in the quickest time possible. I congratulate the \ncommittee. They worked very hard to come up with this bill.\n\n[[Page S13466]]\n\n  As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday, \nbut Members should be here Monday to offer amendments on Amtrak if they \nso desire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13466-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2233, S. 2234, H.R. 505, H.R. 3963\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, with cloture filed, we are hopeful we \nwill be able to move with dispatch to the support and approval of S. \n294, the Amtrak bill.\n  I wish to start this morning by thanking our colleague and my \ncosponsor and longtime Amtrak supporter, Senator Trent Lott, for the \nopportunity to work together to move this bill along. His support is \nessential, and I know he is pleased with the progress we have made this \nmorning up to this point. Today is our third day on the bill. Yesterday \nwe made very good progress. We were able to work through a number of \namendments, some of which we were able to agree to and some of which we \ndisposed of with votes. Now, this morning, cloture has been filed, \nwhich should put us on a schedule to finish this bill early next week. \nIt is very important that we do so for the future of America's \ntransportation systems.\n  Whether it is to reduce congestion on our roads or at our airports, \nor to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that puts us at risk of global \nwarming--our society and our world--or to give people another safe mode \nof transportation during an emergency, rail is critical. We cannot \nneglect the contribution it makes in the event of a calamity or \ndisaster, whether it comes from a terrorist attack or from an erratic \nact of nature such as a storm or forest fires, and all of the things we \nsee that call at times for evacuation.\n  Our bill, by authorizing $2 billion a year for Amtrak in the States \nover the next 6 years, will make all of that much easier for America to \ndeal with the problem of a decaying infrastructure. It provides funding \nfor Amtrak's capital needs as well as State grants for passenger rail.\n  While Amtrak had record ridership and revenues last year, our bill \nrequires changes at Amtrak to make sure these funds will help the \nrailroad to continue moving in the right direction. It would require \nAmtrak to reform its operations, to reduce its Federal operating \nsubsidy by over 40 percent over the life of the bill.\n  We worked very hard to forge this bipartisan compromise plan. Last \nCongress, our plan was approved by the Senate as an amendment to the \nbudget bill by a vote of 93 to 6. I hope that early next week we will \nget a strong vote in support of our bill so we can be one step closer \nto making it law.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment and call up amendments Nos. 3467, 3468, \n3469, and 3470 en bloc, on behalf of Senator DeMint.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to S. 294, the \nAmtrak reauthorization bill. I applaud the authors of the bill for \ntheir hard work in putting this legislation together. As one who hopes \nto see a robust, efficient passenger rail service, I have long been a \nsupporter and rider on Amtrak. As Governor of Missouri, I started the \nState support of Amtrak to run trains between Kansas City and St. \nLouis. As I have watched Amtrak over the years, I have been \nincreasingly concerned about the rising costs and relatively stagnating \nridership. As I look at this bill, I do not believe it includes all the \nneeded reforms that are crucial to the success of Amtrak.\n  While there are many positive aspects of the bill, the fundamental \nproblem with Amtrak is that it has no clearly defined mission. Is it \nsupposed to provide only those services where it can make a profit? Is \nit supposed to supplement air service in specific markets regardless of \ncost? Is it supposed to serve rural markets regardless of cost? Is it \nsupposed to provide tourist travel regardless of cost? All of these \nhave been held out from time to time as reasons to subsidize Amtrak and \nas excuses for why it should not be held accountable for the effective \nuse of the taxpayers' money. However, those are empty excuses. The \nmoney continues to flow out, and I believe strong reforms are \nnecessary.\n  While Amtrak's revenue, ridership, and cash operating loss numbers \nimproved this year, this improved financial performance reflects labor \ncosts held low by the absence of a labor settlement. Once a settlement \nis reached, Amtrak's costs will jump up, reflecting the pay raises that \nhave largely been deferred during the past 7 years during which time \nthere has not been a labor contract.\n  Amtrak has made no significant progress in restructuring its \noperations to become less reliant on Federal funds. The pace of \nAmtrak's reform savings has slowed from $61 million in fiscal year 2006 \nto a planned $46 million in fiscal year 2008. There is little chance \nAmtrak will achieve anywhere near the $500 million in annual reform \nsavings it promised when it adopted its 2005 plan.\n  GAO reports consistently cite that Amtrak has lost the focus of its \nstatutory mandate to be operated and managed as a for-profit company.\n  Just last year, over 10 percent of Amtrak's operating subsidy was \nspent on food and beverages and a like amount subsidized first-class \nservice. There is no critical public purpose associated with such \nexpenditures. Yet there are some who assume they are OK because that is \nwhat Amtrak has always done.\n  S. 294, I regret to say, will not change this deplorable system. \nWhile section 208 would have FRA and Amtrak develop performance \nmetrics, there is no clear statement of Amtrak's mission on which to \nbase these metrics.\n  After 36 years, we should not miss the opportunity to finally and \nclearly state Amtrak's mission. It is for that reason that I offer as \nan amendment to S. 294 the establishment of Amtrak's mission. That \nmission should be:\n\n       To provide efficient and effective intercity passenger rail \n     mobility in those travel markets where passenger rail offers \n     a trip-time and service quality competitive travel option \n     consistent with the goal of continual reduction in Federal \n     operating subsidies required to provide service.\n\n  With this mission clearly established, then FRA and Amtrak can \nestablish meaningful performance measures that hold Amtrak accountable \nfor accomplishing that mission. Obviously, meaningful benchmarks will \nhelp both Amtrak and those of us in Congress measure its efforts at \nreform. In fact, failure to meet benchmarks will be a good reason to \nlessen or terminate these excessive subsidies.\n  My colleagues may say that the bill contains benchmark reforms under \nsection 208, Metrics and Standards. The section reads:\n\n       Within 180 days . . . develop new or improve existing \n     metrics and minimum standards for measuring the performance \n     and service quality of intercity passenger train operations, \n     including cost recovery, on-time performance and minutes of \n     delay, ridership, on-board services, stations, facilities, \n     equipment, and other services. Such metrics, at a minimum, \n     shall include the percentage of avoidable and fully allocated \n     operating costs covered by passenger revenues on each route, \n     ridership per train mile operated, measures of on-time \n     performance and delays incurred by intercity passenger rail.\n\n  Exactly what reforms are contained within these metrics and \nstandards? There is no mission, no goals, and no benchmarks for \noperating subsidies and, as I said, quite frankly, no reform.\n  If the authorizers were truly offering operating metrics, they would \nhave year-over-year improvement on metrics applied on a route-by-route \nbusiness line or corporate basis on some of the following:\n  Operating ratio--operating revenues relative to operating costs, \nexcluding depreciation to measure improvements in cost recovery; two, \ncash operating loss--would measure revenue expense improvements; three, \nsavings from reform initiative--while the operating loss includes these \nsavings, monitoring these savings allows for tracking the \nimplementation of structural reform improvements; four, cash operating \nloss for passenger mile--an overall efficiency measure; five, labor \nproductivity--passenger mile per employee; and finally, six, equipment \nreliability--percent of units out of service.\n  The other thing missing from Amtrak oversight has been real teeth. So \nI propose changing the language in section 210 from being permissive, \nwhich says the FRA ``may'' withhold grants from trains that don't \nmeasure up, to being mandatory, to say that FRA ``shall'' withhold \ngrants from trains that don't measure up.\n  Today, the Secretary of Transportation has the ability to discontinue \nservice on specific routes, but none have been proposed for elimination \nbecause perhaps there is no mission\n\n[[Page S13468]]\n\nstatement for Amtrak on which to make a determination for closure.\n  This measure I propose does not push Amtrak off the cliff, but it \nrecognizes we cannot afford for Amtrak to be all things to all people. \nIt requires Amtrak to take a degree of responsibility that has been \nlacking in the use of the taxpayers' money. It would require Amtrak to \nimprove efficiency and effectiveness of its service, to reduce the \ndemands it makes of our taxpayers, including, where appropriate, \nrecognizing that passenger rail is not the best option in all places.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nperiod for morning business be delayed until we finish this discussion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to respond to Senator Bond's \namendment, but I first ask the Senator from Missouri whether the delay \nhe experienced this morning was due to congestion on the highways?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, that is what we all live with, I assure my \nfriend from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I just wanted to see whether there was any personal \ndirect experience with congestion on the roads. I don't think there is \na city or a town in this country, a highway that doesn't experience \nincredible pressure from its expanded use; will the Senator agree?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I agree with that. Of course, I would agree \nin some areas there are no rail lines available to relieve that \ncongestion. While many metropolitan areas do have rail lines, they are \ndefinitely an efficient alternative. In many areas of the country, \npeople do not have rail service, existing rails. So rails cannot solve \nall of our transportation congestion problems.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for \nhis suggestion that we expand rail service all across this country.\n  Mr. BOND. I didn't say that, no.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That was the interpretation. The Senator said there \nwasn't rail service available in lots of places. I take the positive \nside of that statement and say let's get on with our task of providing \nservice.\n  While I appreciate the Senator's perspective, I believe there is no \nneed for this amendment. It covers some of the same debate we have \nalready voted on as part of the discussion. This amendment establishes \na new mission for Amtrak and sets a new standard by which Amtrak and \noperating subsidies for Amtrak services should be judged. While I can \nagree with the general principles of the mission statement, it largely \ncovers issues already contained in existing Federal law related to \nAmtrak and is, therefore, redundant.\n  We have seen Amtrak getting expanded use, but we have to look at what \nhas happened in our society, what the conditions are that have put so \nmuch pressure on Amtrak. When we look at the growth in population \nalone, since Amtrak became a quasi-government corporation, the \npopulation of this country has expanded by 100 million people in barely \nover 35 years. It was never thought that our aviation system would be \nso strained because of inadequate infrastructure, and whatever the \nreasons, that it cannot be relied upon. One out of four flights is \nlate, appointments are missed, crowding is standard, our highways are \njammed. Maybe in some parts of the country we don't see the congestion \nwe see in many of the metropolitan areas. But highways are notoriously \nslow-moving now because of expanded traffic.\n  So Amtrak has been under the same pressure. And thank goodness we \nhave Amtrak in existence. We have seen more rapid service from Amtrak \nand more riders--over 26 million passengers in the last year. So when \nwe look at Amtrak's performance, we have to consider under what \nconditions it operates. I think it is fair to say that Amtrak was never \nfinanced at the level it should have been to be an up-to-date, modern \nrailroad in this country.\n  I have had the opportunity, as we know, to ride one of the French \ntrains, TGV, in which a trip of just over 200 miles from Paris to \nBrussels, where our NATO headquarters exists, is 1 hour 20 minutes. If \nanything similar to that could ever be achieved with Amtrak, we would \nreduce the congestion in the sky substantially. It is so crowded in the \nair these days, separations are narrowed, and we are expecting over \n5,000 new light jets into our system in the next 10 years.\n  We have to look at the expectations Amtrak has had to live with over \nthis period of time. Insufficient capital, that is where it all \nstarted, and it has continued to make it very difficult for Amtrak to \nproduce the kind of service we want. I believe they ought to be \nresponsible for maintaining the quality of service, for providing the \ndata that is required on what progress has been lacking. Current law \nalready requires Amtrak to minimize Government subsidies and provide \nhigh-quality rail service.\n  I believe the real goal of this amendment is to reduce or eliminate \nFederal operating support for long-distance routes and other services \nwhere current infrastructure problems or ontime performance limits the \nservice quality. Of course, as I said earlier, these problems resulting \nfrom insufficient capital expenditures and also hosting freight \nrailroad delays are addressed by this bill.\n  Most of the accountability Senator Bond desires is already in our \nbill through requirements of a 5-year plan, through the reduction of \nthe operating subsidy by 40 percent. Our bill calls for changes that \nare significant as we attempt to put them in place. That is where we \nare going.\n  While the Senator's amendment also requires the Secretary to \neliminate funding for any route not meeting Amtrak's long-distance plan \nrequired under the bill, S. 294 already gives the Secretary this \nauthority. But our bill preserves some flexibility for the Secretary to \ncontinue a long-distance route if Amtrak could not implement a plan or \ndid not meet the goals of a plan for legitimate reasons or events \nbeyond Amtrak's control. Heaven forbid if we have another serious \nhurricane or terrorist attack. The Secretary should have the ability to \ntake these situations into consideration when judging whether Amtrak \nmeets the requirements demanded under the law.\n  I look forward to debating this amendment further. I certainly am \nopen to discussion with the Senator from Missouri on his amendment. But \nas it is currently drafted, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to respond to my friend from New \nJersey and point out that while I may have had some operating delays \ncoming into downtown Washington this morning because of the rain, I am \nnot the only one. Service reliability continues to plague Amtrak. \nAmtrak systemwide in 2007 had ontime performance through August at only \n68 percent and long-distance ontime performance was only 40 percent.\n  The Senator points out that there are constraints on Amtrak. With the \nexception of Connecticut, which I believe has its lines, most of the \nAmtrak lines run on lines established, bought, and paid for by freight \nrailroads. For the lines to be kept operating, they have to continue to \nuse freight.\n  If the chairman of the subcommittee is proposing that we build a \nnational network of passenger rails--buy the land, buy the equipment, \ninstall the rails--I will be happy to take a look at the numbers that \nwould be involved, whether they are billions or trillions, but I \nquestion whether we could make that investment.\n  What I have stated only in this amendment is that we should come to \nan agreement on what the mission of Amtrak is. What is it supposed to \ndo? If you don't know where you are going, it is hard to tell when you \nhave gotten there. Yes, we put money into a capital operating plan, a \n5-year plan in 2005. There were supposed to be operating savings. The \noperating savings are not being realized. What I propose is simply good \nmanagement techniques.\n  My colleague has run a successful business, and I assume to run a \nbusiness he had to have a mission and he had to have standards and \ngoals by which to judge the achievement of that mission. S. 294 talks \nabout all kinds of metrics, but it doesn't say there are any goals. How \ndo you know if you\n\n[[Page S13469]]\n\nhave gotten there? Where are you going? You don't know.\n  Maybe I have missed it, but I don't think any of us are clear on the \nclearly stated mission of Amtrak and any standards by which the \nachievement of that mission should be judged. I would be happy to have \na discussion--and this is the appropriate place to do it--on what \nshould be the mission of Amtrak. Maybe for my edification, I ask my \nfriend from New Jersey to cite to me what the written mission of Amtrak \nis because I will have to admit, I am not familiar with that specific \nmission statement and the standards and goals by which Amtrak and the \nFRA and we in Congress can judge the effective accomplishment of the \nobjectives within the parameter of that mission. Through the Chair, I \nask my friend from New Jersey to enlighten me.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nasking this question at this moment because I have here existing law, \nwhich is continued in S. 294. Here, in existing law, it says the \npurpose of the management is:\n\n       By using innovative operating and marketing concepts, \n     Amtrak shall provide intercity and commuter rail passenger \n     transportation that completely develops the potential of \n     modern rail transportation to meet the intercity and commuter \n     passenger transportation needs of the United States.\n\n  The first goal is to:\n\n       use its best business judgment in acting to minimize the \n     U.S. Government subsidies, including--\n\n  And it lists a number of these things which I will submit for my \ncolleague and friend to take a look at and see if these questions are \nnot already dealt with.\n  Yes, we have to be more diligent. There is no doubt we have to fill \nthe board of Amtrak's open positions. We have not done that. We want to \nexpand the board to a more significant body of opinion. We are doing \nall kinds of things.\n  I have an affection for the State of Missouri, having been a soldier \nthere many years ago and trying to dig foxholes in the Ozark Mountains. \nWe know what steels the spine of those people who live in Missouri now. \nIt is the depth and the quality of the rock upon which most of Missouri \nis built. That is why the railroad contributes so much, for instance, \nfrom Chicago to St. Louis, Kansas City to Kansas City.\n  But in the final analysis, I think it is important to note a \nsignificant difference between business operations. I was fortunate \nenough to run a fairly large company; but business to business. \nHowever, it is clearly stated that Amtrak is a not-for-profit \norganization. When we look at what happens with good business \noperations and think of the subsidy that has been given to the \nairlines--it was as a result of a terrible calamity in American \nhistory, 9/11--but over $20 billion has been given to the airlines, \nfor-profit businesses. They are doing very well right now, I might add, \nand still getting subsidies.\n  I think, in fairness, we will have a chance to look at this further. \nWe are pressed by several things, not the least of which is that there \nare others who would like to be included in the debate. I will be happy \nto loan the Senator from Missouri my copy of the existing law, if he \nwould like to borrow it for a while.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may respond, I don't see any clearly \ndefined mission. If my colleague doesn't agree that Amtrak should be \nproviding efficient and effective passenger service in those travel \nmarkets in which passenger rail offers a trip time and service quality, \ncompetitive or complementary travel option consistent with the goal of \ncontinuing to reduce Federal operating subsidies--we are not saying it \nshould be a for-profit company, but it certainly should not be a \ncontinual growing loss operation.\n  I believe we must have some discipline that I do not see in the law \nand particularly saying ``best business practices''--best business \npractices to do what?\n  I hope we can continue this discussion, and I thank the Chair and my \ncolleagues for the time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I understand we are ready to go to \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13469-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to talk this morning about the \nPresident's request for $190-plus billion in emergency funding for the \nwar in Iraq and for activities in Afghanistan.\n  Before I do that, however, I wish to mention the subject of Iran. I \nnotice in the paper this morning, and I noticed the other day in a \npress conference by President Bush, he made a reference to world war \nIII in a description of the issues with Iran. I am very concerned about \nwhat I hear from this administration. This administration has had a \nhistory of describing for us how they see the world. Many of us have \nspent a lot of time in classified, top-secret briefings with members of \nthis administration, some of whom are now speaking out now about Iran. \nThey include Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Vice President Dick \nCheney, and others. We have had plenty of experience in top-secret \nbriefings with them in which they described circumstances with respect \nto the country of Iraq.\n  It turns out what we were told in top-secret briefings about Iraq was \nnot accurate. No one has done the in-depth investigation to find out \nwhy that was the case. It appears to me, in some cases that which was \ndescribed to us by top-level folks in this administration about Iraq \nprior to the Iraq war--in some cases, it turns out they either should \nhave known, and in some cases may have known, that what they were \nsaying to the Congress and to the American people was not accurate.\n  My point is this. I think there is precious little credibility on the \npart of the administration on these issues. I do not--I would say most \nof my colleagues feel the same--do not want this administration moving \noff precipitously based on information they have, to take military \naction of any type against another country. They certainly cannot in my \njudgment do that without the consent of Congress. I believe they would \nhave a very difficult time getting the consent the Congress, given the \nlack of credibility in this administration on many of these issues.\n  These are important issues. Preventing the country of Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon is a very important mission, in my judgment. \nBut we will best accomplish that through diplomatic means with other \ncountries, particularly with the Europeans and the Russians and many \nothers. I must say my own view is that the foreign policy of this \nadministration--I regret to say it--has largely been an inept and a \nclumsy foreign policy at best. We face, as a result of it, very \nsubstantial challenges around the world. My hope is that we see much \nmore action on diplomacy and negotiation and working to form alliances \nand much less front-page headlines by members of this administration.\n  Now I wish to talk about priorities. I wish to talk about the \nPresident's request for $196 billion in emergency funding, none of it \npaid for. But first I want to talk about this little girl. This little \ngirl, her name is Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight. Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight is \nfrom the Crow Nation in Montana. She loved to dance, as you can see--\nsparkling, beautiful eyes, 5 years old, loved to dance the Indian \ndances.\n  Ta'shon's grandmother testified at a hearing I held at the Crow \nReservation in Montana, with my colleague, Senator Tester. Her \ngrandmother told us a story about Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight. Ta'Shon \ndied, by the way. This little girl with the bright eyes and the love of \ndancing isn't with us anymore. Ta'Shon had health problems. Last year \nshe was taken, many times, to the Crow Indian Health Service clinic. \nThey were treating her--after they had diagnosed various things--they \nwere treating her for depression. It turned out this little girl didn't \nhave\n\n[[Page S13470]]\n\ndepression, this little girl had a cancerous tumor, terminal cancer.\n  At one point, her grandfather, who was with her at the clinic, \npointed out the bulbous condition of her fingertips and toes and said \nto the health care folks that it appeared to him this reflected a lack \nof oxygen to the body and they ought to check on what was causing that. \nThat concern was dismissed.\n  On another visit, her grandmother asked the doctor to eliminate the \npossibility that this child was suffering from cancer or leukemia, but \nthe family's concerns went unheeded. In August of 2006, Ta'Shon was \nrushed from the Crow clinic to the St. Vincent Hospital in Billings, \nMT, airlifted to the Denver Children's Hospital, diagnosed with an \nuntreatable, incurable form of cancer. Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight lived 3 \nmore months after the tumor was discovered, in what the grandmother \nsaid was unmedicated pain, and then died.\n  I show you this picture of this beautiful young girl because her \nfamily said it was all right for me to use her image to describe the \nserious problem of health care on American Indian reservations. Ta'Shon \nRain Littlelight didn't get the health care we would expect, and she \ndied. We had, on the floor of the Senate, a bill that would have \nprovided 3.8 million American kids who do not now have health insurance \ncoverage--it would have provided them health insurance coverage. But \nthe President says that is not the priority, so he vetoed the bill. I \nam trying to bring a bill to the floor of the Senate right now that \nextends and reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. It has \nbeen 8 years, and I am likely to have to have a cloture motion filed on \nthe motion to proceed to it, because for some it may not be a priority, \napparently.\n  This ought to be a priority. Yes, for this little girl, her memory, \nand the health of other children similar to her, it ought to be a \npriority in this country. I hope this Senate will make it a priority. \nWe certainly did on the Children's Health Insurance Program, and we \ncame up short in the House of being able to override the President's \nveto. But we will try again.\n  Isn't this something most of us believe represents an urgency? As I \nhave said before, I don't know what is in second, third or fourth place \nin what is important in people's lives, but I know what is in first \nplace. It is their children and their children's health.\n  Having said that about priorities and values and about someone \nlooking at what we spend our money on 100 years from now, looking back, \nthe historians, through the rearview mirror, will say: What was that \ngroup of people--what were they doing? What was their value system? \nWhat were they about? They said they didn't believe--at least some of \nthem didn't believe covering children with health insurance was the \nmost significant priority. They didn't believe that adequate funding \nfor the Indian Health Service was the most significant priority. Nobody \nknew that Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight lived several months in unmedicated \npain, lived many months before that in an undiagnosed condition, with a \nterminal illness; nobody knew that, so that wasn't a priority.\n  So let's look at the priorities. The President has proposed to us, in \nthis year, that we spend $196 billion in emergency funding to continue \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. By my calculation, that is nearly $16 billion \na month, $4 billion a week, and not one penny of it is paid for. The \nPresident said: I declare an emergency. Put it on top of the debt.\n  Then the President went to Arkansas, at exactly the same time, and \nheld a press conference at a political rally and said: I am going to be \nthe fiscally responsible President, and I am going to stop this \nprofligate spending.\n  I don't know, maybe he thinks people are not paying attention, people \nare not reading what is going on. Here is what the Congressional Budget \nOffice says. They estimate a $2.4 trillion long-term war cost.\n\n       The U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could cost taxpayers \n     a total of $2.4 trillion by 2017 when counting the huge \n     interest costs because combat is being financed with borrowed \n     money, according to the . . . the nonpartisan Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n\n  We are borrowing the money because the President wants to spend the \nmoney, but he doesn't want to ask anybody to pay for it. Here is what \nthis war is costing, all of it borrowed. The soldiers fight at the \norder of the Commander in Chief, and when they come back, they and \ntheir children can pay the bills. That is not a value system that makes \nmuch sense to me.\n  Now, the President says: I want another $196 billion, and, by the \nway, if you do not agree with that, you do not support the troops. He \nsays: We will see who supports the troops.\n  Let me make another construct here. This is in some ways about \nsupporting the troops, but it is much more than that. It is about \nsupporting the contractors, because a substantial portion of this war \nis contracted out. I want to go through with my colleagues about whom \nwe are supporting with this money as well, contractors for whom there \nis no oversight.\n  The Secretary of State was up here yesterday answering questions \nabout that. I hope the Secretary of State is properly chastened, \nreading the stories and finally understanding what these contractors \nhave been doing, with no oversight and virtually no accountability.\n  Let me go through a list of these contract issues so that people \nunderstand, and the President would understand. This is not just about \n``are you supporting the troops,'' it is about are you supporting the \ncontractors with virtually no oversight.\n  This is from September 21, 2007, the New York Times:\n\n       Military officials said that contracts worth $6 billion to \n     provide essential supplies to American troops in Kuwait, Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, including food, water and shelter were under \n     review by criminal investigators. In addition, $88 billion in \n     contracts and programs, including those for body armor for \n     American soldiers and material for Iraqi and Afghan security \n     forces, are being audited for financial irregularities.\n\n  So when the President says: Are you supporting the soldiers? My \nquestion is this: Are you watching the contractors? Because the \nAmerican taxpayer is getting fleeced. This does not support soldiers, \nthis undermines the soldiers. Of $6 billion in contracts reviewed, the \nPentagon says: The Army reported that it had 78 cases of fraud and \ncorruption under investigation, had obtained 20 criminal indictments, \nand had uncovered over $15 million in bribes. That is from the same \narticle.\n  Contract abuse. Of the enormous expenditures of American and Iraqi \nmoney on the Iraq reconstruction program, at least $40 billion overall \nhas been criticized for reasons that go well beyond the corruption \ncases that have been uncovered so far.\n  Weak oversight, poor planning, and endless security problems have \ncontributed to many of the program's failures. Some $40 billion has \nbeen spent. No, this is not in support of troops. This is in support of \nthe administration's mission by which they hire contractors and shovel \nthe money in their direction.\n  Most of us have read the stories about this, but they are pretty \nunbelievable. We sent 185,000 AK-47s to Iraq; 185,000. They can only \naccount for 75,000 of them, so 110,000 AK-47s, bought and paid for by \nthe American taxpayers, are missing. Some undoubtedly will land in the \nhands of the insurgents being aimed at American troops. We sent 170,000 \npistols; 80,000 of them are missing. That is unbelievably inept on the \npart of those whom we ought to expect to be accountable and to make \ncertain the taxpayers' money is spent wisely, No. 1; No. 2, that if you \nare sending weapons to Iraq, they end up in the right hands, not the \nwrong hands.\n  It is unbelievable that we have a couple hundred thousand AK-47s and \npistols that we sent to Iraq, we do not have the foggiest idea where \nthey are, yet we know some of them end up in the wrong hands.\n  We have trained about 360,000 police and soldiers for security in the \narmed forces and the police forces. We have trained 360,000 of them. We \nbelieve there are somewhere around 180,000 to 273,000 still around, but \nno one knows. Absenteeism is up around 50 percent. There is no official \ndocument in the Federal Government that tells us how many exist in the \nsecurity forces at the moment; and, by the way, today we are only \ntraining about one-third of the number of Iraqis as we were training \nbefore the surge. So we have reduced by two-thirds the number we are \nnow training, even as we are losing a substantial portion of the \n360,000 who have\n\n[[Page S13471]]\n\nalready been trained for security, which begs the question: When we \nleave Iraq, and we will, is it up to the Iraqis to provide for their \nown security? After you have trained 360,000 people to do so, have you \nnot trained enough Iraqis, so if the Iraqis have the will to provide \nfor their own security, they can do that? One would expect so.\n  Between April of 2003 and June of 2004, $12 billion of U.S. currency \nwas hauled to Iraq in C-130s on big pallets. It was disbursed by what \nwas called the Coalition Provisional Authority, which we created.\n  At least $9 billion of that is missing. Some have said: So what? It \ndoes not matter. This money was Iraq's own money. This was the oil \nmoney we had for safekeeping. So if we lost the money that came from \nIraq oil, so what?\n  Well, here is the ``so what.'' Retired ADM David Oliver, then the \nCPA's director of management and budget, when asked by a BBC reporter \nabout the cash that they airlifted.\n  I have no idea. I can't tell you whether the money went to the right \nthings or didn't, nor do I actually think it's important.\n  Tuesday, October 23, that is this week, an independent oversight \nagency said it could not complete an audit of a $1.2 billion contract \nto train Iraqi policemen because the records kept by the \nState Department and by DynCorp International, the contractor, were \ninaccurate and in disarray. . . . The documents were not sufficient in \norder for us to do an audit.\n\n  The Secretary of State is up here this week testifying. I do not know \nwhether she was asked about this. But this is under her stewardship, \nher responsibility.\n  The State Department paid $43.8 million for manufacturing and \ntemporary storage of a residential camp that has never been used. The \nState Department's payment of $36.4 million for weapons and equipment, \nincluding body armor, armored vehicles, and communications equipment \ncould not be accounted for.\n  This week again: Among the problems identified before the audit was \nsuspended were duplicate payments, the purchase of a never used $1.8 \nmillion x-ray scanner, and payments of $387,000 to DynCorp officials in \nhotels rather than other available accommodations.\n  I should have brought a towel that Henry Bunting brought to a hearing \nI held last year to show you symbolically what has been fundamentally \nwrong. Henry Bunting was a purchaser for Halliburton or Kellogg, Brown \nand Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton. He said: I worked in Kuwait. I \nwas supposed to buy the equipment and so on. They wanted towels, hand \ntowels for the troops. So I made out an order for hand towels, because \nHalliburton was furnishing the towels for the troops. My supervisor \nsaid: No, you cannot order that particular hand towel, you have to \norder a hand towel with a logo on it that was embroidered that says \nKBR. We want the logo of our company on the hand towel.\n  Bunting said: But it will triple the price. The supervisor said: It \ndoesn't matter. The taxpayer is paying for this. This is a cost-plus \ncontract. Then Bunting went on to tell us about $7,600 a month for \nleasing an SUV, about paying $40 or $45 a case for Coca-Cola. He went \non to tell us all these stories: It does not matter, the taxpayer is \npaying for it. `\n  It is unbelievable, if you take the lid off this and smell a little \nbit about what is happening with these contracts.\n  The President says: I want $196 billion in additional funding. I want \nit as an emergency. I do not want anybody to pay for it. I want to put \nit on top of the debt. That is almost $16 billion a month this year, $4 \nbillion a week, and I do not want any questions about it, and we are \ngoing to see, he says, who supports American troops.\n  Well, that money is also going to support the same kind of \nincompetence in contracting that has been facing the American taxpayer \nnow for about 4 years. I think hard questions need to be asked, yes, of \nthe President, the Vice President, the heads of agencies who are \nresponsible for this: How do you justify this? How do you justify \ninsisting that this Congress come up with $196 billion and then tell us \nthat we cannot afford, we do not have enough money to care for Ta'Shon \nRain Littlelight? She died because the health care did not exist for \nher. That is not a priority for this administration. The President says \nwe cannot afford it, despite the fact that the bill was fully paid for, \nChildren's Health Insurance. We cannot afford sufficient money for the \nIndian health care system, so Ta'Shon died.\n  What is the value system here? What are the priorities? Once again \nthe President says: Well, the priorities are we need the $196 billion. \nIt is an emergency. If you do not support it, you do not support the \ntroops. The fact is, this entire Senate supports our troops. We have \ndemonstrated it time and time and time again. But it is also time for \nus to tell the President: We do not support a strategy that says: Let's \nkeep spending money and not paying for it. We do not support a strategy \nthat has us in the middle of a civil war, going door to door in \nBaghdad, when Osama bin Laden last week sent us another tape. Osama bin \nLaden is the one who boasted about attacking our country. He is the one \nwho boasted about killing innocent Americans. Our National Intelligence \nEstimate of July of this year says the greatest threat to our country \nis al-Qaida and its leadership, and they are reconstituting themselves \nand developing new training camps, and rebuilding. They are in a \n``secure'' or safe hideaway in northern Pakistan. There ought not be \none acre of ground on this planet that is secure or safe for those who \nmurdered innocent Americans. But instead of dealing with the greatest \nthreat to this country, and that is eliminating the leadership of al-\nQaida, this administration has us going door to door in Baghdad, in the \nmiddle of a civil war, and now says--they say they want $196 billion in \nadditional funding, and they want it as emergency funding, $4 billion a \nweek for the next year.\n  I think there is something horribly wrong with what is going on here. \nI think this Congress has to tell this President that change is on the \nway.\n  I want to mention something that relates to this, because I do not \nknow what this Congress is going to do with all of these funding \nrequests. But I know the next time we vote on emergency funding \nrequests by the President, I am going to offer a couple of amendments. \nThey may be out of order, they may be blue slipped, they may be \nwhatever, but we are going to vote on them one way or the other. That \nis, we need to start paying for that which we are spending money on.\n  The President can go to a political rally down in Arkansas and say: \nThis is a new George W. Bush, and now I am going to be fiscally \nconservative. But the fact is, he has recommended all of this spending, \nthe highest amount of spending in the history of our country from this \nadministration. He now suggests that we continue to spend but not pay \nfor it.\n  I want to talk about a couple of pay-fors. My colleagues have often \nheard me speak about this, but I am going to offer this again the next \ntime we have an emergency funding bill.\n  There is an enterprising reporter named David Evans from Bloomberg. \nDavid Evans went to the Cayman Islands, and he went to this little \nplace on Church Street, a quiet little five-story building, and \nreported that there are 12,748 corporations living here in this little \nfour-story white building.\n  They are not there. This is a legal fiction created by lawyers so \ncompanies could avoid paying taxes. Well, I have got some legislation \nthat would stop that dead in its tracks. You cannot move an address for \nthe purpose of not paying U.S. taxes you rightfully owe. If you are not \ndoing your central business there, you cannot claim this is where you \nare; we tax you as if you never left. I intend to offer that as an \namendment to what the President would suggest we spend money for, and \nnot pay for. I would suggest that: Let's begin paying for some of this.\n  Runaway manufacturing plants, that is another one. I have a piece of \nlegislation I have introduced on runaway manufacturing plants.\n  We actually pay somebody, if they close their American manufacturing \nplant, fire their workers, move the jobs to China, we say: Good for \nyou. We want to give you a tax cut.\n  That is totally nuts. I have tried four times to close it down. There \nare over 50 Senators who actually support this perverse tax break. \nAbout 44 Senators\n\n[[Page S13472]]\n\nhave supported me, and I am going to keep pushing this until we have a \ndeep reservoir of common sense that says it is crazy for us to say, if \nyou close your plant in our country and ship your jobs overseas to \nChina, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, we will give you a tax \nbreak for doing so. That makes no sense at all.\n  Third, I have a bill I have introduced ending benefits of abusive \nforeign cross-border leasing transaction. The most pernicious of all of \nthe things going on is American companies buying foreign assets \nbelonging to foreign governments. Let me give an example. Wachovia \nBank, formerly First Union, one of the big banks, entered into a sale \nin-lease out transaction to purchase a sewer in Bochum, Germany. Why \nwould an American bank want to buy a sewer--not a sewer in America, a \nGerman city sewer system? Because they want to take ownership and be \nable to get large depreciation on property that otherwise would not be \ndepreciated because it is owned by a government. So they lease the \nsewer back to the city which will continue to use the sewer system as \nif they still own it, but that financial transaction turns out to be \nabout a $175 million tax savings to an American bank. Of all of the \nunbelievably pernicious tax cuts that exist, this is it. The Finance \nCommittee has taken some action. Good for them. They need to take more \naction. I testified a couple of weeks ago. I say shut it off, even \nretroactively. There is no sense supporting something that was \nfundamentally wrong. No one can justify this nonsense.\n  I am going to offer these three and several other provisions to \nanything we have on the floor of the Senate that calls for emergency \nfunding. The emergency funding request in itself needs to be inspected \ncarefully. Is there a change of course in Iraq? If not, why not? Is \nthis support of the troops, or is it to support contractors?\n  A young woman named Bunnatine Greenhouse had the courage to give her \njob up because she was willing to stand up and say: This is the most \nblatant contract abuse I have witnessed as an employee of the Federal \nGovernment. She was the highest ranking civilian official in the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers. They are the ones who monitor and approve the \ncontracts. She stood up to the old boys network and said: What you are \ndoing is wrong. It is the most blatant abuse. She is talking about \ncontracts that were worth billions of dollars, many of them awarded \nsole source to Halliburton; Kellogg, Brown & Root; and other companies. \nShe blew the whistle. She paid for it with her job. She was an \noutstanding public official. She had the courage that was necessary to \nspeak out.\n  We need to have similar courage. We need to say to the President: \nThis $196 billion is not about demonstrating whether one supports the \ntroops. All of us support the troops. A substantial portion of this \nmoney is also going to go to contractors for which there has been no \noversight. There is the greatest waste and fraud and abuse in the \nhistory of this country in recent years under this administration's \ncontracting out virtually everything, much of it sole-source, very \nlarge, no-bid contracts. This Congress needs to weigh in on these \nissues.\n  With respect to the value system, the President says we can't afford \nto cover 3.8 more children who don't have health insurance with a bill \nthat we fully pay for. He says: We can't do that. That is not \nimportant. I am not willing to sign that. I will veto it. I will stop \nit.\n  Then he goes to Arkansas and says: I am a fiscal conservative. I want \nto shape everybody up.\n  Then the next day he sends us a $196 billion request. Give me some \nemergency money, $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week, none of it \npaid for, piled on top of the debt.\n  That is not a fiscal conservative where I come from. That is not what \nthey call those kinds of actions. All of us want this country to \nsucceed. All of us want this country to do well. We need to put this \ncountry on track. Yes, we need fiscal responsibility, absolutely. We \nalso need a foreign policy that makes sense. We need to change course \nin Iraq. We need to describe our values at home through the legislation \nwe pass that represents the best of what America can do. Yes, that \nincludes providing health insurance for children who don't have it, so \nthat young girls such as Ta'Shon have a chance at life.\n  There is so much debate these days that is thoughtless rather than \nthoughtful at a time when we so desperately need thoughtful discussion \nabout so many important issues that deal with America's future. My hope \nis that in the coming weeks, we can engage in some very thoughtful \ndiscussion about public policy and how to advance this country's \ninterests. All of us want the same thing. We want this country to \nsucceed, to provide expanded opportunity for people. But we face \nenormous challenges. Those challenges will not be met and resolved by \nthe kind of sloganeering we hear too often these days and by chaining \nourselves to certain public policies that we already know do not work. \nWe must force change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have some comments I want to make about \nthe FISA legislation. But before doing so, I commend my colleague from \nNorth Dakota. I have joined with him on so many occasions in the past. \nOnce again, his eloquence and passion about these issues is evident \nthis morning. We have worked together. We have sponsored legislation on \na number of matters. I will join him in the efforts he raised today. He \nhas described a situation that most Americans find horrific.\n  As to the point he makes on the issue of supporting our troops, I \nfind it offensive that anyone would suggest, because we disagree with \nthe policy, we are somehow putting our soldiers, sailors, marines, and \nairmen at risk. I strongly suggest, as does my colleague from North \nDakota, that our continuing policy in Iraq has made us less safe, less \nsecure, more vulnerable, more isolated in the world and, in fact, the \nvery soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines we admire are in greater \njeopardy because of a continuation of this policy. I will be joining \nwith him and others as we try to bring this to a halt, not in 2009 or \n2013 but hopefully this year. I commend him for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13472-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13472-S13473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REAUTHORIZATION OF THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for 6 years the President has demonstrated \ntime and again that he doesn't respect the role of Congress, nor does \nhe respect the rule of law. It is the latter point that I want to \naddress this morning because it is the rule of law which draws us all \ntogether, regardless of politics, ideology, or party. It is the rule of \nlaw, not of men, which we swear to uphold when we take the oath of \noffice in this Chamber, as Members do in the other Chamber, and \ncertainly as the President does on January 20 every 4 years.\n  For 6 years this President has used scare tactics to prevent the \nCongress from reining in his abuse of authority. A case in point is the \ncurrent direction in which this body appears to be headed as we prepare \nto reform and extend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Many of the unprecedented rollbacks to the rule of law by this \nadministration have been made in the name of national security.\n  The Bush administration has relentlessly focused our Nation's \nresources and manpower on a war of choice in Iraq. That ill-conceived \nwar has broken our military, squandered our resources, and emboldened \nour enemies.\n  The President's wholesale disregard of the rule of law has compounded \nthe damage done in Iraq, made our Nation less secure, and as a direct \nconsequence of these acts, we are far less secure, far more vulnerable, \nand certainly far more isolated in the world today.\n  Consider the scandal at Abu Ghraib, where Iraqi prisoners were \nsubjected to inhumane, humiliating acts by U.S. personnel charged with \nguarding them.\n  Consider Guantanamo Bay. Rather than helping to protect the Nation by \naggressively prosecuting prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, these individuals \nhave instead become the symbol of our weakened moral standing in the \nworld. Who would have ever imagined it?\n  Consider the secret prisons run by the Central Intelligence Agency \nand the practice of extraordinary rendition that allows them to evade \nU.S. law regarding torture.\n\n[[Page S13473]]\n\n  Consider the shameful actions of our outgoing Attorney General who \npoliticized prosecutions in the U.S. Attorney's Office, who was more \ncommitted to serving the President who appointed him than laws he was \nsworn to uphold as Attorney General.\n  Consider the Military Commissions Act, a law that allows evidence \nobtained through torture to be admitted into evidence.\n  It denies individuals the right to counsel.\n  It denies them the right to invoke the Geneva Conventions.\n  And it denies them the single most important and effective safeguard \nof liberty man has ever known, the right of habeas corpus, permitting \nprisoners to be brought before a court to determine whether their \ndetainment is lawful.\n  Warrantless wiretapping, torture, the list goes on.\n  Each of these policies share two things in common.\n  First, they have severely weakened our ability to prosecute the \nglobal war on terrorism, if for no other reason than they have made it \nharder, if not impossible, to build the kind of international support \nand cooperation we absolutely need to succeed in our efforts against \nstateless terrorism.\n  And second, each has only been possible because the U.S. Congress has \nnot been able to stop the President in his unprecedented expansion of \nexecutive power, although, I might add, some in this body have \ncertainly tried.\n  Whether these policies were explicitly authorized is beside the \npoint. In every instance, Congress has been unable to hold this \nadministration to account for violating the rule of law and our \nConstitution. In each instance, Republicans in the Congress have \nprevented this body from telling this administration that a state of \nwar is not a blank check.\n  And those are not my words. Those are the words of Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, nominated by President Ronald Reagan.\n  And today, it appears that we are prepared to consider the proposed \nrenewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law that \nwhatever form it eventually takes will almost certainly permit the Bush \nadministration to broadly eavesdrop on American citizens.\n  Legislation, as currently drafted, that would grant retroactive \nimmunity to telecommunications companies that helped this \nadministration violate the civil liberties of Americans and the law of \nthis Nation.\n  While it may be true that the proposed legislation is an improvement \nover existing law, it remains fundamentally flawed because it fails to \nprotect the privacy rights of Americans or hold the Executive or the \nprivate sector accountable if they choose to ignore the law.\n  That is why I will not stand on the floor of the Senate and be silent \nabout the direction we are about to take.\n  It is time to say: No more.\n  No more trampling on our Constitution.\n  No more excusing those who violate the rule of law. These are \nfundamental, basic, eternal principles. They have been around, some of \nthem, for as long as the Magna Carta.\n  They are enduring.\n  What they are not is temporary. And what we do not do in a time where \nour country is at risk is abandon them.\n  My father served as executive trial counsel at the Nuremberg trials \nof Nazi war criminals in 1945 and 1946.\n  What America accomplished at those historic trials was not a foregone \nconclusion. It took courage. When Joseph Stalin and even a leader as \ngreat and noble as Winston Churchill wanted to simply execute the Nazi \nleaders, we didn't back down in this country from our belief that these \nmen, as terrible as they were--some of the worst violators in the court \nof history of mankind--ought to have a trial. We did not give in to \nvengeance.\n  As then, the issue before us today is the same.\n  Does America stand for all that is still right with our world or do \nwe retreat in fear?\n  Do we stand for justice that secures America or do we act out of \nvengeance that weakens us?\n  I am well aware this issue is seen as political. I believe Democrats \nwere elected to help strengthen our Nation, elected to help restore our \nstanding in the world.\n  I believe we were elected to ensure that this Nation adheres to the \nrule of law and to stop the administration's assault on our \nConstitution.\n  But the rule of law is not the province of any one political party. \nIt is the province of each and every one of us as American citizens, on \nour watch and our generation, to make sure we are safer because of its \ninviolable provisions.\n  Mr. President, I know this bill has not been reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee yet.\n  But I am here today because if I have learned anything in my 26 years \nin this body, particularly over the last 7 years, it is that if you \nwait until the end to voice your concerns, you will have waited too \nlong. That is why I have written the majority leader informing him that \nI will object to any effort to bring the legislation to the Senate \nfloor for consideration.\n  I hope my colleague, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy is able to remove this language from the FISA bill. Pat Leahy is \nas strong a defender of the Constitution as any Member of this body.\n  But if he is unable to do so, I am prepared to filibuster this bill.\n  President Bush is right about one thing: The debate is about security \nbut not in the way he imagines it.\n  He believes we have to give up certain rights to be safe.\n  I believe the choice between moral authority and security is a false \nchoice.\n  I believe it is precisely when you stand up and protect your rights \nthat you become stronger, not weaker, as a nation.\n  The damage that was done to our country on 9/11 was stunning. It \nchanged the world forever.\n  But when you start diminishing our rights as a people, you compound \nthat tragedy. You cannot protect America in the long run if you fail to \nprotect our Constitution. It is that simple.\n  History will likely judge this President harshly for his war of \nchoice and for fighting it with a disregard for our most cherished \nprinciples.\n  But history is about tomorrow. We must act today and stand up for the \nConstitution and the rule of law.\n  Mr. President, this is the moment. At long last, let us rise up to \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business for such time as I shall consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13473-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13473-S13487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a phrase has been used recently called \n``the tipping point.'' The American people will very soon be asked to \nsupport a type of global warming cap-and-trade bill, legislation that \nhas already had a hearing in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. There are a couple other bills in the background.\n  These bills come at a time when the science is overwhelmingly taking \naway the basis for alarm. I am going to use terms this morning. The \nalarmists are the ones who are mostly out in California, the far-left \nextremists, the Hollywood elitists, and others who feel this is a great \nalarm, the world is coming to an end--the same ones who said that \nanother ice age was coming back in the middle 1970s. So we need to know \nwhat terms we are using.\n  An abundance of new peer-reviewed studies, analyses, and data-error \ndiscoveries in the past several months have prompted scientists to \ndeclare that fear of catastrophic manmade global warming--I am using \ntheir terms now, the scientists' terms--``bites the dust'' and the \nscientific underpinnings for alarm are ``falling apart.''\n  I have addressed this subject on this floor about a dozen times since \n2003.\n\n[[Page S13474]]\n\nBut I want to talk to you today about something that is really kind of \nunprecedented; that is, to talk only about things that have happened \nthis year, or mostly in the last 7 months, that people are just not \naware of.\n  The media is very much opposed to the idea there might be another \nside to the global warming story. So we are going to be talking about a \n``tipping point'' in a little different relationship than you have been \nhearing about it recently. I will detail how even committed leftwing \nscientists now believe the environmental movement has been ``co-opted'' \ninto promoting global warming as a ``crisis,'' and I will expose the \nmanufactured facade of ``consensus.''\n  The interesting thing is that everything I am going to be using is \ngoing to be what has happened just in the last 6 months. I will also \naddress the economic factors of the so-called solutions to global \nwarming and how they will have no measurable impact on the climate. But \nthese so-called solutions will create huge economic harm for American \nfamilies and the poor residents of the developing world who may see \ndevelopment hindered by unfounded climate fears.\n  We are currently witnessing an international awakening of scientists \nwho are speaking out in opposition to former Vice President Al Gore, \nthe United Nations, the Hollywood elitists, and the media-driven \n``consensus'' on manmade global warming.\n  We have witnessed Antarctic ice grow to records levels since \nsatellite monitoring began in the 1970s. We have witnessed NASA \ntemperature data errors that have made 1934--instead of 1998--the \nhottest year on record in the United States. We have seen global \naverage temperatures flat line since 1998 and the Southern Hemisphere \ncool in recent years.\n  When they talk about global warming, I have always conceded that the \nNorthern Hemisphere is going through a warming period, as it did a \ncooling period back in the 1970s. But the Southern Hemisphere actually \nhas been getting colder. This is all new stuff, as I say, in the last \nfew months. These are new developments. They are but a sample of the \nnew information coming out that continues to debunk the United Nations, \nformer Vice President Al Gore, and the media-promoted ``consensus'' on \nglobal warming. But before we delve into these dramatic new scientific \ndevelopments, it is important to take note of our pop culture \npropaganda campaign aimed at children, the most vulnerable of all of \nus.\n\n  In addition to Gore's entry last year into Hollywood fictional \ndisaster films, other celebrity figures have attempted to jump into the \ngame. Hollywood activist Leonardo DiCaprio decided to toss objective \nscientific truth out the window in his new scarefest ``The 11th Hour.'' \nDiCaprio refused to interview any scientists who disagreed with his \ndire vision of the future of the Earth. In fact, his film reportedly \nfeatures physicist Steven Hawking making the unchallenged assertion \nthat:\n\n       The worst-case scenario is that Earth would become like its \n     sister planet, Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees \n     centigrade.\n\n  I guess these worst-case scenarios pass for science in Hollywood \nthese days. It also fits perfectly with DiCaprio's stated purpose of \nthe film. DiCaprio said on May 20 of this year:\n\n       I want the public to be very scared by what they see. I \n     want them to see a very bleak future.\n\n  While those who went to watch DiCaprio's science fiction film may see \nhis intended ``bleak future,'' it is DiCaprio who has been scared by \nthe bleak box office numbers, as his film has failed to generate any \nsignificant audience interest.\n  Children are now the No. 1 target of the global warming fear \ncampaign. DiCaprio announced his goal was to recruit young, eco-\nactivists to the cause. ``We need to get kids young,'' he said, in a \nSeptember 20 interview with USA Weekend.\n  Hollywood activist Laurie David, who is Vice President Gore's \ncoproducer of ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' recently coauthored a \nchildren's global warming book with Cambria Gordon for Scholastic \nBooks, entitled ``The Down-To-Earth Guide to Global Warming.'' David \nhas made it clear that her goal is to influence young minds with her \nnew book when she recently wrote an open letter to her children \nstating: ``We want you to grow up to be activists.'' Apparently, David \nand other activists are getting frustrated by the widespread skepticism \non climate as reflected in both the United States and the U.K., \naccording to the latest polls. It appears the alarmists are failing to \nconvince adults to believe their increasingly shrill and \nunscientifically unfounded rhetoric, so they have decided to go after \nthe kids.\n  But David should worry less about recruiting young activists and more \nabout scientific accuracy. A science group found what it called a major \n``scientific error'' in David's new kids' book on page 18. According to \na Science and Public Policy Institute release on September 13--and I am \ngoing to quote right now--this is very significant:\n\n       The authors (David and Gordon) present unsuspecting \n     children with an altered temperature and CO2 graph \n     that reverses the relationship found in the scientific \n     literature. The manipulation is critical because David's \n     central premise posits that CO2 drives \n     temperature, yet the peer-reviewed literature is unanimous \n     that CO2 changes have historically followed \n     temperature changes.\n\n  That is the reverse of the reality.\n  David has now been forced to publicly admit this significant \nscientific error in her book.\n  A Canadian high school student named McKenzie was shown Gore's \nclimate horror film in four of her classes. Her response was:\n\n       I really don't know why they keep showing it. It scares me.\n\n  In June, a fourth grade class in Portland, Maine's, East End \nCommunity School issued a dire climate report: ``Global warming is a \nhuge pending global disaster'' read the elementary school kids' report, \naccording to an article in the Portland Press Herald on June 14 of \n2007. Remember, these are fourth graders issuing a dire global warming \nreport.\n  This agenda of indoctrination and fear aimed at children is having an \nimpact.\n  Nine-year-old Alyssa Luz-Ricca was quoted in the Washington Post, on \nApril 6 of 2007, as saying: ``I am worried about it because I don't \nwant to die.''\n  The same article explained: ``Psychologists say they're seeing an \nincreasing number of young patients preoccupied by a climactic \nArmageddon.''\n  I was told by the parent of an elementary school kid last spring--\nthis is kind of interesting because we had a 3-hour discussion with Al \nGore, and afterwards, after it was over, a lady came up to me and she \nwas from Maryland. She was a mother of an elementary school student, \nand she said they were required to actually watch this film, ``An \nInconvenient Truth'' about once a month at school, and her child would \ncome home and have nightmares about drowning in the film's predicted \nscary sea level rise.\n  The Hollywood global warming documentary ``Arctic Tale'' ends with a \nchild actor telling kids: ``If your mom and dad buy a hybrid car, \nyou'll make it easier for polar bears to get around.''\n  Unfortunately, children are hearing the scientifically unfounded \ndoomsday message loudly and clearly. But the message kids are receiving \nis not a scientific one, it is a political message designed to create \nfear, nervousness, and ultimately recruit them to liberal activism.\n  There are a few hopeful signs. A judge in England has ruled that \nschools must issue a warning before they show Gore's film to children \nbecause of scientific inaccuracies and sentimental mush. This is a \ncourt. It is a judge in the U.K. Before they see it, they have to sign \na disclaimer. In addition, there is a new kids' book called ``The Sky's \nNot Falling! Why It's OK to Chill About Global Warming.'' The book \ncounters the propaganda from the pop culture.\n  The chart here shows ``The Sky's Not Falling!''\n  Objective, evidence-based science is beginning to crush hysteria. My \nspeech today and these reports reveal that recent peer-reviewed \nscientific studies are totally refuting the ``Church of Manmade Global \nWarming.''\n  Meteorologist Joseph Conklin, who launched the skeptical Web site \nclimatepolice.com in 2007, recently declared the ``global warming \nmovement is falling apart.'' All the while, activists such as former \nVice President Al Gore repeatedly continue to warn of a fast-\napproaching climate ``tipping point.''\n\n[[Page S13475]]\n\n  I agree with Gore in this respect. Global warming may have reached a \n``tipping point.'' The manmade global warming fear machine crossed the \ntipping point in 2007--this year. That is the reason today I am talking \nabout things that are happening this year, things in the last 6 months. \nI am convinced the future climate historians will look back on 2007 as \nthe year the global warming fears began to crumble. The situation we \nare now in is very similar to where we were in the late 1970s, when the \ncoming ice age fears began to dismantle. Remember, it was Newsweek \nmagazine which in the 1970s first proclaimed that meteorologists were \nalmost unanimous in their view that a coming ice age would have \nnegative impacts. It was also Newsweek in 1975 which originated the \neerily similar ``tipping point''--they called it a tipping point at \nthat time--rhetoric they are using today, except it was an ice age at \nthat time.\n\n  Newsweek wrote on April 28, 1975, about coming ice age fears. They \nsaid:\n\n       The longer the planners delay, the more difficult will they \n     find it to cope with climatic change once the results become \n     grim reality.\n\n  Of course, Newsweek essentially retracted their coming ice age \narticle 29 years later in October of last year, 2006. People don't see \nthe retractions, they get the hysteria of the moment.\n  Today, the greatest irony is that the U.N. and the media's climate \nhysteria grows louder as the case for alarmism fades away. While the \nscientific case grows weaker, the political and rhetorical proponents \nof climate fear are ramping up to offer hefty tax and regulatory \nsolutions, both internationally and domestically, to solve the so-\ncalled crisis.\n  Skeptical climatologist Dr. Timothy Ball, formerly of the University \nof Winnipeg in Canada, wrote about the current state of the climate \nchange debate earlier this month. This is a quote, I say to my \ncolleagues:\n\n       Imagine basing a country's energy and economic policy on an \n     incomplete, unproven theory--a theory based entirely on \n     computer models in which one minor variable (CO2) \n     is considered the sole driver for the entire global climate \n     system.\n\n  How minor is that manmade CO2 variable in the atmosphere?\n  Meteorologist Joseph D'Aleo, the first director of Meteorology at the \nWeather Channel and former chairman of the American Meteorological \nSociety's Committee on Weather Analysis and Forecasting, explained in \nAugust how minuscule mankind's CO2 emissions are in relation \nto the Earth's atmosphere. This is what he said, and keep in mind we \nare talking about a guy who was the first director of meteorology at \nthe Weather Channel.\n\n       If the atmosphere was a 100 story building, our annual \n     anthropogenic CO2 contribution today would be \n     equivalent to the linoleum on the first floor.\n\n  We use terms such as ``anthropogenic''--and many Members of this body \nare not sure that manmade gases are anthropogenic gases--and those who \nwant to blame man for all of these problems that they try to make us \nbelieve are happening are saying anthropogenic gases are the problem.\n  Here are scientists who are totally debunking this.\n  Now, there are four essential components to debunking climate fears. \nDebunking catastrophic manmade global warming fears can be reduced to \nfour essential points. Now, what I am going to do is read these points \nand go back and elaborate on each one.\n  First, recent climate changes on Earth lie well within the bounds of \nnatural climate variability. Even the New York Times concedes this. \nU.N. temperature data shows that the late 20th century phase of global \nwarming ended in 1998; new data for the Southern Hemisphere shows that \na slight cooling is underway.\n  By the way, when we talk about IPCC, that is the United Nations; they \nare synonymous. That is where all this stuff started. A lot of things \ncome from the United Nations. Currently, we are looking at a treaty \ncalled the Law of the Sea Treaty. It started in the United Nations--not \nin America's best interests. But the first thing we are going to do is \ntalk about the recent climate changes on Earth, and we are going to \ntalk about how they lie within natural variability.\n  The second thing we will talk about is almost all current public fear \nof global warming is being driven by unproven and untestable computer \nmodel fears of the future, which now even the United Nations concedes \nthat the models--these are computer models; that is what all this stuff \nis based on--they do not account for half of the variability in nature \nand, thus, their predictions are not reliable. Even the United Nations \nagrees with that.\n  The third thing is debunking the relationship that the more \nCO2 you have, the warmer the world is. That is very \nsimplistic and it is untrue. Scientists are reporting in peer-reviewed \nliterature that increasing CO2 in the atmosphere will not \nhave the catastrophic impact doomsters have been predicting. In fact, \nclimate experts are discovering that you cannot distinguish the impact \nof human-produced greenhouse gases from natural climate variability. \nThat is extremely significant and something that has come around in the \nlast 6 or 7 months.\n  The fourth thing we will talk about is consensus. We hear so much \nabout consensus. The more things that come out of science, where the \nscientists are saying, wait a minute, we were wrong. In a minute, I \nwill be naming names of scientists who were marching the streets with \nAl Gore 10 years ago who now say they were wrong. When you talk about \nthat today, those who are promoting this type of fear from the left, \nthey use the word ``consensus.'' The climate change ``consensus'' \nexists. Well, it does not exist. Instead, the illusion that it does has \nbeen carefully manufactured for political, financial, and ideological \npurposes.\n  These four basic points form the foundation of the rational, \nevidence-based approach to climate science that has come to be called \nglobal warming skepticism.\n  Let's talk about the first one, essential point No. 1, that the \nEarth's climate is within the natural variability. On April 23, 2006, \nthe article in the New York Times by Andrew Revkin stated--and I am \nquoting now from the New York Times:\n\n       Few scientists agree with the idea that the recent spate of \n     potent hurricanes, European heat waves, African drought and \n     other weather extremes are, in essence, our fault--\n\n  Manmade gases.\n\n       There is more than enough natural variability in nature to \n     mask a direct connection, scientists say.\n\n  The Times is essentially conceding that no recent weather events fall \noutside the range of natural climate variability. On a slightly longer \ntime scale, many scientific studies have shown the medieval and earlier \nwarm periods were as warm or warmer than the Earth's current \ntemperature--when there were no influences that were due to manmade \ngases. There were no SUVs around at that time.\n  Now, everything is blamed on global warming. Right now, the fires \nthat are finally subsiding out in California, the disaster that has \ntaken place, the first thing they say is it is due to global warming. \nIt has nothing to do with global warming. When Al Gore made his global \nwarming speech a year ago in February in New York--and coincidentally, \nit was on a day that set a new cold record for all time throughout the \nhistory of New York--a 2006 National Academy of Science, NAS, report \ndiscredited the now infamous ``hockey stick'' temperature graph. The \nstudy was created by the U.N. IPCC lead author Michael Mann. They took \nthe temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and showed that they were \nflat for 1,000 years. They then started spiking in the 20th century and \ncausing them to go up. On this graph, this is the blade of the hockey \nstick.\n\n  The problem is, they didn't take into consideration things such as \nthe Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. The NAS found evidence \nof both the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, which is on \nthe lower chart. It also expressed little confidence in Mann's \nconclusion that the 1990s were the hottest decade of the last \nmillennium, and even less confidence that 1998 was the hottest year. In \nfact, we will show in a minute that NAS has come around and said we \nwere wrong, that 1998 wasn't the hottest year; 1934 was.\n  There have been recent studies refuting claims that the 20th century \nhas seen unprecedented warmth. A June 29, 2007, paper by Gerd Burger of \nBerlin's Institute of Meteorology in the peer-reviewed Science Magazine \nchallenged a\n\n[[Page S13476]]\n\n2006 study that claimed the 20th century had been unusually warm.\n  Ivy League geologist, Dr. Robert Giegengack, the chair of the \nDepartment of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of \nPennsylvania, noted on May 27, 2007 that extremely long geologic \ntimescales reveal that ``only about 5 percent of that time has been \ncharacterized by conditions on Earth that were so cold that the poles \ncould support masses of permanent ice.''\n  Giegengack added:\n\n       For most of Earth's history, the globe has been warmer than \n     it has been for the last 200 years. It has rarely been \n     cooler.\n\n  That is the chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental \nScience at the University of Pennsylvania. These guys know what they \nare talking about, and they have been ignored.\n  Greenland has actually cooled since the 1940s. In fact, the current \ntemperatures in Greenland--a ``poster boy'' for climate change \nalarmists--are cooler. It wasn't too long ago that there was a \ndelegation from the Senate that went to Greenland. They came back with \nall these statements, but I cannot figure out where they came from \nbecause that is not what the facts show. Even though Greenland has been \na ``poster boy'' for climate alarmists, it is now cooler there than the \ntemperatures were in the 1930s and 1940s. It is cooler there now. You \nheard correctly.\n  Greenland reached its highest temperatures in 1941, according to a \npeer-reviewed study published in the June 2006 issue of the Journal of \nGeophysical Research. Keep in mind that 80 percent of the manmade \nCO2 came after these high temperatures. Eighty percent came \nafter the 1940s. That is a very interesting thing because, if you look \nat it, you would say if 80 percent of the CO2 came after the \n1940s, would that not precipitate a warming period--if they are right--\nin terms of CO2 affecting warmer climate change? That didn't \nhappen. That precipitated a cooler period.\n  According to a July 2007 survey of peer-reviewed literature on \nGreenland:\n\n       Research in 2006 found that Greenland has been warming \n     since the 1880s, but since 1955, temperature averages at \n     Greenland stations have been colder than the period of 1881-\n     1955. Another 2006 peer-reviewed study concluded the rate of \n     warming in Greenland from 1920 to 1930 was about 50 percent \n     higher than the warming from 1995 to 2005.\n\n  That is the time they say this crisis is taking place.\n\n       One 2005 study found Greenland gaining ice in the interior \n     higher elevations and thinning ice at the lower elevations. \n     In addition, the often media promoted fears of Greenland's \n     ice completely melting and a subsequent catastrophic sea \n     level rise are directly at odds with the latest scientific \n     studies.\n\n  That is not me saying this; these are scientists. These are \nscientific facts you will not hear from the U.N. scientists, Gore, or \nthe hysterical liberal left.\n  Yet despite all of this evidence, the media and many others still \nattempt to distort the science in order to create hysterical fears \nabout Greenland.\n  Environmental activist Robert Corell, who works for Teresa Heinz \nKerry's foundation, the Heinz Center, recently tried to stir alarm by \nstating:\n\n       I spent four months on the [Greenland] ice cap in 1968 and \n     there was no melting at all.\n\n  If Corell, a former fellow with the American Meteorological Society, \nhad desired to give a balanced historical view, he would have noted \nthat Greenland in the 1930s and 1940s was much warmer. This is typical \nof how many activists mislead the public by presenting utterly \nmeaningless bits of information and avoiding inconvenient facts. Corell \nis also on record for giving former Vice President Gore's 2006 science \nfiction film two thumbs up for accuracy.\n  Keep in mind, he is paid by the Heinz Foundation.\n  Corell's assertion in a September 8, U.K. Guardian article that the \nearthquakes triggered by melting ice are increasing in Greenland was \nrebuffed by the University of North Carolina's Jose Rial. Rial is a \nprominent climatologist/seismologist working on glacial seismic \nactivity in Greenland.\n  Corell's erroneous claim prompted Rial to take the unusual step of \nwriting a letter to the U.K. Guardian:\n\n       I also know there is no evidence to suggest that these \n     quakes ``are happening far faster than ever anticipated.'' \n     [As Corell claimed].\n\n  Rial wrote that in a September 13 letter. He criticized the newspaper \nfor presenting a ``sky-is-falling'' alarmist perspective, and he added:\n\n       It will take years of continued surveying to know whether \n     anything here [in Greenland] is ``accelerating'' toward \n     catastrophe, as the article [featuring Corell] claims.\n\n  So much for Greenland. Let's look at Antarctica for more evidence on \nthe Earth's current climate. It is not changing in an alarming manner, \nand you need to look no further than the South Pole.\n  Scientists monitoring ice in Antarctica reported on October 1 that \nthe ice has grown to record levels since 1979, when satellite \nmonitoring began. So the ice levels have grown to record levels since \nthat time, according to an announcement by the University of Illinois \nPolar Research Group Web site.\n\n       The Southern Hemisphere sea ice area has broken the \n     previous maximum of 16.03 million square kilometers and is \n     currently at 16.26 million square kilometers.\n\n  There is more. A February 2007 study reveals Antarctica is not \nfollowing predicted global warming temperature or precipitation models. \nThis is a quote from the scientists studying that:\n\n       A new report on climate over the world's southernmost \n     continent shows that temperatures during the late 20th \n     century did not climb as had been predicted by many global \n     climate models.\n\n  The study was conducted by David Bromwich, professor of atmospheric \nsciences in the Department of Geography, and research with the Byrd \nPolar Research Center at Ohio State University.\n  How inconvenient that the two poster children of alarmism--Greenland \nand Antarctica--trumpeted by Al Gore and the climate fear mongers have \ndecided not to cooperate with the computer models.\n  There is much more evidence that the Earth is currently well within \nnatural climate variability.\n  The Southern Hemisphere is cooling, according to U.N. scientist, Dr. \nMadhav Khandekar. Keep in mind this is a U.N. scientist, a retired \nenvironmental Canadian scientist, and an expert IPCC reviewer in 2007. \nHe explained this on August 6, 2007, and these are all new scientific \nfindings:\n\n       In the Southern Hemisphere, the land-area mean temperature \n     has slowly but surely declined in the last few years. The \n     city of Buenes Aires in Argentina received several \n     centimeters of snowfall in early July, and the last time it \n     snowed in Buenos Aires was in 1918. Most of Australia \n     experienced one of its coldest months in June of this year. \n     Several other locations in the Southern Hemisphere have \n     experienced lower temperatures in the last few years. \n     Further, the sea surface temperatures over world oceans are \n     slowly declining since mid-1998, according to a recent \n     worldwide analysis of ocean surface temperatures.\n\n  I don't think many people would disagree. The Southern Hemisphere is \npart of the globe, and it has been getting cooler over the past few \nyears.\n  The media would not report on the historical perspective of \nGreenland, the ice growing in Antarctica, or the Southern Hemisphere \ncooling. Instead, the media's current fixation is on hyping Arctic sea \nice shifts.\n  What the media is refusing to report about the North Pole is that \naccording to a 2003 study by an Arctic scientist, Igor Polyakov, the \nwarmest period in the Arctic during the 20th century was the late 1930s \nthrough the early 1940s. We are talking about the Northern Hemisphere \nnow. Many scientists believe if we had satellite monitoring of the \nArctic back then, it may have shown less ice than today.\n  According to a 2005 peer-reviewed study in the Geophysical Research \nLetters by an astrophysicist, Dr. Willie Soon, solar irradiance appears \nto be the key to Arctic temperatures. The study found Arctic \ntemperatures follow the pattern of increasing or decreasing energy \nreceived from the Sun. That is a unique thought--that the Sun is \ncausing warmth.\n  In another 2005 study published in the Journal of Climate, Brian \nHartmann and Gerd Wendler linked the 1976 Pacific climate shift to a \nvery significant one-time shift upward in Alaskan temperatures. These \nevidence-based scientific studies debunk fears of manmade warming in \nthe Arctic and in Alaska.\n  I have covered the latest science on both poles. In the Southern \nHemisphere, scientists are finding nothing to be alarmed about. It is \nimportant to point out that the phase of global warming that started in \n1979 has itself been halted since 1998, which is nearly\n\n[[Page S13477]]\n\na decade. In other words, the warming that took place, which I believe \nis from natural causes, stopped in 1998. It is not getting warmer \nanymore. You can almost hear my critics skeptical of that assertion.\n  According to the temperature data that the U.N. relies on, \npaleoclimate scientist Dr. Bob Carter, who testified before the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, noted this on June 18 of \nthis year, and this is significant:\n\n       The accepted global average temperature statistics used by \n     the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that no \n     ground-based warming has occurred since 1998. Oddly, this \n     eight-year-long temperature stability has occurred despite an \n     increase over the same period of 15 parts per million (or 4 \n     percent) in atmospheric CO2. Second, lower \n     atmospheric satellite-based temperature measurements, if \n     corrected for non-greenhouse influences, such as El Nino \n     events and large volcanic eruptions, show little if any \n     global warming since 1979, a period over which atmospheric \n     CO2 has increased by 55 parts per million (17 \n     percent).\n\n  Yet it is true that 1998 was influenced by the warming effect of \nparticularly strong El Nino. But lest you think Dr. Carter somehow \nmisinterpreted the data, I have more evidence to bury any skepticism.\n  The U.K. Met Office, the British version of our National Weather \nService, was finally forced to concede the obvious in August of this \nyear: Global warming has stopped.\n  After the U.K. Met Office--a group fully entrenched in the global \nwarming fear movement--was forced to acknowledge this inconvenient \ntruth in August, they could not help but whip up a way to continue \nstoking manmade climate alarm.\n  How can you do that if you are saying it is no longer warming? This \nis how they did it.\n  Their response was to promote yet more unproven dire computer model \nprojections of the future. They now claim climate computer models \npredict ``global warming will begin in earnest in 2009'' because \ngreenhouse emissions will then overtake natural climate variability.\n  What he is saying is, they are admitting--it hurts them to do this--\nthat the warming has stopped. But they say, well, it is going to start \nagain in 2009.\n  Hyping yet more unproven computer models of the future in response to \ninconvenient real-world, evidence-based data is the only thing they \nhave left for promoters of manmade climate doom. But it is a bit \nrefreshing to hear climate doomsters be forced to utter the phrases \nsuch as ``natural climate variability,'' something they do not like to \ntalk about and never have.\n  Meteorologist Joseph Conklin recently weighed in on these new \ndevelopments.\n  Conklin wrote in August:\n\n       A few months ago, a study came out that demonstrated global \n     temperatures have leveled off. But instead of possibly \n     admitting that this whole global warming thing is a farce, a \n     group of British scientists concluded the real global warming \n     won't start until 2009.\n\n  Here is somebody else talking about it.\n  This new claim that ``global warming will begin in earnest in 2009'' \nsounds like the reverse of the 1930s Great Depression slogan of \n``Prosperity is just around the corner.'' Only in this instance the \nwording has been changed, ``A climate catastrophe is just around the \ncorner.''\n  Again, I was quoting meteorologist Joseph Conklin.\n  This is not to say that global average temperatures may not rise \nagain--change is what the Earth naturally and continually does, and \npart of this is temperatures fluctuating both up and down. However, the \nawkward halting of global warming since 1998 despite rising emissions \nis yet another indication that CO2 levels and temperature \nare not the simple relationship many would have us believe.\n  Another key development in 2007 is the research led by metrologist \nAnthony Watts of surfacestation.org which has revealed massive U.S. \ntemperature collection data errors biasing thermometers to have warmer \nreadings.\n  Meteorologist Conklin explained on August 10--a couple months ago--\n2007:\n\n       The (U.S.) National Climate Data Center is in the middle of \n     a scandal. Their global observing network, the heart and soul \n     of surface weather measurement, is a disaster. Urbanization \n     has placed many sites--\n\n  Measuring sites he is talking about--\n\n     in unsuitable locations--on hot black asphalt, next to trash \n     burn barrels, beside heat exhaust vents, even attached to hot \n     chimneys and above outdoor grills. The data and approach \n     taken by many global warming alarmists is seriously flawed. \n     If the global data were properly adjusted for urbanization \n     and station siting, and land use change issues were \n     addressed, what would emerge is a cyclical pattern of rises \n     and falls with much less of any background trend.\n\n  That is all a quote by meteorologist Conklin.\n  Adding to the further chilling of warming fears is a NASA data error \ncorrection that made 1934 the warmest year, and not 1998. Always \nbefore, they had been talking about 1998. Now NASA has come back--and \nno one seems to be refuting this--and said it was 1934 that was the \nhottest year.\n  Perhaps the most humorous reaction to this inconvenient correction \ncame from NASA's James Hansen who tried to minimize the data error in \nAugust when he wrote:\n\n       No need to read further unless you are interested in \n     temperature changes to a tenth of a degree over the U.S.\n\n  This comment was particularly outlandish, given that Hansen has \nbecome a media darling in recent years by hyping temperature \ndifferences of ``tenth of a degree'' to any reporter within ear shot.\n  I now move to central point No. 2, the unproven computer models that \nare driving climate fears.\n  It is hard to describe what a computer model is. But anytime you try \nto make a projection into the future, you try to have a model you can \nrely on instead of relying on data that is current and accurate. Even \nthe New York Times has been forced to acknowledge the overwhelming \nevidence that the Earth is currently well within natural climate \nvariation. This inconvenient reality means all the climate doomsdayers \nhave to back up their claims, their climate fears are unproven computer \nmodels predicting future doom. Of course, you can't prove a prediction \nof the climate in 2100 wrong today, which reduces the models to \nspeculating on what could or might or may happen 50 or 100 years from \nnow.\n  But prominent U.N. scientists publicly questioned the reliability of \ncomputer models.\n  Again, only a few months ago, in June of this year, in a candid \nstatement, IPCC scientist--this is a U.N. scientist--Dr. Jim Renwick, a \nleading author of the U.N. IPCC 4th Assessment Report, publicly \nadmitted that climate models may not be so reliable after all.\n  Renwick stated:\n\n       Half of the variability in the climate system is not \n     predictable, so we don't expect to do terrifically well.\n\n  Let me say that again. A U.N. scientist admitted ``half the \nvariability in the climate system is not predictable. . . .''\n  In June, another high profile U.N. IPCC lead author, Dr. Kevin \nTrenberth, echoed Renwick's sentiments about the climate models by \nreferring to them as nothing more than ``story lines.''\n  Climate models made by unlicensed software engineers are of great \nconcern to a lot of people. A leading scientific skeptic, meteorologist \nDr. Hendrik Tennekes, a scientific pioneer in the development of \nnumerical weather prediction and former director of research at The \nNetherlands' Royal National Meteorological Institute, recently took the \ncritique of climate computer models one step further.\n  Tennekes said in February of 2007:\n\n       I am of the opinion that most scientists engaged in the \n     design, development, and tuning of climate models are, in \n     fact, software engineers. They are unlicensed, hence \n     unqualified to sell their products to society.\n\n  Meteorologist Augie Auer of the New Zealand Climate Science \nCoalition, former professor of atmospheric sciences at the University \nof Wyoming, agreed, describing models this way:\n\n       It's virtual science, it's virtual reality.\n\n  Auer joked:\n\n       Most of these climate predictions are models, they are \n     about a half a step ahead of PlayStation 3.\n\n  I guess that is some kind of kid's video game.\n\n       They're really not justified in what they are saying. Many \n     of the assumptions going into [the models] are simply not \n     right.\n\n  Auer said this in May of 2007 in New Zealand in a radio interview.\n\n[[Page S13478]]\n\n  Predictions simply cannot happen. Prominent scientist Professor Nils-\nAxel Morner also denounced computer models in August of 2007, saying:\n\n       The rapid rise in sea levels predicted by computer models \n     simply cannot happen.\n\n  They are not going to happen.\n  Morner is a leading world authority on sea levels and coastal erosion \nwho headed the Department of Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics at Stockholm \nUniversity. Morner, who was president of the Commission on Sea Level \nChanges and Coastal Evolution from 1999 to 2003, has published a new \nbooklet refuting climate model claims of catastrophic sea level rise.\n  Physicist Dr. Syun-Ichi Akasofu, the former director of both the \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks' Geophysical Institute and International \nArctic Research Center, told a congressional hearing in 2006 that \nhighly publicized computer models showing a disappearing Arctic were \nnothing more than ``science fiction.'' Akasofu has twice been named one \nof the ``1,000 Most Cited Scientists.''\n  It gets kind of boring and hard to understand when I talk about the \nqualifications of these scientists. I have to say it because the other \nside is using people who are not of this caliber. This is what the real \nscientists are saying today.\n  Geologist Morten Hald, an Arctic expert at the University of Tromso \nin Norway, has also questioned the reliability of computer models that \npredict a future melting of the Arctic. He says:\n\n       The main problem is that these models are often based on \n     relatively new climate data. The thermometer has only been in \n     existence for 150 years and information on temperature which \n     is 150 years old does not capture the large natural changes.\n\n  Hald, who is participating with a Norwegian national team in Arctic \nclimate research, made this statement in May of 2007.\n  Physicist Freeman Dyson, professor emeritus of the Institute for \nAdvanced Study at Princeton, called himself a ``heretic'' on global \nwarming and slammed computer models as unreliable. Keep in mind, I am \ntalking about a professor emeritus at the Institute of Advanced Study \nat Princeton University. These are smart guys. ``The fuss about global \nwarming is grossly exaggerated,'' writes Dyson in his 2007 book called \n``Many Colored Glass: Reflections on the Place of Life in the \nUniverse'' published in August.\n  Dyson is a fellow of the American Physical Society, a member of the \nU.S. National Academy of Sciences, and a fellow in the Royal Society of \nLondon.\n  Dyson focuses on debunking climate model predictions of climate doom. \nThere is no one more qualified than the man I just described. He said:\n\n       They do not begin to describe the real world that we live \n     in. The real world is muddy and messy and full of things that \n     we do not yet understand. It is much easier for a scientist \n     to sit in an air-conditioned building and run computer models \n     than to put on winter clothes and measure what is really \n     happening outside in the swamps and the clouds. That is why \n     the climate model experts end up believing their own models.\n\n  Gore was recently challenged to a bet on climate model accuracy. \nInternationally known forecasting pioneer, Dr. Scott Armstrong of the \nIvy League University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School--that is the \nWharton School of Economics--challenged Gore to a $10,000 bet in June \nover the accuracy of climate computer model predictions. Armstrong and \nhis colleague, Professor Kesten Green of Monash University's business \nand economic forecasting unit in Australia, found ``claims that the \nEarth will get warmer have no more credence than saying it will get \ncolder.'' According to Armstrong, the author of ``Long-Range \nForecasting,'' the most frequently cited book on forecasting methods, \n``of 89 principles [of forecasting], the [UN] IPCC violated 72.'' That \nis the United Nations. They violated 72 of the 89 principles of \nforecasting.\n  Internationally renowned scientist Dr. Antonino Zichichi, president \nof the World Federation of Scientists, has also taken climate models to \ntask.\n  According to an April 27, 2007 article, Zichichi, who has published \nover 800 scientific papers, said:\n\n       The mathematical models used by the [United Nations] IPCC \n     do not correspond to the criteria of the scientific method.\n\n  IPCC reviewer and climate researcher Dr. Vincent Gray of New Zealand, \nan expert reviewer on every single draft of the IPCC reports going back \nto 1990, ridiculed the United Nations process as ``dangerous scientific \nnonsense.'' Gray, the author of ``Greenhouse Delusion: A Critique of \nClimate Change 2001,'' explained on April 10, 2007:\n\n       My greatest achievement was the second [U.N.] report where \n     the draft had a chapter ``Validation of Climate Models.'' I \n     commented that since no climate model has ever been \n     ``validated'' that the word was inappropriate. They changed \n     the word to ``evaluate'' 50 times, and since then they have \n     never ``predicted'' anything. All they do is make \n     ``projections'' and ``estimates.''\n\n  In fact, so much of climate computer modeling is based on taking \ntemperature data from a very short timeframe and extrapolating it out \nover 50 or 100 years or more and coming up with terrifying, scary \nscenarios. There is often no attempt to look at the longer geologic \nrecord.\n  But much of this type of modeling has about as much validity as me \ntaking my 5-year-old granddaughter's growth rate from the last 2 years \nand using that to project her height when she is 25. My projections may \nshow she will be 12 feet high at that time. Yet that is exactly how \nmany of these computer model fears of the future are generated for sea \nlevel rise estimates on ice melt projections in places such as \nGreenland and the Arctic and other locations.\n  Once again, computer model predictions are not evidence.\n  Earlier this month, yet another report was issued based on future \ncomputer models finding that polar bear populations are allegedly going \nto be devastated by 2050 due to global warming. The report was issued \nas part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service consideration of listing \nthe polar bear under the Endangered Species Act.\n  This is a classic case of reality versus unproven computer model \npredictions. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that the polar \nbear population is currently at 20,000 to 25,000 bears, whereas in the \nfifties and sixties, estimates were as low as 5,000 to 10,000 bears. We \ncurrently have an estimated four or five times more polar bears than 50 \nyears ago.\n  We have a 2002 U.S. Geological Survey of wildlife in the Arctic \nRefuge Coastal Plain that noted the polar bear populations ``may now be \nnear historic highs.''\n  Top biologists and wildlife experts are dismissing unproven computer \nmodel concerns for polar bears. Yet we still see the polar bears out \nthere. Everybody feels sorry for the polar bears. There are some 13 \npopulations of polar bears and all but 2 of them are thriving, many \nincreasing rapidly.\n  In 2006, Canadian biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor, the director of \nwildlife research with the Arctic government of Nunavut, dismissed \nthese fears with evidence-based data on Canada's polar bear \npopulations.\n  ``Of the 13 populations of polar bears in Canada, 11 are stable or \nincreasing in number. They are not going extinct, or even appear to be \naffected at present,'' Taylor said, noting that Canada is home to two-\nthirds of the world's polar bears.\n  In other words, they are in Canada under his jurisdiction.\n\n       Of the 13 populations of polar bears in Canada, 11 are \n     stable or increasing in number. They are not going extinct, \n     or even appear to be affected at present.\n\n  He added:\n\n       It is just silly to predict the demise of polar bears in 25 \n     years based on media-assisted hysteria.\n\n  In September, Taylor further debunked the latest report hyping the \nfears of future polar bear extinctions. He said, ``I think it is naive \nand presumptuous,'' referring to the recent report on the U.S. \nGovernment warning that computer models predicted a dire future for the \nbears due to projected ice loss.\n  Taylor also debunked a notion that less sea ice means less polar \nbears by pointing out that southern regions of the bears' home with low \nlevels of ice are seeing booming bear populations. He noted that in the \nwarmer southern Canadian region of Davis Strait with lower levels of \nice, a new survey will reveal that bear populations have grown from an \nestimated 850 bears to an estimated 3,000 bears. And despite the lower \nlevels of ice, some of the bears measured in this region are among the \nbiggest ever on record.\n\n[[Page S13479]]\n\n  ``Davis Strait is crawling with bears.'' I am quoting him again. ``It \nis not safe to camp there. They are fat. The mothers have cubs. The \ncubs are in good shape,'' he said, according to a September 14, 2007 \narticle.\n  He added, ``That's not theory. That's not based on a model. That's \njust observation of reality.''\n  Other biologists are equally dismissive of these computer model-based \nfears. Biologist Josef Reichholf, who heads the Vertebrates Department \nat the National Zoological Collection in Munich, rejected climate fears \nand asserted any potential global warming may be beneficial to both \nhumans and animals.\n  In a May 8, 2007 interview, Reichholf asked, ``How did the polar bear \nsurvive the last warm period?'' Reichfolf also debunked the entire \nnotion that the warmer world will lead to a mass species extinction.\n\n       Warming temperatures promote biodiversity. The number of \n     species increases exponentially from the regions near the \n     poles, across the moderate latitudes and to the equator. To \n     put it succinctly, the warmer the region is the more diverse \n     are its species.\n\n  Botanist David Bellamy--this is kind of interesting because David \nBellamy used to be on the other side. He was a famous U.K. \nenvironmental campaigner and former lecturer at Durham University and \nhost of a TV series on wildlife. He also dismissed fears of a global \nwarming driving polar bear demise.\n  Keep in mind, this is David Bellamy of the U.K., who was at one time \nmarching down the streets hand in hand with Al Gore, saying the world \nis coming to an end.\n\n       Why scare the families of the world with tales that polar \n     bears are heading for extinction when there is good evidence \n     that there are now twice as many of these iconic animals . . \n     . than there were 20 years ago?\n\n  Bellamy asked on May 15. There are twice as many as there were 20 \nyears ago.\n  Bellamy concluded:\n\n       The climate change people have no proof for their claims. \n     They have computer models which do not prove anything.\n\n  The bottom line is that the attempt to list the polar bear under the \nEndangered Species Act is not based on any evidence that the polar bear \npopulations are declining or in trouble. It is based on computer models \nfraught with uncertainties. I hope we made that point very clear. The \ntruth is we clearly don't know enough about polar bear populations to \nmake an argument about their listing. What we do know is their \npopulations have dramatically increased over the past 30 or 40 years. \nIt is about trying to bring about climate change regulation using the \nmost powerful, development-stopping law of the land, the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Polar bears are being used to achieve long-sought leftwing \nenvironmental regulatory policies.\n\n  We had four essential points. The third essential point is debunking \nthe relationship that the more CO2, a warmer world. The \nthird critical point on global warming is to debunk the notion that the \nmore CO2, the warmer the world as simplistic. Scientists and \npeer-reviewed scientists are increasingly revealing that catastrophic \nclimate fears of rising CO2 are simply unsustainable.\n  In May 2007, the ``father of meteorology,'' Dr. Reid Bryson, the \nfounding chairman of the Department of Meteorology at the University of \nWisconsin, dismissed the rising CO2 fears very bluntly. He \nsaid:\n\n       You can go outside and spit and have the same effect as \n     doubling carbon dioxide.\n\n  Bryson has been identified by the British Institute of Geographers as \nthe most frequently cited climatologist in the world. He explained that \none of the reasons climate models are failing is because they \noverestimate the warming effect of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n  Climatologist Dr. Ball described how CO2's warming impact \ndiminishes. A quote from Dr. Timothy Ball:\n\n       Even if CO2 concentration doubles or triples, \n     the effect would be minimal. The relationship between \n     temperature and CO2 is like painting a window \n     black to block the sunlight. The first coat blocks most of \n     the light. The second and third reduce very little more. The \n     current CO2 levels are like the first coat of \n     black paint, Ball explained in June of 2007.\n\n  Environmental economist Dennis Avery, co-author with climate \nscientist Dr. Fred Singer of the new book ``Unstoppable Global Warming \nEvery 1500 years,'' details how solar activity is linked to the Earth's \nnatural temperature cycles. These two scientists are quoted as saying, \nin their book:\n\n       The Earth has warmed only a net of .2 degrees centigrade of \n     net warming since 1940. Human-emitted CO2 gets \n     blamed for only half of that--\n\n  Even those who are the hysterical people say only half of that would \ngo to manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane, as \nwe talked about earlier.\n\n     --or one tenth of 1 degree centigrade of warming in 65 years. \n     We've had no warming at all since 1998. Remember, too, each \n     added unit of CO2 has less impact on the climate. \n     The first 40 parts per million of human-emitted \n     CO2 added to the atmosphere in the 1940s had as \n     much climate impact as the next 360 parts per million.\n\n  Perhaps the most inconvenient fact for the promoters of climate doom \nis the abundance of new peer-reviewed papers echoing these many more \nscientists' skeptical views. Keep in mind, these are new studies, the \ndebunking of alarmism that have been published since 2007.\n  That is this year, I say to the distinguished occupier of the chair, \nthat we have been talking about, just what has happened in the last 6 \nor 7 months.\n  A new peer-reviewed study by Brookhaven National Lab scientist \nStephen Schwartz, accepted for publication in the Journal of \nGeophysical Research, finds that even a doubling of atmospheric carbon \ndioxide would not have the previous predicted dire impacts on global \ntemperatures. In fact, this paper implies that we have already seen \nalmost all of the warming from CO2 that mankind has put into \nthe atmosphere.\n  The study is in agreement with the views of the 60 prominent \nscientists who advised the Canadian Prime Minister to withdraw from \nKyoto in 2006. The 60 scientists noted global climate changes all the \ntime due to natural causes and the human impact still remain impossible \nto distinguish from this natural ``noise.''\n  Astronomer Dr. Ian Wilson proclaimed in August of 2007 that the new \nSchwartz study means ``Anthropogenic--that is man-made global warming--\nbites the dust.''\n  Those are their words, not mine.\n  American Enterprise Institute scientist Joel Schwartz also agreed. He \nsaid:\n\n       Along with dozens of other studies in the scientific \n     literature, this new study belies Al Gore's claim that there \n     is no legitimate scholarly alternative to climate \n     catastrophism. Indeed, if [this study's] results are correct, \n     that alone would be enough to overturn, in one fell swoop, \n     the United Nations scientific consensus--I say in quotes--the \n     ``environmentalists'' climate hysteria, and the political \n     pretext for the energy-restriction policies that have become \n     so popular with the world's environmental regulators, elected \n     officials, and corporations. The question is, will anyone in \n     the mainstream media notice?\n\n  This is all a quote by the scientist.\n  A former Harvard physicist, Dr. Lubos Motl, said the new study has \nreduced proponents of manmade climate fears to ``playing the children's \ngame to scare each other.''\n  Now, just look at a sampling of the recent peer review studies \ndebunking the issues. There are many others I could talk about, but I \nam just going to name a few here, things all happening this year, 2007.\n  No. 1, an August 2007 peer-reviewed study Published in Geophysical \nResearch Letters finds global warming over last century linked to \nnatural causes. Excerpt: The study, by scientists at the University of \nWisconsin-Milwaukee, was entitled ``Synchronized Chaos: Mechanisms For \nMajor Climate Shifts.'' The author's found that ``By studying the last \n100 years of these [natural] cycles' patterns, they find that the \nsystems synchronized several times.'' The authors show that this \nmechanism explains all global temperature tendency changes and El Nino \nvariability in the 20th century.''\n  No. 2, a September peer-reviewed study counters global warming \ntheory, by finding carbon dioxide did not end the last Ice Age. The \nstudy found: ``Deep-sea temperatures rose 1,300 years before \natmospheric CO2, ruling out the greenhouse gas as driver of \nmeltdown. The lead author geologist Lowell Stott, explained: ``The \nclimate dynamic is much more complex than simply saying that \nCO2 rises and the temperature warms.''\n\n[[Page S13480]]\n\n  No. 3, an October 2007 study by the Danish National Space Center \nStudy concluded: ``The Sun still appears to be the main forcing agent \nin global climate change.'' This study was authored by Physicist Henrik \nSvensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen.\n  No. 4, a Belgian weather institute's August 2007 study dismissed the \ndecisive role of CO2 in warming. Here is an excerpt about \nthe study: ``CO2 is not the big bogeyman of climate change \nand global warming. This is the conclusion of a comprehensive \nscientific study done by the Royal Meteorological Institute, which was \npublished this past summer. Climate scientist Luc Debontridder \nexplained: ``Not CO2, but water vapor is the most important \ngreenhouse gas. It is responsible for at least 75 percent of the \ngreenhouse effect. This is a simple scientific fact, but Al Gore's \nmovie has hyped CO2 so much that nobody seems to take note \nof it.''\n  No. 5, an August peer-reviewed study finds clouds may greatly reduce \nglobal warming. Paragraph No. 2, a new peer-reviewed--\n  I use ``peer reviewed'' quite often to show these are documented. \nThese are studies that have been reviewed by the peers, by other \nscientists, and found to be true.\n  No. 5, an August peer-reviewed study finds clouds may greatly reduce \nglobal warming: Here is an excerpt about the study: ``This study \npublished on August 9, 2007 in the Geophysical Research Letters finds \nthat climate models fail to adequately take into account the effects of \nclouds. The study shows that tropical rainfall events are accompanied \nby a decrease in high ice clouds, thus allowing more infrared heat \nradiation to escape to space. Author Dr. Roy Spencer of the University \nof Alabama Huntsville said: ``At least 80 percent of the Earth's \nnatural greenhouse effect is due to water vapor and clouds, and those \nare largely under the control of precipitation systems. Until we \nunderstand how precipitation systems change with warming, I don't \nbelieve we can know how much of our current warming is manmade. Without \nthat knowledge, we can't predict future climate change with any degree \nof certainty.''\n  Spencer, formerly a senior scientist for climate studies at NASA's \nMarshall Space Flight Center where he received NASA's Exceptional \nScientific Achievement Medal, believes that the Earth self-regulates \nits own temperature.\n\n       In fact, for the amount of solar energy available to it, \n     our climate seems to have a ``preferred'' average \n     temperature, damping out swings beyond one degree or so. I \n     believe that, through various negative feedback mechanisms, \n     the atmosphere ``decides'' how much of the available sunlight \n     will be allowed in, how much greenhouse effect it will \n     generate in response, and what the average temperature will \n     be.\n\n  No. 6, a new peer-reviewed study finds that the solar system \nregulates the earth's climate--The paper, authored by Richard Mackey, \nis published August 17, 2007, in the Journal of Coastal Research. Here \nis an excerpt about the paper: ``According to the findings reviewed in \nthis paper, the variable output of the sun, the 31 sun's gravitational \nrelationship between the earth (and the moon) and earth's variable \norbital relationship with the sun, regulate the earth's climate.''\n  No. 7, Chinese scientists Lin Zhen-Shan, and Sun Xian's 2007 study, \npublished in the peer-reviewed Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics, \nnoted that CO2 impact on warming may be ``excessively \nexaggerated.'' Here is an excerpt: ``The global climate warming is not \nsolely affected by the CO2 greenhouse effect. The best \nexample is temperature obviously cooling however atmospheric \nCO2 concentration is ascending from 1940s to 1970s. Although \nthe CO2 greenhouse effect on global climate change is \nunsuspicious, it could have been excessively exaggerated. It is high \ntime to reconsider the trend of global climate change,'' the two \nscientists concluded.\n  No. 8, a Team of Scientists Question The Validity of a ``Global \nTemperature''--The study was published in Journal of Non-Equilibrium \nThermodynamics. A March 18, 2007 article in Science Daily explained: \n``Discussions on global warming often refer to `global temperature.' \nYet the concept is thermodynamically as well as mathematically an \nimpossibility, says Bjarne Andresen, a professor at The Niels Bohr \nInstitute, University of Copenhagen.\n  ``It is impossible to talk about a single temperature for something \nas complicated as the climate of Earth'', Bjarne Andresen says, an \nexpert of thermodynamics. According to Andresen: ``The Globe consists \nof a huge number of components which one cannot just add up and \naverage. That would correspond to calculating the average phone number \nin the phone book. That is meaningless.''\n  No. 9, an April 2007 study revealed the Earth's climate ``seesawing'' \nduring the last 10,000 years, according to Swedish researchers at Lund \nUniversity. An excerpt of the study states: ``During the last 10,000 \nyears climate has been seesawing between the North and South Atlantic \nOceans. As revealed by findings presented by scientists at Lund \nUniversity in Sweden, cold periods in the north have corresponded to \nwarmth in the south and vice verse. These results imply that Europe may \nface a slightly cooler future than predicted by IPCC, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n  No. 10, a new peer-reviewed study on Surface Warming and the Solar \nCycle published in Geophysical Research Letters by scientists from the \nUniversity of Washington claims to be ``the first to document a \nstatistically significant globally coherent temperature response to the \nsolar cycle,'' according to an August 2, 2007 Science Daily article. \nThe paper found ``that times of high solar activity are on average 0.2 \ndegrees C warmer than times of low solar activity.'' Despite the fact \nthat one of the co-author's protests this study being used to chill \nclimate fears, this paper is an important contribution to establishing \nthe solar climate link.\n  No. 11, in 2007, even the alarmist UN IPCC reduced its sea level rise \nestimates significantly, thus reducing man's estimated impact on the \nclimate by 25 percent. Meanwhile, a separate UN report in late 2006 \nfound that cow emissions are more damaging to the planet than all of \nthe CO2 emissions from cars and trucks. Stating it in a \ndifferent way, the gasses released by stock actually exceed the \nCO2 in the atmosphere from all the cars and trucks in the \ntransportation sector.\n  No. 12, the UN Climate Panel has been accused of possible research \nfraud. Here is an excerpt: Douglas J. Keenan, a former Morgan Stanley \n[finance man] and current independent mathematical researcher, accused \nthe UN of ``fabrications'' and ``discovered that the sources used by \nthe Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) have disregarded \nthe positions of weather stations.'' Keenan has accused the UN of \n``intentionally using outdated data on China from 1991 and ignoring \nrevised data on the country from 1997.''\n  No. 13, a study in the summer 2007 American Association of Petroleum \nGeologists publication debunked global warming fears. The study by \nGeologist C. Robert Shoup, was entitled ``Science Under Attack.'' It \nconcluded: ``The hypothesis of Anthropogenic Global Warming does not \nyet meet the basic scientific standards of proof needed to be accepted \nas a viable hypothesis, much less as accepted fact.''\n  Again, I stress that these research studies are but a sampling of the \nnew science flowing in that is starting to overwhelm the fear campaigns \nof the global warming alarmists.\n  I frequently get asked by warming activists whether I can name a \nsingle peer-reviewed study disagreeing with Gore or the UN Summary for \nPolicymakers.\n  As you can see, the skeptic's cup overflows with recent scientific \nstudies.\n  Everything I mentioned refutes that.\n  In addition to the above recent sampling of new studies, I also refer \nto the more than 100 scientific studies by more than 300 coauthors that \nare cited in the new book ``Unstoppable Global Warming Every 1500 \nYears'' by the climate scientist Dr. Fred Singer and Dennis Avery. The \nbook details extensive research going back decades to reveal how solar \nactivity is linked to the Earth's natural climate cycle. Again, we are \ntalking about the sun, we are talking about natural variants.\n  Geophysicist Dr. David Deming, associate professor of arts and \nsciences at the University of Oklahoma--very proud of him--explained in \nJanuary of this year:\n\n       No one has ever died from global warming. What kills people \n     is cold, not heat. For more\n\n[[Page S13481]]\n\n     than 150 years, it has been documented in the medical \n     literature that human mortality rates are highest in the \n     winter when temperatures are the coldest.\n\n  Perhaps the most scathing indictment of the ``more CO2 \nequals a warmer world'' simplicity comes from Ivy League geologist Dr. \nRobert Giegengack, the chair of the Department of Earth and \nEnvironmental Science at--I call to the attention of the Presiding \nOfficer--the University of Pennsylvania. Giegengack voted for Gore in \n2000, says he would do so again. He is a Gore fan, but he is appalled \nby Gore's ignorance of climate science. Here is a guy who--he voted for \nhim, and he would vote for him again. He says to his undergraduates: \nEvery single one of you knows more about global warming than Al Gore.\n  This is the chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental \nScience at the University of Pennsylvania, a very fine, well-known \ninstitution. Giegengack said:\n\n       Gore claims that temperature increases solely because more \n     CO2 in the atmosphere traps the sun's heat. That's \n     just wrong. It is a natural interplay. It's hard for us to \n     say that CO2 drives temperature. It's easier to \n     say temperature drives CO2.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The driving mechanism is exactly the opposite of what Al \n     Gore claims, both in his film and in that book. It's the \n     temperature that, through those 650,000 years, controlled the \n     CO2; not the CO2 that controlled the \n     temperature.\n\n  I do not think anyone refutes that anymore. If I said this a year \nago, everyone would be up in arms. But now all of them are agreeing. It \nis the temperature that is controlling the CO2.\n  Now, this might be a bit technical, but what Giegengack is saying \nhere is that it is temperatures that control CO2. This is \ncrucial to the understanding of the reason why the scientific \nunderpinnings of manmade global warming fears are utterly collapsing \nand the climate models are continuing to fail.\n  Let me repeat a key point Dr. Giegengack makes. He said: If we \nreduced the rate at which we put carbon into the atmosphere, it will \nnot reduce the concentration in the atmosphere; CO2 is just \ngoing to come back out of these reservoirs.\n  There are various natural reservoirs such as oceans, soils, \npermafrost, et cetera. Giegengack is explaining the heart of the \nscientific skepticism about CO2's role in the Earth's \nclimate system.\n  He is not finished. He said:\n\n       In terms of global warming's capacity to cause human \n     species harm, I don't think it makes it into the top 10. \n     [Giegengack said in an interview in the May/June 2007 issue \n     of the Pennsylvania Gazette.]\n\n  So it is entirely appropriate that a man who supports Gore \npolitically may be putting the final nail in the coffin of manmade \nglobal warming fears.\n  The global warming scare machine is now so tenuous that other liberal \nenvironmental scientists and activists are now joining Giegengack and \ncondemning the entire basis for manmade global warming concerns.\n  This is kind of interesting. I am going to be quoting Denis Rancourt, \na professor of physics and an environmental science researcher at the \nUniversity of Ottawa. He believes that the global warming campaign does \na disservice to the environmental movement. He is a big \nenvironmentalist. He wants people to be concerned about the \nenvironment. He says: But they are a doing a disservice.\n  Rancourt wrote, on February 27, 2007:\n\n       Promoting the global warming myth trains people to accept \n     unverified, remote, and abstract dangers in the place of true \n     problems that they can discover for themselves by becoming \n     directly engaged in their workplace and by doing their own \n     research and observations. It trains people to think \n     lifestyle choices, in relation to CO2 emission, \n     rather than to think activism in the sense of exerting an \n     influence to change societal structures.\n\n  Rancourt believes that global warming:\n\n       Will not become humankind's greatest threat until the sun \n     has its next hiccup in a billion years or more in the very \n     unlikely scenario that we are still be around.\n\n  He also noted that even if CO2 emissions were a grave \nthreat, Government action and political will cannot measurably or \nsignificantly ameliorate global climate in the present world.\n  Most significantly, however, Rancourt, a committed leftwing activist \nand scientist--that is whom we are talking about--he believes \nenvironmentalists have been duped into promoting global warming as a \ncrisis. This is a far leftwing environmentalist type. He said:\n\n       I argue that by far the most destructive force on the \n     planet is profit-driven corporations and their cartels backed \n     by military might; and that the global warming myth is a red \n     herring that contributes to hiding this truth. In my opinion, \n     activists who, using any justification, feed the global \n     warming myth have effectively been co-opted, or at best \n     neutralized. Global warming is strictly an imaginary problem \n     for the First World middleclass.\n\n  Again, this is a very well-known far leftwing scientist by the name \nof Rancourt.\n  Finally, Rancourt asserted that in a warm world, life prospers.\n\n       There is no known case of a sustained warming alone having \n     a negative impact on an entire population. As a general rule, \n     all life on earth does better when it is hotter. Compare \n     ecological diversity and biotic density, or biomass, at the \n     poles and at the equator.\n\n  Indeed, 2007 has turned into the ``tipping point'' for \nunsubstantiated fears and gross distortion of science by activists who \nhave committed decades trying to convince the world it faced a manmade \nclimate crisis. Rancourt so eloquently describes the entire movement as \none featuring unverified, remote, and abstract dangers.\n\n  Perhaps the biggest shock to the global warming debate was the \nconversion of the renowned French geophysicist Dr. Claude Allegre from \na believer in the dangerous manmade warming fears to a skeptic just \nlast year. This is a guy--Dr. Claude Allegre, former French Socialist \nParty leader and a member of both the French and the U.S. Academies of \nScience--who was one of the first scientists around to sound global \nwarming fears 20 years ago. Now, this is a guy who was walking down the \nstreets with Al Gore 10 years ago holding hands, saying: The world is \ncoming to an end, the heat is upon us now, and we are going to have to \ndo something. That was the 20 years ago and 10 years ago. But he now \nsays--this is as of this year, 2007--the cause of climate change is \nunknown. He ridiculed what he termed the ``prophets of doom of global \nwarming'' in a September 2006 article.\n  Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles and written 11 \nbooks and received numerous scientific awards, including the \nGoldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States. He \nnow believes the global warming hysteria is motivated by money.\n\n       The ecology of helpless protesting has become a very \n     lucrative business for some people.\n\n  I find it ironic that a free market conservative Member of the Senate \nsuch as myself and a French Socialist scientist both apparently agree \nthat sound science is not what is driving this debate; it is money.\n  I just say bravo for the growing scientific dissent. It is not easy \nfor these guys who took a hard position just a few years ago to change \ntheir minds. You do not have to believe me. In October, Washington Post \nstaff writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, writing that the \nclimate skeptics ``appear to be expanding rather than shrinking.''\n  These are the people, the climate science skeptics, those individuals \nwho believed that global warming was causing all of those problems, \nthat manmade gases, methane, CO2, were causing climate \nchange. They are on the other side now.\n  Washington Post's Eilperin wrote--and, of course, the Washington Post \nis not known to be a very conservative publication:\n\n       In late May, Michael Griffin, Administrator of NASA, which \n     conducts considerable amounts of climate research, told \n     National Public Radio that he was not sure climate change was \n     a problem we must wrestle with and that it was rather \n     arrogant to suggest that the climate we have now represents \n     the best possible set of conditions.\n\n  Alexander Cockburn, a maverick journalist who leans left on most \ntopics, lambasted the global warming consensus last spring on the \npolitical Web site counterpunch.org, arguing that there is no evidence \nyet that humans are causing the rise of global temperature.\n  These are liberals we are talking about, in fairly liberal \npublications.\n  Leftwing professor David Noble of Canada's York University has joined\n\n[[Page S13482]]\n\nthe growing chorus of disenchanted liberal activists. Noble now \nbelieves that the movement has ``hyped the global climate issue into an \nobsession.'' Noble wrote a May 8 essay entitled ``Corporate Climate \nCoup'' which details how global warming has ``hijacked'' the \nenvironmental left and created a ``corporate climate campaign'' which \nhas ``diverted attention from the radical challenges of the global \njustice movement.''\n  Finally, I would say that world leaders such as Czech President \nVaclav Klaus and former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt have been \noutspoken in their climate skepticism. Schmidt said on June 4 of this \nyear that fears of global warming were ``hysterical'' and \n``overheated.'' He called efforts to control the earth's temperature \n``idiotic.''\n  Former Vice President Gore's biggest worry is now coming true; \npreviously committed believers in manmade global warming are now \nconverting to skeptics after reviewing the new science.\n  Well, the new science is changing minds. The 60 prominent scientists, \nmany of whom advised the Canadian Prime Minister--I mentioned this \nbefore. This is very significant. These are the guys in the 1990s who \nwere advising the Prime Minister. These 60 scientists advised the Prime \nMinister to ratify Kyoto, the treaty we did not ratify, and now they \nhave come back and said:\n\n       Significant scientific advances have been made since the \n     Kyoto protocol was created, many of which are taking us away \n     from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in \n     the mid 1990s, we knew what we know today about climate, \n     Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would have \n     concluded it is not necessary.\n\n  These are the 60 scientists who advised the Prime Minister; they have \nall changed their minds. They are now advising him not to sign on any \nsuccessor treaties to Kyoto.\n  The climate skeptics have welcomed many scientists from around the \nworld into the fold recently, including previously noted Claude \nAllegre. There are others. If you go to my Web site, you can see some \nof the rest of them. But in addition to Claude Allegre, you have the \ntop Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv, Australian mathematician David \nEvans, Canadian climate expert Bruno Wiskel, paleoclimatologist Ian D. \nClark, environmental geochemist Jan Veizer, and climate scientist Chris \nde Freitas of New Zealand--the list goes on and on--just to name a few.\n  Please go to epw.senate.gov for a full report and stay tuned to the \nupcoming blockbuster Senate report detailing the hundreds of scientists \nwho have spoken out recently to denounce manmade global fears. The list \nis unending. It is larger every day. These people were all on the other \nside of this issue, vocally, with all their scientific background. They \nhave now come over. They are skeptics now. Skeptics mean that there is \nno conclusive proof. Instead of that, it is national variances, within \nnational variability, I would add.\n  We come now to the last point, the central point No. 4, debunking the \nconsensus. The fourth and final essential point deals with how the \nmedia and the climate doomsters insist that there is an overwhelming \nscientific consensus of manmade global warming. The notion of a \nconsensus is carefully manufactured for political, financial, and \nideological purposes. Its proponents never explain fully what consensus \nthey are referring to. Is it a consensus that future computer models \nwill turn out correct? Is it a consensus that the Earth has warmed? \nProving that parts of the Earth have been warming doesn't prove that \nhumans are responsible.\n  While it may appear to the casual observer that scientists promoting \nclimate fears are in the majority, that is because most of the media \nwants to believe this. By the way, this sells papers; we all know that. \nEvidence continues to reveal this is an illusion. Climate skeptics, the \nemerging silent majority of scientists, receive much smaller shares of \nuniversity funds. They don't get university research funds, foundation \nfunds.\n  You think the Heinz Foundation is going to give funding to somebody \nunless they agree with their hysteria? Climate skeptics also receive \nsmaller shares of Government grants and are not plugged into the well-\nheeled special interest lobby. If you are part of that lobby, you get \nall these funds. If you are not, they will not play with you. On the \nother side of the climate debate, you have a comparatively well-funded \ngroup of scientists, the activists who participate in the U.N. \nconferences, receiving foundation moneys, international government \nsupport, and fawning media treatment. The number of skeptics at first \nglance may appear smaller, but the skeptics are increasingly becoming \nvocal and turning the tables on the Goliath that has become the global \nwarming fear industry.\n  Key components of the manufactured consensus, as they keep saying, \nfade under scrutiny. We often hear how the National Academy of Sciences \nand the American Meteorological Society issued statements endorsing the \nso-called consensus view that man is driving global warming. What you \ndon't hear is that both the NAS and the AMS never allowed member \nscientists to vote on these climate statements because they know that \nif it doesn't come out this way, they will not get the money they would \notherwise get. Essentially, only two dozen or so members on the \ngoverning boards of these institutions produced the consensus \nstatements. It appears that the governing boards of these organizations \ncaved in to pressure from those promoting the politically correct view \nof the United Nations and Gore-inspired science. The Canadian Academy \nof Sciences reportedly endorsed a consensus global warming statement \nthat was never even approved by its governing board.\n  Rank-and-file scientists are now openly rebelling. James Spann, a \ncertified meteorologist with the AMS, openly defied the organization \nwhen he said in January he does not know a single TV meteorologist who \nbuys into the manmade global warming hype. In February, a panel of \nmeteorologists expressed unanimous climate skepticism, and one panelist \nestimated 95 percent of his profession rejects global warming fears.\n  This is big, a survey of recent peer-reviewed studies. This is \nsomething you better get ready for because it is something you don't \nknow about yet. It hasn't been revealed yet, but it will be.\n  In August 2007, a comprehensive study of peer-reviewed scientific \nliterature from 2004 to 2007 revealed less than half of all published \nscientists endorse global warming theory. ``Of 539 total papers on \nclimate change, only 38 or 7 percent gave an explicit endorsement of \nthe consensus.'' That consensus being that manmade anthropogenic, \nCO2, methane gases are causing climate change. Only 7 \npercent of these 539 total papers since 2004.\n  In addition, a September 26, 2007, report from the international \ngroup Institute of Physics finds no consensus on global warming. Here \nis an excerpt:\n\n       As world leaders gathered in New York for a high-level UN \n     meeting on climate change, a new report by some of the \n     world's most renowned scientists urged policymakers to keep \n     their eyes on the ``science grapevine'' arguing that the \n     understanding of global warming is still far from complete. \n     The IOP is also urging world leaders to remain alert to the \n     latest scientific thought on climate change.\n\n  In May the United Nations special climate envoy, Dr. Harlem \nBrundtland, declared ``it's completely immoral, even, to question'' the \nU.N.'s alleged global warming consensus.\n  Let's examine whether immorality plays a role in this process. There \nare frequently claims that the U.N. IPCC ``Summary for Policymakers'' \nis the voice of hundreds or even thousands of the world's top \nscientists, but such claims do not hold up even to the light of \nscrutiny. According to the Associated Press, during the United Nations \n``Summary for Policymakers''--after they have their process, which is a \npublication that comes out, then it is many months after that that \nscientists get to say something.\n  According to the Associated Press, during the IPCC ``Summary for \nPolicymakers'' meeting in April of 2007, the most recent, only 52 \nscientists participated. The April 9, 2007, AP article by Seth \nBorenstein reported:\n\n       Diplomats from 115 countries and 52 scientists hashed out \n     the most comprehensive and gloomiest warning yet about the \n     possible effects of global warming, from increased flooding, \n     hunger, drought and diseases to the extension of species.\n\n  Many of the so-called hundreds of scientists who have been affiliated \nwith\n\n[[Page S13483]]\n\nthe U.N. as expert reviewers are, in fact, climate skeptics. They are \non our side. Skeptics such as Virginia State climatologist Dr. Patrick \nMichaels, Alabama State climatologist Dr. John Christy, New Zealand \nclimate researcher Dr. Vincent Gray, former head of the Geological \nMuseum at the University of Oslo Tom V. Segalstad, and MIT's Dr. \nRichard Lindzen have served as IPCC expert reviewers but were not \ninvolved in writing the alarmist summary. These are the people who were \npart of this process but were excluded from talking about the summary. \nThe summary is put together by politicians.\n\n  An analysis released in September of 2007 on the United Nations \nscientific review process by climate data analyst John McLean revealed \nthat the U.N. peer-review process is an illusion. A new study found \nthat very few scientists are actively involved in the U.N. peer-review \nprocess. The report contained devastating revelations to the central \nIPCC assertion that ``it is very highly likely that greenhouse gas \nforcing has been the dominant cause of the observed global warming over \nthe last 50 years.''\n  What do the real scientists say about this statement? According to \nthe analysis by McLean:\n\n       The IPCC leads us to believe that this statement is very \n     much supported by a majority of reviewers. The reality is \n     that there is surprisingly little explicit support for the \n     key notion. Among the 23 independent reviewers just 4 \n     explicitly endorsed the chapter with its hypotheses, and one \n     other endorsed only a specific section. Moreover, only 62 of \n     the IPCC's 308 reviewers commented on the chapter at all.\n\n  Only four out of 23 endorsed the statement that manmade gasses are \nthe primary cause of global warming. Let me repeat the key point, only \nfour U.N. scientists in the U.N. peer-review process explicitly \nendorsed the key chapter blaming mankind for warming the past 50 years, \naccording to recent analysis. This analysis was echoed by U.N. \nscientist Dr. Madhav Khandekar. He is a retired Environment Canada \nscientist. In an August 13, 2000, letter, Khandekar lashed out at those \nwho ``seem to naively believe that the climate change science exposed \nin the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change documents represents \nscientific consensus.'' He said:\n\n       Nothing could be further from the truth. As one of the \n     invited expert reviewers for the 2007 IPCC documents, I have \n     pointed out the flawed review process used by the [United \n     Nations] scientists in one of my letters. I have also pointed \n     out in my letter that an increasing number of scientists are \n     now questioning the hypotheses of Greenhouse gas induced \n     warming on the earth's surface and suggesting a stronger \n     impact of solar variability and large-scale atmospheric \n     circulation patterns on the observed temperature increase \n     than previously believed.\n\n  Khandekar concluded:\n\n       Unfortunately, the [United Nations] IPCC climate change \n     documents do not provide an objective assessment of the \n     earth's temperature trends and associated climate change.\n\n  Keep in mind, the IPCC, the United Nations, are the ones who brought \nall this to start with.\n  Paul Reiter, a malaria expert formally of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, participated in the past U.N. IPCC process and \nnow calls the concept of consensus on global warming a sham. Reiter, a \nprofessor of entomology and tropical disease with the Pasteur Institute \nin Paris, had to threaten legal action to have his name removed from \nthe IPCC. They were not even letting him withdraw because he disagreed \nscientifically with what they are coming up with. He called it a sham. \nPeople who are going to review what I am saying here today will call it \na sham. I am not calling anything a sham. That is what the scientist \ncalled this last report. ``That is how they make it seem that all top \nscientists are agreed,'' he said in 2007. He said: ``It's [just] not \ntrue.''\n  Hurricane expert Christopher Landsea of NOAA's National Hurricane \nCenter was both an author and a reviewer of the IPCC's second \nassessment report back in 1995 and the third assessment report in 2001 \nbut resigned from the fourth assessment report after charging the U.N. \nwith playing politics with hurricane science. Landsea wrote a January \n17, 2005, public letter detailing his experience with the U.N. Keep in \nmind, he is one of the top scientist on hurricanes.\n\n       I am withdrawing [from the U.N.] because I have come to \n     view the part of the IPCC to which my expertise is relevant \n     as having become politicized. In addition, when I have raised \n     my concerns to the IPCC leadership, their response was simply \n     to dismiss my concerns. I personally cannot in good faith \n     continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being \n     motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically \n     unsound.\n\n  The IPCC's own guidelines explicitly state that the scientific \nreports have to be ``changed'' to ``ensure consistency with'' the \npolitically motivated ``Summary for Policymakers.'' We have already \nsaid that the ``Summary for Policymakers''--that is the political arm, \nnot the scientific but the political arm. In addition, the IPCC more \nclosely resembles a political party's convention platform battle, not a \nscientific process. During an IPCC ``Summary for Policymakers'' \nprocess, the political delegates and international bureaucrats \nsquabbled over the scientific wording of a phrase or assertion.\n  Steve McIntyre, one of the individuals responsible for debunking the \ninfamous hockey stick theory temperature graph, slammed the IPCC \n``Summary for Policymakers'' process in January of 2004.\n\n       So the purpose of the three-month delay between the \n     publication of the (IPCC) Summary for Policy-Makers and the \n     release of the actual [Working Group 1] is to enable them to \n     make any ``necessary'' adjustments to the technical report to \n     match the policy summary. Unbelievable. Can you imagine what \n     securities commissions would say if business promoters issued \n     a big promotion and then the promoters made the ``necessary'' \n     adjustments to the qualifying reports and financial \n     statements so that they matched the promotion. Words fail me.\n\n  That is the scientist, not me.\n  As you continue to scratch beneath the surface of the alleged global \nwarming consensus, more discoveries await. Alabama's State \nclimatologist Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama in \nHuntsville served as a U.N. IPCC lead author in 2001 for the third \nassessment report and detailed how he personally witnessed U.N. \nscientists attempting to distort the science for political purposes.\n  This guy, keep in mind, was a scientist who participated in that \nprocess. He said:\n\n       I was at the table with three Europeans, and we were having \n     lunch. And they were talking about their role as lead \n     authors. And they were talking about how they were trying to \n     make the report dramatic that the United States would just \n     have to sign that Kyoto Protocol.\n\n  That is what Christy told CNN on May 2, 2007, just this year.\n  Former Colorado State climatologist, Dr. Roger Pielke, Sr., also \ndetailed the corruption of the U.N. IPCC process. This is what he said \non September 1--just a month ago--2007:\n\n       The same individuals who are doing primary research in the \n     role of humans on the climate system are then permitted to \n     lead the [IPCC] assessment! There should be an outcry on this \n     obvious conflict of interest, but to date either few \n     recognize this conflict, or see that since the \n     recommendations of the IPCC fit their policy and political \n     agenda, they chose to ignore this conflict. In either case, \n     scientific rigor has been sacrificed and poor policy and \n     political decisions will inevitably follow.\n\n  This is Dr. Pielke.\n  He added:\n\n       We need recognition among the scientific community, the \n     media, and policymakers that IPCC process is obviously a real \n     conflict of interest, and this has resulted in a \n     significantly flawed report.\n\n  What we have been talking about is the United Nations at work.\n  Politics appear to be the fuel that runs this process--the U.N. \nprocess we have been talking about--from the scientists to the \nbureaucrats to the delegates, and all the way to many of the world \nleaders involved in it.\n  What is the motivation of these distortions? I am often asked, if we \nknow that the costs are going to be so great, and we know the science \nis now flawed, and people are now waking up to it, what is the \nmotivation? I would have to say there is a lot of motivation overseas \non things like this.\n  Former French President Jacques Chirac stated in 2000 that as to \nKyoto, we are not talking about climate change. He said Kyoto \nrepresents ``the first component of an authentic global governance.''\n  These growing critiques of the politicized IPCC process have been \nechoed by the U.K.'s Lord Nigel Lawson. He is former Chancellor of the \nExchequer and a member of the House of Lords Committee that reviewed \nthe IPCC process. Lawson called for the abolishment of the U.N.'s IPCC \nprocess. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S13484]]\n\n\n       I believe the IPCC process [U.N. process] is so flawed, and \n     the institution, it has to be said, so closed to reason, that \n     it would be far better to thank it for the work it has done, \n     close it down, and transfer all future international \n     collaboration on the issue of climate change [to something \n     else].\n\n  This is a statement he made in 2005.\n  The huge organizational and funding advantage that proponents of \nclimate alarmism enjoy over scientific skeptics has led to a pretty \nelaborate and impressive facade of ``consensus.'' Many climate skeptics \nhave been excluded from key roles in the politicized IPCC process and \nlargely ignored by the media unless they are being demonized as ``flat \nEarthers'' or accused of being part of a well-funded industry campaign. \nBut in reality, it is the climate fear peddlers who enjoy an \noverwhelming funding advantage over skeptics.\n  Since the late 1980s, when global warming fears rose out of the \nscorched frost of the 1970s coming ice age scare--the same ones, I \nmight add--an international organized effort and tens of billions of \ndollars have been spent promoting the warming fear gravy train.\n  Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter estimates proponents of global \nwarming fears worldwide have received over $50 billion from \ninternational sources and the United States over the last two decades. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       In one of the more expensive ironies of history, the \n     expenditure of more than [50 billion U.S. dollars] on \n     research into global warming since 1990 has failed to \n     demonstrate any human-caused climate trend, let alone a \n     dangerous one.\n\n  That was a quote from him on June 18, 2007.\n  The U.S. alone spends over $5 billion a year on research directly or \nindirectly related to global warming. Adding to these totals of funding \nmanmade climate fears are large foundations such as the Heinz \nFoundation, international governments, the United Nations, worldwide \nuniversities, the Pew Foundation, and individuals such as billionaires \nRichard Branson and George Soros.\n  In fact, if you want to get a study funded today on anything from \nsuicide to butterflies, researchers are finding they better somehow \nlink the issue of global warming, and it will increase their chances of \nsecuring funding automatically.\n  James Spann is a meteorologist, certified by the American \nMeteorological Society. He suggests scientific objectivity is being \ncompromised by the ``big cash grab'' for money flowing to proponents of \nmanmade climate fears. I previously noted that NASA's James Hansen \nreceived a $250,000 award from the Heinz Foundation.\n  It is kind of interesting. One of my favorite liberals--and I think \nhe is kind of the darling on the left on CNN--is Miles O'Brien. We are \nfellow pilots. We have a lot in common, so I enjoy being on his \nprogram. I have been on many times.\n  He asked me the last time I was on: Well, how do you respond to the \nassertions that NASA's James Hansen made these statements, and they \nmust be true?\n  I said: Because he was given $250,000 in cash by the Heinz \nFoundation, and I think he would say anything they wanted him to say.\n  Spann explained:\n\n       Billions of dollars of grant money are flowing into the \n     pockets of those on the man-made global warming bandwagon. No \n     man-made global warming, the money dries up. This is big \n     money, make no mistake about it. Always follow the money \n     trail and it tells a story.\n\n  That is what Spann wrote in January of this year.\n  The imbalance of money between the promoters of climate fears and \nskeptics is so large that one 2007 U.S. Department of Agriculture grant \nof $20 million to study how ``farm odors'' contribute to global warming \nexceeded all of the money the groups skeptical of climate fears \nallegedly received from ExxonMobil over the past two decades.\n  The money is clearly coming from the far left environmental \nextremists, from the Hollywood elitists.\n  Later this fall, my EPW Committee will also release a report \ndetailing the hundreds of scientists--many of them affiliated with the \nU.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change process--who have spoken \nout recently to oppose climate alarmism. The report will feature the \nscientists--many of them who have finally had it with claims that ``all \nscientists agree''--in their own words. The report will be complete \nwith the scientists' biographies and Web links for future reading.\n  Keep in mind that is in addition to the names we have identified \ntoday. Look at them all, as shown on this chart. Those are many of the \nscientists now--and not even a complete list.\n  This new research and the hysteria created by the U.N. and by Gore \nand the media have prompted frustrated scientists to finally fight back \nin the name of a rational approach to science.\n  Climate rationalists or skeptics do not need to engage in smoke and \nmirrors to state their case, and we will be offering the world a chance \nto read and decide for themselves, unfiltered from the increasingly \nactivist and shrill lens of media outlets such as NBC, Newsweek, Time, \nCBS, ABC, and CNN.\n  I have stood on the floor for years detailing all the unfolding \nscience that has debunked climate alarmism. These scientific \ndevelopments of 2007 are the result of years or decades of hard work by \nscientists skeptical of manmade climate fears. Finally reaching the \npoint where we can watch the alarm crumble is very satisfying.\n  All these scientists have come up with the same response.\n  Despite the massive scientific shift in favor of skeptics, proponents \nof climate fears are increasingly attempting to suppress dissent by \nskeptics. During Gore's Live Earth concert--which was a dismal failure, \nI might add--that he had in July, environmental activist Robert F. \nKennedy, Jr., said of climate skeptics:\n\n       This is treason. And we need to start treating them as \n     traitors.\n\n  I have been personally attacked by Anderson Cooper. It is taking \nplace right now, even this week, calling me every kind of name, all \nkinds of threats. This is what--you people say: Why don't more Members \nof the House and the Senate tell the truth about climate change? This \nis the reason. This is what we are subjected to. I have a big family at \nhome who has to watch all this.\n  Heidi Cullen of the Weather Channel--she is a lovely girl--but she \ncalled on the American Society of Meteorologists to deny certification \nof any of the scientists or any of the Weather Channel people or the \nmeteorologists who do not agree with her.\n  In August, NASA's resident alarmist, James Hansen--whom we already \ntalked about--he called skeptics ``deceitful'' and ``court jesters.'' \nThis is the same activist Hansen who conceded in a 2003 issue of \nNatural Science that the use of ``extreme scenarios'' to dramatize \nglobal warming ``may have been appropriate at one time'' to drive the \npublic's attention to the issue--a disturbing admission by James \nHansen. In other words, he is saying: Exaggerate this. Scare people.\n  Other climate fear promoters have called for Nuremberg-style trials \nfor those expressing manmade global warming skepticism.\n  In September, the Virginia State climatologist skeptical of global \nwarming lost his job after a clash with the Governor. Dr. Patrick \nMichaels claims he was censored by the Governor because he held a \ndifferent view of climate science.\n  Michaels said:\n\n       I was told that I could not speak in public on my area of \n     expertise, global warming, as state climatologist.\n\n  He was fired. If the advocates for climate change alarm are so \nconfident, why are they so afraid of the debate? Why do they resort to \nsuch low-brow name calling and intimidation?\n  The reason is obvious. The latest scientific findings are refuting \nclimate fears and prompting many global warming activists to try \ndesperate measures to silence the debate. When they do agree to debate \nthe scientific facts, the alarmists lose, and lose badly.\n  In March--this is really significant--in March of this year, an \naudience of several hundred in the New York City area were persuaded to \nthe view that global warming was not a ``crisis'' following a public \ndebate with scientists on both sides.\n  Now, what we are saying here is, we had several hundred people just \noff the street, people in New York City; and most of them, when they \nwere surveyed at the beginning of this--like 75 percent of them--said: \nWe believe manmade gases are causing climate\n\n[[Page S13485]]\n\nchange. Then, after the debate took place, it reversed, and a majority \nof them said that was not true. So people--when they hear the debate \nand listen to the science on both sides, there is a wake-up call.\n  When I became chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee--\nthat was 4\\1/2\\ years ago--I vowed to make science one of the \ncornerstones of my agenda to ensure policy based on sound science. And \nas I continue on as the ranking member, I have continued this goal.\n  I think it is probably fair to say that no other Federal legislator \nhas devoted so many hours addressing Congress about the science of \nclimate change. I have spent this time because sound policy requires \nunderstanding, and what climate policy direction we choose will have \nenormous consequences not only for our Nation but for the world.\n  I would like now to address a question that I am asked repeatedly: \nSenator Inhofe, what if you are wrong and the alarmists are right? \nIsn't it better to adopt carbon restrictions to stop carbon dioxide \nemissions, just in case? My answer is always the same: What if I am \nright, and there is no response to that?\n  But let me address their question. Let's assume for a moment that the \nalarmists are right, which, of course, they are not, but let's assume \nfor the sake of discussion they are. It still makes absolutely no sense \nto join Kyoto or any successor treaty or to adopt climate restrictions \non our own. Not only does it not make economic sense, it does not make \nenvironmental sense.\n  Let me explain that.\n  First, going on a carbon diet, for us, would do nothing to avert \nclimate change. After the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in \n1997--it was never ratified, but we signed it--Al Gore's own \nscientist--this is what happened to Al Gore when he was Vice President \nof the United States. His own scientist, Tom Wigley of the National \nCenter for Atmospheric Research, calculated--he said: Let's assume we \nsigned on to the Kyoto treaty--this is back in 1997--and all other \ndeveloped nations--not China, not Mexico, just the developed nations--\nsigned on to it and lived by the emission requirements. How much would \nit lower the temperature in 50 years? His answer was 0.07 degrees \nCelsius by the year 2050.\n\n  Mr. President, 0.07 degrees is not even measurable, and that is if we \ntook all these drastic steps, and we are not going to be doing that.\n  Of the 15 original European Union countries, only two are on track to \nmeet their targets. One of these is Great Britain, and they are \nstarting to increase their emissions again, not decrease them.\n  Similar calculations have been done to estimate other climate bills. \nThe Climate Change Stewardship Act that was defeated 38 to 60 last year \nin this Chamber would have only reduced temperatures by 0.03 degrees \nCelsius, and another bill modeled on the National Commission on Energy \nPolicy report would have only reduced temperatures by 0.008 degrees \nCelsius. That is right--that is less than 1 percent of 1 degree.\n  Now, I think when we come to the significant part of this--and that \nis the lesson on economics--the high costs that would be borne under \ncarbon constraints are unjustifiable to achieve minuscule temperature \nreductions, and that is if the alarmists are right about the science. \nHow much more unjustifiable would it be if I and the growing number of \nskeptical scientists are right, which I believe we are?\n  The fearmongering about global warming has turned common sense on its \nhead. In its December 7, 1998, issue, Time magazine named Henry Ford \none of the 20th century's 100 most influential builders. Yet, just this \nmonth, ``Time'' named the 1909 Model-T car the worst environmental \nproduct of the century. ``Time'' acknowledges that the car supercharged \nthe American economy and put it on its wheels but states: ``That's just \nthe problem, isn't it?'' The consequences keep piling up, it says. In \nshort, ``Time'' now endorses the view that our world would be better \noff if we had never advanced technologically and if we were still \ndependent upon the horse and the cart as we were in 1909.\n\n  Now, most people don't agree with such extremist views, but at the \ncore of the question: ``Shouldn't we do something just in case''--that \nis the question they ask--the same calculus is at work. What if Henry \nFord had not created the Model-T out of fear of unknown consequences, \njust in case?\n  It isn't just that our major cities don't each have to deal with the \nsanitation disposal issues of tens of millions of pounds of horse \nmanure--one of the many real environmental problems a century ago that \nthe automobile eliminated. It extended to every aspect of life.\n  When the Model-T first rolled off the assembly lines near the \nbeginning of the 20th century, the average American's life expectancy \nwas 53 years. Today, the average American's life expectancy is 78 \nyears, or 25 more than it was a century ago. We are not just living \nlonger lives but healthier and more secure lives. The average \nAmerican's real standard of living climbed from $5,300 a year in 1913 \nto $33,000 a year in 2005. That is an enormous jump. The carbon-based \nsociety is responsible for that.\n  Advances in medicine and food production, building construction, \nservices, and the manufacturing of clothing, furniture, and other goods \nhave all been made possible by the mobility brought about by the \ntransportation sector and the electricity provided by our powerplants.\n  The advances over the last century are not simply interesting \nhistoric facts, they show us not only why we are a prosperous nation, \nbut a roadmap to a prosperous future. Threats to prosperity have real \nconsequences and for how well and how long Americans will live. \nWhatever actions we take today, we must also safeguard the well-being \nof America's families now and into the future.\n  The Senate acknowledged this when it passed two similar resolutions \non the floor right here in the Senate Chamber. In 1997, the Byrd-Hagel \nsense of the Senate passed 95 to nothing, a resolution that the United \nStates should not be a signatory to any kind of a treaty that reduced--\nthat had the result of costing a lot of money for the United States and \nthat did not involve the developing nations. In other words, something \nthat involved us and the developing nations but left Mexico and India \nand China and these countries alone. That was passed 95 to nothing. \nSimilarly, the Bingaman sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed in 2005 \nresolved that the United States should address global warming as long \nas it will not significantly harm the United States economy and \nencourages comparable action by other nations that are major trading \npartners and key contributors to global emissions.\n  Neither the Kyoto protocol nor a single bill before Congress meets \nthese criteria. They range from costly to ruinous. But they all fail to \nmeet the requirement of Byrd-Hagel and Bingaman.\n  Both the Energy Information Administration--that is the EIA--and the \nWharton Econometric Forecasting Associates--that is the Wharton School \nof Economics--analyzed the cost of Kyoto when it was signed and the \ncosts were staggering. For instance, EIA found that the annual cost \nwould be up to $283 billion a year. That is in 1992 constant dollars. \nWharton put the cost even higher--more than $300 billion a year. Now, \nthat equates out to an increase in taxes $2,700 a year for every family \nof four in the United States.\n  The estimated costs to comply with carbon legislative proposals in \nthe United States would be unreasonable. The NCEP approach would do \nnothing to lessen global warming, even according to the alarmists. But \naccording to the EIA, it would still cost more than 118,000 American \njobs simply to make this symbolic gesture.\n  As I recall from our debate, I say to the Presiding Officer, the \nhighest job loss was actually in the State of Pennsylvania if we had \npassed that bill 2 years ago.\n  According to the MIT study--this is a different study than the one we \njust talked about--the Sanders-Boxer bill would cost the energy sector \nconsumers an amount equal to $4,500 per American family of four. This \nis a bill that is now pending in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. The same study found the Lieberman-McCain bill would cost \nconsumers $3,500 per family of four. Similarly, the EIA found that it \nwould have a cost of\n\n[[Page S13486]]\n\n1.3 million jobs. A new EPA analysis shows the Lieberman-McCain bill \nwould also cost up to a half a trillion dollars by 2030, and $1.3 \ntrillion by 2050.\n  Let me in all fairness say it is no longer called the Lieberman-\nMcCain bill; it is the Lieberman-Warner bill now.\n  So the environmentalists will now tell you that is OK. Dan Lashof of \nthe National Resource Defense Council says the EPA's analysis of the \nLieberman-Warner bill shows it is affordable, although EPA finds that \nfuel will increase by 22 percent, because he calls fuel impacts \n``pretty modest.'' Activists inside the Beltway may think that big \njumps in gas prices is not a big deal, but I doubt people living in the \nreal America would agree.\n  What few Americans realize is that the impact of these policies would \nnot be evenly distributed. The Congressional Budget Office recently \nlooked at the approach taken by most global warming proposals in \nCongress, known as cap and trade--cap and trade the CO2 \nemissions--that would place a cap on carbon emissions, allocate how \nmuch everyone could emit, and then let them trade those emissions. Let \nme quote from the CBO report:\n\n       Regardless of how the allowances were distributed, most of \n     the cost of meeting a cap on CO2 emissions would \n     be borne by consumers, who would face persistently higher \n     prices for products such as electric and gasoline. Those \n     price increases would be regressive in that poor households \n     would bear a larger burden relative to their income than \n     wealthier households would.\n\n  Think about that. Even relatively modest bills would put enormous \nburdens on the poor. The poor already face energy costs much higher as \na percentage of their income than the wealthy. While most Americans \nspend about 4 percent of their monthly budget on heating homes and \nenergy needs, the poorest one-fifth of Americans spend 19 percent of \ntheir budget on energy. Why would we adopt polices \nwhich disproportionately force the poor and working class to shoulder \nthe higher costs?\n\n  To put this in perspective as to what the costs would be, we go \nback--on this chart we show that these right here represent the last \nfour of the largest tax increases in this country. This one right here, \na $32 billion tax increase, was the Clinton-Gore tax increase of 1993. \nYou remember that: Increased marginal rates, corporate rates affected \nall of the capital gains tax and all that. I came down here and stood \nat this podium in outrage trying to fight that tax increase of 1993. By \ncontrast, the Kyoto protocol would actually be 10 times greater. So it \nis a tax increase 10 times greater than the largest tax increase in \nrecent history.\n  Carbon caps would also fundamentally alter the way we live. Take the \ncase of the cement industry and its relationship to our daily lives. \nCement is experiencing a tremendous growth in daily demand with new \njobs that are created. Cement is essential to the maintaining and \nrevitalization of our aging infrastructure. Highways, bridges, water \nand sewer systems are built with cement. Already, our ability to meet \nour energy needs is under tremendous stress due to the cost. I think we \nunderstand that. I have several things I will put in the Record talking \nabout how that is going to hurt the economy.\n  But I wish to move on here and say that many times I have heard \nAmerica is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. They have been saying \nthis up until a month ago. They said that America is the biggest \nemitter of carbon dioxide, and thus, we are the problem. That is no \nlonger true. Earlier this year, China surpassed the United States as \nthe world's largest emitter of carbon. Only 6 years ago, it was \nestimated that China's emissions would still lag those of the United \nStates in 2040. China's emissions growth is explosive and climbing \nupward.\n  To put things in perspective, the United States did not build a \nsingle new coal-fired powerplant in the last 15 years, up until 2006--\nnot one--although there are now some efforts underway to change that. \nBy comparison, according to the New York Times, China last year built \n117 government-approved coal-fired powerplants at a rate of roughly 1 \nevery 3 days according to official figures. So they are putting up 1 \nevery 3 days and we crank out none in 15 years. You talk about the main \nmotivator of that. India's emissions increases are not far behind \nChina, and Brazil is not far behind them. The fact is if these \ncountries do not curb their rapidly accelerated emissions growth, then \nembracing a carbon diet and sluggish economic growth by developed \ncountries will accomplish nothing. Moreover, many of the carbon \nreductions achieved through most manufacturing jobs in developing \ncountries are simply emitted elsewhere, as jobs are created to make the \nsame product in countries that don't ration energy. The U.S. emissions \nas a measure of productivity are far lower than China. Cement \nmanufacturing is a perfect example. Every job sent there will increase \nemissions, not lower them.\n  What we are talking about here is they don't have all these safe \nterms--the technologies in China--that we have to lower the emissions. \nSo if we force them overseas to China, emissions will have a net \nincrease.\n  China is growing at such a rate that even if the United States, \nEurope, and the rest of the developing world were to eliminate every \nton of its emissions and become zero emitter countries within a few \ndecades--a clearly ruinous goal--emissions would still be higher than \ntoday because of rapidly growing emissions in the developing world. We \nare talking about China and other countries.\n  Some will say we simply need to educate the developing countries, but \nthe fact is they understand all too well that there are more important \npriorities. As the Director General of China's Office of Global \nEnvironmental Affairs said in October 2006:\n\n       You cannot tell the people--\n\n  Talking about his Chinese people--\n\n     who are struggling to earn enough to eat that they need to \n     reduce their emissions.\n\n  The Secretary of India's Environmental Ministry expressed the same \nsentiment when he said:\n\n       Removal of poverty is the greater immediate imperative.\n\n  These views are consistent with the findings of the Copenhagen \nConsensus. In 2004, a Danish environmentalist who believes global \nwarming is a serious problem got together eight of the world's leading \neconomists, including four Nobel laureates and 30 specialists on many \nof the world's leading problems. They analyzed the world's biggest \nissues and ranked them on the cost-effectiveness of directing societal \nwealth or resources toward these problems. Of the 17 issues studied, \nHIV/AIDS, malnutrition, malaria and sanitation topped the list as the \nbest investments, while climate came in dead last. It was ranked as a \nbad use of resources.\n  So what is the path forward? I categorically will oppose legislation \nor initiatives that will devastate our economy, as well as those that \nwill cost jobs simply to make symbolic gestures to the far left.\n  I believe such measures would be defeated because the approach is \npolitically unsustainable. We are seeing the first signs of that in \nEurope right now. Even if the alarmists were right on the science--\nwhich they are not--their command and control approaches sow the seeds \nof their own failure. As long as their own policies put national \neconomy in the crosshairs, they will stoke the fires of opposition and \neventually collapse under their own weight.\n  Stabilizing emissions cannot happen in 20, 40, 60 years because our \nworld infrastructure is built on fossil fuels and will continue to be \nso for a long time to come. The powerplants and other facilities being \nbuilt now and in the future will emit carbon for half a century once \nthey are complete. Quite simply, the technology does not exist to cost-\neffectively power the world without emitting carbon dioxide. I and many \nothers who reject the climate alarmism or ineffective yet expensive \nsolutions will block efforts to implement mandatory carbon \nrestrictions.\n  I find it unfortunate that so many politicians and climate advocates \nfocus on trying to resurrect a mandatory carbon policy in the face of \nits demonstrated failure in practice in the countries that have adopted \nit. In the process, they are ignoring the best path forward.\n  There is only one approach so far I have seen that will work, which \nis called the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and \nClimate. Why is this? It is because this approach serves multiple \npurposes. There are\n\n[[Page S13487]]\n\nsome real pollutants out there. CO2 is not a pollutant; it \nis a fertilizer. But there are real pollutants out there, \nSOX, NOX, and mercury. By working with our \npartners, the Asia-Pacific partners, we can expand our energy supply, \nincrease trade, and along with these other goals, reduce greenhouse \ngases as a byproduct, along with reducing real pollutants such as \nSOX, NOX, and mercury. Others might put this list \ntogether differently in terms of priority, but my point is that the \nAsia-Pacific Partnership meets the criteria for success.\n  It is a politically and economically sustainable path forward that \naddresses multiple issues in the context of their relation to other \nissues. Perhaps other approaches in the future will meet this criteria \nas well, but this partnership is currently the only one that does.\n  Any international post-Kyoto agreement the United States enters into \nmust make the concepts embodied in the APP a cornerstone of that \nagreement.\n  Let me conclude. I point out that climate alarmism has become a \ncottage industry in this country and many others. But a growing number \nof scientists and the general public are coming around to the idea that \nclimate change is natural and that there is no reason for alarm. It is \ntime to stop pretending the world around us is headed for certain doom \nand that Kyoto-style policies would save us--when, in fact, the biggest \ndanger lies in these policies themselves. Again, new studies continue \nto pile up and debunk alarm and the very foundation for so-called \nsolutions to warming.\n  I know this has been a long speech. I want the real people--not the \nmoney-driven liberals and the Hollywood elitists but the real people \nout there raising their families and working hard and paying taxes for \nall the stuff we are doing in Washington--we want to tell them that \nhelp is on its way and that all the U.N.- and media-driven hype to sell \nAmerica down the river will fail.\n  During the past 2 hours, I have named hundreds of scientists who were \nAl Gore followers in the past and now who are skeptics; and they \nrealize this issue is driven by money and the far left. The truth is \ncoming out loudly and clearly.\n  As Winston Churchill said:\n\n       Truth is incontrovertible, ignorance can deride it, panic \n     may resent it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.\n\n  Why am I willing to subject myself to the punishment by the alarmists \nand elitists? It is because of this. My wife and I have 20 kids and \ngrandkids who are living in this world. I don't want them to have to \npay a tax 10 times greater than they should because of something that \nis based on flawed science and contrived science. It is for them that \nwe are doing it.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I will speak for a couple of minutes. If \nsomebody else comes to the floor and wants to be heard, I will yield at \nthat time.\n  I think it is very important we realize something else is looming out \nthere. As everyone knows, I am a conservative Republican. I have seen a \nthing called the Law of The Sea Treaty. It is coming at us again. This \nstarted back in the 1960s and 1970s. During the Reagan administration, \nPresident Reagan was able to stop it.\n  What this treaty would do, in one sentence, is this: It would \nrelinquish our sovereignty to over 70 percent of the world--again, it \nis another United Nations initiative--to a superagency that will have \nthe ability to tax globally.\n  During the last 2 years, I have talked about the problems we are \nhaving with the hyped global warming debate. It all came from the U.N. \nThat is where a lot of these things come from. The U.N. is less and \nless accountable to any of the member countries than they were at one \ntime.\n  One of the things we have done, and I have done personally, is every \ntime we have had a problem where the U.N. is coming out with a policy \nnot in the best interest of the United States, since the United States \npays for 25 percent of the budget of the U.N., I have been able to pass \na resolution that says that if the U.N. doesn't back down from this \nprogram, we will hold back 50 percent of our dues. It is the only \nleverage we have. Of course, they are outraged.\n  The people running the U.N. do not want to be accountable to anyone. \nThe reason and the motivations of the Law of the Sea Treaty is to set \nup this superagency that does have taxing powers--global taxing powers. \nTheir goal has been stated that if they are able to pass this, and they \ncan run the U.N. on a global tax, then they don't have to be \naccountable to anyone. Here we are paying for 25 percent of it now. But \nwe would not be at that time. It would be paid for independently.\n  I believe that of all of the bad things coming from this treaty, that \nis the worst. I think that is the motive of many of them. There are \nmany other problems. By giving up the authority of over 70 percent of \nthe Earth's surface, it has huge military risks. It puts us into a \nposition where if we in the United States know there is a ship on the \nhigh seas that has a terrorist aboard or has a weapon of mass \ndestruction, we could no longer stop and search and try to seize it. It \nstates there are only four conditions under which we could stop a ship, \nand none have to do with national security.\n  It does say it should not affect the military, but there is no \ndefining term of military effort. Instead, that would be determined by \nthis new high court that would be established--this high court that \nwould be established by the U.N.\n  I know many people in this Chamber will say: Of course, it is coming \nfrom our Republican administration and the military says they want it. \nI question that when I go back and study what happened during the 1980s \nand see what the consequences could be. It is now a popular thing. We \nare saying we have made all the corrections and everything is satisfied \nnow, and if President Reagan were here, he would sign off on it. That \nis not true. He had five objections to it. Not one of the five has been \nmet.\n  So I suggest we have something very serious coming. I don't know why \nit is that the majority of Members of this body, the Senate, think that \nno idea is a good idea unless it is made by some big multinational \norganization, that nothing is good unless it is something that \naddresses a problem from a multinational perspective.\n  When I go back to Oklahoma, they ask me: What happened to sovereignty \nin America? I have to say I don't know, but we are going to try to keep \nit as much as possible. The best way to do that is to not ratify the \ntreaty called the Law of the Sea Treaty. It is going to be a tremendous \neffort for us to get a number of Senators--34--to sign a letter saying \nwe would oppose this treaty. It takes two-thirds to pass a treaty.\n  I think this is coming, and I want America to be ready for it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have repeatedly come to the floor to \nspeak about one of the worst human tragedies in recent memory--the \ncrisis in Darfur.\n  For 4 long years the world has watched this tragedy. We have \nwitnessed the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, \nthe torching of entire villages, rape, torture, and untold human \nsuffering.\n\n[[Page S13488]]\n\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle and in the international \ncommunity have repeatedly called for greater U.S. and global action.\n  Upon taking office in January of this year, U.N. Secretary General \nBan Ki-moon said that ending the violence in Darfur was going to be one \nof his top priorities. President Bush has rightly called the situation \nin Darfur genocide. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said that, \n``Darfur is the greatest humanitarian crisis the world faces today.''\n  Today, I speak once again about this crisis.\n  Quite simply, we are at a critical juncture in Sudan.\n  The situation in Darfur has become increasingly complex. Rebel groups \nare jockeying for power and fighting amongst themselves. Banditry and \nlawlessness are on the rise and humanitarian workers remain at great \nrisk. In late September, a rebel group brutally killed ten African \nUnion peacekeepers in a surprise raid.\n  Just last week, reports surfaced of a new, appallingly violent \nmassacre in southern Darfur. According to reports, more than 30 \ncivilians were killed, including a young boy who was shot in the back \nwhile trying to run away.\n  And now the peace agreement between North and South Sudan--a U.S. \nbrokered accord that might have formed a blueprint for a political \nsettlement in Darfur--appears increasingly in jeopardy.\n  Sadly, without action, Sudan may be on the verge of even greater \ninstability and human misery.\n  Yet thanks in part to the tireless work of Secretary General Ban, we \nalso have two critical opportunities to bring about a long-term \nresolution to this crisis.\n  First, in late July the U.N. Security Council voted to implement a \nsignificantly increased U.N./African Union peacekeeping force.\n  This peacekeeping force is desperately needed and the United States \nshould work with the U.N. and the global community to make sure it is \ndeployed as soon as possible.\n  I commend the White House for including funding for this urgent \nmission in its supplemental appropriations request.\n  But the peacekeepers are only one important step. Sudan also needs a \nlong-term political agreement. As Secretary General Ban said recently \nin Sudan, ``There must be a peace to keep.''\n  This weekend in Tripoli, a first round of peace talks between the \nvarious factions and the Sudanese government will begin.\n  The peacekeeping forces and the Tripoli negotiations are two critical \nsteps toward ending the violence, and they deserve our strongest \nsupport.\n  We must make it clear that we expect all factions to stop the \nviolence and participate in good faith in the peace talks.\n  We must demand that China and Russia immediately halt the sale of \nweapons in Sudan. That's right, two permanent members of the U.N. \nSecurity Council are the primary arms suppliers in Sudan. Global \nleaders have a responsibility to halt such sales.\n  But ultimately, we must hold the Sudanese government accountable. Its \nculpability in the years of violence and stonewalling of international \nefforts is well known.\n  Sudanese President Bashir must be held to his commitment to allow \npeacekeepers in the country and to participate in the peace talks. He \nmust also work to ensure the North-South peace agreement does not \ncollapse.\n  Early statements by his government said that it would ``contribute \npositively to secure the environment for the negotiations'' and \n``facilitate the timely deployment'' of the 26,000 member peacekeeping \nforce.\n  Sadly, we have every reason to be skeptical of the regime's \nintentions.\n  It is therefore critical that we maintain pressure on the Sudanese \ngovernment to honor its commitments. The administration should continue \nits diplomatic efforts and we in Congress should consider tightening \neconomic sanctions if the Sudanese government does not cooperate with \nthe peacekeepers or the upcoming peace negotiations.\n  The stakes are too high, and the humanitarian crisis has dragged on \ntoo long to allow any more delay in Sudan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13488-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                    DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today, President Bush is meeting \nwith President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nDRC.\n  This meeting is very important. The DRC symbolizes the hope that so \nmany Africans have for the future of their continent. The country is \nalso emblematic of so many of the challenges facing Africa.\n  Stabilizing the DRC and fostering democracy are high priorities for \nAmerican objectives in Africa. Given the country's size, efforts at \npolitical and economic reform, and wealth of natural resources, it is \nimperative that we support the Congolese Government to end more than a \ndecade of warfare and several decades of unaccountable and \nnontransparent government.\n  For this reason, I attached an amendment to the 2006 Iraq \nsupplemental appropriations bill, together with Senator Leahy, that \nprovided $13.2 million to the Congo, including $8.2 million for \nmilitary reform and $5 million to support free and fair elections. In \nDecember 2006, the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, \nand Democracy Promotion Act passed into law. I was proud to have \nintroduced this legislation, which authorized $52 million in U.S. \nassistance for the Congo, called for a special envoy to resolve ongoing \nviolence, and urged the administration to strengthen the U.N. \npeacekeeping force.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has ignored the call by Congress to \nappoint a special envoy, and it has done little to strengthen the U.N. \npeacekeeping force which is working to stabilize the eastern part of \nthe Congo.\n  Over the past several months, there have been reports of the \nmobilization of military forces in the eastern Congo. These reports are \ndeeply disturbing. It is my hope that all Congolese leaders will \nrecommit themselves to the search for peace in this part of the \ncountry. The pursuit of military solutions in the eastern part of the \ncountry will inevitably prove elusive and will only yield more \nbloodshed and misery for the civilian population.\n  The seriousness of the situation in eastern Congo was recently \nhighlighted by a devastating report about the escalation of sexual \nviolence against women in the region. For this reason, I wrote a letter \nto Secretary of State Rice earlier this month to express concern about \nthe escalation of sexual violence in eastern DRC. Specifically, I asked \nthe Secretary to respond to nine questions concerning steps that the \nadministration is taking to help end the sexual violence and make the \nperpetrators accountable. To date, I have not received a reply to my \nletter. For the DRC's transition to democratic governance to be \nsuccessful, the U.S. and its partners will have to intensify their \ncommitment to work with the Congolese Government to enhance security, \nresolve conflicts, and spur the country's social and economic \nreconstruction.\n  Despite the success of last year's elections, the first in 40 years, \nthe international community must be actively engaged in the country for \nthe foreseeable future not only to bring an end to the conflict in the \neast but to assist in the emergence of institutions that will ensure \naccountability and economic development. It is a sobering fact that \nnearly 80 percent of the country's 56 million people live in absolute \npoverty and more than 70 percent are undernourished.\n  At the same time, the Kabila government must be encouraged to adopt \ninclusive and transparent political processes, involving opposition \nparties and civil society organizations. Moreover, I welcome the return \nof American investors to the DRC, to help develop and add value to the \ncountry's natural resources. It is imperative, however, that American \nbusinesses, as well as investors from every other country, especially \nChina, commit to a zero tolerance for corruption while implementing \neffective measures to preserve the nation's environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13488-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13488-S13489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n[[Page S13489]]\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S13489, October 26, 2007, the section SUCCESS IN THE \nMIDDLE ACT, was egregiously printed.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to reflect its deletion.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13489-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              ANNIVERSARY OF THE SACRAMENTO PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 150th \nanniversary of the Sacramento Public Library in Sacramento, CA.\n  The Sacramento Library opened on November 8, 1857, for members who \npaid dues equivalent to $300 a year today. It served 260 members with \nan annual circulation of 4,234 books. On June 14, 1879, the city of \nSacramento assumed ownership of the library and residents were given \nthe opportunity to utilize the library at no cost. In 1914, with the \nhelp of a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, the original building \nfor the current Sacramento Central Library was built with a volume \ncollection of 65,000.\n  In addition to serving the reading needs of the community, the \nSacramento Public Library also provides other important educational \ntools. It provides access to books on tape, learning exhibits, \ncomputers, and college and career counselors. The library also offers \nliteracy services and has staff available to answer questions seven \ndays a week.\n  The Central Library has come a long way since its beginning; it had a \nmultistory building addition in 1992 and now houses over 300,000 \nvolumes, 1,000 periodical subscriptions and a garden reading area for \nan outdoor reading environment. Over the years, the Sacramento Public \nLibrary added locations in 11 other cities in Sacramento County, with \n27 total branches and bookmobiles now serving over 1 million residents.\n  As the community and staff gather to celebrate the Sacramento Public \nLibrary's sesquicentennial, I would like to congratulate the whole \ncommunity on this wonderful achievement and wish them luck on another \n150 years of successful learning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13489-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13489-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/26/senate-section/article/S13489-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 505.

A bill ensure that individual homeowners that were not \npreviously required to purchase flood insurance that are now required \nto do so because of the updating of flood insurance program rate maps \nreceive a discount for the purchase of such insurance; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Lott and Cochran to introduce legislation that will help make \nflood insurance more affordable for working families across the \ncountry.\n  This bill makes a substantial change to the National Flood Insurance \nProgram by reducing flood insurance premiums for those living near \nrecently decertified levees.\n  This is critical in California and the Gulf States, where several \nlevees no longer meet national certification standards.\n  Here is how the bill works: If a national flood map update results in \nthe decertification of a levee, those living nearby will be required to \npurchase flood insurance. This legislation makes those now required to \npay flood insurance eligible for a 50 percent discount on premiums for \n5 years. Levee decertification will force some homeowners to pay \nupwards of $1,000 per year for new flood insurance policies from the \nNational Flood Insurance Program; according to FEMA premium estimates \nfor high-risk residential areas.\n\n[[Page S13491]]\n\n  This bill will save most families in a newly zoned high-risk \nresidential area more than $500 each year, or roughly $40 each month.\n  The goal of the 5-year reprieve is to give the responsible agencies \ntime to bring the levees up to standard.\n  When the levees are strong again, the homeowners will no longer be \nrequired to purchase flood insurance. The financial burden would be \nlifted.\n  This grace period helps those who need it most and softens the harsh \nand expensive consequences that accompany FEMA's Map Modification \nprocess.\n  Additionally, the 5-year limit allows this legislation to accomplish \nthese objectives in a manner that is fiscally responsible.\n  Our colleagues in the House recently passed legislation H.R. 3121, \nthat seeks to ensure the continued viability of the National Flood \nInsurance Program.\n  My colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Dennis \nCardoza, authored an amendment similar to this legislation, which \npassed by voice vote and is now included in the House's proposed \nchanges.\n  The House bill encourages broader participation, increases financial \naccountability, and eliminates unnecessary rate subsidies.\n  Additionally, the bill makes the updating and modernization of flood \nmaps a priority, and requires a thorough review of the Nation's flood \nprotection systems.\n  Under the new requirements, FEMA will work in conjunction with the \nArmy Corps of Engineers and local communities to inventory their flood \ncontrol systems and reassess their levels of protection.\n  However, as FEMA remaps and reexamines flood threats, many households \nwill find that they are no longer as safe as they thought.\n  In California alone there are more than 136 communities that contain \nat least one levee that will be impacted by the deaccreditation \nprocess.\n  These communities contain levees that will be, or may have already \nbeen, remapped and decertified for not providing protection from the 1 \npercent annual chance flood.\n  Many of the families in these impacted communities have lived in \ntheir homes for years, and believed that the levees in their backyards \nprotected them from the threat of dangerous and costly flooding.\n  As a result of the changing risk, homeowners who were previously \nexempt from mandatory flood insurance may now be required to purchase \nflood insurance.\n  That is why I believe this bill is necessary. The Homeowners Flood \nInsurance Protection Act lightens this burden.\n  For nearly 40 years, the National Flood Insurance Program has been \ninstrumental in making flood insurance readily available to all \nAmericans: Communities have partnered with the Federal Government to \nadopt and enforce floodplain management and, in turn, receive \nfederally-backed insurance policies; and through the development of \neffective floodplain management strategies, millions of families have \nbeen protected from flooding and saved from the devastating costs \nassociated with flood damage.\n  But today, the program is in danger.\n  After the record-breaking losses of nearly $20 billion suffered as a \nresult of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, it is clear that the \nprogram needs to be updated.\n  This expansive project will allow communities to formulate \nresponsible floodplain development plans and prepare for catastrophic \nflooding. The project will also ensure that the National Flood \nInsurance Program charges fair rates for their flood insurance \npremiums.\n  Now, I support the National Flood Insurance program and recognize the \nimportance of mandatory purchase requirements.\n  The problem is that homeowners who have paid their taxes and helped \nto pay for the upkeep of these levees, will now find themselves forced \nto pay an additional insurance premium because of a failing levee.\n  Many of these individuals in my State and across the country are low-\nincome earners and this increasing burden threatens to break the bank.\n  Coupled with rising energy, health care and home mortgage costs, the \nunexpected additional expense of flood insurance may be too much for \nsome families.\n  That is why we need to offer this assistance.\n  We must act soon to overhaul our Nation's flood insurance program.\n  However, it is also our responsibility to mitigate the impact of the \nlevee decertification process on thousands of unsuspecting families \nacross the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2251\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 357.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 357) designating the week of November \n     11 through November 17, 2007 as ``National Veterans Awareness \n     Week'' to emphasize the need to develop educational programs \n     regarding the contributions of veterans to the country.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the week that includes Veterans \nDay, corresponding this year to November 11-17, 2007, be designated as \n``National Veterans Awareness Week''. This marks the eighth year in a \nrow that I have introduced such a resolution, which has been adopted \nunanimously by the Senate on all previous occasions.\n  The purpose of National Veterans Awareness Week is to serve as a \nfocus for educational programs designed to make students in elementary \nand secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their \nimportance in preserving American peace and prosperity. This goal takes \non particular importance and immediacy this year as we find ourselves \nagain with uniformed men and women in harm's way in foreign lands.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims of our own success with \nregard to the superior performance of our Armed Forces. The plain fact \nis that there are just fewer people around now who have had any \nconnection with military service. For example, as a result of \ntremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current armed forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 15 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was in place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, \nsuch as World War II, when our military was many times larger than \ntoday, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. Even though the \nIraqi war has been prominently discussed on television and in the \nnewspapers, many of our children are much more preoccupied with the \nusual concerns of young people than with keeping up with the events of \nthe day. They just don't ``feel'' the war like many earlier generations \ndid through both World Wars and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. As a \nconsequence, many of our youth still have little or no connection with \nor knowledge about the important historical and ongoing role of men and \nwomen who have served in the military. This omission seems to have \npersisted despite ongoing educational efforts by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the armed forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the armed forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history, can make decisions regarding our military involvement that \nmay have unexpected and unwanted consequences. Even more important, \ngeneral recognition of the importance of those individual character \ntraits that are essential for military success, such as patriotism, \nselflessness, sacrifice, and heroism, is vital to maintaining these key \naspects of citizenship in the Armed Forces and even throughout the \npopulation at large.\n  The failure of our children to understand why a military is \nimportant, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate \nsurvival, and why a successful military requires integrity and \nsacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contributions of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was brought home to me several years ago \nby Samuel I. Cashdollar, who was then a 13-year-old seventh grader at \nLewes Middle School in Lewes, DE. Samuel won the Delaware VFW's Youth \nEssay Contest that year with a powerful presentation titled ``How \nShould We Honor America's Veterans''? Samuel's essay pointed out that \nwe have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly \nemphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of \nthose in uniform tend to be overlooked. We don't want our children \ngrowing up to think that Veterans Day has simply become a synonym for a \ndepartment store sale, and we don't want to become a nation where more \nhigh school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name \nDwight Eisenhower.\n  National Veterans Awareness Week complements Veterans Day by focusing \non education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many \nin addition to the heroism and service of the individual. National \nVeterans Awareness Week also presents an opportunity to remind \nourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of those who have served \nin peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups work unending hours \nand spend long periods away from their families under conditions of \ngreat discomfort so that we all can live in a land of freedom and \nplenty. It can also remind us of the importance of our country keeping \nits promises to our veterans and providing them with the proper support \nservices.\n  Last year, my resolution designating National Veterans Awareness Week \nwas approved in the Senate by unanimous consent. Responding to that \nresolution, President Bush issued a proclamation urging our citizenry \nto observe National Veterans Awareness Week.
