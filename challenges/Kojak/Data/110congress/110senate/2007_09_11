Mr. President, this morning, following any remarks of \nSenator McConnell and myself, the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of the Transportation Appropriations bill. There are no \nvotes presently scheduled.\n  Last night, there were discussions about the possibility of the \nRepublicans offering an amendment on the subject of Mexican trucks, \nwhich is the subject of the pending Dorgan amendment. We are all \nhopeful we can work something out on that this morning regarding the \nDorgan amendment and the so-called alternative amendment to that.\n  It is my understanding Senator Coburn is going to arrive about 10:30 \nthis morning to start offering amendments on problems he has with this \nlegislation. As I mentioned last night, he tends not to speak for long \nperiods of time, but he does have a number of amendments. He hasn't \ndecided how many that will be. We hope we can proceed on that as \nquickly as possible.\n  At 12 noon today, the Senate will observe a moment of silence in \ncommemoration of the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attack. Both \nthe Republican leader and I encourage Members to come to the floor for \nthis observance.\n  Also, the Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the regular party \nconference meetings.\n  Yesterday, I indicated that today would be a late night as we work \ntoward completing this legislation. There is no reason we can't \ncomplete this bill tonight. If we complete it tonight, of course, there \nwill be no votes tomorrow. As indicated, there would be no votes after \n1 o'clock anyway, so we should do our best to complete this legislation \ntonight.\n  It could be a very late night, but we have two of our most competent, \nexperienced legislators doing this bill--Senator Murray and Senator \nBond--and we do hope we can move forward on this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11355-7", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The Senate unanimously confirmed General David H. \n     Petraeus as Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, by \n     a vote of 81-0 on January 26, 2007.\n       (2) General Petraeus graduated first in his class at the \n     United States Army Command and General Staff College.\n       (3) General Petraeus earned Masters of Public \n     Administration and Doctoral degrees in international \n     relations from Princeton University.\n       (4) General Petraeus has served multiple combat tours in \n     Iraq, including command of the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault) during combat operations throughout the first year \n     of Operation Iraqi Freedom, which tours included both major \n     combat operations and subsequent stability and support \n     operations.\n       (5) General Petraeus supervised the development and \n     crafting of the United States Army and Marine Corps \n     counterinsurgency manual based in large measure on his combat \n     experience in Iraq, scholarly study, and other professional \n     experiences.\n       (6) General Petraeus has taken a solemn oath to protect and \n     defend the Constitution of the United States of America.\n       (7) During his 35-year career, General Petraeus has amassed \n     a distinguished and unvarnished record of military service to \n     the United States as recognized by his receipt of a Defense \n     Distinguished Service Medal, two Distinguished Service \n     Medals, two Defense Superior Service Medals, four Legions of \n     Merit, the Bronze Star Medal for valor, the State Department \n     Superior Honor Award, the NATO Meritorious Service Medal, and \n     other awards and medals.\n       (8) A recent attack through a full-page advertisement in \n     the New York Times by the liberal activist group, Moveon.org, \n     impugns the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all \n     the members of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to reaffirm its support for all the men and women of \n     the United States Armed Forces, including General David H. \n     Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq;\n       (2) to strongly condemn any effort to attack the honor and \n     integrity of General Petraeus and all the members of the \n     United States Armed Forces; and\n       (3) to specifically repudiate the unwarranted personal \n     attack on General Petraeus by the liberal activist group \n     Moveon.org.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will not yield at this time, although \nafter I get through speaking I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. President, every generation has defining moments, moments when \nyou know in an instant that the world as you knew it has forever \nchanged. Some of these moments are cause for celebration, such as the \nMoon landing or the fall of the Berlin Wall. But some, like the bombing \nof Pearl Harbor or the assassination of President John Fitzgerald \nKennedy, are moments of intense grief, when the entire Nation holds its \nbreath in shock and disbelief.\n  The morning of September 11, 2001, was one such defining moment. Many \nof us closed our eyes, pleading with reality that what we saw could not \nbe true. Many of us sat and cried, reeling from the loss of so many of \nour friends and neighbors. Many of us crowded into houses of worship \nacross the country, looking for comfort and for answers. We watched as \naverage Americans, finding extraordinary courage, became heroes. \nFirefighters, police officers, and other emergency personnel responded \nwith remarkable bravery and determination, and many gave their lives so \nthat others might live. The strength and generosity of ordinary \nAmericans was the sole bright spot on that dark day.\n  But what defines our generation is not just what we do in such \nmoments but what we do the next day, and the next week, and the next \nyear. Here we stand, 6 years later, remembering that day and reflecting \nback on all that has happened since that time. And here I stand, more \nproud of America than ever, and especially its response over the last 6 \nyears.\n  In the weeks following September 11, our country was faced with \nseveral choices. Would we crack under the weight of the tragedy and the \nthreat of the terrorist mindset or would we unite against the idealogy \nof fear and hatred? Would we retreat from a dangerous global terrorism \nor would we work to create a safer world? Over the last 6 years, we \nhave faced terrorism and extremism head on. We have stood firmly \nagainst those who would attack innocent civilians and push an agenda of \nfear. As a result, our country is safer and terrorism is being combated \nacross the world.\n  Of course, we owe a profound debt of gratitude to the brave men and \nwomen of the U.S. military. Their continued service and dedication to \nour country has literally helped to preserve the American way of life, \nand made the world safer, I might add, for everyone. Their strength and \ncourage is an example to all of us, and we should always remember and \nhonor their sacrifices.\n  But the fact is, while we are safer than we were on September 11, \n2001, we are not yet safe. Recent renewed threats from al-Qaida and \narrests of terror suspects in Germany have proven that the danger is \nstill looming for us. Fighting terrorism means we have to be right all \nthe time, while the terrorists only need to be right once. We\n\n[[Page S11357]]\n\nhave to stay on the offensive, taking the fight to the enemy and always \nlooking for ways to improve our national security here at home.\n  Now, yesterday and today, Congress received a report from the general \nin charge of the Multinational Force Iraq, GEN David Petraeus, and from \nour Ambassador to the region, Ambassador Crocker.\n  All of us will recall that when General Petraeus was nominated to \nthis high office as a professional military man, his confirmation came \nto the Senate. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nwas proud to vote for his confirmation in the Armed Services Committee. \nAs you can see by this chart, on January 26, 2007, the Senate \nunanimously confirmed this professional soldier as the head of the \nmultinational forces in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, when General Petraeus's report was received yesterday \nbefore a joint hearing in the House, there was all too common \npartisanship and shrill rhetoric. But, in contrast, this report \nrepresents an honest, nonpartisan assessment of the conditions in Iraq, \nboth political and marshal.\n  You know, the fact is, it bears note that General Petraeus's report, \nalong with Ambassador Crocker's, is exactly aligned with what the \nDirector of National Intelligence issued in August in his report as \nwell as the report of the independent commission created by this \nCongress headed by retired Marine Corps GEN Jim Jones, who testified \njust last week.\n  As a result of these reports, we will now be faced with a choice: \nWill we heed the advice of our generals, particularly in the case of \nGeneral Petraeus, a counterinsurgency expert, unanimously confirmed by \nthe Senate, or will we close our ears and our minds to the facts and \ncave in to special interest groups that claim to know better than our \ndistinguished military leaders?\n  Even before this report was issued by General Petraeus, one such \ngroup began employing a despicable and reprehensible new tactic in \nanticipation of a report which contradicted their ideology. MoveOn.org \nsponsored this ad, which shamefully, despicably appeared in the New \nYork Times, claiming that General Petraeus, this distinguished military \nwarrior, was a traitor and that he would lie in his report.\n  Lest anyone be misled into thinking this is a product merely of an \nindividual organization, MoveOn.org, I would refer my colleagues to an \narticle that appeared in the New York Times magazine on Sunday entitled \n``Can Lobbyists Stop the War?'' What that article pointed out--I would \ncommend it to all of our colleagues--is that an attack such as this is \nnot an isolated event on behalf of an antiwar organization like \nMoveOn.org; it is part of a concerted strategy composed of some 20 \noutside special interest groups consulting with Democrats on the Hill.\n  This organization, as the article reports, does not work only through \nmedia by paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for ads like this; \nthey coordinate extensively with Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the \narticle points out. Mr. Matzzie, who is the head of this organization, \nis actually the Washington, DC, representative of MoveOn.org, and he \nhimself, the article says, meets with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi or Harry \nReid, the Senate majority leader, maybe once a month, he says, adding \nthat he talks to their staffs once a day or at least a couple times a \nweek. In the article, Mr. Crowley notes that senior Democratic aides \nsometimes even join in conference calls. This might entail discussions \nof political strategy or more substantive policy briefings by experts \nfrom the think tanks that are part of these outside interest groups as \npart of this organized, orchestrated effort on behalf of those who want \nto tear down the good name of a distinguished patriot like David \nPetraeus.\n  This smear campaign consisted of an entirely unwarranted and \nfallacious attack and sought to impugn the name of a highly respected \nman of integrity. I have seen this kind of attack before. I suspect all \nof us have at one point or another.\n  But sometimes it is called just simply ``poisoning the well.'' It is \na simple principle: When you cannot refute someone's report, try to \ndiscredit them before they, in fact, even make it. Indeed, Mr. Matzzie, \nthe Washington director of MoveOn.org who heads up the organization \nthat is referred to in the New York Times magazine article entitled \n``Can Lobbyists Stop the War?'' was quoted in Politico as saying this:\n\n       We have to frame his statements before he makes them. He's \n     not St. Petraeus, he's General Petraeus.\n\n  This same article which I mentioned a moment ago quotes an anonymous \nDemocratic Senator:\n\n       No one wants to call Petraeus a liar on national TV. The \n     expectation is that the outside groups will do this for us.\n\n  I hope all of my colleagues in the Senate will join me in condemning \nthese disgraceful attacks against the good name and character of this \ngeneral. Instead of making wild allegations, we ought to actually \nlisten to what he has to say. It is always, I have found, a valuable \ntool to listen to what someone has to say before you try to argue with \nthem.\n  Of course, what he had to say in the House yesterday will be and is \ncurrently being repeated, I expect in large part in the Foreign \nRelations Committee this morning and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee this afternoon. The fact that General Petraeus has reported \nthat these groups find so reprehensible is that we have actually made \nprogress in Iraq in communities or in areas such as Al Anbar Province \nand in other places around the country; Al-Qaida in Iraq is losing \npopularity, and with it they are losing ground.\n  For every person who abandons the doctrines of terrorism, we take \nanother step toward a stable Iraq and a safer America. Unfortunately, \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle, even before General \nPetraeus gave this report and in the face of the National Intelligence \nEstimate and the Jones Commission, denied the fact of violence actually \ngoing down in Iraq.\n  This is just one comment made by the Senator from New York, who said:\n\n       The violence in Anbar has gone down despite the surge, not \n     because of the surge.\n\n  Disclaiming that our 170,000 American uniformed servicemembers in \nIraq have made any difference. The problem is that when you bet against \nthe men and women of the U.S. military, you are going to lose. And \nthose who bet against the U.S. military in claiming that their efforts \nwould have no effect in Iraq have lost that bet because it has, and \nthey just can't seem to handle it.\n  Another statement by the majority leader attempting to undermine the \ncredibility of this general--Senator Reid said:\n\n       General Petraeus has made a number of statements over the \n     years that have not proved to be factual.\n\n  The chair of the House Democratic caucus, Rahm Emanuel, on September \n7, 2007, said:\n\n       We do not need a report that wins a Nobel Prize for \n     creative statistics or the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.\n\n  Suggesting that this general, whom we confirmed just last January by \nunanimous vote, in charge of multinational forces in Iraq would write a \nreport that could be described as ``fiction'' is an insult.\n  We should make no mistake about the fact that success in Iraq is \ninextricably linked to our safety here at home. Let us not forget that \nonly 2 months ago, this Senate overwhelming passed a resolution \ndeclaring the dangers of a failed Iraq state and expressing our intent \nnot to pursue any strategy which might lead to that failure, passed by \na vote of 94 to 3.\n  I agreed with Senator Reid back in January of 2007 when he said:\n\n       Our hope, our prayer is that this President will finally \n     listen, listen to the generals.\n\n  That is what we are asking Senator Reid and our friends on the other \nside of the aisle to do today, is to simply listen to this good man who \nwears the uniform of the U.S. military and give him a fair hearing.\n  We passed the measure I mentioned a moment ago about taking no action \nwhich would likely result in a failed state in Iraq because we \nrecognized that Iraq is the front line in a much larger war, a global \nwar on terrorism.\n  When the Confederate and Union armies met near a small shoe factory \nin Gettysburg, they could not have known that battle would be a turning \npoint in our Civil War. But as we stand now looking at the situation in \nIraq, we must acknowledge that our success or failure there will be a \nturning point, one way or the other, in the global war on terror.\n\n[[Page S11358]]\n\n  Already we have seen Islamic terrorism spread across the globe from \nSyria, Israel, Lebanon, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Jordan, India, \nand Bali. All have suffered from Islamic terrorism. European countries \nsuch as Spain, Great Britain, and most recently Germany have all had to \nface the growing threat of suicide bombers and terrorists. Even here at \nhome recently we have seen two terror plots fail, thank goodness, at \nFort Dix and at JFK Airport.\n  Were we to close our ears and our minds to what General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker have to report and abandon our effort to provide an \nability for the Iraqis to govern and defend themselves, were we to \nleave the region to the hegemony of Iran, an enemy of this Nation which \nis developing nuclear weapons, we would leave not only the Iraqis but \nthe people in the region--indeed, ourselves here at home--at the mercy \nof terrorist organizations and countries that give safe haven to those \nterrorists, a base of operations which would serve as a launching point \nfor further operations into Europe and America. But if we create a \nstable self-sufficient Iraq, we can begin to push back the terrorist \norganizations in the Middle East. We can stop their spread and we can \npush back, just as the American military has in Anbar Province, \nrecruiting local people, the sheiks, the tribes there to be part of the \nfight on our side and to eliminate al-Qaida from that region.\n  Just as transparency is the enemy of corruption, free and stable \nnations are the Achilles' heel of terrorism. Today, 6 years to the day \nfrom when we were first attacked, we must redouble our efforts. We must \ncombat terrorism throughout the world, starting with a liberated, \nsecure Iraq.\n  We should make sure that we give General Petraeus and our troops \neverything they need to win the battle and turn the tide of the larger \nwar, not undermine them by condoning the kind of scurrilous attacks \nreflected in this New York Times advertisement by MoveOn.org.\n  We should also remember that the war on terrorism is more than a \nmilitary engagement; it is a battle of wills which we all fight. Every \nday we meet in this hallowed Chamber, we fight that battle. Every time \nAmericans gather to worship without fear, we fight that battle. Every \nnight when we go home to our families and we find comfort with our \nloved ones, we are fighting that battle. America's determination to \ncontinue our way of life is a powerful statement to the terrorists that \nyou may threaten us, you may attack us, but you will never break the \nAmerican spirit. We will always cherish freedom, and we will always \npursue peace and justice throughout the world.\n  Over the last 6 years, we have had to make many changes in order to \nadapt to this new threat, but one thing will never change: America will \nalways fight against fear and extremism, and we will always stand up \nfor a peaceful, more humane world.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator from Texas essentially through with his \nstatement?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am glad to yield for some questions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator from Texas has completed his statement, \nI will seek recognition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Texas leaves, I \nwish he could put back up the ad in the New York Times yesterday. It \nstrikes me that the Cornyn amendment is an opportunity for Senate \nDemocrats to have their reputation restored. I can't believe that \nSenate Democrats approved of this kind of trash that we have seen in \nthe New York Times in this paid ad last Sunday which, I gather, cost \nover $100,000. This organization, MoveOn.org, is claiming it controls \nthe Democratic Party. I don't believe that is true. But this is what \nthey had to say back in 2004.\n  Someone named Eli Pariser, an employee of MoveOn, talking about the \nDemocratic Party, said:\n\n       Now it's our party. We bought it. We own it. We are going \n     to take it back.\n\n  MoveOn is claiming they control the Democratic Party. If I were a \nDemocratic Senator, I would be offended by MoveOn.org's claim, as \nSenator Cornyn pointed out in his comments, that they communicate on a \nnear-daily basis with senior Democratic Members. Here is a quote:\n\n       I called over there and said ``you guys better have a \n     strategy on this.''\n\n  By ``there,'' Matzzie, who, I guess, is the head of MoveOn.org, meant \nthe offices of Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill with which he or his \nstaff communicate on a near-daily basis. According to Matzzie, Matzzie \nhas personal relationships with several senior Democratic Members of \nCongress.\n  In short, it strikes me, listening to the Senator from Texas and \nreading the article in the New York Times myself Sunday, that this \norganization, this radical leftwing organization is attacking the \npatriotism of General Petraeus with this ad, accusing him, in effect, \nof treason--``Betray Us,'' it says--and is claiming control of our good \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. I don't believe that. I \ndon't believe that for a minute. The Cornyn resolution is an \nopportunity for the Senate to go on record, hopefully unanimously, \nobjecting to this kind of dialog. Certainly, they are free to do \nwhatever they want. It is a free country. The first amendment allows \neveryone to say whatever they please. But you don't have to endorse \nthis kind of nonsense.\n  This organization strikes me as a severe threat to the reputation of \nthe Democratic Party. This is an opportunity the Senator from Texas has \noffered for all of us to go on record in opposition to this outrageous \nand unacceptable ad run in the New York Times on Sunday.\n  ``General Petraeus or General Betray Us?'' What an outrage. Are we \nnot offended by that? Do we not condemn that? This is the opportunity \nfor the Senate, on a broad bipartisan basis, to condemn this outrageous \nad.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for giving us this opportunity. I hope \nwhen this vote occurs, it will be a unanimous expression. Regardless of \nhow we may feel about the war--and I know that is a deeply divisive \nissue in this body; we understand that--some kinds of rhetoric are \nsimply unacceptable. Here we have an outside organization claiming to \nbasically control the Democratic Party. I don't believe they do. If I \nwere a member of the Democratic caucus and sitting on the other side of \nthe aisle in this Chamber, I would be offended by an organization \nclaiming to control me and to speak for me, such as this group \napparently does.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas. It is a perfectly timely amendment, \nas General Petraeus is testifying here in the Senate today and in the \nHouse yesterday. Of course, next week we will be dealing with the Iraq \nissue again. I hope we can discuss it in a typical, responsible Senate \ndebate and not have these extreme organizations on the far left, which \napparently wish for America's defeat, have a disproportionate influence \non this body over the outcome of our debates. We ought to be able to \nrise above that. We have the possibility of doing that. The American \npeople would like for us to do that. They want us to engage in a civil \ndebate about the way forward in Iraq. We will have an opportunity to \ndemonstrate that again next week. I hope we will demonstrate it this \nmorning by overwhelmingly--and hopefully on a unanimous basis--\ncondemning this outrageous ad questioning the patriotism of General \nPetraeus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators who want \nto speak to the pending amendment by the Senator from Texas. The \nSenator from Minnesota has been waiting for some time. I ask unanimous \nconsent to temporarily set aside the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas in order for the Senator from Minnesota to send her amendment to \nthe desk and to speak for a couple of minutes and then to return to the \namendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, once the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota is sent to the desk, spoken on, if my amendment will then \nbecome the pending business, if I understand the request, I have no \nobjection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2816\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk for \nimmediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Ms. Klobuchar], for herself and \n     Mr. Coleman, proposes an amendment numbered 2816.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n (Purpose: To make available amounts authorized to be appropriated for \n   the repair and reconstruction of the Interstate I-35W bridge that \n        collapsed on August 1, 2007, in Minneapolis, Minnesota)\n\n       On page 20, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n\n                 I-35W BRIDGE REPAIR AND RECONSTRUCTION\n\n        For necessary expenses to carry out the project for repair \n     and reconstruction of the Interstate I-35W bridge located in \n     Minneapolis, Minnesota, that collapsed on August 1, 2007, as \n     authorized under section 1(c) of Public Law 110-56 (121 Stat. \n     558), up to $195,000,000, as documented by the Minnesota \n     Department of Transportation to remain available until \n     expended, Provided, That that amount is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 204 of S. Con. Res. \n     21 (110th Congress): Provided further, That the Federal share \n     of the costs of any project funded using amounts made \n     available under this section shall be 100 percent in \n     accordance with section 1(b) of Public Law 110-56 (121 Stat. \n     588).\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I first thank this body for its amazing \nresponse when the bridge collapsed in Minneapolis. Senator Coleman and \nI went there immediately the morning after the bridge collapsed on \nAugust 1 and saw firsthand what happened. I came back and reported the \nbravery of our citizens, the emergency responders immediately diving \nin, people who were off duty coming to the scene, ordinary citizens \nrunning in saving people among shards of steel, among rebar, diving in, \nrisking their own lives. There was a miracle schoolbus there where \nlittle kids could have died. But one man, who didn't even know those \nkids, opened the door and let them out. This is what happened in \nMinnesota that day. Then we returned to this body and worked with our \nfellow Senators. Not one Senator objected to the idea that when a \nFederal bridge falls in the middle of America, we must rebuild it. When \na Federal highway overpass falls in the middle of America, we must \nrebuild it.\n  At that time, when we only had 60 hours to get the authorization for \nthe $250 million that we requested to rebuild that bridge, we were told \nto wait until the dust settled to figure out the details of the \nappropriation. That seemed like a good idea.\n  The dust has settled. We have learned in our State and in our \ncommunity that 13 people died in that tragedy, ordinary people coming \nhome, going to work, people such as Patrick Holmes, who was driving \nhome to his young wife Jennifer and their two children; people such as \nSadiya Sahal, a pregnant nursing student, and her 2-year-old daughter \nHannah, who were headed to a relative's home when the bridge crumbled \nbeneath them. Many people were injured. Many people died. That is what \nhappened when the dust settled.\n  We now have a gaping hole in a major bridge in the middle of \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, a major metropolitan area. Any of our Members, or \nanyone who is listening today, would think about major metropolitan \nareas in their States, if there was suddenly a gaping hole. The bridge \nbasically buckled into the Mississippi River. It is eight blocks from \nmy home, so I see it every day. It is costing an estimated $400,000 a \nday in lost business, lost time. There are a number of other bridges, \nbut they are very small. Traffic has built up.\n  The emergency response from the Federal Government has been strong. \nThe response from the State has been strong. Within 12 hours after this \ntragedy, billboards were up about emergency bus service. People \nresponded in the right way, including the Senate and Congress. But on \nthat day, 60 hours after this happened, a promise was made that we \nwould rebuild that bridge. I appreciated the amendment to build bridges \nand to help repair bridges across this country. I supported it, as did \nmy colleague, Senator Coleman. But we knew this was not the money that \nhad been allocated to fix our bridge in Minnesota.\n  Oftentimes when these tragedies happen, it does lead to help across \nthe country. When we realized that levees needed to be looked at, when \nwe realized that flood control systems needed to be built after the \nGrand Forks flood--a lot of things happen that help other people in the \ncountry, but we always first help the people where the tragedy occurs. \nThat is what our amendment--Senator Coleman is a cosponsor--is about, \nto make sure we fund the bridge repair, that we fix the bridge.\n  A bridge in the middle of America just doesn't fall down. We will get \nto the bottom of what happened. But when it does fall down, we rebuild \nit. We fix it.\n  I thank the Senate for its consideration.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Minnesota a \ncouple questions? Obviously, we are all concerned about this collapse. \nWe know the burden. We want to make sure we provide responsible help \nthat is necessary. Senator Coleman has indicated he wants to speak on \nthe amendment.\n  I would like to know, No. 1, if this includes transit funding in that \n$195 million. Is it emergency highway funds, emergency bridge funds, or \nis it just designated as an emergency that does not come out of any of \nthe existing highway or bridge funds?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. It is my understanding that it is emergency funds. We \ndid get some transit money designated early on. The Secretary of \nTransportation has been very good in working with us. I believe we have \nreceived about $55 million of the $250 million. That is why this \namendment asks for the remaining $195 million to be appropriated. We \nwill work with the Senator's staff on the details. We want to make sure \nwe cross all the t's and dot our i's. But we cannot continue to let \nthis interstate be a gaping hole in the middle of a metropolitan area, \nwhen it is clearly the intent of Congress to fund and authorize the \nmoney. We are simply trying to receive the rest of the funding that \ncould be immediately given to us by the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate that. We need to work with DOT \nto make sure we have the details worked out. I appreciate the Senator \nagreeing to work with us so we can. Senator Coleman wants to be added \nas a cosponsor. We may get further information as we go to conference, \nbut we will try to get this resolved today.\n  If the Senator would add Senator Coleman, I would appreciate that.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Senator Coleman is an original cosponsor of the \noriginal amendment. We made some modifications after speaking with \nSenator Bond and, of course, he would be included in this one as well. \nI also thank Senator Murray for the work she did immediately after this \ndisaster, sending a staff member out to observe the bridge and work \nwith us on getting immediate funding.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Coleman will be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The Democratic whip.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2808\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to return to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak to that amendment, if I \ncould. First, let me stipulate I have said publicly, and believe in my \nheart, GEN David Petraeus is an honorable man who has served this \ncountry with distinction. It has been my good fortune to meet with him \nin Iraq on several occasions, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, when his job was an \nimportant job in training the Iraqi Army, to prepare it to take over \nfor American soldiers. Most recently, in August, I met with General \nPetraeus in Baghdad for 3 hours, and with Ambassador Crocker, over \ndinner. We had a lengthy conversation about the surge, the situation in \nIraq.\n  I never for 1 minute questioned General Petraeus's patriotism, his \ncompetence, and his record of serving America. That is something I am \nhappy to stipulate for the record and I believe is beyond question and \nreproach.\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\n  I will also tell you I voted for General Petraeus to be head of our \nmilitary effort in Iraq and did so without reservation. I believe he is \nextraordinarily competent as a military leader. There are no questions \nto be raised about that.\n  Yesterday, before a joint session of the House Armed Services \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, General Petraeus \nappeared with Ambassador Crocker. The morning news reports suggest \nvirtually every single Member of Congress from both sides of the aisle \npreceded their remarks about General Petraeus's testimony by giving \ncredit and tribute to this man for his service to our Nation.\n  That is why this amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nTexas strikes me as a little unusual, first in that it is being offered \non the Transportation appropriations bill. Someone said, kind of \njokingly: Is it because General Petraeus was transported over American \nhighways to make it to the hearing? It is a good question that is being \nraised here about the general, but it certainly is not a question \nrelative to a Transportation appropriations bill, which includes many \nserious and important issues as well.\n  We just heard a comment from the Senator from Minnesota. I can tell \nyou her concern about her State and the terrible tragedy that occurred \nthere is heartfelt. I am glad on behalf of Senator Coleman and herself \nshe has brought it to our attention. I hope we will take it up, as we \nshould, during the course of debating this bill.\n  Secondly, though, there is a time and place for this debate. It is an \nimportant debate because having conceded all of these important \npersonal qualities of General Petraeus, the fact is I disagree with the \nconclusions he presented to that joint committee yesterday. That, of \ncourse, does not reflect on him personally; it just reflects on the \nfact he and I have a difference of opinion. Differences of opinion are \npretty basic to our style of Government, not only in Congress but among \nthe American people. So for someone to take exception to the remarks of \nGeneral Petraeus is not unusual. In fact, it is expected. That is a \ndebate that characterizes a democracy, a government where we are not \nafraid to stand up and disagree with even people at the highest levels \nof Government, even people who have excellent reputations who can, from \ntime to time, be wrong.\n  I would remind the Senator from Texas it was a gentleman from his own \nState who became Attorney General and recently resigned, after serious \nquestions were raised about his judgment. I did not vote to confirm \nAlberto Gonzales. I had serious doubts about whether he could serve as \nAttorney General, and expressed those doubts during his confirmation \nhearing, during the consideration of his nomination before the vote on \nthe Senate floor, and afterwards, and that is a fact. That is what we \nare here for. That is part of the debate which is part of our American \nconversation. It goes on on the floor of the Senate and the floor of \nthe House.\n  The same was true for Secretary Rumsfeld. I introduced him to the \ncommittee when the President first nominated him to be Secretary of \nDefense, and did so with pride because I had known of his service as a \nCongressman from Illinois. Over the course of several years, I came to \ndisagree with many of his policies and believe he made some serious \nmistakes, for which we are still paying. That kind of disagreement is \nalso part of this debate on Capitol Hill.\n  Now, what the Senator from Texas suggests--and also the Senator from \nKentucky, the minority leader--is that now the Democratic side of the \naisle has to be held accountable for all the critics of General \nPetraeus. In fact, they have gone so far--the Senator from Kentucky \nsaid what we are about here is not a resolution relative to \nMoveOn.org., what we are about is ``restoring the reputation of the \nDemocratic Party.'' He went on to say the actions of this organization \nare ``a severe threat to the reputation of the Democratic Party.''\n  Perhaps the Senator from Kentucky overstated a little bit. When the \norganization ran a full-page ad, I did not notice at the bottom \nanything that said ``endorsed and approved by the Democratic National \nCommittee.'' Organizations make their statements, stand by their words, \nand are held accountable for those. Occasionally, there is a poor \nchoice of words. I think in this particular ad there was a poor choice \nof words to suggest there was any betrayal involved in the testimony of \nGeneral Petraeus. But I might remind my colleague and friend from \nTexas, even the best of us can occasionally get tangled up in a poor \nchoice of words. It has happened to both of us on the floor of the \nSenate. That is a fact. Occasionally you have to stand up and say: I \ndid not quite mean it the way it sounded.\n  Well, let me say at this point, if we are going to be held \naccountable for every organization that opposes the war and the \nlanguage they use, if the Democratic Party has to come to the floor and \nbe asked up or down to vote on every comment and phrase made, it is a \nstandard that might consume a lot of time in the Senate.\n  I do not recall a legion of Republican Senators filing in here to \ncomplain about Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. In the middle of that \nPresidential campaign, John Kerry, a decorated Vietnam war hero, had \nhis reputation attacked and criticized by a Texas organization, the \nSwift Boat Veterans for Truth, that suggested he was not deserving of \nthe combat decorations which he received. I thought their attack was an \noutrage. Most Americans felt the same. We understand many men and women \nhave risked their lives and given their blood in service to this \ncountry and received recognition from our Government, which they \ndeserved. To have the scurrilous attacks from the Swift Boat Veterans \nfor Truth, I thought, was an outrage. I do not recall resolutions on \nthis side of the aisle saying: Well, now, the Republican Party has to \nrepudiate those.\n  But if this is going to be our stock in trade now--instead of dealing \nwith issues such as rebuilding the bridge in Minneapolis, instead of \nfacing the reality of bridges across America that are dangerous, \ninstead of dealing with highway funds that are critically important--we \nare going to set all that aside and ask, first, the Democrats and then \nthe Republicans to respond to every ad that is published in the \nnewspaper, then we better set up a special committee to deal with that. \nIt would be the ``Committee on Headlines,'' I guess. We could have a \nbipartisan group and each day have a list of headlines we all object \nto, and then vote on them on a regular basis.\n\n  Is that why we are here? Is that why we were elected? Do we set aside \nthe Transportation bill for America to deal with an ad purchased by a \nprivate organization? I do not think so.\n  Let me say I think it was a poor choice of words in that ad. I do not \nsubscribe to that point of view about betrayal at all. I will defend \nthe right of that organization and others to speak up against the war \nor for the war, whatever their position might be. That happens to be \npart of the American opportunity, to stand up and speak your mind, \nwhatever it may be. To take the time of the Senate, on a regular basis, \nto come through here and to hold us accountable for purchased \nadvertising by organizations will become a full-time job.\n  Now, before I close, let me say this: I do not believe this amendment \nis germane. If the Senator wants to offer it on some other bill, in \nsome other context, that is his choice, if he wants to do it that way. \nBut I wish to get back to the business of the Transportation bill.\n  But before I leave the floor, let me make it clear I disagree with \nthe conclusions of General Petraeus. I have been there. I have met with \nhim. I have seen it. It is true the surge is buying us at least \ntemporary security benefits in some parts of Iraq, but the general has \nsaid, and many others have said, we will never win this war militarily. \nIt has to be won by the Iraqi Government making important political \ndecisions to bring their country together and to stabilize Iraq. No \nmatter how many soldiers we send in, that political responsibility will \nstill be there, and even the most optimistic fans of the Bush \nadministration could not say at this moment in time there is a \ngovernment of national unity in Iraq. There is not.\n  For all of the lives that have been offered up by Americans--3,774 of \nour best and bravest who have died as of this day in this war in Iraq; \n27,186 who have been wounded--the fact is the political situation in \nIraq is a disaster.\n\n[[Page S11361]]\n\nEven with the additional surge troops, it is a disaster. For General \nPetraeus to suggest he will try to bring home the surge forces--\n30,000--by some time next year, from this Senator's point of view, is \nnot good enough. That will not move the Iraqis forward to accept \nresponsibility for their own country, to accept responsibility for \ntheir own defense.\n  So though I respect General Petraeus, and will continue to respect \nhim, I respectfully disagree with the conclusions he reached before \nthat joint committee in the House yesterday. That is my right. It is \nthe right of every American. If people, in disagreeing, make a poor \nchoice of words, an unfortunate choice of words, I am not going to be \nstanding here and defending them. But I will stand and defend the right \nof every American to question and challenge this Government and its \npolicies. That is not a reflection on the general's good work or on the \nfine contribution by the men and women in uniform.\n  I hope this amendment offered by the Senator from Texas is found not \nto be germane to this Transportation bill, and I hope we can return to \nthe important business of that bill soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before I respond to the distinguished \nmajority whip, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Inhofe, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, be added as an original cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. He is on the amendment now.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I always enjoy listening to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois. He is one of the most gifted speakers in the Senate, and \nhe is a brilliant lawyer. We serve together on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I agree with him that sometimes people say things they later regret. \nHe is right, both of us have been in that barrel, and we have asked for \nforgiveness. Hopefully--I do believe, actually, we have received that. \nBut I do think he protests too much.\n  This simple amendment--which would take us 15 minutes to vote on, if \nallowed to do so--has to do with more than just a simple disagreement \nwith what General Petraeus has said. This is a direct attack, impugning \nthe character of this distinguished member of the U.S. Army. It is not \nsimply a poor choice of words.\n  The Senator from Illinois said: I do not subscribe to that point of \nview. If we would have an opportunity to vote on my amendment, his vote \nin favor of my amendment would, in fact, confirm what he has already \nsaid on the floor--that it is a poor choice of words and he does not \nsubscribe to that point of view.\n  At the same time he asked: We are on the Transportation \nappropriations bill. Why are we talking about this now? Well, frankly, \nthere are a lot of people who think the global war on terrorism and our \nsuccess or failure in Iraq are just as important--I would submit more \nimportant--than an appropriations bill. But the fact of the matter is, \nwe could do both, and we could get this amendment voted on in rather \nshort order.\n  So I do think this amendment is timely. General Petraeus testified \nyesterday before a joint committee of the Armed Services Committee and \nForeign Relations Committee in the House. He is testifying, even as we \nspeak, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and will testify \nthis afternoon before the Senate Armed Services Committee. I think this \nis a timely matter, where we should express our strongest repudiation \nof the kind of despicable attack on the character of this good man that \nthis ad represents.\n  This ad reportedly cost roughly $160,000 in the New York Times by \nMoveOn.org. I have already spoken to the coordination between these \noutside groups--including MoveOn.org, reported in the New York Times \nSunday magazine in an article entitled ``Can Lobbyists Stop the War?'' \ntalking about regular consultation and coordination between these \noutside groups and Democrats on the Hill.\n  I agree with the distinguished Republican leader, Senator McConnell. \nThis is a way for our friends on the other side of the aisle to show \nsome separation between the irresponsible rhetoric of these groups, \nsuch as MoveOn.org, and their own position.\n  All I am asking is that the distinguished majority whip--who has \nalready said this is a poor choice of words and that he doesn't \nsubscribe to that point of view--allow the amendment to be voted on, \nand by voting for the amendment, he will basically confirm what he has \nalready said on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have about 26 hours left to complete \nthe Transportation and Housing Subcommittee appropriations bill. Our \nmajority leader has already said we are going to return to a debate on \nIraq next week, a very few days away from now.\n  I have a great deal of respect for General Petraeus, but I would \nremind my colleagues this is the Transportation appropriations bill \nwhich we are attempting to complete and the amendment before us has \nnothing to do with that subject matter. Therefore, in accordance with \nthe point of order established by Senator Lott when he was majority \nleader, I now make a point of order against the amendment, that it is a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment which is not germane to the \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the precedent of May 17, \n2000, the Chair must rule on the germaneness of sense-of-the-Senate \namendments to appropriations bills. The Chair finds this amendment is \nnot germane. The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am disappointed the Senator from \nWashington has chosen to make a point of order against this timely \namendment. This amendment is not delaying the underlying bill, contrary \nto the distinguished Senator's statements and the statements of the \nmajority whip.\n  We are prepared to set a vote on this amendment at any time this \nweek. I understand the rules of precedence, and I am certain we have \nconsidered other amendments previously when similar points of order \ncould have been made and the Senate chose not to raise the point of \norder. It is not self-executing; someone must raise it. It appears the \nother side believes the Senate should not speak on this, what I believe \nis the most important issue today. Again, we are prepared to set an \nimmediate vote and move on to other issues.\n  Having said that, I will alert my colleagues that the Senate will \nspeak on this issue at some point. We will come back and the Senate \nwill weigh in on this despicable ad.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by \nthe two leaders today, the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of \na resolution, the text of which is the exact language of the amendment \nwhich I have offered. Further, I ask unanimous consent that if the \nresolution is agreed to, the preamble be agreed to and a motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Before the Chair rules, this unanimous consent request allows us to \nconsider the language outside the Transportation appropriations bill, \nand I would hope there would be no objection to this.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the majority leader has said, we are \ngoing to return to the Iraq debate within a few days. We are trying to \nwork our way through a very difficult Transportation bill today and, \ntherefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to make general comments on the \nlegislation that is before us today--the Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008.\n  This legislation provides critical funding for our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure and supports programs that are essential \nto creating vibrant neighborhoods and communities throughout the United \nStates. I particularly wish to commend Senator\n\n[[Page S11362]]\n\nMurray and Senator Bond for their leadership on this very important \nlegislation. They have been long-time supporters not only of \nTransportation projects but also the Housing and Urban Development \nprojects inherent in this bill.\n  We are all aware of the Nation's aging infrastructure. Senator \nKlobuchar pointed out very eloquently the terrible situation in \nMinnesota with the collapse of the bridge over I-35. This bill provides \n$40 billion to the Federal-aid Highways Program and helps State and \nlocal governments maintain bridges, build roads, reduce congestion, and \nimprove air quality. The funding level of $631 million more than the \nadministration requested and more than $1.13 billion than what was \nprovided in 2007. Frankly, even this robust amount is probably not \nadequate to deal with the crises we face across this country.\n  After the tragedy in Minnesota, every State looked very closely at \ntheir bridges and their roadways, and it turns out that in my State of \nRhode Island we have one of the highest percentages of structurally \ndeficient and functionally obsolete bridges in the country. We need \nresources, but we are not alone. Every State in this Nation needs these \nresources. This bill is very critical in responding to that need. \nAgain, I commend Senator Murray and Senator Bond for doing that, and I \nparticularly commend Senator Murray for her amendment yesterday \nincreasing the allocation for this type of work on bridges with an \nadditional $1 billion. The Transportation provisions in this \nlegislation are critically important to the future of the country.\n\n  The other important part of the legislation is the Housing and Urban \nDevelopment programs. Here again, we have to be terribly concerned \nabout what is going on in the United States. We are all aware of the \nunfolding subprime mortgage crisis. We are aware of the fact that many \nindividuals are already suffering foreclosure because of the exotic \nmortgages. It is also rippling over into our larger financial \ninstitutions in terms of a liquidity crisis. These are huge problems \nthe economy is facing and facing them with great difficulty over the \nlast several weeks. But what is happening and what will happen over the \nnext several weeks is the fact that many additional subprime mortgages \nwill reset their interest, and everyone is projecting and looking \nforward to additional pressure on home loans.\n  One of the important aspects of the legislation before us is that \nthis legislation includes $150 million for housing counseling \nassistance that will help address some of these subprime foreclosure \nproblems by allowing not-for-profit groups to reach out to people \nfacing foreclosure and give them help and assistance and act as an \nintermediary between the financial institution and the borrower. This \nis very important, very timely, and I hope we move aggressively to pass \nthis legislation as a result.\n  The bill also provides $16.6 billion for the Section 8 accounts. We \nall understand that Section 8 is a vital component of our housing for \nour elderly and housing for low-income Americans. Without this, we are \nliterally going to force people out of safe, secure, affordable housing \nthey have today because the bulk of this money goes to maintain those \nindividuals who are in subsidized housing today. So many of them are \nseniors, low-income seniors. This is the least we can do. I am \nparticularly proud to support the $75 million Senator Murray has \nincluded for the Veterans Affairs Supported Housing Program. This is a \nnew incremental voucher program that would be jointly funded by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and HUD to provide Section 8 vouchers \nfor homeless veterans. There is nothing more deplorable, if you want to \ntalk about deplorable then leaving veterans homeless. What about the \nthousands of veterans, combat veterans in this country who are living \non the streets? We had a hearing, and a gentleman from Durham, NC, \ntalked about the veterans program he is running. We have veterans of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States who are living behind the bicycle \nrack at the local Kinkos because they can't get housing. So if you want \nto talk about a shame and an insult to America's men and women in \nuniform, look closely at how we are treating some of these homeless \nveterans. This bill at least attempts to try to reverse that. I am \npleased we are providing $1.6 billion for overall homeless assistance \ngrants because we have a large population of homeless Americans who \ndeserve help and assistance.\n  There is an additional grant for a pilot program of $25 million to \ngive the Secretary of HUD the ability to put a program together that \nwill provide for rapid rehousing of homeless families. Homelessness at \none point was perceived as a problem of principally men on the street; \nperhaps stretches back to our--not nostalgic but our recollection of \nthe hoboes of the Great Depression moving around without homes. Today, \nhomelessness is a family problem in this country, and this program can \nprovide hope--limited resources but a matrix, if you will, to help \nthese families move forward.\n  This legislation also provides additional funding for the Public \nHousing Capital Fund and the Public Housing Operating Fund. We have to \nhelp our cities and municipalities that are running public housing to \nmaintain the facilities and to operate these facilities.\n  There is also another issue that is important and that is lead \nabatement. Senator Bond has been a particular champion, along with \nSenator Mikulski, on lead abatement problems throughout this country. \nThis legislation reflects his interest, his concern, and his commitment \nto helping communities deal with lead abatement. It also deals I think \nvery effectively with the Community Development Block Grant funding \nwhich is so necessary to all our local leaders. This bill represents \nwise policy and robust funding beyond the President's request. I hope \nvery sincerely the President will not carry out his threats to veto \nthis bill. This bill addresses infrastructure problems and housing \nproblems. It goes to what makes this country work: the economic \ninfrastructure of highways and bridges and the human infrastructure of \nhomes and housing and community development.\n  This is legislation that I, again, commend Senators Murray and Bond \nfor developing, and I thank them and their staffs for their great work. \nI hope we can, this evening or tomorrow, go to final passage and send \nthis bill forward for enactment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. He \nhas been a very effective advocate on housing and the wide range of \ntopics he has discussed. His assistance and support for the bill is \nvery important. We work with him on many issues and appreciate the \nopportunity to do so.\n  Yesterday, we had some very interesting discussions. I am sorry the \nSenator from North Dakota is not here, but I am hoping he will perhaps \nbe watching because I do have some answers to the questions he raised \nabout the Department of Transportation's inspector general report. The \nfirst thing he asked was how could the Department of Transportation--\nthe DOT--act so quickly when they received the IG report on Thursday \nnight, September 6, and came out with their truck order for the pilot \nprogram on Friday, September 7. Well, the fact is that the DOT, similar \nto Congress, had been fully briefed on the contents of the report on \nAugust 27. I think everybody who is familiar with audits knows that \nbefore the audit is released, there is an audit conference and the \nauditee--in this case the DOT--gets an opportunity to comment on it. \nThe report that the DOT issued was based on the inspector general's \ndraft.\n  We were able to confirm--they were able to confirm they felt they had \ncomplied with the concerns raised by the inspector general.\n  Specifically, on the inspection of every truck, every time, the IG \nsaid that as of July, the DOT didn't have a plan in place with DHS to \nmake sure Customs and Border Protection checked all the trucks. Since \nthat time, however, DOT has executed agreements with Customs and Border \nProtection so every truck, every time is checked. That is departmental \npolicy, rather than a statutory requirement, but that is what is being \ndone.\n  The third item: It was alleged that DOT does not have independent \naccess to accident, driver's license, and other data if it is not \nvoluntarily provided by\n\n[[Page S11363]]\n\nthe motor carrier. DOT tells us that is not true. Motor carriers who \nwant to participate in the program willingly and promptly turn over all \nrecords pertaining to their proposed operation. If the Federal Motor \nCarriers Agency feels there is a need for more indepth data, the \nMexican Government will provide it. That is exactly the same process \nthat is in place for Canadian carriers, Canadian drivers who come from \nnorth of the border.\n  There was a question about State enforcement and DOT has addressed \nthat. The Federal Motor Carriers Agency has developed a significant \nprogram to train State officials on the enforcement where FMCSA \nofficials are not available, and it would include testing English \nlanguage proficiency.\n  Having covered that, I think it might be useful for our colleagues to \nknow there is some strong support for allowing these trucks to run in \nthe United States. I had a letter that was e-mailed to me, and I assume \nto others, today. It is actually dated June 6; I think it is one they \nhad previously issued. But it says:\n\n       The undersigned U.S. food and agriculture groups are deeply \n     disturbed by congressional efforts to block the 14-year-old \n     commitment of the North American Free Trade Agreement to \n     allow Mexican and U.S. trucks to deliver international \n     cargoes . . .\n\n  And they state:\n\n       These efforts imperil U.S. food and agriculture exports, \n     which have grown dramatically under the NAFTA, and could \n     inflict serious harm on U.S. farmers, ranchers, and \n     agribusinesses.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The NAFTA is a huge success story for U.S. farmers and \n     ranchers. U.S. exports of food and agricultural products to \n     Mexico have tripled under the NAFTA, climbing from $3.6 \n     billion in 1993 to $10.9 billion in 2006. Mexico is now the \n     top-value export market for U.S. beef, dairy, rice, corn \n     sweeteners, soybean meal, soybean oil, apples and dry edible \n     beans and the second largest for U.S. pork, corn, poultry, \n     soybeans and a stable and reliable market for U.S. cotton.\n\n  They go on to talk about how this action is unwarranted. It would \nsignal to the world that the United States is willing unilaterally to \nrenegotiate terms of existing trade agreements. Secondly, they say it \nenhances the likelihood that Mexico will likewise disregard commitments \nthat it made in the NAFTA, such as terminating the remaining tariffs on \nAmerican agricultural exports, and it notes that Mexico could legally \nretaliate against the United States and retaliate against U.S. exports \nto Mexico. That is why Mexico's U.S. Ambassador correctly calls this a \npowerful symbol of the state of our bilateral relations.\n  I think that if you will humor me for just a minute, I want to tell \nyou who is behind this letter. For anybody who has agricultural \ninterests in your State, the people supporting it are the American \nBakers Association; the Cotton Shippers; Farm Bureau Federation; Frozen \nFood Institute; Meat Institute; Soybean Association; Corn Refiners \nAssociation; International Dairy Foods; National Barley Growers; \nCattlemen's Beef Association; Chicken Council; Corn Growers; Milk \nProducers; Oilseed Processors; Pork Producers Council; Potato Council; \nSorghum Producers; Turkey Federation; North American Equipment Dealers; \nNorth American Export Grain Association; American Millers' Association; \nProduce Marketers; Sweetener Users; Fertilizer Institute; U.S. Apple \nAssociation; Dairy Export Council; Wheat Associates; Dry Bean Council; \nHide, Skin and Leather Association; Dry Pea and Lentil Council; and the \nRice Federation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 6, 2007.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned U.S. food and \n     agriculture groups are deeply disturbed by congressional \n     efforts to block the 14-year-old commitment in the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to allow Mexican and \n     U.S. trucks to deliver international cargoes throughout each \n     other's territories. These efforts imperil U.S. food and \n     agriculture exports, which have grown dramatically under the \n     NAFTA, and could inflict serious financial harm on U.S. \n     farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses.\n       The NAFTA is a huge success story for U.S. farmers and \n     ranchers. U.S. exports of food and agricultural products to \n     Mexico have tripled under the NAFTA, climbing from $3.6 \n     billion in 1993 to $10.9 billion in 2006. Mexico is now the \n     top-value export market for U.S. beef, dairy, rice, corn \n     sweeteners, soybean meal, soybean oil, apples and dry edible \n     beans and the second largest for U.S. pork, corn, poultry, \n     soybeans and a stable reliable market for U.S. cotton.\n       We are concerned that Congress has delayed implementation \n     of a modest demonstration program for cross-border trucking \n     with a provision recently attached to the Iraq supplemental \n     spending bill. Of paramount concern, however, are H.R. 1773, \n     which was passed by the House and referred to the Senate \n     Commerce Committee, and rumored plans to attach a similar \n     measure to appropriations bills in both chambers. H.R. 1773 \n     effectively rewrites the NAFTA by stripping the \n     Administration of authority to operate anything but a limited \n     test program for three years.\n       Supporters of this proposed legislation contend that they \n     are concerned about highway safety. But Mexico has always \n     agreed that its trucks and drivers will have to comply with \n     all U.S. safety standards. Indeed, the demonstration program \n     requires that U.S. inspectors examine and clear all Mexican \n     trucks on-site in Mexico before any can participate--a step \n     we do not require for trucks driving through our nation from \n     Canada, our other NAFTA partner, or, for that matter, for \n     U.S. trucks.\n       If implemented, the legislation would create a number of \n     serious problems:\n       First, it would signal to the world that the United States \n     is willing to unilaterally renegotiate the terms of an \n     existing trade agreement.\n       Second, it enhances the likelihood that Mexico will \n     likewise disregard commitments that it made in the NAFTA. \n     There is significant unrest in Mexico over the termination of \n     remaining Mexican tariffs which are scheduled under the NAFTA \n     to be removed on January 1, 2008. Although Mexico's \n     government has reaffirmed its commitment to implement these \n     NAFTA obligations, it is under immense political pressure to \n     disregard some NAFTA provisions--in particular, provisions \n     regarding food and agriculture. Such action by Mexico could \n     have devastating effects on U.S. farm exports to Mexico.\n       Third, Mexico could legally retaliate against the United \n     States on the trucking issue. A NAFTA dispute-settlement \n     panel unanimously ruled in 2001 that the blanket exclusion of \n     Mexican trucking firms from the United States violated U.S. \n     obligations under the NAFTA.\n       Mexico was authorized to retaliate against about $2 billion \n     in U.S. imports. Fortunately, to date, Mexico has refrained \n     from retaliating against the United States. Unless Congress \n     stops preventing implementation of the cross-border trucking \n     program--which Mexico's U.S. ambassador correctly calls ``a \n     powerful symbol of the state of our bilateral relations''--we \n     fear that Mexico may retaliate and that U.S. food and \n     agriculture will be the hardest-hit sector. That would \n     seriously harm U.S. farmers, ranchers and food companies and \n     reverse the vital gains that U.S. agriculture has achieved \n     because of the NAFTA.\n       The Mexican government is resisting broad domestic \n     pressures to keep its word on the NAFTA. We strongly urge you \n     to honor the cross-border trucking commitments the United \n     States has made to Mexico.\n       Sincerely,------.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read this because if \nthey are concerned about what NAFTA has done for U.S. agriculture, I \nthink this is a fairly impressive list of agricultural associations, \ntouching almost every facet of American agriculture, that see the \namendment pending on the floor as a great threat to the trade that \nkeeps agriculture strong and provides revenue farm families in rural \ncommunities need throughout America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on August 2, 2007, by a vote of 83 to 14, \nthe Senate approved S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act \nof 2007, clearing that measure for the President. When that is signed \nby the President, this ethics reform legislation will significantly \nimprove the transparency and accountability of the legislative process.\n  While the President hasn't yet signed that legislation, I wish to \nassure Senators that we intend to abide by the requirements of that \nlegislation during the consideration of this bill. The legislation \nrequires that the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction certify \nthat certain information related to congressionally directed spending \nbe identified and that the required information be available on a \npublicly accessible congressional Web site in a searchable format at \nleast 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill. The information \nrequired includes identification of the congressionally directed \nspending and the name of the Senator who requested such spending. This \ninformation is contained in the committee report numbered 110-131, \ndated\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\nJuly 16, 2007, and has been available on the Internet now for 8 weeks.\n  In addition, pursuant to standards established by Chairman Byrd and \nSenator Cochran for consideration of the fiscal year 2008 bills, \nletters from each Member with the congressionally directed spending \nitem in this bill or accompanying report are available on the Internet \ncertifying that neither the Senator nor his or her spouse has a \npecuniary interest in such spending item.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a certification by the \nchairman of the Committee on Appropriations printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows: \n\n       Senator Byrd: I certify that the information that will be \n     required by S. 1, when it becomes law, related to \n     congressionally directed spending, has been identified in the \n     Committee report numbered 110-131, filed on July 16, 2007, \n     and that the required information has been available on a \n     publicly accessible congressional website in a searchable \n     format at least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their hard work \non this bill. As the tragedy in Minnesota showed, priorities are \nimportant.\n  I notice Senator Bond referred earlier to the IG's report I had \nrequested on the Department of Transportation.\n  I must thank both the inspector general and Secretary Peters for \ntheir forthrightness and plain-spokenness in this report. The report is \npretty significant. I wish to spend a few minutes talking about it.\n  First, I want to show the American people the significance of where \nwe stand on the National Highway System. This doesn't have anything to \ndo with States; this is national highways--designated national highways \nor interstate highways--in terms of the structurally deficient bridges \nin this country. This is from the U.S. Department of Transportation. \nThese are not my numbers. As you can see on this chart, throughout the \ncountry--and it is emphasized in the most populous States, with the \nexception of Florida--we have significant problems when it comes to \nbridges. I contend that it is not necessarily too low of a gas tax that \nhas created this; it has been a lack of priority.\n  I have several amendments I plan to offer to this bill. However, I \nwill probably limit those if my overall first amendment passes.\n  There were several key points that the IG made and the Secretary of \nCommerce commented on when it comes to earmarks. Probably the most \nimportant of those is that earmarks, when they are made, don't fully \naccount for the cost of those earmarks. As a matter of fact, the IG \nfound substantial reduction in all of the other programs throughout the \nDepartment of Transportation because of the underallocation of the \nmoneys necessary to complete an earmark.\n  What does that mean? It means that when we put an earmark in--\nauthorized or unauthorized--and we say it costs $100, what the \nDepartment of Transportation is finding is that often it doesn't cost \n$100; because it is mandated by law, we spend $150. That $50 goes out \nof the rest of the programs at the Department of Transportation; \ntherefore, it cuts. They talked about this as overearmarking, not in \nterms of the numbers but earmarking a result without putting in the \ndollars to do it. I think there is a comment on one of these charts out \nof the IG's report which states just that.\n  Here is another chart. It says:\n\n       99 percent of the earmarks reviewed by the inspector \n     general bypassed merit review.\n\n  What does that mean? That means had they not been earmarked, they \nwould not have been a priority in a State transportation project and \nwould not have met a priority of the standards the DOT has on highways \nand bridges--there are five. Only 1 percent of the earmarks placed in \nthe appropriations bill actually pass or meet merit review. The very \nthing our States do is sit up and say: This is how we want to \nprioritize spending in our States for safety and infrastructure in \nterms of transportation. These are not my words; these are the IG's \nwords from the Department of transportation:\n\n       7,724 out of 7,760 transportation earmarks in 2006 were not \n     subject to the agency's priority ranking, review, or \n     selection process, or bypassed the States' normal planning \n     and program processes.\n\n  So it comes back to the point, why don't we have all these bridges \ninspected, and why did we see a tragedy in Minnesota? It is because we \nfailed; the bridge didn't fail. We failed to put in the proper amount \nof money, and we failed to put priorities on what is most important for \nour transportation sector.\n  Here is the next chart. Here is another point the IG made:\n\n       Recent Department of Transportation reauthorizations have \n     included a significant number of specific projects with \n     associated funding directed to specific State and local \n     agencies or locations. For example, the current Department of \n     Transportation authorization for surface transportation \n     accounted for 6,474 of the Department of Transportation's \n     8,056 earmarked projects for FY2006.\n\n  We are taking money away from the priorities the States and \nDepartment of Transportation have that are out there and are \ntransparent, and we are moving them away. That means there is less \nmoney for the tremendous number of bridges that are structurally \ndeficient right now in our highway system.\n  How do we solve that? How do we meet the needs? The State of North \nCarolina has somebody up here full time to make sure that when an \nearmark is requested, it meets the State's guidelines. The State \nDepartment of Transportation of North Carolina has to lobby its own \nmembers to make sure the requests are within the guidelines of the \npriorities of the State of North Carolina.\n  How did we get to the point that we disconnect priorities to the fact \nthat we want to help a certain group that is outside the priorities of \nour State but inside the priorities of our political purposes? I think \nwe need to reexamine what we are doing. I think we need to \nreprioritize.\n  The fact is that a lot has been said about the tragedy that happened \nin Minnesota. I honestly believe President Reagan was right in 1982 \nwhen he vetoed a Transportation bill that had 11 earmarks. His point \nwas that these take away from the priorities. Those 11 earmarks have \ngrown to over 8,000 now. So each year, we have lessened the priorities \nof safety and efficient transportation to help us politically.\n  Better planning and prioritization of existing transportation funds \ncould improve road safety and bridge safety. Realize that 13,000 people \na year in this country die because of inadequate or poor-quality \nroads--Federal roads, not State roads. What are some of the things we \ndo with transportation dollars? We build transportation museums, we \nbuild bike paths, we build parking garages. We have multitudes of \nearmarks that are anything except a priority for safety for \ntransportation in this country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2810\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 2810.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to setting aside \nthe pending amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2810.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, what is amendment No. 2810?\n  Mr. COBURN. This amendment is an earmark moratorium until all bridges \nare repaired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2810.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit funds appropriated under title I from being used \nfor earmarks until all structurally deficient and functionally obsolete \n          bridges have been repaired, with limited exceptions)\n\n       On page 70, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 194. (a) Except as provided under subsection (b), none \n     of the funds appropriated or\n\n[[Page S11365]]\n\n     otherwise made available under this title may be used for any \n     earmark until all bridges in the United States that are \n     classified under the Federal Highway Administration's bridge \n     inspection program, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, as ``structurally deficient'' or ``functionally \n     obsolete'' have been sufficiently repaired to no longer meet \n     the criteria for such classifications.\n       (b) Funds appropriated under this title may be used for an \n     earmark that is designated to repair--\n       (1) a bridge that is classified as ``structurally \n     deficient'' or ``functionally obsolete''; or\n       (2) a road with ride quality that is not classified as \n     ``good'' or ``acceptable''.\n       (c) In this section, the term ``earmark'' means a provision \n     or report language providing, authorizing, or recommending a \n     specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit \n     authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, \n     loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure \n     with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, \n     locality or Congressional district, other than through a \n     statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive \n     award process.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what does this amendment do? This \namendment does not get rid of earmarks. What this amendment does is it \ndelays earmarks. What it says is that for all the earmarks we have had, \nboth authorized and through the appropriations process, unless they are \ngoing to build and fix structurally deficient bridges in this country, \nor they are going to improve a highway that brings it up to standards, \nthat makes it safe, we ought to delay the implementation of those \nearmarks until we have solved this problem.\n  How many more bridges have to collapse until we get the message? How \nmany more people have to die until we get the message? The Minnesota \nbridge that collapsed was noticed in 1990 as being structurally \ndeficient. In 1999, the State department of transportation in Minnesota \nsaid there needs to be a priority on this bridge, and yet we did not \nrespond.\n  The earmark that should have been made was for the repairs for that \nbridge, and yet they were not made.\n  This amendment is very simple. I know it goes against the grain of a \nlot of the processes we use, but it makes common sense that if we are \ngoing to forego another Minnesota tragedy, we have to change our \npriorities.\n  All this amendment says is the priorities ought to be the safety of \nthe American people and quality so that 13,000 people do not die this \nnext year on roads that are not within the quality classified as \n``good'' or ``acceptable.'' All we do is say let's put our priority \nwhere it needs to be right now. Let's set the priority for making sure \nthere is not another Minnesota.\n  My State leads the Nation in the percentage of bridges that are \nclassified as deficient. Oklahoma, as a State, has never received back \nwhat it has paid in to the transportation fund. As a matter of fact, \nthere is over $1.8 million that we have paid in that we never received \nback. But we have disproportionately shared that in other areas. My \nState does not begrudge this point. The fact is, our State is small \ncompared to the Northeast and the west coast in terms of structurally \ndeficient bridges.\n  The point ought to be: How do we change the priority, how do we \nrespond to the concerns of the American people over what, in fact, has \nto be the right priorities for transportation?\n  A couple of actions can be taken on this amendment. We can vote it \ndown, and we can say safety and bridges and safe roads are not a \npriority, but museums and bike trails and theaters and parking garages \nare because they help us politically. Or we can adopt this amendment \nand send a message to the American people that: We hear you, we \nunderstand what you are saying, and we agree that your safety ought to \noutperform and be above our political necessities and our directed \nspending.\n  This does not limit any directed spending for any of these bridges or \nany of the Federal highways that will move them to good or acceptable. \nSo in terms of transportation, it will not eliminate anything that is \nimportant to our safety, important to repairing the infrastructure in \nthis country.\n  The third action that can be taken on this amendment is that we can \npass this amendment, and because it is not liked, it will get trashed \nin conference. So we can all look good by voting for this amendment, \nbut if we do not insist on this amendment when we get to conference, we \nwill have winked and nodded to the American people again. We would have \nbrought our numbers down by not paying attention to what their concerns \nare. And, most importantly, we will keep American drivers and \npedestrians and passengers at risk.\n  I hope the chair and ranking member will agree to this amendment, \nwill accept it, and fight for it in conference. I believe we should \nvote on this amendment. This is an amendment we ought to have a vote on \nin the Senate. I believe it is about time we start getting our \npriorities right.\n  I yield the floor for the present time and wish to speak on this \namendment later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I always enjoy a discussion with our \ncolleague and neighbor from the State of Oklahoma. His comments that \nearmarks have caused bridge deficiencies and tragedies is a bridge too \nfar. I believe as well-intentioned as this amendment is, it fails to \nunderstand how the States go about rehabilitating their bridges and \nmaintaining the bridges in their States.\n  There are many points I can make about this amendment, but I think it \nis important to note that according to the conditions and needs report \nof the Department of Transportation in 2006, we need to invest \napproximately $12.4 billion annually to eliminate the existing backlog \nand correct other deficiencies, and we are currently spending over $10 \nbillion a year.\n  As Secretary Mary Peters said in testimony on September 5 before the \nHouse Transportation Committee, the number of structurally deficient \nbridges has been declining significantly from 18.7 percent in 1994 to \n12.0 percent now. Obviously, that is still too much, but it is not just \ndeficient bridges.\n  As I pointed out yesterday, we have tremendous highway safety needs. \nThe Chair and I and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nCommittee, the THUD Committee, held a hearing on highway fatalities. We \nkill about 43,000 people a year on our highways. We went back and asked \nthe Department of Transportation how many people were actually killed \non bridges, either bridges that collapsed or bridges that were too \nnarrow. Over a 5-year period, it came out to about 400. We kill 400 \npeople a year on bridges, and roughly 43,000 on highways.\n\n  Why is this important? As the occupant of the chair, my colleague \nfrom Missouri, knows, we have done a study of what causes highway \nfatalities. Our Missouri Department of Transportation has estimated \nthat approximately one-third of the deaths on our highways are caused \nby inadequate highways, outmoded, old-fashioned highways. We have two-\nlane highways that are carrying traffic that should be on four lanes. \nThose two-lane traffic jams get people to take unnecessary chances.\n  When we are talking about the problems of safety, we cannot forget \nthe fact that the biggest safety dangers are the inadequate highways \nand not just the bridges. In our State, the department of \ntransportation has embarked on an ambitious program to bring 800 \nbridges up to standards, and every department of transportation in this \nNation realizes they have bridge problems, that they need to inspect \nthem, and, as I said yesterday, it is important that we find out what \ncaused this particular collapse. Were the inspections adequate? Was the \ndesign adequate? Were there unusual loads that were put on the bridge? \nThese are the kinds of issues we need to deal with immediately. But we \nalso have money going, under the bridge program, to States to deal with \nthese deficient bridges.\n  Earmarks are not taking away money from bridges. I can tell my \ncolleagues about earmarks in the State of Missouri. Every single \nearmark in our State, everything that has been earmarked is on the \nState implementation plan. It is a priority, and most of them are \nhighly significant priorities for safety, whether it is bridges or \nhighways.\n  I am not surprised that an executive branch agency doesn't like \nearmarks. Way, way a long time ago in the dim past, I was an executive, \nand I did not like the legislative body exercising its power of the \npurse. As a matter of fact, I had all kinds of problems when the \nGeneral Assembly would pass something, and I vetoed a couple of them.\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\nSo legislative earmarks are efforts to exercise the legitimate control \nover the purse and are always resisted by the executive.\n  Let's take a look at what happened in last year's Transportation \nappropriations bill. There was about $853 million worth of high-\npriority projects that Members had asked for in their States and the \nbill contained. That bill never got to final passage. So the Department \nof Transportation took that money. They took the money from high-\npriority projects all across the Nation and put it into something \ncalled Urban Partners. They are going to reduce congestion. In one city \nthey are going to use the money to start having rush-hour traffic drive \nin breakdown lanes. What happens when somebody breaks down in the \nbreakdown lane? They have a tremendous jam. There are many things going \non.\n  Oh, and by the way, under Urban Partners, $853 million went to Miami, \nNew York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Seattle. As far as Oklahoma, \nMissouri, and other States, we were left out. Frankly, I think I can do \na better job of working with my colleagues to determine where some of \nthat money should go rather than what I think is a not very well \nthought out Urban Partners program to just five cities.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma says he really likes authorized projects. \nI have been an authorizer, too, but the bridge to nowhere, which gained \nsuch infamy, was an authorized project. It was put in by the chairman \nof the conference committee on SAFETEA. Three months later, the \nTransportation appropriations bill that year unearmarked that earmark, \nand we are pleased to say that it is no longer federally earmarked.\n\n  I know our colleague from Oklahoma doesn't like putting in money for \nbike paths. It may surprise him to know I am not a fan of that either. \nI voted against it. But it was in the authorized bill. Yes, that is \nwhat the authorizers put in, $100 million to go to bike paths. I think \nbike paths have their place, but given the state of congestion on \nhighways, I think with the danger on highways and bridges, we probably \nshould not be putting $25 million there. But since the money was in \nthere, I did, in the authorization project, get $25 million for bike \npaths, and that has been spent. If the Senator from Oklahoma wants to \nchange that, I think we need to change the underlying authorization, \nand I would certainly vote for that.\n  I think trying to blame earmarks on deficient bridges is a bridge too \nfar, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the words of Senator Bond, \nalthough I was misquoted. I don't like any earmark.\n  I accept that authorized earmarks have, in fact, been reviewed by an \nauthorizing committee, but I would make a couple of points. This year, \nthe appropriators will spend $188 billion appropriating money for \nsomething that has not been authorized. So you can use that as a debate \ntool, but the fact is, the authorizers have limited influence over the \nAppropriations Committee because they will spend 20 percent of our \ndiscretionary budget on items that are not authorized by the \nauthorizing committees.\n  The other point I would make is that the Senator will get a chance to \nvote against bike paths because I have another amendment that \neliminates funding for bike paths until we have restored the bridges. \nThis amendment cares for the roads that Senator Bond just made a point \nof. The fact is, this amendment allows the money to bring roads up to \nquality and safety standards. So it would not eliminate where the \n13,000 people die in this country from unsafe and poor quality national \nhighways; it will, in fact, allow those to happen.\n  What it would not allow is $600,000 to be spent on horse-riding \nfacilities in Virginia; a snow mobile trail in Vermont of $5.9 million; \nparking for New York's Harlem Hospital of $8 million; $532,000 for a \nbicycle and pedestrian trail in Tennessee; a daycare center and park \nand ride facility in Illinois; dust control mitigation for rural \nArkansas of $3 million; the National Packard Museum in Ohio, $2.75 \nmillion; a historical pilot project in Washington for $200,000. I think \nwe are going to have trouble convincing the American people those \nthings are a higher priority than bridge safety in this country. And \nthat is just a small example of the congressionally directed spending \nin this bill.\n  So I don't deny that those may be priorities, but what I would state \nis they are lower priorities than safety on our roads and rebuilding \nour bridges and making sure our highways are safe. And I would wager \nthat the vast proportion of Americans, by far, would agree with that \nstatement. We have lost our way if, in fact, we are going to fund these \nthings at the expense of not funding bridge repair in this country.\n  I think the projects that are funded, many of them, a great many of \nthem, fit into the priorities of restoring bridges and highways, but \nmany don't. And the question around this amendment is, Will we do that \nwhich is the highest priority for us?\n  It is kind of like the war. We are spending about $8.5 billion a \nmonth. But whose money are we spending on the war? We are spending our \nchildren and grandchildren's money because every bit of it has been \noutside the budget guidelines, so it goes straight to debt. The point \nis, we don't have the money right now to do some of the things we would \nlike to do because we should be doing the things that we need to do. \nAnd the things we need to do should be the highest priority for the \nAmerican people. That certainly isn't horse-riding facilities in \nVirginia or a snow mobile trail in Vermont.\n  Madam President, I yield back and hope to speak again on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I have listened to the Senator from \nOklahoma on the amendment he has offered, and I want to make a few \ncomments.\n  I remind all of our colleagues that at noon we are going to go to a \nmoment of silence. Today is the 9/11 anniversary, and it is a time we \nall want to pause for a minute to reflect on what has happened over the \nlast 6 years. Hopefully, I will be able to make a few remarks, and we \nwill see if the Senator from Oklahoma has any remaining time, and then \nI can talk to my colleague and we can set a time for this vote and then \nget to many of the other issues that are pending now on this bill.\n  I want to remind all my colleagues that we are trying to work to \nfinish this bill. Hopefully, we will get a path cleared for late \ntonight or to finish tomorrow morning. I remind everyone that we are \ngoing to be finishing this bill because of the Jewish holidays this \nweekend. We are trying to work through this in a very tight timeframe. \nWe have a number of pending amendments we want to work through.\n  But let me respond to the Senator from Oklahoma. He brings before the \nSenate today his argument on funding bridges within our Transportation \nbill, and yesterday the Senate spoke out very strongly and acted very \nstrongly to address the needs of our deficient bridges across the \nNation. I spoke out on the floor yesterday about the number of bridges \nthat were deficient across our country, the imperative that we have in \nmoving forward to make sure that they are taken care of, and on a very \nstrong bipartisan vote we approved yesterday a $1 billion increase in \nFederal funding for bridges. That was, I remind everyone, a historic \n25-percent increase in Federal bridge funding.\n\n  That amendment won't allow us, obviously, to fix every deficient \nbridge, but it is a historic increase, and it does set the priority of \nthis bill in moving forward to address this very critical need that I \nshare the concern of the Senator from Oklahoma about. We cannot, \nhowever, let all our other transportation and all of our other housing \npriorities be ignored to address the bridge problem.\n  Yes, we are all very focused on what happened because of Minnesota. \nBut having worked on this bill for a number of years, and worked with \nmy colleague from Missouri, we have had hearings on safety and \ninfrastructure in this country that need to be addressed. The FAA needs \nto be addressed, we need to deal with our Nation's highways, and there \nare a number of critical housing projects. We\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\nhave to balance all of those priorities, and I think we have done a \nvery good job in this bill of doing that, and then adding $1 billion \nyesterday to address the bridge problem.\n  The long-term solution to our need to address our underinvestment in \ninfrastructure is going to have to come about within the Transportation \nauthorization bill that will be debated sometime in the future. My \ncolleague, Senator Bond, has been a leader on that committee, and we \nneed to do a thorough look at the revenues available in the trust \nfunds. We have talked about that on this floor through our bill. We \nknow that needs to be addressed. We have talked to the Finance \nCommittee. It does need to be addressed and will be addressed with this \nCongress, and in the coming years.\n  But I want to remind my colleagues that the vast majority of our \ntransportation earmarks that are in this bill require a match, and not \njust a small match but an overmatch by local communities that have set \nthe priorities for these projects and brought them to the attention of \nMembers who have then brought them to us and to our committee.\n  As we move to a vote on the amendment that has been offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, I remind everyone that if it passes, it would \nhave the impact of bringing many of our multibillion-dollar projects to \na complete halt. His amendment would not just terminate highway \nprojects, it would also stop major transit projects that many Senators \nhave come to our committee and talked about. They are currently under \nconstruction, and we are funding them in the Federal Transit \nAdministration. These are projects that are working their way through \nthe pipeline. If we were to wipe them out with this amendment, \nconstruction contracts across the country for these transit projects \nwould be halted and cause a tremendous amount of difficulties and \nprobably challenges within those contracts as well.\n  Those contracts include the Jacksonville Rapid Transit System in \nFlorida, the Regional Rail Project in Pennsylvania, the South County \nCommuter Rail, Wickford Junction Station in Rhode Island, transit \nprojects in Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, \nVirginia, another one in Virginia, Washington, Arizona, California, \nColorado, Illinois.\n  Madam President, I refer all of my colleagues to the Transportation \nbill, all of these projects that are now under construction that have \nfull funding grant agreements would be brought to a halt if this \namendment were to pass.\n  So besides all the other arguments, I encourage Members to understand \nwhat the impacts of this amendment are should it pass on the Senate \nfloor today.\n  Now, let me, before we go to a moment of silence in just a minute, \nMadam President, remind my colleagues that the IG report that the \nSenator from Oklahoma referred to today does refer to past practices of \nthis Congress. We came into session in January of this year \nunderstanding the need to take a look at our processes within the \nappropriations. We understood the impact from past practices that were \nunder scrutiny, and we addressed them very clearly.\n  This Congress has now sent a very comprehensive ethics reform law to \nthe President, and we are awaiting his signature. That law includes \nsome new procedures that require a great deal of clarity and \ntransparency that have not been required ever before in Congress. But \neven before we sent that law to the White House, the Appropriations \nCommittee, under the direction of our chairman, Senator Byrd, and \nRanking Member Cochran, said we are not going to wait for a law to be \nenacted. We imposed new rules that require new procedures under the \nethics reform bill. And this bill, this Transportation bill, in working \nthrough our process, has directly followed those new rules and the new \nrules of the ethics bill that have been sent to the President.\n  Every Senator who asked for an earmark was required to certify that \nthere was no pecuniary interest in their earmark request, and each and \nevery one of those certifications is now available for any Senator to \nlook at on the Web for review. Every earmark is identified with the \nSenator who requested it in the Congressional Record. You can look on \nthe Web site to see who is there. So we are complying with what this \nSenate has said we need to do.\n  I would also remind all of us that in addition to those reforms, \nSenator Bond and I worked to develop a new procedure within the \nTransportation Housing Subcommittee, and under the procedures we have \nestablished, each and every earmark has to be fully consistent with the \nmission of the Department of Transportation or the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. So we recognized that past practices \nhave brought us to a point today where we have to fully look at each \nand every one of these earmarks. We make sure they are consistent with \nthe funding requirements of that bill, and they are seeing the light of \nday, as we will see today as we face a number of amendments about them.\n  I want to make one final point before we move to this important \nmoment of silence that is going to occur, and that is, the Senator from \nOklahoma is essentially arguing that bureaucrats in Washington, DC, \nmake every decision about funding across the Nation.\n  Madam President, I know I go home every weekend and I talk to \ncommunity leaders, I talk to mayors, I talk to members of numerous \ncommunity projects, and I listen to what their needs are. There is no \nbureaucrat in any department of this United States Government in \nWashington, DC, who takes the time that most of us do to go home and \nreally understand what the needs of our communities are and to come \nback here and fight for them. That is what we do. That is our job, and \nwe are responsible for that. I take a back seat to no one in working \nhard to represent the interests of my State.\n  Finally, Madam President, one other point. The Senator from Oklahoma \nsaid he only wants to see authorized funding being done. I would remind \nall my colleagues, if we move to that, the State Department hasn't been \nauthorized for years, the FAA authorization will run out this year, the \nOlder Americans Act, the No Child Left Behind Act--all extremely \nimportant business we need to accomplish. But if we move to a point \nthat says no money except authorized, a number of critical programs in \nthis country will be subject to cutback. I don't think that is what any \nof us intend to do.\n  Madam President, we are moving rapidly to a very important moment in \nthe Senate, and I notice many of my colleagues are coming to the floor \nright now. I ask that all of us listen to our majority leader at this \npoint, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in 10 seconds, I will ask that the Chair \nannounce the Senate will stand for a moment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11367-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11367-S11370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMEMORATING THE SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we will now begin a moment of silence \nhonoring the 9/11 victims and their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nobserve a moment of silence in commemoration of the sixth anniversary \nof the September 11 attack.\n  (Moment of silence)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, 6 years ago today, 2,974 men, women, and \nchildren became innocent victims to a cowardice and hatred we will \nnever understand. I remember very clearly watching from the windows of \nthe Capitol, S-219, as smoke billowed from the Pentagon in the clean \nmorning air.\n  I remember the care taken amidst the panic to ensure everyone was \nevacuated safely when word came of another airplane heading toward the \nU.S. Capitol. I remember how our voices joined to sing ``God Bless \nAmerica'' on the Capitol steps, which was our way of showing the \ncountry that its Government was still whole.\n  But what I remember most was how our Nation stood as one, in lines to \ngive blood, stretching long hours; the food and clothing banks \noverflowing with donations; contributions, financial in nature pouring \nin, many giving more than they could afford to help families who had \nliterally lost everything.\n  As our country stood as one, the world stood with us. The headline of\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\none European newspaper read: ``We are all American.''\n  On this anniversary, and all those to follow, we must never forget \nthe innocent lives we lost that day or the burden we bear for the \nfreedom we cherish. Yet we must always remember the endless well of \ncompassion and rejection of despair that followed. These past 6 years \nwe have faced great challenges. But though our scars will never fully \nheal, our spirit will never be broken. We are all American.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today marks 6 years since September \n11, 2001, the day when al-Qaida terrorists unleashed an unprovoked and \nvicious attack on the American people.\n  The Senate remembers and honors the innocent victims of that attack \nand stands in support of their families and communities. Six years \nlater, their healing continues.\n  Our enemies hoped September 11 would burn as a day America would \nnever forget, and it certainly has. But the terrorists hoped today \nwould mark an anniversary of fear and doubt. Today is a day of sadness, \nyes, but also of resolve, strength, and renewed purpose.\n  We remember the kind-heartedness of America that was on display then, \nwhen millions of volunteers gave their time, money, and strength of \nheart to people in need.\n  We honor our Armed Forces, brave men and women who fight under our \nflag. They fight on because the war goes on. Recent arrests in Germany, \nhalting what was to be a devastating terrorist attack against American \nand German targets in that country, are proof this war is not over, \nthat now is not the time to let down our guard or revert to a pre-9/11 \napproach to the world.\n  We know the war goes on by listening to the words of our enemies. \nOsama bin Laden's recently released remarks are more of the same, \nthreats of death and destruction, intended to sow fear in America.\n  German Chancellor Angela Merkel showed her understanding of the \nstruggle that still lies ahead when she said of Germany's foiled terror \nplot:\n\n       The lesson from this is the danger is not just abstract, \n     it's real.\n\n  Real danger struck America 6 years ago. International terrorists had \nbeen at war against us long before that. But unlike previous attacks, \n9/11 spurred America to take the war to them. By going on the offense, \nwe are winning the war on terrorism. Today we are safer at home and \nhave gone 6 years without another attack.\n  So today we also honor the efforts of Americans across the land who \nare working to keep us safe. Many of them are here in the District of \nColumbia, but not all of them. When one of my Kentucky constituents \ndials 911, he is more likely to be calling someone in West Liberty than \nin Washington.\n  Many brave police officers, firefighters or emergency personnel \ntrained to respond to a threat or attack work in Kentucky towns such as \nMurray, Morgantown or Mayfield.\n  Today, we pay tribute to these brave Americans who do not often get \nthe headlines. They are the unsung heroes. When the call goes forth to \ntowns such as Somerset, Sandy Hook or Sacramento, KY, they answer. \nToday, we honor their sacrifice and service most of all.\n  It remains this Congress's job to provide the troops with everything \nthey need to complete their mission. I know all of my colleagues are \nequally dedicated to making sure that happens.\n  Six years after the September 11 attacks, we can say proudly the \nterrorists failed. Terrorists may have devastated two buildings and \ndamaged the Pentagon, but they did not dent America's resolve.\n  While they lashed out to cause death and destruction, we fight for \nfreedom. Freedom is our greatest strength. No terrorist attack will \never diminish that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 1 year from today, the first of \nAmerica's three official 9/11 memorials will be dedicated at the \nPentagon. It will feature 184 stainless steel benches, each surrounded \nby a pool of water; one bench for each of the 184 innocent victims who \ndied in the Pentagon and on the plane that struck it 6 years ago today.\n  This morning on the front page of ``The Washington Post'' there is a \nstory about a small company of master metalworkers who are finishing \nthese benches, grinding and polishing them, transforming them into \nperfectly uniform, flawlessly smooth memorials.\n  The company is called Bucthel Metal Finishing Company. It is located \noutside Chicago. They do work all over the United States. The owner of \nBucthel Metal Finishing is Abe Yousif. Mr. Yousif is an Iraqi immigrant \nwho left his homeland in 1978, months before the start of the Iraq-Iran \nwar. He has never been back.\n  All 24 of Yousif's employees are also immigrants, from Mexico, \nBosnia, and many other nations. For Abe Yousif and each of his \nemployees, polishing those benches for the Pentagon memorial has become \na deeply personal mission. As ``The Washington Post'' describes it:\n\n       If he can make the benches perfect, he believes he will \n     help others to heal. If he can make the metal shine \n     brilliantly, they will feel hope. He wants people to run \n     their fingers along the steel and find, in its clean, \n     immaculate smoothness, something affirming, redeeming even, \n     on a site now scarred by murder and death.\n\n  Today on the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on our \nNation, many Americans in Illinois and across our Nation are searching \nfor their own ways to rescue some lasting good out of the evil of 9/11.\n  There were 3,000 innocent victims from more than 150 nations who died \nin New York, at the Pentagon, and the field in Pennsylvania. Jeff \nMladenik, a husband and father of four from Hinsdale, IL, outside \nChicago, had just been named interim CEO of a new e-commerce company. \nBut he had another job that meant more to him. He worked as an \nassistant pastor at his church in Oak Brook. He was on American \nAirlines Flight 11, the plane that struck the first tower; one of nine \nmen and women from Illinois who died on \n9/11.\n  After Mladenik's death, his parents told a reporter:\n\n       I can guarantee that Jeff would tell us that hatred and \n     bitterness must not have the last word.\n\n  One of America's first memorials to the victims of 9/11 was a tiny, \nlittle makeshift memorial created by a woman in Shanksville, PA, in her \nown front yard weeks after the attacks.\n  Within days, the first tribute arrived, a bouquet of flowers. Next to \nit was a note that read:\n\n       Thanks for saving our lives--the Capitol employees.\n\n  We who are privileged to work in this building have a special \nobligation to work together to prevent the next attack and remember the \nheroes who saved our lives on 9/11.\n  Six years after that date, America is safer, but we need to do more. \nWe need to listen carefully and follow the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  We have passed important legislation this year to move in that \ndirection. We need also make sure that as a sign of respect, we \nremember those who have given their lives on that sad day.\n  As a sign of respect, I would like to read the names of the eight \nother Illinoisans who died in the terrorist attacks on September 11, \n2001.\n  Kathy Bantis, Andrea Haberman, Suzanne Kondratenko, Darya Lin and Sue \nSauer, all from Chicago; and Robert Rasmussen, from Hinsdale, were all \nin meetings in the Twin Towers when the planes hit.\n  CDR Dan Shanower, of Naperville, a Navy intelligence officer, had \njust sat down at his desk after briefing his admiral on the World Trade \nCenter attacks when the third plane smashed into the Pentagon. He died \nthere, along with Navy Reserve LCDR Patrick Murphy, who grew up in \nFlossmoor, IL.\n  We remember them today, along with Jeff Mladenik, also of Hinsdale, \nand all of the nearly 3,000 innocent victims who died on September 11, \n2001. We also remember those they have left behind, and those who still \nsuffer today. May they, and we, continue to heal and find peace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I speak today as a Senator from New \nJersey, the State that lost 700 of its residents including those who \nwere\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\nat work that day at the World Trade Center.\n  I remember when President Roosevelt in 1941 pronounced December 7 as \nthe ``day of infamy,'' and once again, we see a moment in time, a \nmoment of infamy, evil beyond comprehension, because the events of this \nday changed the way people live on this Earth.\n  The Twin Towers were far more than the sum of their steel and \nconcrete parts. The towers that I knew very well were cities, \nessentially, in the sky. Fifty thousand people worked in those towers, \nmore people than the population of many of our Nation's communities.\n  In many cases, those 50,000 men and women spent as much time in the \ntowers as they did at home, from New York and New Jersey, and from \nother States throughout the country, from small families and big \nfamilies, from every walk and stage of life.\n  On that autumn morning 6 years ago, they awoke and began moving to \nthe rhythm of the day, drawn to the Trade Center just as normal, just \nlike the days and the years before. Only this day was different. This \nday became an epoch moment in the history of man, this day terror would \nno longer be a thing that would be in distant places, not be a thing of \nmemory or talk. Terror was about to become real.\n  Three thousand people, spouses with no mates, children without a \nparent, siblings, and treasured friends, gone. They live on only in our \nmemory. Seven hundred of the almost 3,000 people who perished were from \nmy State of New Jersey. Thirty-seven of them came from a single town in \nNew Jersey, Middletown. In 2003, I helped dedicate a memorial garden in \ntheir honor. Tears were still flowing. Firefighters, police officers, \nand first responders died within the towers, as they fought valiantly \nto save people they never knew and never saw.\n  I had the privilege of serving as a commissioner of the Port \nAuthority in New York and New Jersey for 4 years before I came to the \nSenate. I got to know the corridors of traffic and energy contained in \nthose buildings. I also got to know many of the terrific people who \nfilled the jobs that enabled the Port Authority to provide the critical \nservices it offered to our region.\n  The Port Authority lost 84 staff members on 9/11, including 37 brave \npolice officers who gave their lives as they attempted to help others \nimmobilized by the catastrophe. I knew many others who worked for firms \nhoused in the Twin Towers who perished that day. In one firm, Cantor \nFitzgerald, I knew people very well, and they lost 700 that single day \nat their firm alone, many with young families just beginning. They had \nyoung kids and they had lives with great possibilities ahead of them, \nended abruptly, brutalized in that terrible moment.\n  People stared aghast at the television and said to themselves and \nothers who would be listening: This can't be happening. The United \nStates? In America? Taking down the Twin Towers that were monuments to \ncommerce, energy, and vitality.\n  I was on a trip to the Middle East, and it included a stop in Israel, \nat the moment the tragedy hit. I saw tears flowing down the faces of \npeople from this tiny country, crying for America, pleading for some \nunderstanding that would help relieve the pain.\n\n  Like Pearl Harbor 60 years ago, 9/11 changed the world. It changed \nthe world, the way we see it, the way we see ourselves, constantly \nhaving to produce identification cards, waiting in lines to be examined \nby security, thousands and thousands of people. Our own Homeland \nSecurity Department has 180,000 people focused primarily on trying to \nprotect this homeland of ours from other violent moments with \nterrorism. We have to live differently. We must live with more \nvigilance. We live knowing that evil is omnipresent. We know we are \nfighting a ruthless enemy, one whose frontline is our homefront, one \nthat brings war to the innocent.\n  We are constantly on the watch in New Jersey. The stretch between \nPort Newark, our harbor, and Newark Liberty International Airport, is \ndefined by the FBI as the most dangerous 2-mile stretch in the country, \nthe most inviting for a terrorist attack. We are constantly on guard. \nWe are constantly concerned. Something happened that day when 19 madmen \nset out to destroy America. We didn't bend. We promised to search for \nthose who orchestrated the terrible acts. We are still looking for \nthem. We must continue to do so. But we will always remember those who \nfell that day. Their loss binds our Nation.\n  We stand together as one in our fight against terror, and we will, on \nthis day of remembrance, always remember what happened. We can't \nforget. They are honored with vigils and candles, with that light \nserving as beacons of hope and barriers against fear.\n  In Bayonne, NJ, we remember those who perished with a monument, and \nwe see these memorial sites across our region. In Hoboken, there is a \npark with ginkgo trees whose longevity reflects the enduring spirit of \nthe victims. From one county in New Jersey, Bergen County, 135 lost \ntheir lives.\n  It can't just be a memorial. America has to rebuild its spirit. The \nworld has to fight against terror. We know this morning a ceremony at \nthe site of the World Trade Center took place with a commitment to \nrebuild. We want that to happen. It is critical for our spirit that we \nshow that America is trying its best to bring peace to the country, to \nbring back civilization as we knew it, and we hope that will take \nplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNew Jersey for his outstandingly eloquent, heartfelt words. We share a \nregion. We shared the tragedy of that day as Senators doing our best in \na very troubled time. We continue to share it now in our mutual desire \nto keep our region safe from terrorism in terms of homeland security.\n  I was at the Ground Zero site early this morning and before the \nceremony of commemoration began mingled with some of the families of \nthe victims. There is nothing more heartfelt than seeing these fine \npeople, average folks from every different background, profession, \nethnic, religious, economic level, holding pictures in their laps, \noften young men, young women in their prime, in the beginning and \nbeauty of their lives. Their parents are holding the pictures. Husbands \nare holding pictures of wives; wives holding pictures of husbands; \nchildren holding pictures of their dads. There is nothing more touching \nand more meaningful than going over and looking at the faces of these \nfine people. All they have to hold are the pictures and the memories of \nthe people whose lives were snuffed out. This happened in so many \ninstances, close to 3,000 instances, each one a family member, a \nfriend, a business associate--gone, and gone for the most irrational \nand hateful reasons.\n  We fought many wars before, but most of them were about things we \ncould maybe not agree with but understand--a desire for territory, \nreligious domination, righting a wrong. No, this war--aimed at the \ninnocent, aimed at civilians, aimed at average Americans--had an \nirrational hatred to it that is hard to comprehend. We do remember. One \nof the family members attached this ribbon to my lapel. Of course, I \nwear this flag which I put on September 12, 2001. Every day I wear a \nsuit or a sport jacket, I have this flag on, the same one I put on my \nlapel then in hope and memory of those who were missing, because we \ndidn't know how many had died. I wear it every day to think of those \nwho were lost and what we lost and what their families lost and what \nour country lost. God willing, I will wear it every day for the rest of \nmy life to remember them.\n  Today we do remember. We remember Ground Zero. We remember here on \nthe Senate floor. And most of all, we remember in countless homes \nthroughout the country, throughout the world--most of them concentrated \nin New York and New Jersey--as people remember those who were taken \nfrom them.\n  There is not much to say about such a mindless act of evil cruelty \nwith almost no goal other than frightening people. But one thing we \nassure the terrorists together: Regardless of our political views, we \nare not frightened. We are hurt; we are saddened; sometimes we feel \nlost. But we are not frightened. They have strengthened our resolve--\nour resolve to win the war on terror, do it the smart and rational way, \ndon't do it in a mean, evil way\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\nlike the means used by the terrorists. But we will prevail. We will \nrebuild buildings at Ground Zero. We will rebuild the network--slowly, \nbut surely--that protects us at home. We will rebuild the strength of \nAmerica abroad to fight terrorism and adapt. And we will prevail. But \nwe will also never forget, never forget those people, some of whom were \nfriends of mine, a guy I played basketball with as a kid in high \nschool, a firefighter from the neighborhood in which I was raised, a \nbusinessman, very successful, who helped me on my way up--we will never \nforget them, never. We will resolve that their memory will importune us \nto be better as individuals and as a nation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President. I would like to take a few moments to \nremember the Americans who were killed in the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  In the 6 years since terrorists carried out the September 11 attacks, \nour Nation has not forgotten the innocent Americans who were killed, \none of whom was Al Marchand from Alamogordo, NM, a flight attendant on \nUnited Airlines flight 175 and one of the first casualties on this \nhorrific day. Neither have we forgotten the heroic policemen and \nfirefighters who lost their lives trying to save fellow Americans or \nour brave men and women in uniform who have served their country in the \nwar on terror. I do not believe Americans will ever cease to remember \nthe shock and sadness we all felt that day.\n  September 11 also serves as a reminder that there are many in this \nworld who would harm us and that we must remain vigilant. In the last 6 \nyears we have made great progress in making sure America is secure and \nI am proud of the contribution many of my fellow citizens from New \nMexico have made to strengthen our defenses against terrorist attack. \nThe men and women at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories have \nworked hard to develop many of the technologies that now help us detect \nterrorist threats. Many members of the New Mexico National Guard have \nbeen deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terror as \nwell as many active duty members of the Armed Forces who are stationed \nin or are from New Mexico. All these service men and women are doing a \nfantastic job and we should not forget to thank them for their service \nand the scarifies they have made to keep us safe.\n  Although the Islamic extremists behind the attacks sought to break \nour will and erode our freedom, they were unsuccessful on both fronts. \nOur liberty is dearer to us now, and we are reminded of that each day, \nas our nation continues the war against terror that these terrorists \nbegan 6 years ago.\n  I hope New Mexicans will take a moment today to reflect on the \ntragedy of 9/11, the Americans who lost their lives and the loved ones \nthey left behind and pay tribute to the individuals who serve and \ndefend us today.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today in remembrance of the 2,974 \nAmericans who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. They were family, \nfriends, and neighbors going about their everyday lives. They were \nairline passengers, office workers, emergency personnel, and public \nservants. They were men, women, and children of every age and color. \nYet they were targeted all the same, as citizens of a nation upholding \nthe principles of freedom and personal liberty. We did not invite this \nextreme act of violence, nor will we soon forget the heroes who gave \ntheir lives that day. My prayers are with their families and the \nsurvivors of this unprovoked, cold-blooded attack.\n  Many brave Americans fought back that Tuesday morning, and many \nothers have continued the fight these last 6 years. The United States \nhas not suffered another 9/11 because we have pursued al-Qaida on our \nterms, attacking them where they plan and train before they can reach \nus at home. Many Oregonians have paid the ultimate price to protect \ntheir friends, family and country. For them, America is eternally \ngrateful.\n  September 11 exposed the vulnerability of free societies to acts of \nterrorism. In response, Congress acted to improve our intelligence \ngathering and law enforcement agencies. These improvements have \nprotected this country from further attacks. Today, we are better \nprepared to face this ideological battle of the 21st century, but we \nmust never become complacent.\n  As today's ceremonies commemorate those fallen in New York City, the \nPentagon, and Pennsylvania, may we also remember those Americans on the \nbattlefield fighting to protect us back at home. Their courage and \ndedication testifies to the endurance of free men against all \nadversaries. God bless liberty and all those devoted to its \npreservation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11370-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will yield for the Senator from \nKentucky to speak for a few minutes, and then I will come back, and we \nwill try to get unanimous consent, again, to set the vote at 4 o'clock.\n  I remind all Members of the Senate on both sides that the majority \nleader has asked us to finish this Transportation/Housing bill by \ntonight.

But it is imperative we understand from everyone as soon as \npossible what business they need us to accomplish. Again, we expect to \nfinish this bill by tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am dismayed at the lack of \nconsideration given to Senator Cornyn's resolution on General Petraeus \nand the troops. I condemn the comments made by the Democrats concerning \nour commander in Iraq, General Petraeus. The vendetta against our \nmilitary must stop.\n  It sickens me to hear the comments some Democrats are making against \nGeneral Petraeus. By attacking his character and reputation, these \nDemocrats are attacking all our men and women in the military. On \nbehalf of all these proud men and women who sacrifice their lives every \nday for our Nation, I am here to say these actions and accusations have \nno place in public discourse.\n  Americans do not attack the character of those who risk their lives \nto protect us. The lies, deceit, and disinformation the Democratic \npropaganda machines are feeding to the American people must stop.\n  To suggest that our troops and General Petraeus are motivated by \npolitics rather than patriotism and love of our country is wrong. It \ndiminishes the sacrifice each of them makes and their families have \nmade in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other places around the world.\n  These attacks are made by some of the same people who voted on \nJanuary 26--this year--to unanimously confirm General Petraeus.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record rollcall vote No. 33.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 110th Congress--1st Session\n\n   As compiled through Senate LIS by the Senate Bill Clerk under the \n                direction of the Secretary of the Senate\n\n\n                              vote summary\n\n       Question: On the Nomination (Confirmation Lt.

Voting.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. You will notice on this vote that not one Senator--not \none--voted against General Petraeus. During the debate on his \nconfirmation, no one questioned his integrity or ability to complete \nhis mission--a mission the Senate gave him by confirming him. And now, \nnearly 9 months later, how do we greet him when he comes back to \ndeliver a progress report on Iraq that we requested, the Democrats, \nalso, in Congress requested? Instead of thanking him for his sacrifices \nand listening to him deliver his report, many Democrats who voted to \nconfirm him are either attacking his personal character or not \ndefending him from a personal smear attack by their allies at \nMoveOn.org. I cannot believe this slanderous campaign started before \nthey even heard one word of General Petraeus's report.\n  I read a quote from an anonymous Democratic Senator in the Politico \nnewspaper this morning. I want to share it with this body today. This \nDemocrat, who did not want to give his or her name, made the following \nstatement:\n\n       No one wants to call [Petraeus] a liar on national \n     [television]. The expectation is that the outside groups will \n     do this for us.\n\n  I do not even know where to begin to describe my disgust with that \none. It shows that the attack on General Petraeus is a coordinated \nattack by MoveOn and its allies.\n  Here is just some of what my Democratic colleagues have been saying:\n\n       I don't think General Petraeus has an independent view.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       At the end of the day, these are not totally independent \n     free agents. They are an appendage of the administration.\n\n  And another:\n\n       The fact that there are questions about General Petraeus' \n     report is not surprising. . . . By the general's admission, \n     the so-called surge has not achieved its goal. . . .\n\n  Wrong. I cannot believe these false statements have been made on the\n\n[[Page S11372]]\n\nfloor of this Senate. It is outrageous to condemn a unanimously \nconfirmed general and question his patriotism for this country simply \nfor political sake.\n  I know many of my friends on the other side of the aisle are good, \ndecent people. But I have to say, I am amazed that more of them have \nnot denounced this kind of smear campaign.\n  The folks from MoveOn accuse General Petraeus of ``cooking the \nbooks.'' Is this because his counterinsurgency operation and the surge \nin Iraq are seemingly having positive results? Democrats are talking \nout of both sides of their mouths, and it is time for them to stop \ntalking and start listening. Instead of taking political advice from \nleftwing activist groups, Democrats should actually take time to listen \nto General Petraeus's report.\n  I cannot tell you how disgusted I was to see the full-page ad \nyesterday in the New York Times--which cost $167,000; that is what it \ncost--questioning the character of a four-star general who only 9 \nmonths ago had the support of this entire body.\n  These tactics are insulting and should be condemned. In my book, the \npeople who resort to this type of below-the-belt mudslinging are no \npatriots.\n  I happen to know General Petraeus. He is a good friend of mine and a \ngood friend of the Commonwealth of Kentucky from his days as the \ncommanding officer of the 101st Airborne Division. He is a brave \npatriot of the highest moral character and has made immeasurable \nsacrifices for our country. He has spent the last 4 years deployed from \nhis home, from his family and his loved ones, overseas serving this \ngreat Nation. Three of these years he has spent in Iraq, where he has \nworked tirelessly to build security and stability throughout the \ncountry. His efforts are seeing positive results.\n  To suggest he is driven more by politics than by his love of our \ncountry may possibly be the lowest political attack I have ever seen in \nmy time in the Congress. In the 4 years I have known him, not once did \nGeneral Petraeus bring up politics--not once. I have no idea what he \nis--whether he is a Democrat or a Republican. In all of our \ndiscussions, including the hour I spent with him alone in my office \nbefore he left for Iraq to implement the surge, I do not believe the \nword ``Democrat'' or ``Republican'' was ever used. What I do know is he \nis a great patriot. He does not deserve to come home to be greeted by \npersonal political attacks, especially by the very Democrats who asked \nhim to come home and give us this report 9 months ago.\n  Let me be clear to my Democratic colleagues: Using leftwing attack \ngroups such as MoveOn to discredit General Petraeus--these are the \nworst of the worst. Any politician willing to sacrifice the long-term \nsecurity of the United States in an attempt to salvage a short-term \npolitical career is beyond deplorable. I will not stand for it. Our \nmilitary will not stand for it. And the American public will not stand \nfor it.\n  Just yesterday, a poll by the same New York Times reported that 68 \npercent of Americans trust the military commanders more than the \nDemocratic Congress when it comes to Iraq policy. The American public \nsupports our military. It is time for Congress to echo this support.\n  Yesterday, in my office, I had the opportunity to sit down one on one \nwith a young, brave Kentuckian who had just returned from a long \ndeployment in one of Iraq's hotspots. At the end of our visit, he \nturned to me and made one request. He asked for Congress to support the \ntroops.\n  How can we expect General Petraeus and our troops to successfully \ncomplete their mission when we keep attacking them and threatening to \ncut off their funds? I promised this young man my support and will \ncontinue to do all I can to support our troops.\n  As we find ourselves 6 years from this tragic event, this terrorist \nevent that occurred on September 11, 2001, we must not forget there are \nthose out there who still want to harm us. The freedoms we enjoy daily \nare protected by the brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, \nincluding General Petraeus and the young man with whom I visited in my \noffice yesterday.\n  To all of those who suggest General Petraeus should be called \n``General Betray Us,'' I have a message for you: You are the ones \nbetraying our troops and the American people. You are giving aid and \ncomfort to our enemies. We used to try people who did this as traitors.\n  Just 5 months ago, the Senate Democratic majority leader was quoted \nas saying:\n\n       No one wants us to succeed in Iraq more than Democrats.\n\n  Well, I say to my friend, the majority leader, stand by your words. \nLet's focus on succeeding in Iraq and for once show a united support \nfor our troops.\n  Every night, my wife Mary and I take about 10 minutes at 9 p.m. and \nsay prayers for our troops and pray for the safety and security of our \nNation. I suggest to all who are listening and who are in this body to \ndo likewise. Maybe Democrats should take a moment of silence and stop \ncriticizing our commanders and troops.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by \nthe two leaders today, the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of \nthe Cornyn resolution, the text of which is the exact language of the \namendment which Senator Cornyn offered this morning. Further, I ask \nconsent that if the resolution is agreed to, the preamble be agreed to \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as Members know, we are currently \ndebating the Transportation and Housing appropriations bill that funds \nincredibly important infrastructure, from airports to highways to \nbridges to housing programs. The majority leader has instructed us to \nfinish this bill by tonight. We have a number of amendments before us \nthat we need to work through. Therefore, I will object, and I remind \nall Senators that next week, in just a few short days, we will be \nmoving to the Defense authorization bill and a debate on Iraq with \nnumerous opportunities for Senators to bring forward issues relating to \nthat. So I will object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I feel compelled to respond to the \ncomments of my colleague and friend from Kentucky. There are hundreds, \nliterally hundreds of organizations throughout the country that are \nloosely supportive of the Republican Party, just as there are hundreds \nof organizations in this country that are loosely supportive of the \nDemocratic Party. If one of those Republican organizations makes a \nparticular charge or assertion, that does not mean that every Member of \nthe U.S. Senate or the House, Republican in nature, or the \nadministration believes or agrees with that assertion any more than one \nshould believe that an assertion--in this case by an advertisement paid \nfor by MoveOn.org--is reflective of the views of all of us. It is not. \nI found the advertisement distasteful, disappointing, and, frankly, not \nreflective of the views I hold and I suspect the views that almost \neverybody in the Senate, Democrat or Republican, holds.\n  I don't know General Petraeus well, but I do know him to be a decent \nand honorable person, a good leader; someone who has given really the \nmajority of his life to serve the people of our country, sometimes in \ndangerous and harmful situations; someone who is willing to spend not \njust months but years away, separated from his family, in support of \nour country and serving as he has pledged to do, as he has sworn to do. \nHe is someone who, in my own experience with him, is a straight \nshooter. He calls them like he sees them. He gives us the good, the \nbad, and the ugly. He did 2 months ago when several of us were over in \nIraq and met with him and Ambassador Crocker.\n  I wish to speak for a moment as a veteran, a Vietnam veteran. My \nfriend, Senator Bunning, talked about the question of the lack of \nrespect and support our troops receive maybe from those of us on this \nside of the aisle. I couldn't disagree more. I remember what it was \nlike 30, 35 years ago when\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\nthose of us who served overseas in an even less popular war in \nSoutheast Asia, the lack of support we received, not so much from the \nCongress but from the American people. That was then. This is now. I \nthink as a nation we learned a lot from the way we treated veterans \nback at the end--during and at the end of the Vietnam war. We have \nvowed not to make that same mistake. There is great support and \naffection for our troops, the men and women who serve in the Army, \nNavy, Air Force and Marines, as great now as I have ever seen it.\n  While not everybody supports the war this administration has gotten \nus into, we support our troops. We provided money again and again and \nagain. The Presiding Officer has led the fight to make sure we not only \nprovide our troops with what they need in Iraq or in Afghanistan but to \nmake sure the Veterans' Administration has the money it needs to meet \nthe needs of our veterans when they come back to us harmed, injured, \nand in some cases maimed for life. I am one of those who come here--and \nI know many others--who come here to work together, and I want us to \nget things done.\n  General Petraeus, when he has talked to me--and I have heard him \ntestify, and he is literally testifying again today on the Senate \nside--what he has said over and over again is there is not going to be \na military victory, definitive military victory in Iraq as we would \nthink of having occurred in other wars we have fought. The victory is \ngoing to be a political victory, if there is to be one, and my earnest \nhope is that there will be one. In part, what the surge is about is to \nprovide a space for the Iraqi political leaders to make some tough \ndecisions they have been unwilling--unable to make for the last 2 \nyears. How are they going to divvy up and share their oil revenue? The \npotential is enormous. How are they going to share power among the \ndifferent factions? What will they give the Baathists, the civilian arm \nof Sadam's regime? What role will they have in terms of helping the \ncountry go forward? Are they going to have elections? Are they going to \namend their Constitution, as they promised to do 2 years ago, to \nprotect minority rights? Those are things the Iraqis need to do. Those \nare tough decisions they need to make. They have been unwilling to make \nthem. We are providing for them, hopefully, a greater calm, a little \nbit less hostility in which they can meet and deliberate and hopefully \nreach some kind of consensus. That is what we are endeavoring to do.\n\n  One of the roles for us here in the Congress is we play an oversight \nrole, overseeing the administration's conduct of the war after getting \nus into this war. That is appropriate, and that is our constitutional \nresponsibility. We also have the responsibility and an opportunity to \ntry to put pressure--hopefully in a positive way--on the Iraqi leaders \nto do what they need to do if they are going to have a country. We have \nbeen very forthright in telling them again and again and again. My hope \nis that they begin to listen. If they do, then all of the sacrifice, \nthe lives, the injuries, the money we have spent will not have been in \nvain--will not have been in vain. If they don't take advantage of the \nopportunities they have now and in the months ahead, they will have \nsquandered this opportunity because the American people, as generous as \nwe are, as supportive as we are of democracies here and around the \nworld, we are not going to stand by forever and give up our own lives--\nthe welcoming back of the dead, to care for those who have been \nmaimed--we are not going to do this forever. There is a limited period \nof time.\n  Back to General Petraeus, basically what he has said--and I heard him \nsay it as recently as today--is the Iraqis have an opportunity to save \ntheir country. We can't do it for them. We can help provide an \nenvironment where they can make those tough decisions. We are \nendeavoring to do that. We can open the door; they have to walk through \nit. My hope is that they will.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2794\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2794 on behalf of \nSenator Bingaman and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in \n     fiscal year 2008, in managing and disposing of any \n     multifamily property that is owned or has a mortgage held by \n     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary \n     shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section 8 \n     of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs \n     that are attached to any dwelling units in the property.

The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps \n     to ensure that project-based contracts remain in effect prior \n     to foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual \n     abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for \n     imminent major threats to health and safety. After \n     disposition of any multifamily property described under this \n     section, the contract and allowable rent levels on such \n     properties shall be subject to the requirements under section \n     524 of MAHRAA.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, with that, we have now cleared several \namendments. We are again, for the information of all Senators, working \nto come up with a time agreement. We expect to have a vote in a little \nmore than an hour, as soon as it has been cleared on the Republican \nside.\n  Again, we are going to finish this bill tonight. All Members need to \nget their amendments to the floor, and we will work our way through as \nmany as possible. It will be a late night. It will be less of a late \nnight the sooner we get amendments to the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address this issue now because, \nas I understand, there is a bit of a lull here. I congratulate the \nmanagers for wanting to get the bill completed.\n  I want to continue this discussion that has been going forward today \non the treatment of General Petraeus by the group MoveOn.org relative \nto the advertisement they ran, which has been shown on the floor a \nnumber of times, which referred to him as ``General Betray Us.'' I \nthink it was a despicable act. I think it crosses the line, where \nsomeone who has dedicated his life to defending this Nation would be \nsubjected to this type of a personal assassination, personality \nassassination, character assassination. It is totally inappropriate.\n  The troops serving us in Iraq are doing so because they believe \nunalterably in the cause of America. They believe what this Nation \nstands for is good and right. They are putting their lives on the line \nto make sure we can maintain the freedoms that are so critical to us. \nYou can disagree with the policies on Iraq--and I have a lot of \nreservations about them, especially my severe concerns about what is \nhappening with the Government of Iraq in both the area of creating a \ncoalition government and stability, and specifically in the area of \ncorruption.\n  But what you cannot argue with and what should not occur is to say to \nour troops who are out there every day facing danger and, obviously, a \nlethal threat, that we do not support them. Yet when you impugn in such \na gratuitous and vicious way the integrity of their commander in the \nfield, you clearly impugn the troops in the field also. It is wrong, \nand it should not be tolerated.\n\n  General Petraeus has a record which is extraordinary. He has \ndedicated almost four decades, I believe, to the military service of \nthis country. He has received the Bronze Star, along with innumerable \nother decorations. He commanded the 101st Airborne. He has been to Iraq \non three tours and spent the last 4 years overseas away from his \nfamily. He has put in place an initiative in Iraq which he generally \nbelieves, as his testimony has shown both yesterday and today before \nthe House and the Senate, is making progress in a number of critical \nareas relative to the war on the ground, relative to fighting the \nIslamic terrorists who wish to do us harm.\n  Yet before he even got to the Senate or to the House to testify and \nmake his case as to why he felt his policy, the policy he is pursuing \nas the general in command, is the correct policy and should be \nsustained, before that could even occur, his character was attacked in \nthe most vicious way by people who oppose the war.\n  Opposing the war is a legitimate position. There are very strong \narguments in that area. I do not happen to agree with many of them, but \nI respect those arguments when they are made substantively and \nappropriately. But when an organization, such as MoveOn.org, which is a \nnational organization of dramatic influence, steps out and runs a full-\npage ad at the cost of $160,000 in the New York Times which has as its \ntitle, ``Is he General Petraeus or General Betray Us,'' that is an \ninexcusable, vicious and petty act and not becoming of our society and \na democracy generally.\n  The other side of the aisle--and I have the greatest respect for \nMembers on the other side of the aisle relative to their commitment on \nthis issue--the other side of the aisle said: It is not us doing this. \nLet's remember that MoveOn.org identifies with and openly claims to be \na major player in the caucus of the Democratic Party. In fact, this \nweekend in the New York Times, the lead spokesman for MoveOn.org said--\nand I paraphrase here--but he said: I meet regularly with the \nDemocratic leaders of the Senate, and I talk almost daily to the \nDemocratic staff of the Democratic leaders of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\n  Earlier in the year, MoveOn.org--and I believe it was the same \nindividual, and I again paraphrase--said of the Democratic Party: We \nbought it, it is ours, we are going to dominate it. I see in New \nHampshire that MoveOn.org is being one of the most aggressive arms of \nthe Democratic Party in our State. They are the ones carrying the \nmessage relative to the war, relative to the Democratic leadership in \nour State, that is for sure.\n  So I think this attempt now to step away--the attempt isn't even \noccurring. But this statement by MoveOn.org, which is so over the top \nand so outrageous and so inexcusable in its treatment of an American \nsoldier and the troops he commands, should be repudiated openly. It \nshould be repudiated by this Senate because it is wrong. It is common \ndecency that we should repudiate it.\n  Yet we see on this floor that procedural mechanisms are being used to \nprotect MoveOn.org. That is what is happening here. Rule XVI, a \nprocedural mechanism in this Senate, has been used to keep a very \nreasonably innocuous sense of the Senate from being brought forward to \na vote. It doesn't take very long to vote on something such as this. We \ncould set up a vote in 10 minutes.\n  What does this sense of the Senate, which is so inappropriate that it \nhas to be knocked down by a procedural action, say? It says:\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to reaffirm its support for all the men and women of \n     the United States Armed Forces, including General David H. \n     Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force--Iraq;\n       (2) to strongly condemn any effort to attack the honor and \n     integrity of General Petraeus and all of the members of the \n     United States Armed Forces; and\n       (3) to specifically repudiate the unwarranted personal \n     attacks on General Petraeus by the liberal activist group \n     MoveOn.org.\n\n  I think it is No. 3 that must bother my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, which is causing us not to be able to go to a vote on \nthis amendment, that we would repudiate, probably from a financial \nstandpoint, one of the biggest contributors to the efforts to fight the \nwar and that organization, which openly claims to essentially be an arm \nof the Democratic Party, would be repudiated on the Senate floor. But \nthey deserve to be repudiated.\n  Honestly, if an organization which identified itself with the \nRepublican Party--I cannot think of any that we have that has the type \nof money that MoveOn.org has because we don't have any George Soroses \nfunding us or any organization such as that, but if we did have such an \norganization and they did something such as this, I would immediately \nwant to repudiate it because somebody of the character and commitment \nof General Petraeus does not deserve this attack. He came back to \ntestify because he was asked to come back to testify by committees \nwhich are majority committees, committees where the majority is \ncontrolled by the Democratic leadership of the Congress. Yet before he \ngets here to testify before those committees, there is a clear attempt \nto discredit him personally because they do not like the message. So \ninstead of attacking the message, they decided to kill the messenger or \nattempt to at least undermine the messenger. That is the goal of this \nad, nothing more than a petty attempt to basically undermine the \nmessage General Petraeus has to deliver: We are going to attack him who \nis the messenger, which is gratuitous, inappropriate, inaccurate, \nunfair, and vicious, quite simply vicious, calling him ``General Betray \nUs.''\n\n  So if the majority party does not subscribe to this message, then \nthey should allow us to offer this resolution right now while he is in \ntown, while he is testifying before the Senate today and before the \nHouse yesterday. They should not ask us to wait until next week to \ncorrect this egregious act and to go on record to repudiate this \negregious act. They should not use a parliamentary procedure to defend \nMoveOn.org. No, we should have a vote right now on this resolution, \nthis sense of the Senate.\n  So at this point, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that rule \nXVI not apply to this sense of the Senate and that a procedural attack \non this sense of the Senate not be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that we \nimmediately move to a vote on this resolution stating we support \nGeneral Petraeus as general in the field, we support his men and women \nwho are fighting for us, and that we reject the despicable ad of \nMoveOn.org.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I regret the decision by the majority party \nto not allow us to proceed in this manner, to help us give this good \nman his fair hearing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2816, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nKlobuchar amendment be the pending amendment, and the amendment be \nmodified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n\n                 I-35W BRIDGE REPAIR AND RECONSTRUCTION\n\n        For necessary expenses to carry out the project for repair \n     and reconstruction of the Interstate I-35W bridge located in \n     Minneapolis, Minnesota, that collapsed on August 1, 2007, as \n     authorized under section 1(c) of Public Law 110-56 (121 Stat. \n     558), up to $195,000,000, as otherwise eligible under the \n     emergency relief program of the Department of Transportation, \n     to remain available until expended, Provided, That that \n     amount is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 204 of S.

Mr. President, I would again notify Members that we are \nlikely going to have a vote here in about 35 minutes. We are working \ntoward an agreement on that. But I notify Members to come to the floor \nfor a vote in a short while.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that at 4:15, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on a motion to table the Coburn amendment No. 2810 and that \nSenator Coburn be allowed the last 10 minutes prior to the vote in \norder to speak on his amendment. I further ask unanimous consent to \npreclude any other amendments prior to the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2795\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside. I call up amendment No. 2795 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2795.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher leadership in managing this bill. We have had many important \namendments discussed, and, of course, the Transportation and HUD \nappropriations bill is one of the most important of all of our \nappropriations bills. It covers all of our transportation \ninfrastructure, including mass-transit and housing initiatives and \nothers. I could not let this opportunity go by without offering an \namendment that is one important piece of an overall puzzle for recovery \nin my State. It is my sincere hope that we can pass this amendment \ntoday, but if not, I am willing to work with the distinguished chair \nand ranking member to incorporate this provision in the appropriate \nlegislative vehicle.\n  We are still struggling, despite the wonderful amounts of money from \nvolunteers particularly and time from volunteers and appropriations \nthat have come from Congress to help rebuild homes, we are still \nstruggling from a catastrophic flood in south Louisiana, primarily in \nsoutheast Louisiana in the city of New Orleans, that region, St. \nBernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, Orleans Parish, parts of Jefferson, \nand others. There was also tremendous flooding in the southwest part of \nthe State caused by Hurricane Rita, which came 4 weeks after Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  While the country is used to dealing with hurricanes and we have all \nhad large ones and small ones and ferocious ones and minor ones to deal \nwith, we have never, at least in the last 100 years or so, dealt with \nthe devastation following the levee breaks and flooding and pumping \nsystems that collapsed that should have worked. I tell people, if they \ncan just imagine what the Netherlands would look like if the little guy \nwith his finger in the dike--if it didn't work one day and the dike \nbroke and the Netherlands basically went underwater. It is a country, \nand it is much smaller than the United States. In fact, it would fit \ninside of Louisiana. But, nonetheless, it is a very powerful economic \nengine in Europe. To have that dike and levee system fail and the \ncatastrophe that would result in large measure is kind of what happened \nin New Orleans and the region.\n  You can imagine the difficulty of rebuilding 200,000-plus residences, \nsome individual, single-family, owner-occupied homes, some homes that \nwere rented, nonsubsidized, and then the rental subsidized sections of \nthe city, public housing, affordable housing, workforce development \nhousing--there are many words to describe these types of housing.\n  I come to say that rebuilding this housing stock is quite a challenge \nfor our delegation. Congress can provide vast amounts of tax credits, \ngrants, loans, and waivers but these benefits will not spur recovery if \nwe cannot get people back into their homes. That is where recovery must \nstart and end. For example, in Louisiana alone we had over 20,000 \nbusinesses destroyed. Business cannot open their doors if their workers \nhave nowhere to live. Louisiana also had 875 schools destroyed. Again, \nteachers cannot come back to school and teach our children if they do \nnot have a roof over their heads. So a fundamental piece of recovery in \nthe gulf coast is to allow disaster victims to return home and rebuild.\n  The amendment I offer today for consideration--I thank Senator Murray \nfor being such an outstanding leader on previous appropriations bills \nto try to push this issue for additional funding and help--is \nspecifically to complement or parallel our efforts for helping \nhomeowners get back. There is a bill, S. 1668, the Gulf Coast Housing \nRecovery Act, which is coming through the Banking Committee which is \ngoing to help our public housing residents and workforce development \nhousing. This is because we lost thousands of units of public \nsubsidized housing. I am pleased to work alongside Senate Banking \nCommittee Chairman Chris Dodd to hopefully secure a hearing on this \nimportant bill in the coming weeks and to work with my colleagues to \nusher it out of committee as soon as possible.\n  In regards to this bill, I should note that the recovery of public \nhousing is one area that has not received much national press \nattention, even though prior to Hurricane Katrina, the Housing \nAuthority of New Orleans--HANO operated over 7,000 public housing \nunits, with about 5,100 units occupied. These residents, just like \nrenters and homeowners, have a right to return home. We must provide \nthem with the means and opportunity to do so. S. 1668, which I have \nmentioned would provide the means and opportunity necessary to make \nthis happen.\n  I will not go into great detail on this legislation today but given \nits importance to my state, and the entire gulf coast, let me summarize \nthe main provisions in this bill. First, this bill sets out a process \nto allow New Orleans area public housing residents to return home. \nNext, it strikes a good balance between the redevelopment priorities of \nHANO, developers, and public housing residents to responsibly rebuild \nbetter affordable housing units in New Orleans. Lastly, this bill \ncreates home ownership opportunities, spurs community development, and \ngives a hand up to community nonprofits.\n  As evidence of the merits of this bill and the balanced approach we \nhave established, I will ask that a copy of an August 27, 2007, \nWashington Post editorial be printed in the Record. This editorial \nclearly outlines the need for this legislation, how it will allow \nresponsible mixed-income development, and how if it is passed today, \nresponsible developers could begin construction tomorrow if they meet \nrequirements in our bill. They are not burdensome requirements, instead \nthey ask developers to consult with residents, ensure that when they \ntear down public housing units that they are providing for sufficient \nreplacement units of affordable housing. Given that our State has over \n5,000 displaced public housing residents, thousands of people who were \non the waiting list pre-Katrina to get into public housing, and a \nfurther 12,000 homeless individuals, I do not feel this is unreasonable \nto require that affordable housing stock be replaced, not lost, during \nthis housing crisis.\n\n  I note that according to a June 2007 report by PolicyLink, a national \nresearch institute, rents have increased as much as 40 to 200 percent \nsince the storms, leaving few apartments affordable to families making \nless than the area median income. That is why the amendment I am \ndiscussing, and S. 1668 are so important. The amendment I offer today \nis included as an authorization in S. 1668 and I would urge my \nDemocratic and Republican colleagues to support this bill as I would \nask their consideration of this amendment today.\n  This amendment is an amendment which will help close the loophole for \nthe elderly, the disabled, and the homeless. In particular, there are a \ngroup of people who are too frail or fragile to live on their own, yet \nthey do not belong in a hospital. We have many people--I am sure in the \nState of the Presiding Officer, in Pennsylvania, and I\n\n[[Page S11377]]\n\nwas in Philadelphia last night, a magnificent city--I am sure you can \nthink of many places in Philadelphia where there are homes or \napartments for disabled elderly, for adults who are not older but they \nare disabled through an accident or injury. They don't belong in a \nhospital. They can't be left alone. But it is sort of group housing, \nmany times run by Catholic Charities. Sometimes they are run by other \nnonprofit organizations. We need that kind of housing desperately to \nhelp us get back, to take care of the most fragile people in our city \nwho are still today without shelter. It would help those most at-risk, \nand those who really need the help most in my state. You can imagine \nthe challenge to take care of this group under normal circumstances. \nBut here we are, dealing with a catastrophe, trying to provide housing \nfor thousands of people now returning to the city in a fragile \nsituation. It is our obligation as a city, as a State, and as a nation \nto help. So that is basically what my amendment does.\n  I note that the Senate has already passed this amendment. It already \npassed this body as part of H.R. 4939, the emergency supplemental which \nwas enacted last summer. However, much to my chagrin, and to those \nworking on this issue in my State, this important provision was taken \nout by the House in final negotiations on the supplemental. So the \nSenate has already in some measure passed this particular proposal. I \nam offering and talking about it today to ask the Senate to consider \nthis 3,000 units of supportive housing for the elderly, the disabled, \nand the homeless--the most fragile of our population. This is not \nnecessarily the working population. These people can't work. They are \ntoo old to work, they are too weak to work, or they are too sick. But \nit is, of course, our obligation to help provide them with permanent \nand safe places to live. We all have a percentage of the population. No \nmatter where you live, in the Northwest or in the Northeast or in the \nSouth, a percentage of the population has been overlooked.\n  With this in mind, we have to fight to get our homeowners back in \ntheir houses who are workers and business owners and professionals and \nupwardly mobile middle-class individuals. We have to fight hard to get \nour renters back. Some renters are upwardly mobile and middle class, \nsome very wealthy. They just choose not to own a home. There is another \ngroup of renters that are in subsidized rentals because they have to be \nbecause they are working at minimum-wage jobs. There is a whole other \ngroup of people who are neither homeowners, young and vibrant, in the \nmiddle class and younger, although they might have been at one time. \nThey are not in regular rental units. They are the fragile population. \nWe have virtually provided no additional funding for them. That is what \nmy amendment attempts to do. People are living with relatives. People \nare making ends meet. This amendment would provide $70 million for \n3,000 units of permanent supportive housing to assist these at-risk \nresidents.\n  As I mentioned, I was able to put this in the Senate-passed version \nof the emergency supplemental but, unfortunately, it was taken out. \nTherefore, I am here to show my support for this proposal, to \nrespectfully ask the chairman and ranking member who are handling this \nappropriations legislation to consider this important proposal again \ntoday. If it can't be adopted by this body today, I would like to ask \nthem whether they would be supportive of including this in the next \nsupplemental that comes before the Senate. I see the chairman of the \ncommittee on the floor. I would appreciate knowing if Senator Murray is \nsupportive of this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana has raised a \ncritically important issue with regard to the need of the disabled and \nhomeless citizens in Katrina-impacted areas she knows so well. We are \ngoing to be developing a supplemental appropriations bill in a very \nshort time which we anticipate will include provisions as it relates to \nKatrina. The Senator does have my commitment that I will work with her \nto see what we can do to address that critical need within the \nsupplemental.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2795, Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  With that commitment and the opportunity to speak on this important \nissue today--I know there are other amendments that will be \nconsidered--I am willing to withdraw my amendment at this time and will \noffer it again at an appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to have the previously \nmentioned article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 27, 2007]\n\n                            Home Sweet Home\n\n       Public housing advocates are gearing up for a sit-in at the \n     offices of the Housing Authority of New Orleans tomorrow. \n     Their frustration is understandable. Two years after \n     Hurricane Katrina scattered residents to communities outside \n     the Crescent City, most have yet to return home. But the \n     protesters' goal of getting the displaced back into their old \n     units is wrong. While the historical significance of those \n     structures is undeniable, so is their history of being \n     forlorn concentrations of poverty.\n       To tour the barracks-style apartment complexes of New \n     Orleans is to see the best and worst of public housing. \n     Because most of them were built in the 1940s, a walk into one \n     of their cramped units is a walk back in time. For instance, \n     residents can't run water in the bathtub and the bathroom \n     sink at the same time. Warmth in the winter is provided by \n     space heaters. For the most part, the old projects are cut \n     off from the flow of the city because the city's streets \n     don't go through them. Now, if you go to the redeveloped \n     Fischer and St. Thomas complexes, you'll see the best in \n     modern public housing. Warehousing of the poor and \n     marginalizing them from the larger community are out. Modeled \n     on HOPE VI developments, these are mixed-income neighborhoods \n     of townhouses. The homes are spacious. The appliances are \n     new. The sense of hopelessness that envelops Iberville, the \n     one fully functioning old-style public housing project, is \n     not present.\n       The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development wants \n     to bring four other old public housing estates into the \n     modern era. But a lawsuit by the Advancement Project, a \n     Washington-based civil rights organization, has stopped HUD \n     from doing so. The lawsuit accuses the agency of cleansing \n     African Americans from New Orleans by keeping the four public \n     housing projects shuttered. It demands a right of return for \n     all New Orleans public housing residents, and it demands that \n     those families go back to the units they fled on Aug. 29, \n     2005. Until the case goes to trial in November, those \n     families will have to wait. This is unconscionable. Yes, they \n     should return. But they should return to something much \n     better than they left.\n       At least one developer, Enterprise Community Partners, \n     which has been chosen by HUD to redevelop the Lafitte \n     project, has committed to providing a new public housing unit \n     to every family that lived there before in what would become \n     a mixed-income community. A bill sponsored by Sens. \n     Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Mary Landrieu (D-La.) would \n     make what Enterprise is voluntarily doing the law.\n       Donna Davis, 52, has lived in the projects since she was 9. \n     The pride in her two-story townhouse in the new Fischer \n     complex was plainly evident as she toured a visitor around. \n     When asked what she would say to people afraid of HUD's \n     redevelopment plans, Ms. Davis looked to her own experience. \n     ``We lived [in Fischer] and stayed there,'' she said. ``Now \n     it's time for us to grow and open up . . . to see how good we \n     can all live.'' If the Dodd-Landrieu bill passes, the \n     Advancement Project should drop its lawsuit. Returning public \n     housing residents deserve to have Ms. Davis's experience.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2816\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to display four charts during debate on the Klobuchar \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have consulted with everyone. As much \nas I would like to comply with the Senator, if we make it four, it is \ngoing to be six, it is going to be eight. I think we need to keep to it \na modicum that works for all Senators. At this point, I apologize, but \nI have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment offered \nby my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, and myself. The \namendment is only a few lines long, but it truly embodies the Minnesota \nspirit of perseverance and rebuilding in light of enormous tragedy.\n  Most of us in the North Star State won't ever forget the tragic event \nthat befell our largest city on ``eight one'' of this year. Just after \n6 p.m. on that day, the main transportation artery in\n\n[[Page S11378]]\n\nthe heart of Minneapolis, the Interstate 35W bridge, fell into the \nMississippi River, killing 13 people and wounding more than 100 others. \nThe images that began to appear on national news within minutes of the \ncollapse are still too difficult to describe with words, and the view \nbehind me only begins to outline the magnitude this disaster has had on \nthe Twin Cities and our entire region. The pictures hardly describe the \nextent of the tragedy.\n  As I mentioned on the floor of this body when Senator Klobuchar and I \nreturned from surveying the damage of the bridge collapse firsthand \nwithin hours of the tragedy, this area of the Mississippi River is one \nof Minnesota's most historic. It was here that Father Louis Hennepin \nnamed the falls of St. Anthony, pictured behind me upstream from the \nwreckage. You can also see Cadwallader Washburn's and Charles \nPillsbury's flour mills that sprang up along these falls, defining an \nera of growth in our State and earning Minneapolis the title of ``The \nmill city.'' These structures, these falls, and this river include so \nmuch of our State's history and identity, sitting on the headwaters of \nNorth America's greatest waterway. This is truly the heart of the \nheartland.\n  As I said on August 2, when this bridge fell, part of our Minnesota \nidentity fell with it. Within 60 hours of the bridge's collapse, we in \nthe U.S. Senate took action and committed the necessary Federal \nresources to rebuild this structure and to rebuild it quickly. I thank \nmy colleagues once again, as I thanked them before we adjourned for the \nAugust recess, for their commitment to the people of Minnesota and to \nreacting decisively when an emergency strikes in our Nation.\n  The actions we took in this body before recess set out a blueprint \nfor the future of the I-35W bridge and the entire Twin Cities region. \nWe provided authorization for emergency funding, $55 million of which \nwas sent to the Minnesota Department of Transportation almost \nimmediately to begin reconstruction of the bridge. We provided \nimmediate assistance in transit funding, including $5 million to assist \nthe Twin Cities in their most immediate transportation needs including \ndetours and temporary busing, and other Federal resources, such as Navy \ndive teams used to recover bodies under conditions in which there was \nno visibility, with current, twisted metal, steel, and \nconcrete. Without these resources, we would not have been able to move \nso quickly to bring some measure of closure to families who have \nsuffered so much.\n\n  Regional transportation administrators descended upon the Twin \nCities. Across the board, we reacted in a way that showed we were there \nto help and assist in recovery and in rebuilding. That was a good \nthing. But while these efforts were an important start, the bridge \nrebuilding process is steaming ahead with bid letting for the bridge \nthis week. I received a letter today from Assistant Transportation \nCommissioner Bob McFarlin from the Minnesota Department of \nTransportation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Minnesota Department\n\n\n                                            of Transportation,\n\n                               Saint Paul, MN, September 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Amy Klobuchar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman & Senator Klobucher: On behalf of the \n     Minnesota Department of Transportation, I want to thank you \n     and Congress once again for the quick response in authorizing \n     $250 million in emergency relief funding to help the state \n     respond to the I-35W bridge collapse. Congress and the entire \n     federal government's incredible response has greatly \n     facilitated the ability of the state to recover from this \n     tragedy.\n       Now the state is looking to Congress to quickly appropriate \n     the $250 million in emergency funding. The Untied States \n     Department of Transportation has made available $55 million \n     of the $250 million which is helping pay the initial costs of \n     recovery, cleanup, traffic re-routing, and bridge \n     replacement. However, this $55 million and the state's cash \n     flow will likely be depleted by October 2007.\n       The Minnesota Department of Transportation is proceeding \n     with bid-letting for the bridge replacement on or about \n     September 19th with award by the end of September. \n     Construction would commence in mid-October.\n       If the $250 million in federal emergency relief funding is \n     not appropriated soon, the state will be in a difficult \n     financial situation in trying to quickly replace this bridge \n     and keep other construction projects on schedule.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob McFarlin,\n                                    Assistant to the Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. At the impressive pace the Minnesota Department of \nTransportation is moving toward rebuilding this essential structure, \nthis letter states the funding we have already appropriated for \nreconstruction will likely run out by the middle of October, thwarting \nthe otherwise amazing progress we are making in recovery from this \nhorrible tragedy.\n  The Minnesota Department of Transportation will in all likelihood \nreceive funding someday from the Federal Government to complete \nreconstruction of this bridge. That is not at question. We authorized \nthat funding before we adjourned. What the amendment before us would do \nis simply expedite receipt of this funding so the State can continue \nits reconstruction process on this critical project. We all know it is \nnot easy to pass a bill around here. The people of Minneapolis and the \nTwin Cities are still dealing with an emergency, and they need \nemergency funding now. The reconstruction of the bridge stops when the \nmoney runs out. Who knows when we will have another chance to provide \nfunding for this horrible tragedy.\n  The time is now. We have a Transportation appropriations bill before \nus with a transportation emergency in our backyard. I ask my colleagues \nto help us rebuild, to help us recover, and to do so today for a \nbrighter future and a brighter tomorrow for the people of Minneapolis \nand the people of Minnesota, and, in fact, the people of the entire \nregion.\n  I urge support for the Klobuchar-Coleman amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized until 4:15.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2810\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are going to be voting on an amendment \nvery soon, amendment No. 2810. The whole point of this amendment is to \nreorder our priorities in terms of transportation. We have had \nsignificant debate on whether certain ongoing projects will be harmed.\n  We have seen a Department of Transportation inspector general's \nreport that lists five problems with what is happening right now. \nBasically, the conclusion of the report is earmarks are not the most \neffective or efficient use of funds--noncompetitively awarded \ntransportation earmarks.\n  Let me say that again. Noncompetitively awarded transportation \nearmarks reduce funding for each individual State's core transportation \nfunding. They are not in unison with DOT strategic research goals. As a \nmatter of fact, the research institute has oftentimes gone around with \nearmarks. They provide funds for projects that would otherwise be \nineligible for transportation funds. They disrupt the agency's ability \nto fund programs as designated when authorized funding amounts are \nexceeded by what they call overearmarking. That is the technique where \nwe put in an earmark, congressionally directed spending, but we do not \nput enough money in to pay for that congressional spending, so that \nexcess money goes against the rest of the transportation priorities. \nThen, finally, many low priority earmarked projects are being funded \nover higher priority nonearmarked projects.\n  This is a simple amendment that says we are not going to spend money \non earmarks unless they are for roads and bridges at this time. It does \nnot stop earmarks; it just slows them down and says: Whoa. This is a \nlower priority than what we are doing.\n  In this bill are over 500 earmarks that come right now to $2.8 \nbillion. Mr.\n\n[[Page S11379]]\n\nPresident, $2.8 billion would go a long way in terms of fixing the \ntremendous number of bridges that are structurally deficient in this \ncountry. That is just with the National Highway System. That does not \nhave anything to do with State transportation highways.\n  The real question for this body--and there have been many claims made \nagainst this amendment. No. 1, this amendment will not lessen the \namount of money that goes to State transportation departments. That \nmoney can be rerouted so certain things such as transit initiatives \nwill not have to stop. But what it will say is, the Senate is on record \nfor saying the highest priority ought to have the highest priority.\n  Minnesota is a tragic example of the misplaced priorities we have. Of \nthe billions and billions of dollars, well over 10 percent of the last \nTransportation bill--authorization bill--and a significant amount of \nthis bill will be spent on projects that are not a priority for a \nState, are not a priority for national transportation, but are our \npriorities. We can differ on what the low level priorities are, but \nnobody can deny we have a significant problem with structurally \ndeficient bridges in this country.\n  We are going to spend $600,000 on horse-riding facilities, $5.9 \nmillion on a snowmobile trail, $8 million on a parking garage, $532,000 \njust on one particular earmark for a pedestrian trail, $1.25 million \nfor a day center and park-and-ride facility, $3 million for dust \ncontrol mitigation, and $2.75 million for the National Packard Museum \nwhen we have bridges falling down?\n  I think we have plenty of room to reorder our priorities. This \namendment does not eliminate any earmark. What it does is delay it. \nThere is no question about it. But the purpose is to put us in touch \nwith the American people saying: First things first. This does not \neliminate addressing the 13,000 people who die every year on unsafe \nroads. Those funds are still available.\n  We heard from the Senator from Missouri that 400 people succumbed to \naccidents related to bridges in the last year. The fact is, we have had \nalmost 40,000 people die a year on our roads. A third of that is \nsecondary to alcohol excess. But another third of that is associated \nwith unsafe roads and bridges. That is according to the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Department of Transportation inspector general and an \naccompanying Executive Overview of Report AV-2007-066 of the Department \nof Transportation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Department of Transportation,\n\n\n                                  Office of Inspector General,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, \n         Government Information, Federal Services, and \n         International Security, Committee on Homeland Security \n         and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: We have enclosed the results of our \n     review of congressional earmarks within Department of \n     Transportation (DOT) programs, which we conducted in response \n     to your request. Specifically, you asked that we conduct an \n     independent analysis of the cost, oversight, and impact of \n     congressional earmarks for the most recent fiscal year.\n       We determined the total number and dollar amount of \n     congressional earmarks within DOT programs for fiscal year \n     2006, the inclusion of earmarks in DOT's annual planning and \n     evaluation process, and the effects of earmarks on DOT's \n     mission and goals.\n       This report provides our analysis of selected programs \n     within the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal \n     Transit Administration, and the Federal Aviation \n     Administration; these agencies accounted for 99 percent of \n     the earmarks (both in number and dollar amount) in DOT for \n     fiscal year 2006.\n       We want to express our appreciation to the Department and \n     the various stakeholder organizations for their cooperation \n     during this review.\n       If I can answer any questions or be of further service, \n     please contact me or Todd J. Zinser, Deputy Inspector \n     General.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Calvin L. Scovel III,\n     Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Over the past year, there has been considerable interest \n     and debate over congressional earmarks. According to the \n     Government Accountability Office, an earmark is a \n     congressional directive in legislation to a Federal agency to \n     spend a specific amount of its budget for a specific entity, \n     project, or service. Earmarking differs from the general \n     appropriations process where Congress grants a lump sum to an \n     agency to distribute according to the agency's authorized, \n     transparent, statutory criteria and merit-based decision-\n     making processes.\n       In a memorandum published in January 2006, the \n     Congressional Research Service reported that during the 10-\n     year period from fiscal year (FY) 1996 to FY 2005, the number \n     of earmarks within Department of Transportation (DOT) \n     appropriations acts and accompanying conference reports \n     increased by more than 1,150 percent--from 167 earmarks in FY \n     1996 to 2,094 earmarks in FY 2005. The amount of dollars \n     earmarked also increased by more than 314 percent--from $789 \n     million in FY 1996 to about $3.27 billion in FY 2005 (see \n     figure). Although down in numbers from FY 2005, DOT's FY 2006 \n     appropriations included 1,582 earmarks, of which 1,516 were \n     specifically identified in the conference report accompanying \n     the act.\n       Not only do earmarks originate in the appropriation \n     process, but they also enter the process through program \n     authorizations. Recent DOT re-authorizations have included a \n     significant number of specific projects with associated \n     funding directed to specific state and local agencies or \n     locations. For example, the current DOT authorization for \n     surface transportation, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \n     Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users \n     (SAFETEA-LU), accounted for 6,474 (80 percent) of DOT's 8,056 \n     earmarked projects for FY 2006. As with most DOT program \n     authorizations, SAFETEA-LU is a multi-year (5 years--from FY \n     2005 to FY 2009) authorization with specified percentages of \n     appropriated funds authorized each year for the given \n     agencies, programs, and activities.\n       In August 2006, Senator Coburn--then Chairman of the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government \n     Information, Federal Services, and International Security--\n     requested that we conduct an independent analysis of the \n     cost, oversight, and impact of congressional earmarks. As \n     Senator Coburn requested, we defined an earmark as a \n     provision of law, directive, or an item represented in any \n     table, chart, or text contained within a joint explanatory \n     statement or a report accompanying an appropriations or \n     authorization bill that identifies an entity, a program, \n     project, or service and the amount of assistance the Federal \n     agency is to provide.\n       Consistent with Senator Coburn's request, we determined (1) \n     the total number and amount of earmarks within DOT for FY \n     2006, (2) the inclusion of earmarks in DOT's annual planning \n     and project evaluation processes, and (3) the effects of \n     earmarks on DOT's mission and goals.\n       We focused our analysis on earmarks within DOT's programs \n     administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), \n     Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and Federal Aviation \n     Administration (FAA), because these three Operating \n     Administrations accounted for 99 percent of the earmarks for \n     FY 2006 (both in number and dollar amount) in DOT. Exhibits A \n     through E provide details on: (A) the total number and dollar \n     amount of earmarks by program with DOT for FY 2006; (B) \n     earmarked projects that bypassed established selection and \n     review processes or planning and programming processes; (C) \n     our analysis of earmarks' impact on agencies' programs; (D) \n     stakeholders interviewed; and (E) our objectives, scope and \n     methodology, and related audits. We conducted this review \n     between December 2006 and August 2007, in accordance with \n     generally accepted Government Auditing Standards as \n     prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States.\n       In February 2007, the President signed a joint resolution \n     passed by Congress that provided appropriations for FY 2007 \n     with a moratorium on earmarks. Section 112 of this joint \n     resolution states that ``any language specifying an earmark \n     in a committee report or statements of managers accompanying \n     an appropriations act for FY 2006 shall have no legal effect \n     with respect to funds appropriated'' under the joint \n     resolution.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has taken steps to \n     enforce the joint resolution by requiring that Federal \n     agencies only fund projects or activities that are \n     ``specifically identified in statutory text'' and ``in \n     accordance with authorizing law, using statutory criteria, \n     such as funding formulas, eligibility standards, and merit-\n     based decision-making.''\n\n                           Executive Overview\n\n       Overall, we identified 8,056 earmarked projects within the \n     Department's programs that received more than $8.54 billion \n     for FY 2006 (see exhibit A). Of the 8,056 earmarked projects \n     for FY 2006: 66 earmarked projects were specified in the text \n     of the appropriation act; 1,516 earmarked projects were \n     specified in the conference report accompanying the \n     appropriation act; 6,474 earmarked projects were identified \n     in the appropriation act's accompanying conference report \n     sections referring to distribution of FY 2006 authorized \n     funding as directed by SAFETEA-LU.\n       FHWA, FTA, and FAA accounted for 99 percent of these \n     earmarked projects, both in\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\n     number (8,011 of the 8,056 projects) and dollar amount (about \n     $8.49 billion of the more than $8.54 billion). FHWA had the \n     highest number of earmarked projects at 6,556, and FTA had \n     the highest percentage of its FY 2006 appropriation earmarked \n     at 28 percent.\n       Generally, before a capital or research project can receive \n     DOT funding, either discretionary or formula, it must be the \n     product of a planning process. Planning for highway, transit, \n     and airport improvement projects takes place at the local, \n     state, or Federal levels. For highway and transit projects, \n     each metropolitan planning organization (MPO), in cooperation \n     with the state and public transportation operators, must \n     develop a long-range transportation plan and a short-range \n     transportation program for the urbanized areas within the \n     state. Integral to the planning process is an evaluation of \n     factors such as a project's enhancement of mobility, \n     maximization of safety and security, relief of congestion, \n     financial viability, and protection of the environment. The \n     planning process culminates in a list of projects to be \n     funded within 4 years.\n       To be eligible for Federal funds, a project must be part of \n     the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), which is \n     approved by the MPO and the Governor, and the State's \n     Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), which is approved \n     by the Governor, FHWA, and FTA. Subsequent to the planning \n     process, FHWA and FTA select projects to receive \n     discretionary grants based on their merits as reflected in \n     the transportation plans. For formula grants, the states make \n     the selections based on their priorities and in cooperation \n     with the MPOs and local officials.\n       To be considered for funding under the Airport Improvement \n     Program (AlP), a project would be part of the national \n     Airport Capital Improvement Plan (ACIP), which is formulated \n     by FAA in cooperation with states, planning agencies, and \n     airport sponsors. In all cases, the planning process \n     culminates in a list of priority projects to be funded within \n     a given time frame.\n       However, our review of 7,760 earmarked projects valued at \n     $8.05 billion within FHWA, FTA, and FAA programs disclosed \n     that 7,724 of the 7,760 projects (99 percent) either were not \n     subject to the agencies' review and selection processes or \n     bypassed the states' normal planning and programming \n     processes. For example, 125 AIP projects, totaling almost \n     $201 million, were earmarked for FY 2006. Of the 125 \n     earmarked projects, 72 (about 58 percent), totaling $132.4 \n     million, were on FAA's list of candidates to receive AIP \n     funds for critical airport planning and development \n     projects--the remaining 53 projects were not. These 53 \n     projects, totaling about $68.5 million, would not have been \n     considered for funding in FY 2006 if they had not received \n     earmarks.\n       There were earmarked projects we reviewed that were \n     evaluated as ``highest'' priority projects and would have \n     been fully funded regardless of being earmarked. For example, \n     the New Starts Program is the Federal Government's primary \n     financial resource for supporting locally planned, \n     implemented, and operated transit fixed ``guideway'' systems. \n     From heavy to light rail, from commuter rail to bus rapid \n     transit systems, these projects have improved the mobility \n     of millions of Americans; helped to improve air quality; \n     and fostered the development of more viable, safe, and \n     livable communities.\n       However, earmarks may not be the most effective or \n     efficient use of funds on programs within FHWA, FTA, and FAA. \n     Many earmarked projects considered by the agencies as low \n     priority are being funded over higher priority, non-earmarked \n     projects. For example, for FY 2006, FAA considered 9 of the \n     10 new earmarked projects, totaling $31.5 million, in its \n     Tower/Terminal Air Traffic Control Facility Replacement \n     Program within the Facilities and Equipment account to be low \n     priority projects that would not have received funding \n     without the earmarks. Funding these new low priority projects \n     in FY 2006 added to the already substantial backlog of \n     replacement projects from earmarks in prior fiscal years and \n     caused FAA to delay the planning of its higher priority \n     replacement projects by at least 3 years.\n       Some earmarks are providing funds for projects that would \n     otherwise be ineligible. For example, for FY 2006, 16 of 65 \n     earmarked projects, totaling more than $14 million, in FHWA's \n     Interstate Maintenance Discretionary Program did not meet \n     statutory program criteria and would not have received \n     funding were it not for a section in DOT's appropriations law \n     that allows funding for earmarks that do not meet the \n     statutory requirements of the program.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. An investigation by the inspector general found the \nfollowing: For 2006, there were 8,056 earmarks within the Department of \nTransportation program, with a total of more than $8.54 billion, or \nover 13 percent of DOT's appropriation. So for one in seven and a half \ndollars, we have directed the spending, and for most of them, it is \nagainst the highest priority things we should be funding. So thinking \nabout the risks, thinking about the costs, thinking about our standing \nin terms of doing what we should be doing to make sure the highest \nordered priorities are taken care of--that the bridges that are \nstructurally deficient will be addressed, that the highways that do not \nmeet or exceed a good or acceptable level of safety--we ought to be \nredirecting this money in that direction. That is what this amendment \nis about.\n  We get three choices. We can table the amendment, as I think the \nmotion will be made so we do not have to deal with it, saying we should \nnot change our priorities. We can say yes, and we can renew the faith \nin the American people that we understand we are here to do priority \nwork. We are not necessarily here to do the next best thing for our \npolitical careers.\n  However you slice it, many of the earmarks are great things. They are \ngreat needs which have to be met at some point in time. But most of the \nearmarks that go for the bridges and roads will not be affected by this \namendment at all. The ones that will be affected are those earmarks \nwhich are not a priority.\n  I know we are going to have a vote. I want to give the subcommittee \nchairman, as well as Ranking Member Bond, a chance to answer this \ndebate. I will say I plan on offering this amendment in another form, \nif this amendment goes down, limiting it and more directing it, if in \nfact that is the case.\n  But we have a duty to do what is in the best interest of our \ntransportation needs in this country. I realize there is a debate, and \nI realize there is disagreement with me on this issue. But it is going \nto be hard for us as a body to justify 500 separate earmarks that do \nnot address the bridges in this country, will not help us assess that.\n  Earlier today, Senator Murray alluded to the $1 billion increase. \nWell, that is true, but we did not increase the money; we just made it \ntoward the Transportation fund. The trust fund will run out of money a \nyear earlier. So all we did was speed up spending that is allowed in \nthe trust fund that we have today, and that will be consumed more \nquickly. I agree we probably should do that. But we will, in fact, have \nto address this issue, and it is about priorities.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have had a good discussion with the \nSenator from Oklahoma earlier in the day. Just to recap for those who \nmay have missed it after he gave his eloquent pitch, I would say on \nbehalf of those of us who worked on the bill--certainly the great \nleadership of our chair, the distinguished Senator from Washington--\nthat when we put in earmarks, when we target specific investments to \nour State, they reflect the judgment of each Member of this body on \nwhat is important in his or her State based on what we hear from \nelected officials, transportation officials, and community leaders who \nsay these are their top priorities.\n\n  Now, my friend from Oklahoma is earmarking money for bridges. If he \nbelieves Oklahoma is not putting in an adequate share of its money for \nbridges, then we would be happy to entertain earmarks. But don't tell \nus to earmark ours. I work with the Missouri Department of \nTransportation officials. They say our highest needs are mostly in \nhighways. We don't want to lose that money from highways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Coburn amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to table the Coburn amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) \nand the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Idaho (Mr. Craig) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is no further debate and I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2816), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCornyn be recognized to offer an amendment related to Mexican trucking \nat 6 p.m.; that there then be 60 minutes of debate with respect to the \nCornyn amendment and the pending Dorgan amendment No. 2797 and that the \namendments be debated concurrently, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Dorgan and Cornyn, or their designees; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, without further intervening \naction or debate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Dorgan \namendment, to be followed by 2 minutes of debate, equally divided and \ncontrolled as noted above, prior to a vote in relation to the Cornyn \namendment; that no amendments be in order to any amendments covered in \nthis agreement prior to the vote; that after the vote with respect to \nthe Dorgan amendment, the vote time be limited to 10 minutes for the \nremaining amendment in this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oklahoma is on \nthe floor and will be offering an amendment in a minute. Prior to his \noffering that amendment, I ask that the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. \nKlobuchar, be given 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for working on a \nbipartisan basis. I thank Senators Murray and Bond for their work on \nthis issue and for passing the appropriation for the funding to fix the \nI-35W bridge in Minneapolis.\n  The Senate acted incredibly quickly after this tragedy occurred--\nAugust 1. The next day, Senator Coleman and I were there. We saw this \ntragedy firsthand and the heroic responses of our rescue workers in \nMinnesota. Ordinary citizens were diving into the water; they didn't \nknow whom they would find and they didn't know the danger. They rescued \npeople. It could have been so much worse. Our citizens came together \nand now this Senate comes together. I thank them for this. We are \nlosing about $400,000 a day. This was a major thoroughfare in our town \nand in our Twin Cities area.\n  We are going to rebuild. On the day that we went and saw the shards \nof steel and the broken bridge that had flopped into the middle of the \nMississippi River, I said that bridges in America should not fall down. \nThis bridge did. When bridges in America fall down, we must rebuild. By \ntaking this important action today to fund the rebuilding of the \nbridge, the Senate has started that process. I thank my colleagues. I \nthank Senator Coleman for cosponsoring my amendment. We will now move \non to rebuilding our bridge and bringing our beautiful Twin Cities area \nback to where it was.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is some confusion about my \namendment. I think we have reached an agreement, and we will shortly be \nsending up my amendment No. 2796, as modified. I believe it will be \naccepted on both sides. So we will stand by for that to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We have been \nworking with Senator Inhofe, and we believe we have a modification. As \nsoon as that is written up, we hope to get an agreement and move that \namendment forward.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2811\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2811.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2811.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds made available under this Act \n for bicycle paths so that the funds can be used to improve bridge and \n                              road safety)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be spent for bicycle paths or bicycle trails.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, maybe this will not be as painful an \namendment. Again, referencing what Senator Klobuchar said today about \nrepairing the bridge that has collapsed and cost 13 people their lives \nand many others injuries, we decided not to order priorities with the \nlast amendment but hopefully will give a little bit better \nconsideration to this one.\n  About 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, a friend of mine, who has been a friend for \nover 20 years, talked me into getting a bicycle. I have to say I have \nmarkedly enjoyed that exercise. This amendment says that for the $12 \nmillion to $18 million in this bill, which is not clear how much is \nactually for bicycle paths, we should not be spending money on bicycle \npaths for our own leisure, comfort, and exercise when we have bridges \nthat are falling down. It is very straightforward. It prohibits funding \nbicycle paths until we have our bridges and highways in order. Through \nthe years, we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on bicycle \npaths. It is great, it\n\n[[Page S11382]]\n\nis fun, they are enjoyable, but it isn't as important for us to have \nfun and enjoyment as it is for us to be responsible in repairing the \nroads and bridges in this country. This is simply a prohibition that \nsays for the funds that are in this appropriations bill for bicycle \npaths, we are saying, no we won't spend that money; we are going to \nspend the money on fixing roads and bridges.\n  I guess one could say we could do both. We can fix the roads and \nbridges and we can have bicycle paths. The problem is this body adopted \nan amendment creating another billion dollars for bridges just \nyesterday, and what that does is shorten the life of the trust fund. \nWhat it does is move the empty, the zero on that fund to 2009. We have \naddressed some of that, but we haven't addressed it near to the need I \nbelieve we should.\n  I ask my colleagues to give some thought about whether bicycle paths \nor the safety of our people in cars on bridges and roads in this \ncountry is more important.\n  I will give some examples. There is $3 million for three bike trails \nin Illinois. Illinois has 290 structurally deficient bridges.\n  There is $500,000 for the CEMAR Trail in Iowa. Iowa has 61 \nstructurally deficient bridges.\n  There is $500,000 in Maryland. Maryland has 43 structurally deficient \nbridges on the National Highway System.\n  Mississippi has $2.2 million earmarked for bicycle trails and has 28 \nstructurally deficient bridges.\n  Missouri has $750,000 for the Heart of America bicycle/pedestrian \nbridge and has 123 structurally deficient bridges on our National \nHighway System.\n  North Dakota has $800,000 for the Lewis and Clark Legacy Trail and \nhas nine structurally deficient bridges.\n  The State of Washington, the chairman's State, has three bike \nearmarks, $3 million, and 76 structurally deficient bridges.\n  West Virginia has 98 structurally deficient bridges, but yet $1 \nmillion is going to the Paw Paw Bends Trail in Morgan County.\n  That is not the complete list. I can go on. I have five more pages of \nStates around the country.\n  It is interesting that in Chesapeake, VA, the council voted in June \nto build a 2-mile bicycle path estimated to cost $16 million. That is \nto be paid for with federally earmarked funds and a match. The mayor of \nthat city, in arguing against this expenditure, cast the lone vote, \nsaying: It reminds me of a bridge somewhere to nowhere. You are talking \nabout Government spending. To spend that kind of money on a bike path \nthat would rarely be utilized is astounding to him. The traffic in that \narea, pedestrian and bike, is four people per day.\n  I don't deny that it is a wonderful experience that many millions of \nAmericans are getting to enjoy the bike paths we build. The question \nis, Should we stop for a while and do what we should be doing with our \nother transportation needs?\n  A quote from Mary Peters, Secretary of Transportation, is the \nfollowing:\n\n       Americans would be shocked to learn that only about 60 \n     percent of the gas tax money they pay today actually goes \n     into highway and bridge construction. Much of it goes to \n     many, many other areas. Ten to 20 percent goes into areas \n     that are not directly transportation related.\n\n  Bike paths and trails happen to fit into that category.\n  The highway trust fund was set up to build highways and maintain \nbridges. When 40 percent of it is not used to maintain highways or \nbuild bridges, we have missed the priorities the American people have \nasked for.\n  The last time the gas tax was increased in 1993, it was 4.3 cents. We \nhave had many people say we need a tax increase on transportation \ndollars to afford the Transportation bill. I don't believe that is true \nat all. I believe we ought to be spending the money on true \ntransportation needs--roads and highways and transit--and we should \nhave less of the other.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe Minnesota Star Tribune recently that noted the significant amounts \nof money that have been spent in that State on bicycle paths at the \nsame time the chairman of the Transportation Committee did not allocate \nthe funds, along with the State, to effectively solve the problems of \nthe I-35 bridge.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Minnesota Star Tribune]\n\n       [Minnesota Congressman Jim] Oberstar played a lead role in \n     crafting the 2005 bill as ranking Democrat on the House \n     Transportation Committee. In the bill, Congress allocated \n     about $4 billion a year for bridge reconstruction and \n     maintenance. It designated about the same amount--about $24 \n     billion over a five-year period--for member earmarks in a \n     bipartisan porkfest.\n       Ironically, $24 billion is almost exactly the amount that \n     Oberstar now says we must raise through new taxes to prevent \n     future bridge collapses.\n       Oberstar's earmarks were among the highest for any member, \n     totaling $250 million. What did they fund?\n       Not repair of the I-35W bridge, though the state had \n     identified cracks in the bridge as a major concern in 1999. \n     Oberstar's earmarks, which included many road-related \n     projects, also provided $25 million for Twin Cities bicycle \n     and pedestrian trails and lanes, and such ``high priority'' \n     items as $471,000 for the Edge of Wilderness Discovery Center \n     in Marcell.\n       He did slip in $1.5 million for a new bridge in Baxter--for \n     the Paul Bunyan bike trail.\n       Oberstar, an avid cyclist, has lavished federal gas-tax \n     dollars on bike trails for years. In 1991, he spearheaded \n     legislation that first allowed Highway Trust Fund monies to \n     flow to state bike trails.\n       Now Oberstar, has taken his enthusiasm for bikes a step \n     further. He recently amended a federal aviation law to allow \n     airports to spend federal funds on bike storage facilities.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I will limit my debate on this amendment and try to come \nback to the Chamber. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside and that we call up and consider amendments Nos. 2812, \n2813, and 2814, as a block of three amendments, to be debated en bloc \nand then to be voted en bloc. I ask for their consideration to be \navailable or time be made available to consider those amendments when I \nhave time to come back to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote in \nrelation to Coburn amendment No. 2811 occur upon disposition of the \nCornyn amendment relating to Mexican trucks and that no amendment be in \norder to the Coburn amendment prior to the vote; that there be 2 \nminutes for debate prior to a vote with respect to the Coburn \namendment, with the vote time limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my understanding is that the Senator from \nOklahoma is going to come back and debate his amendment that he \ncombined. Can he let us know what time he will be back so we can make \nsure we are able to fit in that debate time so we can possibly add the \nvotes on those amendments onto the end of the votes we now have \nstarting at 7 as well?\n  Before the Senator from Missouri speaks, let me say that when the \nSenator from Oklahoma comes back, then we will try to work with him to \nget a time agreement to vote as well at the 7 o'clock time so we can \nhave four votes and move expeditiously to finish this bill tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, before my friend from Oklahoma leaves, we \ntalk a lot about safety. This is one of the problems when we try to \ntake a meat ax to all earmarked programs in the States that have been \nworked out. I was working on another amendment, so I didn't hear \nwhether he mentioned the $750,000 for the Heart of America Bridge in \nKansas City. But in the interest of full disclosure, yes, we put in a \nretrofitting of a bridge to provide a barrier-separated crossing for \nbicyclists and pedestrians crossing the Missouri River from north \nKansas City to downtown Kansas City.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to yield.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 2812, 2813, and 2814, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I made an error in terms of calling up my\n\n[[Page S11383]]\n\namendments. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and that amendments Nos. 2812, 2813, and 2814 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2812, 2813, and 2814, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, the reason we put in a barrier on this \nbridge between north Kansas City, a vibrant growing community, and, of \ncourse, the heart of Kansas City, MO, is that many people cross that \nbridge on foot and on bicycles. The traffic is getting so heavy that \nthere is great danger to the pedestrians and bicycle riders. For those \nwho like exercise and like conserving energy, many people commute \nbetween north Kansas City and Kansas City, MO, by foot or on bicycles. \nBut for them to continue to do that, they need to be separated from the \ntraffic.\n  I drive on the streets of Washington, DC, where bicyclists are not \nseparated from traffic. It is always with great fear and trepidation as \nI am driving in two lanes of traffic coming to work in the morning and \nI see a bicyclist riding down the street between us. I just hope and \npray that I am not the one who hits that bicyclist and that nobody hits \nthem.\n  But if we are going to have bicyclists using roadways, please, let's \nput a barrier to separate the bicyclists and the pedestrians from the \ntraffic. If we are talking about safety, I believe this is one of the \neasiest points to understand, and that is why I object so strongly to \nsaying that any earmark we put in our States that deals with bicycles \nshould be struck.\n  Where is the sense in this body to tell the people of Kansas City and \nnorth Kansas City they cannot have a protected pedestrian and bicycle \nmeans of ingress and egress between north Kansas City and regular \nKansas City? It makes so much sense that I really hate to bring it up. \nThat is what this amendment would do. That is why I will strongly \noppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The distinguished Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I join my colleague from Missouri in \nopposing the amendment that has been offered by Senator Coburn. Under \nthe SAFETEA-LU authorization bill, that is the surface transportation \nauthorization law, the bill that defines all of the transportation \nprojects for the country, communities are required to prepare \ncomprehensive transportation plans in order to receive Federal highway \nand transit grants. Those plans have to include the communities' plans \nfor bike and pedestrian pathways. We set that policy because these \nplans are meant to be comprehensive, and our national policy has been \nto recognize bike and pedestrian pathways as one component of an \nentire, complete transportation system. They can't constitute the \nlargest part of the system, but a plan that ignores that element is not \ncomplete.\n\n  Now, there are three reasons our national transportation policy has \nrecognized the role of bike and pedestrian paths in the role of \ntransportation authorization. There is safety, there is mobility, and \nthere is our healthy communities about which we are all concerned. When \nwe put in adequate bike paths and walkways, what we are essentially \ndoing in many of our communities is protecting the safety of our \nfamilies and our neighbors. In many of our communities, without those \npaths, many more bicyclists and pedestrians would be forced to commute \nwith regular vehicle traffic.\n  Everyone on bicycle or on foot is vulnerable when they are mixed in \nwith heavy traffic. But I contend our school-aged children are often \nthe ones who are the most vulnerable, and that is why it is extremely \nimportant that we protect these kinds of pathways in our transportation \nbills.\n  When we put in place these bike paths and walkways, we also provide \nessential mobility to a lot of people who can't afford to drive a car, \nwho don't have a car, or for disability reasons can't drive a car. \nThese are people who sometimes can't afford the daily travel by car, \nbut they have their bike. They might like to travel by bus or a transit \nvehicle, but perhaps there aren't any available and so they are on our \nbikeways, bike paths, and walkways, and they need a mode of \ntransportation within our communities as well.\n  It wasn't very long ago I happened to read an article in the \nWashington Post about informal bike and pedestrian paths showing up all \nover northern Virginia. These are just foot paths now, apparently, and \nnot much more than grassy areas where commuters come and go on a daily \nbasis. From the story, it said most of the people walking along these \npaths can't afford to commute by train or by car. They are walking to \ntheir jobs every day. These jobs don't pay a lot. These families need \nto get to work to support their families, and so they are walking on \nthese pathways all over northern Virginia, the story tells us. The \nunfortunate part of that story, as I read it, is that these bike and \npathways crossed over four lanes of traffic, many times without any \ntraffic signals to accommodate them. So those commuters who are walking \non these paths scrambled every day to get across four lanes of traffic \nbecause the transportation system didn't protect them as bicyclists or \nas pedestrians.\n  So mobility is important and safety is important. But, finally, we \nall recognize that having healthy communities is an important part of \nour country today. In recent years, we have all become aware of how our \nphysical infrastructure affects our daily lives, and too often people \nfind themselves trapped in cars by a transportation network that will \nnot allow them to walk or bike to work, which can be an important part \nof an exercise regime for many who choose that. So these bike paths and \nwalkways provide an alternative to cars and help make our\n\n[[Page S11384]]\n\ncommunities more healthy and more like neighborhoods.\n  When the Senate passed the last Transportation authorization bill, \nthe so-called SAFETEA-LU, that bill recognized that bike and pedestrian \npathways were one component of a complete transportation system for our \ncommunities. The President signed that bill into law. Today, if we \nchoose to pick out this one mode of transportation and say we are not \ngoing to have bike paths or walkways, that we are excluding that from \ntransportation funding, we would be making, on the floor of the Senate \ntoday and in the Transportation appropriations bill, a major shift in \nour transportation policy.\n  So I hope our colleagues will take a serious look at this amendment \nand realize that it will affect the safety of many of our citizens who \ncommute to work, to school, and those who, in their daily lives, don't \nhave a car or who choose to walk for their own personal health or ride \na bike for their own personal health.\n  I hope the Senator from Oklahoma will wait to have this discussion \nwhen we are back on the floor during the reauthorization bill, which \nwill be occurring during the next couple of years, and he will then \nhave an opportunity to make his arguments at that time during the \nsurface transportation debate. But today we are not considering an \nauthorization bill. We are considering a transportation appropriations \nbill. And, yes, it does include an alternative for many people in this \ncountry, which is part of their transportation. It is part of their \ncommute to work or to school or their daily lives, and it is an \nessential part of this bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Coburn amendment, and we \nwill be having that vote certainly after 7 o'clock.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2796, as Modified\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set the current amendment \naside and call up amendment No. 2796 and send a modification to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 147, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       Sec. 414.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended by the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to \n     transfer the design and development functions of the FAA \n     Academy in their entirety or to implement the Air Traffic \n     Control Optimum Training Solution proposed by the \n     Administrator in its entirety prior to September 30, 2008.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe there is no further debate on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2796), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I see the Senator from Montana is on \nthe floor at this time and wishes to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I have a question for the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I have a statement that applies to servicemen going off to war in \nIraq from the State of Montana, which does not apply to this bill. It \nis a statement I want to make as in morning business. If the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has something applicable to this bill and he is time \nsensitive, I would defer to him, if he wishes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. I would respond to the Senator from Montana that we \njust adopted my amendment, as modified, and that is the reason I was on \nthe Senate floor at this time.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, first of all, I have a few comments to make about \nthe bill. I thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from \nWashington for their great work on this bill. I would hope that the \nSenate would pass this bill as it is because I think it is a good piece \nof legislation that fits the needs of our country very well.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Tester are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2797\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I want to speak for a moment about the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota relating to the cross-border \ntrucking demonstration program. That is the long title for the pilot \nproject to allow U.S. trucks to travel into Mexico carrying cargo and \nto allow a certain number of Mexican trucks, after inspection, to \ntravel into the United States carrying products for delivery here. This \nprogram has actually been planned over the past 14 years, but the \nSenator from North Dakota has an amendment that would deny the entry of \nMexican trucks into the United States on the grounds that the trucks \nparticipating in this program do not meet the same safety standards as \nU.S. trucks and, therefore, would be unfit for U.S. roads. If that were \ntrue, I would agree. But it is not true. I very much understand the \nSenate's role in protecting the safety and security of people on our \nhighways, protecting the American public. But in my view, the Dorgan \namendment ignores the numerous safety and inspection standards which \nare set in place by the Department of Transportation under this \ndemonstration program. In fact, the whole point of the demonstration \nprogram is to show that a safe regime for cross-border trucking can \nexist in a way that benefits both Mexico and the United States.\n  First, let me emphasize the minor impact the Mexican trucks will \nactually have on our U.S. highway system. The Department of \nTransportation authorized a maximum of 100 Mexican trucking companies \nto participate in the 1-year demonstration program, the same number of \nU.S. trucking companies that would be allowed to participate in Mexico. \nPreliminary information indicates there will be approximately 500 to \n600 vehicles involved. According to statistics released by the National \nTrucking Association, 5.1 million commercial trailers were registered \nin 2004 for business purposes here in the United States. Clearly, the \n500 to 600 Mexican trucks compared to 5.1 million American trucks is a \npretty miniscule number compared to our trucking industry as a whole.\n  As I mentioned, proponents of the Dorgan amendment claim that Mexican \ntrucks are too dangerous for U.S. roads. However, Mexican trucking \ncompany drivers and vehicles participating in this demonstration \nprogram must overcome multiple layers of safety and inspection \nstandards before operating in the United States. Let me describe in \ndetail the mandates the Mexican companies must meet to qualify for this \ndemonstration program.\n  The first layer of safety is an application process whereby any \ntrucking company that wishes to participate in the demonstration \nprogram must complete a 38-page application dealing with business \nactivities, cargo content, safety records, safety rules, and other \nrequired information. If a Mexican trucking company fails to meet any \nof those DOT standards, the application is denied. The next layer of \nsafety and inspection standards is a preauthorization safety audit. \nThis measure mandates that U.S. Federal inspectors must conduct a \nthorough safety audit of each Mexican trucking company business at the \ncarrier's headquarters in Mexico before it is granted authority to \noperate beyond U.S. border commercial zones. So U.S. inspectors will be \nat the Mexican trucking company site in Mexico performing this \ninspection, not only of the vehicles but of the entire operation. That \nis a major inspection. It seems to me it is a major way that we \npreliminarily qualify these Mexican companies for operation here.\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\n  Our inspectors must verify that the Mexican companies are complying \nwith the following U.S. standards: U.S. hours of service regulations, \ndrug and alcohol testing for each driver--these are completed by U.S. \nlabs, by the way--insurance with a U.S. insurance company--so this \nbusiness of not being insured in the United States is not correct--\nadequate driver qualifications, and a vehicle maintenance program. If \nthe company passes the compliance test, then the inspectors conduct a \nfull front-to-back review of each truck, which takes 45 minutes per \nvehicle, and they interview every driver who will participate in the \nprogram. These are U.S. inspectors in Mexico at the company site.\n  They then do a 45-minute inspection of the trucks, and they have to \nmeet the same safety standards as U.S. trucks traveling on our \nhighways. If the company passes the preauthorization safety audit, each \ntruck is then given a safety decal and that decal is only valid for 90 \ndays. So each truck will have to undergo a bumper-to-bumper inspection \nevery 3 months. Each truck is also given a unique decal. Every time the \ntruck crosses the border, Department of Transportation inspectors at \nthe border look for that decal. They verify that the driver is the one \nthe company has certified for that truck, and they check English \nlanguage proficiency and licensing requirements. They do all of that at \nthe border.\n  Finally, every vehicle and driver participating in the project will \nbe subject to roadside inspections, just as U.S. and Canadian drivers \nare. If at any point a Mexican truck fails to comply with just one of \nthe safety requirements, the truck and the driver will be placed out of \nservice immediately. The Mexican trucking company will then be subject \nto disciplinary action. All of these safety and inspection standards \nensure that Mexican trucking companies, vehicles, and drivers \nparticipating in the demonstration program abide by the same or, in \nsome cases, even stricter safety standards than U.S. and Canadian \ntrucking companies, drivers, and vehicles operating in the United \nStates.\n\n  Clearly, the Department of Transportation has worked hard to develop \nsafety and inspection standards designed and intended to protect \nAmerican highways and the public. It is for that reason that we should \nnot support the Dorgan amendment.\n  Remember, this is a pilot project, a demonstration project. To ensure \nthat its results are adequately reported to us and that the Department \nof Transportation makes no changes without notifying the Congress, \nSenator Cornyn has offered an amendment that will add those additional \nprecautions. Of course, those are worthwhile and I will support that. \nThe bottom line is, those people who fear that Mexican trucks will not \nbe held to the same safety standards as U.S. trucks in America are \nincorrect. They will receive the two inspections in Mexico, another \ninspection at the border, and the potential for an inspection anywhere \nelse on the highways, just as American trucks. Those inspections are \nperformed by U.S. inspectors.\n  It is worth giving this program a chance--a demonstration program \nonly--to see whether it will work. If it turns out it is too much \ntrouble and expense, it doesn't work, the Mexican drivers are not \nqualified, the trucks don't meet the standards, whatever else, then we \ncan adjust our program. But let's give the demonstration project a \nchance to also show that maybe our neighbors to the South deem it \nimportant enough for their vehicles to travel in the United States for \ntheir own commercial purposes that they care about this program and \nthey are going to make it work. If they do, it is much more efficient \nand much cheaper for American consumers, if those Mexican trucks can \ntravel in the United States, because the alternative is to offload the \ncargo in Mexico, reload it onto an American vehicle, and then have it \ncome into the United States, a very lengthy, time-consuming, and costly \nprocess.\n  The United States has always been a trading nation. It is our \nhistory. Americans have benefited throughout the centuries because we \nhave been a trading nation. Our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, like to \nbuy American products. They have things to sell to American consumers. \nSome of the finest tomatoes we are eating right now come through the \nport of entry in Nogales, AZ. I see the trucks lined up every time I go \ndown there. They are great products. Because they come in, they are \nfresher, less expensive, and they can be even more fresh and less \nexpensive if they don't have to offload the cargo and reload it onto \nAmerican carriers to be transported to final destination.\n  This is a way of demonstrating that we can make our commerce more \nefficient and less costly and speed products to market, if the Mexicans \nwill do their part and verify that their vehicles are safe on American \nhighways. Why not give them the chance? That is all this demonstration \nproject does.\n  To those who say: We don't think they will meet our standards, this \nis the time to tell. I think it would be unfair to American consumers \nif we try to prejudge that and say there is no way it can work so we \nare not even going to give it a chance. We should give it a chance. \nThen we can evaluate it. Then we can make our decision. In the \nmeantime, the Department of Transportation inspection demonstration \nproject should go forward. The Dorgan amendment should be defeated. The \nCornyn amendment should be adopted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2814\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nan amendment Senator Coburn is going to be offering in a few minutes. I \nrise today to say a few words about a construction project this \namendment is potentially eliminating. It is a construction project that \nis generating a lot of excitement and community pride in my home State \nof Montana.\n  While campaigning for this Senate seat this time last year, I \nrepeatedly said I support appropriations for projects that improve our \nNation's infrastructure--projects such as safer bridges, better water \ncanals, better highways, and improvements to our Nation's economic \ndevelopment. That is why I am following this project in Billings, MT, \nvery closely. The project is a major effort by the people of Billings \nto reinvigorate their city's economy by rebuilding a well-known \nlandmark--Cobb Field. Right now, crews are already working on the new \nstadium. Once finished, it will serve as a venue for sports, concerts, \nand art fairs throughout the year. It will attract visitors from all \nover the region.\n  The people of Billings are very proud of Cobb Field and the role it \nplays in their community. That is why they voted to raise their own \ntaxes by over $10 million to rebuild this stadium. They understand how \nimportant it is to be proud of a place where they can gather as \nfamilies, host visitors, and enjoy American pastimes.\n  The people of Billings also understand that the new Cobb Field will \nbe a major economic boost. It will be an asset to the entire region. \nThat is why I have requested the Senate invest $500,000 in this \nproject. Believe me, it will go a long way in Billings--a community \nthat has already done its part.\n  I believe this is a pretty darn reasonable request. The community \ndevelopment fund in this appropriations bill specifically sets aside \nmoney for projects that boost economies in cities such as Billings. \nWhat is the community development fund for if it is not for good \ncommunity development projects such as this?\n  I am asking my colleagues not to remove any Federal funding in this \ncommunity project. Instead, I stand before you to ask for a small \ninvestment in economic development for a growing community to provide \njobs, tourism, and overall economic growth.\n  While running for this Senate seat, I criticized Congress for \nsneaking in projects in the dead of night, attaching them to spending \nbills behind closed doors without any accountability. It happened a lot \nmore often than most people think. Our Government spent a lot of money \nwithout properly vetting it through Congress.\n  For the better, times have changed. I stand before you today to \nvigorously\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\ndefend why I requested this funding project in the light of day. I am \ngoing to bat for it because Cobb Field deserves the funding. There are \nno secrets here, there is no waste--just a good, worthwhile community \nproject that will only make a very special place in my home State even \nbetter.\n  I am not going to let Cobb Field strike out. It is too much of an \ninvestment by Montana folks who work hard and raise families. They are \ntaking it upon themselves to make their home better, and I will do \neverything I can to help.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2832\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, shortly, I hope we will be able to clear my \namendment No. 2832, which deals with mitigation assistance to eliminate \nthe default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied single \nfamily homes. As we all know, the subprime market collapse has caused \ngreat distress in the marketplace and in many of the entities that are \nengaged in issuing these subprime loans, and others, including hedge \nfunds, which were dealing in the secondary market with them.\n  I am not so much concerned if large institutions made bad gambles. We \ndon't want to engage in the moral hazard of bailing out large financial \ninstitutions that get out too far on the fringe and find out that \ninterest rates rise and they can't make the profits they thought. But \nwe are very much concerned about the individual homeowners who may find \nthat this subprime crisis is costing them their housing.\n  Therefore, this amendment we propose would take $100 million from the \nHOME program within HUD to allow for foreclosure mitigation activities. \nThe amount would go to organizations such as FHA, Neighborhood \nReinvestment Corporation, and State Housing Finance agencies to help \nidentify foreclosure alternatives and offer some homeowners, \nspecifically in subprime mortgages, an alternative to the prospect of \nforeclosure.\n  Recently published data from the Mortgage Bankers Association for the \nsecond quarter of this year shows that one in seven U.S. homeowners was \ndelinquent in their payments. Delinquencies in general rose to the \nhighest levels since 2002, to 5.1 percent of all mortgages, not just \nsubprime. These estimates also show that more than 600,000 homeowners \nare facing the prospect of foreclosure and repossession.\n  These numbers are the tip of the iceberg. Action needs to be taken to \nensure that where possible, good borrowers who happen to be in the \nsubprime category are not unfairly hurt by the housing downturn facing \nthis Nation. While price corrections are natural, and perhaps needed in \nsome markets today to balance against speculation and overt risk-\ntaking, rapid rates of foreclosures will only build additional \ninventory in an already flush housing market and may lead to an \novercorrection and a true recession in the housing market. Depending on \nthe severity of the housing downturn, this could create a major drag on \nother aspects of our economy and pull us into a recession.\n  However, we should not be quick to attempt to bail out or otherwise \ncreate moral hazard in the mortgage markets. This amendment, therefore, \nseeks to build cooperation between entities and the Federal Government \nneeded in the future in terms of preventing foreclosures and preventing \na truly catastrophic mortgage crisis. I strongly believe this is a good \nstep forward to help stem the tide of foreclosures without bailing out \nrisky lenders and speculators from the market. I urge my colleagues to \naccept this amendment.\n  I would also note that sometimes people who have limited incomes may \nnot be in a position to buy a home but may be better off renting. I \nhave been in rental housing in my lifetime, as many of us have been. I \nthink the recent efforts by the administration to push for home \nownership without regard, in too many instances, to the ability of the \nhomeowners to meet the payments is pushing the envelope too far. Some \nof the no-downpayment schemes that have been offered have put not only \nhomeowners at risk but whole neighborhoods at risk, where one or two \nforeclosures may totally cripple a vulnerable, but otherwise healthy, \nhousing neighborhood.\n  So we need to take a look carefully at the subprime market. We also \nneed to look at those practices which unnecessarily put at risk \nfamilies of modest income who may not be able to take on the \nresponsibilities and the financial burdens of home owning but would be \nbetter off renting.\n  So with that, I yield the floor, and I look forward to hearing our \ncolleagues talk about Mexican trucks.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2800, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2800.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2800.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified \nas presented to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to \n treat certain communities as metropolitan cities for purposes of the \n              community development block grant programs)\n\n       On page 137, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 232.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and that the following three amendments be \nconsidered en bloc: amendments Nos. 2832; 2800, as modified; and 2845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments en bloc.\n  The amendment (No. 2800), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2832 and 2845) were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2832\n\n   (Purpose: To establish mitigation activities and alternatives to \nmortgage foreclosure when viable and to reasonably ensure the long-term \n      affordability of any mortgage assisted under this amendment)\n\n       On page 95, after the period at the end of line 25, begin \n     with the following new paragraph:\n       Of the overall funds made available for this account, up to \n     $100,000,000 may be made available for mortgage foreclosure \n     mitigation activities, under the following terms and \n     conditions:\n       (1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     (``Secretary, ``the Department'') is authorized to provide, \n     or contract with public, private or nonprofit entities \n     (including the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and \n     Housing Finance Agencies) to make awards (with up to a 25 \n     percent match by an entity of the amount made available to \n     such entity) (except for the match, some or all of the award \n     may be repayable by the contractor to the Secretary, upon \n     terms determined by the Secretary) to provide mitigation \n     assistance to eliminate the default and foreclosure of \n     mortgages of owner-occupied single-family homes that are at \n     risk of such foreclosure, including mortgages known as \n     subprime mortgages;\n       (2) These loss mitigation activities shall only be made \n     available to homebuyers with mortgages in default or in \n     danger of default where such activities are likely to ensure \n     the\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\n     long-term affordability of any mortgage retained pursuant to \n     such activity; No Federal funds made available under this \n     paragraph may be provided directly to lenders or homeowners \n     for foreclosure mitigation assistance. An entity may use its \n     own funds (including its match contribution) for foreclosure \n     mitigation assistance subject to repayment requirements and \n     the regulations issued by the Secretary;\n       (3) Loss mitigation activities shall involve a reasonable \n     analysis of the borrower's financial situation, an evaluation \n     of the current value of the property that is subject to the \n     mortgage, the possible purchase of the mortgage, refinancing \n     opportunities or the approval of a work-out strategy by all \n     interested parties, and an assessment of the feasibility of \n     the following measures, including:\n       (I) waiver of any late payment change or, as applicable, \n     penalty interest;\n       (II) forbearance pursuant to the written agreement between \n     the borrower and servicer providing for a temporary reduction \n     in monthly payments followed by a reamortization and new \n     payment schedule that includes any arrearage;\n       (III) waiver, modification, or variation of any term of a \n     mortgage, including modifications that changes the mortgage \n     rate, including the possible elimination of the adjustable \n     rate mortgage requirements, forgiving the payment of \n     principal and interest, extending the final maturity rate of \n     such mortgage, or beginning to include an escrow for taxes \n     and insurance;\n       (IV) acceptance of payment from the homebuyer of an amount \n     less than the stated principal balance in financial \n     satisfaction of such mortgage;\n       (V) assumption;\n       (VI) pre-foreclosure sale;\n       (VII) deed in lieu of foreclosure; and\n       (VIII) such other measures, or combination of measures, to \n     make the mortgage both feasible and reasonable to ensure the \n     long-term affordability of any mortgage retained pursuant to \n     such activity.\n       (4) Activities described in subclasses (V) (VI) (VII) shall \n     be only pursued after a reasonable evaluation of the \n     feasibility of the activities described in subclasses (I), \n     (II), (IlI), (IV) and (VIII), based on the homeowner's \n     circumstances.\n       (5) The Secretary shall develop a listing of mortgage \n     foreclosure mitigation entities with which it has agreements \n     as well as a listing of counseling centers approved by the \n     Secretary, with the understanding that an eligible mortgage \n     foreclosure mitigation entity may also operate as a \n     counseling center.\n       (6) Any mitigation funds recovered by the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development shall be revolved back into the \n     overall mitigation fund or for other counseling activities, \n     maintained by the Department and revolved back into \n     mitigation and counseling activities\n       (7) The Department shall report annually to the Congress on \n     its efforts to mitigate mortgage default. Such report shall \n     identify all methods of success and housing preserved and \n     shall include all recommended efforts that will or likely can \n     assist in the success of this program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2845\n\n  (Purpose: To permit pilots to serve in multicrew covered operations \n                    until attaining 65 years of age)\n\n       On page 16, beginning with line 8, strike through line 2 on \n     page 18, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 115.

Age standards for pilots''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \njust used be equally divided from both sides between now and the hour \nof 7 o'clock. I remind all of our colleagues that at 7 o'clock we will \nbe having three votes on the amendments that are pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I could inquire of the Senator from \nWashington, my understanding is that from 6 to 7, there was to be \ndebate on the two amendments, Senator Cornyn's amendment and my \namendment, which will then be voted on as side-by-side amendments at 7 \no'clock, and that I would be allotted half the time.\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So let me ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak for 5 minutes on the Coburn amendment that I believe he has \nspoken about already dealing with the Peace Garden outside of that \nblock of time, and following that 5-minute presentation, the remaining \ntime would be split between myself and Senator Cornyn or his designee. \nI am not asking that the vote be extended; I am just saying that \nbetween now and 7 we are splitting the time with respect to the truck \namendments.\n  If I have 25 minutes, that is fine.\n  Might I ask with respect to the Peace Garden amendment, will there be \n2 minutes on each side prior to the vote on that amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me let the Senator know that between \nvotes we will have time for the Senators to discuss the amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2797\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this issue of Mexican long-haul trucking \ninto this country is an important issue, and I have offered an \namendment that is very simple. It is an amendment that is supported by \na number of groups: The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Citizens \nfor Reliable and Safe Highways, Parents Against Tired Truckers, Public \nCitizen, the National Farmers Union, the Teamsters, the Transportation \nTrade Department of the AFL-CIO.\n  In a newspaper article this morning, the American Trucking \nAssociation, which represents the trucking business, and which, by the \nway, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, said today it \nhas ``grave concerns'' about the Mexican trucking pilot project.\n  Here is the story: We passed NAFTA, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. I didn't vote for it. It was a horrible trade agreement, and \nit has demonstrated over the years to be a trade agreement that does \nnot represent our country's interests. We turned a very small trade \nsurplus with Mexico into a huge trade deficit. But aside from that, in \nthe passage of NAFTA, it was to harmonize at some point in the future \nthe ability to do long-haul trucking across Canada, the United States, \nand Mexico, but it was never anticipated that it would start in \ncircumstances where there were not equivalent standards and/or \nenforcement with respect to safety.\n  So I have very strong concerns because I don't think there is any \nevidence presented anywhere in this Chamber during this debate that we \nhave equivalent standards and enforcement with respect to safety, and \ntherefore I don't believe we ought to allow, at this point, the pilot \nproject to go forward that will have long-haul Mexican trucks coming \ninto this country now.\n  Now, let me describe a couple of things. First of all, it is \ncoincidental, perhaps, but yesterday, a great tragedy occurred in \nMexico, and I will describe it with this story that I saw yesterday \nmorning. A terrible truck accident occurred where 37 people were \nkilled; 150 people were injured in the blast. It left a crater of up to \n65 feet, and that was because one of the trucks was hauling explosives \nin Mexico. This is a great tragedy, this accident; so many people were \nkilled. Here is the crater in the road in Mexico. One of the trucks was \ncarrying explosives. This was in a mining area.\n  According to newspaper reports, the driver of the truck that was \ncarrying the dynamite was trying to overtake another truck carrying 25 \ntons of explosives in a trailer. The chief of police in the State where \nthe accident took place said the truck was not equipped to carry \nexplosives. The driver of the truck that was carrying the explosives \nfled the scene, and the bishop of the Catholic diocese in the area, the \ncapital of the border State where the crash happened said:\n\n       It's not possible to understand how a truck with 25 tons of \n     explosives could drive on the highway with no type of \n     protection.\n\n  Now, we know what would happen in this country if you were driving a \ntruck with explosives on board. We have safety requirements that are \nstringently enforced. You have to have vehicles in front and vehicles \nbehind and proper signage. That was not the case yesterday in Mexico. I \nam not suggesting that is a circumstance which would exist in this \ncountry, but I am saying we don't have equivalent standards between \nthis country and Mexico--not yet. Some day, when they exist, I will not \ncomplain about a pilot project, but today I will complain about it \nbecause those equivalent standards don't exist.\n  Mr. President, the inspector general's report described the \nfollowing. I mention that report because last Thursday, at 7:30 in the \nevening, the IG issued a report. The report was required because of an \namendment I offered, and others, that said the Department of \nTransportation cannot move to begin a pilot project of having long-haul \nMexican trucks come into this country until the IG has done a report. \nThe IG did a report, and at 8:30 the Department of Transportation, 1 \nhour later that evening--apparently they had taken a speed-reading \ncourse--decided it was going to implement the pilot project right then.\n  Here is what the IG report says:\n\n       While the DOT officials inspecting Mexican trucking \n     companies took steps to verify onsite data, we noted that \n     certain information was not available to them. Specifically, \n     information pertaining to vehicle inspections, accident \n     reports, and driver violations maintained by Mexican \n     authorities . . .\n\n  What does that mean? It means the most important information by which \nyou would judge whether we ought to allow long-haul trucks to come into \nthis country from Mexico is not available. They go on to say that they \nwere able to get some if they were able to obtain it from the company's \nrecords by the generosity of the company. But no data bank was \navailable. The information wasn't available. They were not able to get \ninformation about vehicle inspections, accident reports, and driver \nviolations. I am sorry, that is the ball game, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  This is about safety. We developed standards in this country to \nprovide basic safety for the American people. If you want to obliterate \nthose standards, go ahead, but it won't be with my support and vote. \nThe Department of Transportation is making a mistake, in my judgment. I \nmentioned the three areas that we are taking on faith because we could \nnot get the information, and there is no such data bank. Does that make \nyou feel comfortable? It doesn't me.\n  There are a whole series of questions and problems raised in the IG's \nreport. Yet we are told that we have enough information, let's just \nproceed. I don't think it is wise to proceed.\n  My colleague from Texas is going to offer an amendment that will say: \nNo, no, let's let this proceed and see what happens. My colleague from \nArizona said let's go ahead and try this and see what happens. We are \ngoing to see what happens? No, no. In my judgment, we ought to certify \nthe ability to have long-haul trucking coming from Mexico into this \ncountry when we have decided there is safety for American drivers and \nsafety on American roads and that we have been able to determine that \nequivalent enforcement and equivalent standards exist. That is not now \nthe case. The IG's report demonstrates that. So I don't understand the \nrush. What is the requirement for speed and why the urgency? Why not \nstand up for the standards we have created in this country?\n  If I might, I believe I have a copy of the IG's report. I will read \nsomething else. On page 2, it says that the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration, which is part of the Department of \nTransportation, agreed to develop a plan to check every truck every \ntime. They are saying: No, it is going to be fine; we are going to \ncheck every truck coming across the border every time. But they say \nthat as of July 2007, no coordinated, site-specific plans to carry out \nsuch checks were in place. They say they would have the plans by August \n22, 2007, but we have not received any outlines or any completed plans.\n  They say this:\n\n       In our opinion, not having site-specific plans developed \n     and in place prior to initiating the demonstration project \n     will increase the risk that project participants will be able \n     to avoid the required checks.\n\n  Once again, they say that we will check every truck every time. The \nIG says that the way it works is we now have a greater risk and they \nwill be able to avoid the required checks. That is not from me, it is \nfrom the IG's report.\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\n  So I offer on behalf of myself and Senator Specter an amendment--\nbipartisan, with a good many cosponsors--that says let's stop this \npilot program. It should not have been initiated last Thursday. The \nHouse of Representatives already voted to do so by voice vote. The \nHouse has done this already. I hope the Senate will do the same this \nevening.\n  My colleague will offer an amendment that sounds as if it is wrapped \nin a bouquet of flowers. The very last sentence says: Let's fund this \nproject. So we can skip the preamble and say: Do you want to fund this \nproject or not? Do you believe we ought to have long-haul trucks from \nMexico under these circumstances at this time or don't you? If you \nbelieve we are not ready, that there is not and will not be at this \npoint equivalent standards and enforcement and, therefore, assured \nsafety for the American people, if you believe that--and I think the \nevidence is clear--then you vote for the amendment I have offered with \nSenator Specter and others. If you believe we should proceed with this \nlong-haul Mexican trucking coming into our country at this moment, then \nvote with Senator Cornyn and his amendment.\n  I hope most Members of the Senate will reject what a colleague of \nmine said last evening. This amendment is just making Mexico a \nbogeyman, I think is what he described. This is much more serious than \nthat. There will be people driving up to 4-way stop signs in this \ncountry or driving down a 2-lane or 4-lane road in this country next to \nan 18-wheeler, and the American people want to know whether that has an \nequivalent inspection to what we have. Do they have logbooks and \nrecords, and are they obligating themselves to the same requirements as \nthis country? The answer, quite clearly, in my judgment, looking at \nwhat the IG has said, is that there is nobody in this Chamber who can \ngive that assurance, and if that is given, it is given without any \ndocumentation at all.\n  I have other things to say. I want others to proceed to make their \ncase. I hope to be able to close the debate this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think it would be helpful for Members of \nthe Senate to recount the history of this pilot program because it \ndemonstrates that this pilot program was adopted as part of the treaty \nobligations of the United States, dating back to 1993. I know that \nseems like a long time ago. It was certainly long before I got in the \nCongress. But I do believe this is relevant to the debate.\n  Of course, in 1993, the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, \nwas adopted. But, relevant to this amendment, it had the requirement \nthat signatory countries--in other words, Canada, Mexico, and the \nUnited States--are to give each other access to each other's long-haul \ncommercial trucks. There was initially a refusal to enact the provision \nwith regard to Mexican trucks, and in 1995 Mexican trucks were to have \nbeen given full access to four U.S. border States.\n  In 2000, under NAFTA, this 1993 treaty obligation, Mexican trucks \nwould have been given full access throughout the United States.\n  In 2001, this matter was taken to a NAFTA arbitration panel, which \nruled that the United States is in violation of its commitments under \nNAFTA and must open up its highways to Mexican trucks.\n  In 2001, Congress passes the 2002 Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill, which set 22 safety-related preconditions for \nopening the border to long-haul Mexican trucks.\n  In 2002, the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, announced \nthat all of the preconditions--those 22 safety preconditions--had been \nmet and directed the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to act \non the Mexican application.\n  In 2003, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delayed implementation of \nthis provision. But then, in June of 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court \nreversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit and ruled that Mexican \ntrucks could operate in the United States pursuant to the 1993 NAFTA \ntreaty.\n  In 2007, the administration announced a pilot project to grant \nMexican trucks from 100 transportation companies full access to U.S. \nhighways.\n  In May 2007, the Iraq war supplemental mandates that any pilot \nprogram to give Mexican trucks access beyond the border region cannot \nbegin until U.S. trucks have similar access to Mexico and requires a \nreport of the Office of the IG.\n  In September 2007, the Office of the IG issued its report. The next \nday, the administration issued its first permit to enter the United \nStates under the program.\n  I wish to address the concerns many of my constituents have addressed \nto me regarding the Mexican truck demonstration program because I think \nwe ought to be guided by the facts and not solely by fear. I \nunderstand, however, the fear people have of unsafe trucks coming into \nthe United States. Frankly, I would not for a moment tolerate that, nor \ndo I believe would any Member of the Congress. I firmly believe the \nAmerican people must have confidence that their family's safety is not \nendangered by any truck, whether it be Mexican, American, or Canadian.\n  As my colleagues know, as I have just recounted, the United States is \nunder a treaty obligation through NAFTA to open our interior to long-\nhaul trucks from Canada and Mexico, just as they are required to open \ntheir highways to American truckers. I believe we should live up to our \ntreaty obligations, and I say that even if I don't necessarily agree \nwith them because they are, as a matter of fact, the law of the land, \nand whether I agree with it or the Senator from North Dakota agrees \nwith it, once the matter is adopted as a treaty obligation of the \nUnited States, it is litigated not only by the NAFTA arbitration panel \nbut by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, \nand I think his opinion or mine about whether it is something we prefer \nto happen becomes pretty much a moot point if we are to be a nation of \nlaws and respect the judgments of the courts, even if we don't happen \nto like it.\n  I do believe we have a high obligation, however, to ensure that the \ntrucks on our roads live up to the high standards of safety the \nAmerican people demand. So I think it is important for people to \nunderstand what this demonstration program entails because there has \nbeen misinformation about it.\n  Under this program, 100 precertified Mexican trucking companies would \nbe able to expand operations beyond the U.S. border zones. At the same \ntime--and this is an important part of the deal--100 U.S. trucking \ncompanies would be allowed to operate in Mexico. This is not a one-way \nstreet; it is a two-way street when it comes to international trade and \ncommerce. As required by Congress, Mexican trucks must have a U.S.-\nbased insurance policy, must comply fully with hours of service \nregulations, must maintain vehicles to U.S. carrier standards, and \ndrivers must be able to communicate in English so they can understand \nthe instructions of law enforcement and other safety personnel. They \nmust also pass drug and alcohol testing requirements.\n  Many of the safety provisions included in the program the Department \nof Transportation has adopted, in fact, go well beyond what Congress \nhas required to date. I am here today to have a real debate about \nsafety and what we in Congress can do to take concrete steps to ensure \nthe highest standards of truck safety.\n  The solution to me is simple, and it is embodied in my amendment, \nwhich we will have an opportunity to vote on. My amendment, for the \nfirst time, will make it U.S. law that every truck participating in the \ndemonstration program must be inspected every 3 months to the same \nstandard as U.S. trucks. Every driver entering this country under the \nprogram will have to verify compliance with safety requirements, and \nthey would have to do so every time they entered the United States.\n  The Department of Transportation's inspector general will be required \nto certify soon after the program is fully implemented that the \nDepartment has, in fact, inspected every truck and verified every \ndriver. This is the Department of Transportation of the United States \nGovernment; no other government. They must verify every truck \ninspection and verify every driver. If the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Transportation fails to\n\n[[Page S11390]]\n\ncertify such, then funding for this program will be automatically \nsuspended.\n  Under this approach, for the first time, we will statutorily enshrine \nin American law the principle that we inspect and certify every Mexican \ntruck that enters the United States through this program.\n  It is also worth noting that this will be the first time in the \nhistory of the program that there will be an actual congressional \nrequirement for the inspector general to certify the program. \nPreviously, Congress has only required the inspector general to review \nthe program.\n  Finally, my amendment will require the administration to provide 60 \ndays' notice to Congress should they wish to extend or otherwise \ncontinue the demonstration project. Such notice will give this body \nample time to consider the merits of the program as implemented and \nwhat modifications, if any, we want to make.\n  By moving forward on a conditional basis with a threat of a full \nshutdown if the inspector general finds the program is noncompliant, we \nwill further incentivize the Department of Transportation to \nstrenuously enforce the safety inspection and verification requirements \nunder this new law.\n  It is also worth noting that the Department has already taken a ``go \nslow'' approach--I am glad they have--planning to allow only up to 25 \ncarriers per month into the program in the first 4 months. Even at the \nheight of the program, the Department expects a maximum of 500 to 600 \ntrucks to participate, compared to the millions of domestic and \nCanadian trucks that currently operate on our roads.\n  I have heard the claim has been made that there are no site-specific \nplans for each point of entry to ensure compliance with new \nverification and inspection standards. The Department of Transportation \ndid, in fact, develop site-specific plans for all 25 commercial \ncrossings in full coordination with Customs and Border Protection, and \nother relevant agencies, although they did not finish them in time for \nthe inspector general's data collection.\n  Furthermore, the inspector general raised concerns about training of \nState enforcement officials. Of course, any time a new policy is \nenacted, there will be challenges as personnel become accustomed to the \nnew rules. That is why the Department has conducted and will continue \nto conduct rigorous training with State enforcement officials. And it \nis important we not look to training as a one-shot deal. Many of the \nlessons on how best to ensure the safety of trucks entering this \ncountry will be learned on the ground.\n  I believe that instead of trying to kill this program, which will \nviolate the treaty obligations of the United States of America as \ninterpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court and international arbitration \npanels, we in the Congress have a duty to find workable solutions that \nensure as much as humanly possible the safety of trucks on our roads \nand make sure, whether they be American trucks or Mexican trucks or \nCanadian trucks, that they are all held to the same high standard.\n  My amendment will do this, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 12 minutes 6 \nseconds; the Senator from Texas has 13 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to close debate, if possible, at \nsome point. Does the Senator from Texas have other speakers?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are checking, and we will be able to \nlet you know momentarily.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2842\n\n  Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2842 to the pending bill \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2842.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that every motor carrier entering the United States \n    through the cross-border motor carrier demonstration program is \n  inspected and meets all applicable safety standards established for \n                United States commercial motor vehicles)\n\n       On page 70, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 194. (a) Not less frequently than once every 3 months, \n     the Secretary of Transportation shall inspect every \n     commercial motor vehicle authorized to enter the United \n     States through the demonstration program to ensure that every \n     participating commercial motor vehicle complies with all \n     applicable safety standards established for United States \n     commercial motor vehicles.\n       (b) The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct an on-\n     site preauthorization safety audit of every motor carrier \n     domiciled in Mexico that participates in the demonstration \n     program to ensure compliance with all applicable safety \n     standards established for motor carriers domiciled in the \n     United States.\n       (c) The Secretary of Transportation shall verify, at the \n     point of entry, the safety compliance of every motor vehicle \n     and motor vehicle operator that enters the United States \n     through the demonstration program to ensure that every motor \n     vehicle and motor vehicle operator meets all applicable \n     safety standards established for United States commercial \n     motor vehicles and motor vehicle operators.\n       (d)(1) Not later than 120 days after the commencement of \n     the demonstration program, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Transportation shall submit a certification to \n     Congress that the Secretary of Transportation is in \n     compliance with this section.\n       (2) No funds made available under this Act may be used for \n     the demonstration program if the Inspector General fails to \n     submit the certification required under paragraph (1).\n       (e)(1) Not later than 60 days before implementing a cross-\n     border motor carrier inspection program based on the \n     demonstration program, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     submit written notification that describes the Secretary's \n     intention to implement the inspection program to--\n       (A) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     of the Senate;\n       (C) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (D) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (2) The Secretary may not implement the inspection program \n     if Congress passes a law that terminates the program.\n       (f) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``commercial zones'' means the commercial \n     zones along the international border between the United \n     States and Mexico; and\n       (2) the term ``demonstration program'' means the cross-\n     border motor carrier demonstration program that authorizes \n     motor carriers domiciled in Mexico to operate beyond the \n     commercial zones along the international border between the \n     United States and Mexico.\n       (g) Of the amounts appropriated for the Office of the \n     Secretary under this title, sufficient funds shall be made \n     available to the Secretary of Transportation to carry out \n     this section.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to withhold his request \nfor a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will you notify me when I have 7 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment that has just been described \non page 4 ends with:\n\n       Of the amounts appropriated for the Office of the Secretary \n     under this title, sufficient funds shall be made available . \n     . . to carry out this section.\n\n  This is simply a mechanism to say let's just do this; let's fund it.\n  The point I have made is very simple. There is no treaty that would \nrequire this Senate to decide to have something happen on our highways \nthat we believe not to be safe. There is no treaty that requires us to \nopen our borders to long-haul Mexican trucking at this moment unless we \nbelieve there is safety and soundness to that proposal. I do not \nbelieve that is the case.\n  Let me again describe the three conditions that represent the \nproblem. The suggestion that every truck will be inspected every time \nis simply not the case. On page 2, it says, from the inspector \ngeneral's report, that it will not be the case:\n\n\n[[Page S11391]]\n\n\n       In our opinion, not having site-specific plans developed \n     and in place prior to initiating the demonstration project \n     will increase the risk that project participants will be able \n     to avoid the required checks.\n\n  This is not a legal issue; frankly, it is a safety issue. The \nquestion of accident reports, vehicle inspections, driver violations, \nthe fact there is no national database--that is not me saying that, \nthat is the inspector general--there is no national database, there is \nno database they can go to get this information, the fact that this \ninformation doesn't exist means that we don't know what the \nconsequences will be.\n  One of my colleagues earlier said: Let's try it. That is probably \nfine, if he feels like pulling up to a four-way stop sign next to an \n18-wheeler to try it and see whether there were vehicle inspections \nthat were adequate or whether it has a driver who might have had three \ndrunk driving accidents or perhaps 10 speeding violations nobody knows \nabout because there is no database. Let's try it? How about let's not \ntry it with our families or with the families of other Americans.\n  Sheryl Jennings McGurk describes her family's experience. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a two-page statement \nfrom this woman, Sheryl Jennings McGurk.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement From Sheryl Jennings McGurk in Support of Dorgan-Specter \n                     Amendment, September 11, 2007\n\n       On behalf of all members of my family, including my parents \n     and nephew lost in 2005 in a horrendous and unnecessary crash \n     with a large truck that should never have been where it was, \n     I strongly support the Dorgan/Specter amendment that will \n     prevent any spending to carry out the Mexican truck pilot \n     program begun by the federal government last week. We hope \n     that telling the story of what happened to my family will \n     help prevent others from going through what we have and what \n     we will continue to go through for the rest of our lives.\n       My husband Sean and I were married on June 6th, 2004. This \n     was an extraordinarily special day for us because it was also \n     my parent's 45th wedding anniversary. They were married \n     following my father's graduation from the first class of the \n     United States Air Force Academy in 1959. I had a very close \n     relationship with my mom and dad, they were not just my \n     parents but they were also my best friends! They asked us to \n     share this date with them forever and of course we accepted, \n     hoping to be blessed with a long and happy marriage. It was a \n     special day shared by our family.\n       My mom, Marie Jennings, was a beautiful, stylish, lady and \n     her bouncy and adventurous personality was the perfect \n     compliment to my dads more serious and quiet demeanor. My mom \n     served our country first as the wife of an Air Force officer, \n     and next as a mom, raising myself and my two older brothers, \n     David and Bob; swim team, soccer, boy scouts, girl scouts, \n     you name it, we kept her quite busy! We moved across the \n     country and around the world. As we grew up, she decided to \n     use her talents by working for the federal government as a \n     civil servant and she did so, for 25 years.\n       My dad was an officer and gentleman! He retired as a \n     colonel after 27.5 years. He served first as a fighter pilot \n     in Vietnam where he was awarded the Distinguished Flying \n     Cross. He later became a test pilot and an instructor pilot. \n     During his career he flew almost all the planes the AF had at \n     the time. He loved to fly and had recently been recertified \n     so he could fly with his friend to attend an air show in \n     Oshkosh, WI. During his career, he still made time to be my \n     dad as a soccer coach, a ski buddy, and a private tutor. \n     Later on he decided to continue to serve his country by \n     teaching high risk youth at Hollywood High School in Los \n     Angeles, young adults at the University of Phoenix and he \n     also volunteered teaching for free at private schools.\n       My nephew, David Michael Jennings, was a great kid! He was \n     my brother David's only son and the first grandchild. He was \n     born in Beavercreek, Ohio. He was active in high school. He \n     played football, the French horn in the marching band, ran \n     track, and was active in the Spanish and math clubs. David \n     was an Eagle Scout, quite an honor for any young man. He was \n     active in his community and his church. He volunteered as \n     team captain for Relay for Life and the Special Olympics. \n     Upon graduating high school, he left home to live with my \n     parents and attend junior college. He was completing his \n     sophomore year at Mira Costa College where he was a Student \n     Ambassador and active in student government. He sponsored a \n     5K run for charity and beach clean-ups in Carlsbad, CA. He \n     was transferring to UCSD in the fall.\n       On February 15th, 2005, just 8 months after we were \n     married, my mom and dad started out on exciting journey to \n     visit my oldest brother, Bob, his wife Sandy, and their \n     youngest grandson, Jack. David volunteered to take my parents \n     to the airport. Unfortunately, their journey was cut short \n     only 30 miles from their home in Carlsbad, CA.\n       It was around 5 a.m. A truck from Mexico was headed north \n     on I-5 when the driver thought he was having mechanical \n     issues. He pulled his truck off the freeway to check it out. \n     At that time he decided he would not be able to get his truck \n     from where he now was to Los Angeles where he needed to \n     deliver his goods. He decided to take his truck back onto the \n     freeway and headed south. It was a bad decision. His truck \n     proceeded to break down in the middle of the freeway. My \n     parents and nephew never had a chance.\n       This accident was 100 percent avoidable. The truck had \n     numerous safety issues and should not have been operating in \n     the United States. For this, our lives are forever changed \n     and we lost three of the most incredible people. This loss \n     has left a hole in our lives that cannot be filled. To lose \n     your mom, your dad, and your nephew; all at once; is \n     indescribable. Your world changes in an instant.\n       Please help ensure this doesn't happen again. Vote for the \n     Dorgan/Specter amendment. Safe roads are everyone's \n     responsibility.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, she describes an accident south of Los \nAngeles that took the life of several members of her family, an \naccident that was totally avoidable, she says. I quote her last \nparagraph:\n\n       The accident was 100 percent avoidable. The truck had \n     numerous safety issues and should not have been operating in \n     the United States. For this, our lives are forever changed \n     and we lost three of the most incredible people [from our \n     family].\n\n  This was a truck from Mexico headed north on I-5, a truck that had \nmechanical problems, a truck that had numerous safety issues. Three \npeople are dead. This is not a legal issue, not for the Senate; this is \na safety issue. And if you believe that you have all of the assurances \nyou need that this will be safe, then I understand your vote. But if \nyou look at what the inspector general report says clearly--the \ninspector general report says we don't have information on these key \nissues, the issues we would need to know before we decide to allow \nlong-haul Mexican trucking into our country.\n  As I indicated earlier, the American Trucking Association is an \nassociation that supported the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nClayton Boyce, the vice president of public affairs for the American \nTrucking Association, said today, in fact:\n\n       The group has grave concerns about how the pilot project \n     will be carried out and whether it will be safe.\n\n  Even though they supported NAFTA. Let me say that again. The American \nTrucking Association said:\n\n       The group has grave concerns about how the pilot project \n     will be carried out and whether it will be safe.\n\n  I don't believe this is a legal issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that he has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This Congress has the right to make decisions about \nsafety on our highways. We made those decisions in many ways with \nrespect to our internal regulations, our internal standards, and we \nenforce those standards, but that equivalent enforcement does not exist \nin Mexico at this point. If it existed, we would have a database in \nMexico that would tell us immediately and quickly accident reports on \ndrivers and vehicles, vehicle inspections, and driver violations. No \nsuch database exists, and that is the problem. That is why I think this \npilot project is unwise. It is why Senator Specter, I, and others have \noffered an amendment to stop this pilot project.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yield yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I guess I have to agree with the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota that there is no legal issue \nbecause, frankly, the legal issues have all been decided, all the way \nup to the U.S. Supreme Court and by the NAFTA arbitration panel. So, in \neffect, the mandate to allow Mexican trucks that meet high safety \nstandards is the law of the land. The question is whether we are going \nto comply with it in a way that protects the safety of the driving \npublic in America.\n  My amendment makes clear that we should maintain and mandate high \nstandards, and my amendment does that. I would never tolerate an unsafe \ntruck on our American highways, particularly on Texas highways. I don't \ncare whether it comes from Mexico or Canada or from the United States, \nwe should not tolerate unsafe trucks. What my amendment does is it \nmakes sure that those high safety standards are enforced and \nmaintained.\n\n[[Page S11392]]\n\n  I have to ask: How does it look if we are going to hold trucks coming \nfrom Mexico to a different standard than we are with trucks coming from \nCanada? The suggestion is that because trucks are coming from Mexico, \nthey are somehow incapable of meeting these high safety standards. I \ncan tell my colleagues, as somebody who comes from a border State with \n1,600 miles of common border with Mexico, there are challenges along \nthe border, but legal trade and legal commerce are important to the \npeople in Texas, and they are important to the people of the United \nStates.\n  For every truck entering into the United States from Mexico that has \nto be tested, if it fails to pass a test, it will be put out of \nservice; for every truck that is going to come into the United States \nunder NAFTA, a truck will be able to travel from the United States into \nMexico.\n  So this is a matter of enforcing free trade requirements that are \npart of the law of the land that have been litigated all the way up to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court and about which there isn't any controversy. The \nonly question that remains is whether we are going to treat trucks from \nCanada and trucks from Mexico the same. I submit we should, and we \nshould hold both to the high standards of public safety which my \namendment will require. And as I said earlier, if in fact trucks \nparticipating in this program must be inspected every 3 months, the \nsame standard as U.S. trucks, every driver entering the country under \nthis program would have to verify compliance with safety requirements \nand they would have to do so every time they enter the United States. \nIf in fact the Department of Transportation's inspector general fails \nto certify that the program actually makes sure every truck is \ninspected and every driver is verified--if the inspector general fails \nto certify to such--then funding for this program would be \nautomatically suspended.\n\n  So under my approach, for the first time, we will enshrine the \nprinciple that we inspect and certify every single truck, whether it \ncomes from Mexico or whether it comes from Canada, that would enter the \nUnited States under this program.\n  I know that previously a letter from the Secretary of Transportation \nhas been made part of the Congressional Record here which addresses \nsome of the concerns raised by the Senator from North Dakota with \nregard to border license checks of drivers working for Mexican \ncarriers. The Department of Transportation has noted that there is a \nrequired check of the commercial driver's license of each driver of a \nMexican domiciled carrier crossing the border. So I believe the \nconcerns raised by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota have \nbeen addressed by the Department of Transportation, and given the \nstringent inspection requirements and public safety requirements of my \namendment, I believe that is what my colleagues should support, one \nthat is compliant with what in essence is the law of the land and which \nwill protect the safety of the public.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me yield 3 minutes to Senator Brown, \nand as I do that, let me say to Senator Brown, as I have said \npreviously, the Cornyn amendment, in the last sentence, says let us \njust fund the pilot project. It has a lot of bouquets wrapped around \nit, but in the end it says, let us just fund this project. That is why \nI believe we should pass the Dorgan, Specter, et al., amendment.\n  I yield 3 minutes to Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n  Senator Dorgan has reviewed the numerous reasons why this pilot \nprogram doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense to compromise safety \nlaws, whether it is road safety, food safety, toy safety, or truck \nsafety. Unsafe trucks on our roads, unsafe food on our tables, or \ndangerous toys in the hands of our children, all of this is part of a \nlarger issue. It is about trade.\n  It would be easier if it weren't. It would be easier if we didn't \nneed strong trade rules to ensure truck safety and food safety and \nproduct safety, but it simply doesn't work that way. If we don't \nrequire China to export products as safe as those manufactured in the \nUnited States, our children will be exposed to lead paint and loose \nparts. If we don't write trade deals, as Senator Dorgan says, that \nprohibit unsafe trucks from our roads, more Americans--count on it--\nwill be killed on our highways. Yet we write trade deals that \ncompromise and compromise and compromise away the safety standards that \nprotect our children, our pets, our roads, and ourselves.\n  Why should we agree to a trade deal that turns product safety into a \nreactive recall-driven enterprise? Not because it serves our families \nbut because it serves multinational corporations. Why should we agree \nto trade deals that compromise road safety? Not because it serves our \nfamilies but because it serves multinational corporations.\n  Too often in both Chambers in this Congress we write trade deals that \nignore consumers, coddle corporations, produce massive trade deficits, \nensure unsafe imports, and export U.S. jobs. Instead, we could write \ntrade rules that respect U.S. law and promote U.S. exports. We could \nwrite trade rules that keep our roads safe, our food and toys safe, \nthat are fair to U.S. trading partners, and best for America's \nfamilies. But it means letting go of expedient, shortsighted, lopsided \nfree trade deals and embracing a new model.\n  Instead of trade deals designed to benefit top management and \nmultinational corporations, we should write trade deals designed to \nbenefit everyone else. I am sure the benefit of those trade deals will \nultimately trickle down to the Nation's CEOs. U.S. road safety laws \nmake sense. Voting for the Dorgan amendment and voting against the \nCornyn amendment demonstrates respect for those rules.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote accordingly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 3 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Texas has 8 minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the interest of finishing, I will use \nmy 3 minutes.\n  Let me say that when I said this is not a legal issue, my point is \nwhether it has been in the courts or not, we make the law. We will \ndetermine tonight our destiny. That is our responsibility here in this \nChamber. Because we write the law and make the law, we will determine \nwhat the safety standards will be for America's roads tonight. My \ncolleague from Ohio says it very well, in my judgment.\n  There is an old saying: Never buy something from somebody who is out \nof breath. There is a kind of breathless quality to what the Department \nof Transportation did last Thursday night. They get the IG report at \n7:30; at 8:30 they announced, we made a decision: We got the report, \nstudied it--we have some of the fastest lawyers in the world waiting on \nthis--and away we go. Well, let me talk about what they missed. They \nmissed the three key points with respect to the standards of safety, \nbecause the inspector general's report said there is no databank, no \nmassive information with respect to accident reports, vehicle \ninspections, or driver violations in Mexico with Mexican trucking.\n  The fact is they do not have equivalent enforcement in Mexico. That \nis just a fact. If you think there is equivalency between Canada, the \nUnited States, and Mexico, you just miss it.\n  I had a trucker call me yesterday who said, look, I do this for a \nliving, and I pull up at truckstops all over this country. I pull up in \nthe short-haul areas 25 miles from the border, and I have talked to a \nlot of Mexican truckers and looked at their equipment. He said, if \nthere are people who think there are equivalent standards, they are \ndaydreaming.\n  Let me say this, finally. Everything about NAFTA has gone haywire, to \nuse a term of art. Everything. They said pass NAFTA, the trade \nagreement with Mexico and Canada, and things will be great. Well, we \npassed it. Guess what. We turned a small surplus into a huge trade \ndeficit. They said what it will mean is low-skilled, low-wage jobs will \nmove to Mexico. Well, guess what. The three biggest exports to Mexico \nare automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics. All the products of \nhigh-skilled labor. Those are the jobs we lost. Huge deficits, and we \nlost a lot of\n\n[[Page S11393]]\n\nimportant and good jobs. They said, we are going to cut the tariffs for \naccentuating trade between the two countries. Just months later, Mexico \ndevalued the peso 50 percent, and all the gains in the tariff cut were \ngone and then some.\n  So all of it is wrong. All of it has redounded against this country's \ninterest. And now the latest chapter is to say, you know what, we are \nrequired to at this moment, notwithstanding what the inspector general \nsays, notwithstanding that there is no databank with respect to vehicle \ninspections and drivers records, and so on, we are required to allow \nlong-haul Mexican trucks into this country. Well, we are not required \nto do that.\n  We are a body of lawmakers in the Senate and we ought to do what the \nHouse has already done. I hope by passing my amendment we will say to \nthe Department of Transportation that they may not go forward with this \npilot project because this is an issue of safety and we stand for \nsafety in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish my distinguished colleagues from \nNorth Dakota and Ohio would take ``yes'' for an answer. I agree with \nthem. Public safety is No. 1. That is what my amendment guarantees. It \nguarantees inspections of trucks whether they come from Mexico or \ndomestic American trucks or whether they come from Canada.\n  The U.S. Federal inspectors perform and Mexican trucking companies \nmust pass a preauthorization safety audit conducted in Mexico by \nAmericans prior to granting authority to operate beyond the U.S. border \ncommercial zones. This audit includes inspection of vehicles the \ncompany intends to use in long-haul operations in the U.S. and a \nthorough inspection of the company's records to ensure compliance with \nFederal safety regulations. Vehicles not inspected cannot be used for \nlong-haul operations in the United States. Every inspector reviews \nFederal safety regulations with the carrier, including those governing \ndriver hours of service, to ensure the carrier is knowledgeable of and \ncomprehends the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations.\n  This is not about safety, because we all agree that is nonnegotiable, \nand my amendment protects public safety. So what is it about? It is \napparently about protectionism; it is apparently about fear of \ncompetition in the marketplace. It is fear of free trade, which, to my \nway of looking at things, provides new markets to American producers, \nnew opportunities, more revenue, and creates more jobs right here at \nhome.\n  Why in the world would we want to do anything that would discourage \njob creation and greater prosperity here at home by opening up new \nmarkets and new opportunities to American producers? We can try the way \nof protectionism versus free trade, but I guarantee you that is a net \nloser for the American worker.\n  So if this is about safety, then we certainly all agree. If this is \nabout fear of competition and discriminating against Mexican trucks \nthat are required to meet the same high safety standards as trucks that \ncome from Canada, then I think that sends a very bad signal and not \nsomething the Senate should endorse.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  If all time has been yielded back or expired, I yield the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield back his time. The \nSenator from North Dakota has no time at present.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I ask, we have a vote ordered by \nunanimous consent at 7 o'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is to take place at the expiration or \nyielding back of time or at 7 p.m.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might take 2 to 3 minutes to \nrespond to Senator Coburn's amendment, which we will vote on, I \nbelieve, during this group of votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to use the time between now and 7 p.m. to \nrespond to the amendment offered by Senator Coburn for which I have not \nhad an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2812\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Coburn has an objection to \nlegislative directed spending for something called the International \nPeace Garden. He apparently believes that is unwarranted spending. Many \nof my colleagues perhaps will not know it by the International Peace \nGarden, but it is an institution that has been around since the 1930s. \nIt has been supported at various times by the Government of Canada and \nby the Government of the United States. It exists between the United \nStates and Canada and is a wonderful and a remarkable place. I would \nencourage all of my colleagues to visit the International Peace Garden \nat some point.\n  We have a substantial number of buildings at the International Peace \nGarden that are in some disrepair. The Government of Canada and the \nGovernment of Manitoba have agreed to participate in some funding. The \namount of funding that is in the appropriations bill is $450,000, and \nit represents the kind of commitment that our Federal Government has \nmade in the past to maintain this wonderful institution called the \nInternational Peace Garden.\n  We are proud of that institution, and sufficiently so that we put it \non our license plates in North Dakota--The Peace Garden State. We are \nenormously proud it exists in our State. But as I have indicated \npreviously, the Congress has, on previous occasions between the 1930s \nand today, assisted in some funding, very minimal funding, to upgrade \nsome facilities there. The facilities are in substantial disrepair. The \nGovernment of Canada has made a commitment for some funds, and we wish \nto match those funds, so that is the purpose of this rather small \nearmark, but an earmark or legislative-directed funding, nonetheless.\n  It is very important and will perform a very important purpose at the \nInternational Peace Garden. I hope the citizens of America are as proud \nof the existence of this peace garden as I am. The peace garden \nactually reflects the determination and the dedication of two wonderful \nneighbors, the United States and Canada, and the peaceful co-existence \nthat has existed for some long while.\n  It has also been a place in which seminars have taken place, a band \ncamp exists there, and so many other things occur that are a wonderful \nreflection of the best that is in all of us, those of us from the \nUnited States and Canada.\n  My hope is my colleagues would agree with me, the amendment by the \nSenator from Oklahoma is not a worthy amendment. Let us do what the \nGovernment of Canada has already done and recognize the worth of the \nInternational Peace Gardens and dedicate a very small amount of funding \nto try to respond to its facilities' needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2797\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2797 offered by the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided for debate prior to a vote in relation to the Cornyn amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment mandates that the Department \nof Transportation can inspect Mexican trucks, Canadian trucks, and \nAmerican trucks by exactly the same high public safety standards.\n  If, in fact, under this pilot program those requirements are not met, \nit defunds this pilot program that is part of our compliance with our \n1993 treaty agreements under NAFTA.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if you voted to shut down this program of \nlong-haul trucks into the United States from Mexico, Senator Cornyn \nsays: You were wrong. In his amendment, page 4, it says: We shall fund, \nsufficient funds shall be made available to the Secretary of \nTransportation to carry out this section.\n  The reason I believe that is inappropriate is the inspector general \nlast Thursday night said this: They could not get information about \nMexican trucks with respect to vehicle inspection, accident reports, \nand driver violations. Why couldn't they? Because there is no database \navailable. None available.\n  There will come a time when this is just fine, but it is not now. The \nfirst and most important concern at this point is safety on the roads \nof this country. I hope those who voted for the Dorgan-Specter \namendment will decide to vote against the Cornyn amendment, which funds \nthe very program against which the Senate has just voted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I share Senator Coburn's concern for our \nNation's bridges, but I must oppose his amendment. We cannot fund our \nNation's infrastructure on the backs of crucial road safety projects \nthat save tax dollars and lives.\n  The Senator's amendment specifically eliminates crucial funding for \nbike and pedestrian trails in Illinois and across the country. His \namendment will have seriously adverse consequences for millions of \nIllinois residents.\n  The Federal transportation programs do provide flexible funding for \nStates and localities to set aside Federal money for bike and walking \ntrails, yet States tend to fund trails as a last resort--only if they \ncan't use that money for roads and intersections.\n  For example, in fiscal year 2006, States rescinded $602 million of \nTransportation Enhancements funds, 15 percent of all rescissions in \nthat year. A more proportional share would have been closer to 3 \npercent. The Congestion Mitigation Air Quality program, or CMAQ, \naccounts for approximately 4-5 percent of highway apportionments each \nyear but CMAQ funds have accounted for about 20 percent of total \nhighway funds rescinded in recent years.\n  CMAQ and Transportation Enhancements are the major sources of funding \nfor bicycle facilities in cities and communities across the country.\n  Given such drastic rescissions at the State level, communities are \nincreasingly approaching Congress for help to fund their local trail \nconstruction and expansion projects.\n  Incorporating bike and pedestrian trails and access into \ntransportation systems and planning is essential for safety.\n  Bicycling and walking currently account for 10 percent of trips and \n13 percent of fatalities nationally, but receive less than 2 percent of \nFederal transportation funds.\n  In Illinois, such fatalities are worse than the national average. For \nexample, 15.1 percent of traffic deaths in Illinois in 2000-2001 were \npeople on foot or bicycle.\n  It is no coincidence that Illinois' numbers of pedestrian and bike \nfatalities were so high at that time, considering that we did not spend \nany of our Federal safety dollars on bicycle or pedestrian projects \nbetween 1998-2001.\n  With that lack of investment, this is no time to cut funding. The \nU.S. Department of Transportation knows this as well. In its policy \nstatement entitled ``Accommodating Bicycle and Pedestrian Travel: A \nRecommended Approach,'' the U.S. DOT states:\n\n       There is no question that conditions for bicycling and \n     walking need to be improved in every community in the United \n     States; it is no longer acceptable that 6,000 bicyclists and \n     pedestrians are killed in traffic every year, that people \n     with disabilities cannot travel without encountering \n     barriers, and that two desirable and efficient modes of \n     travel have been made difficult and uncomfortable.\n\n  My hometown of Springfield, IL, has been trying to keep pace with \ntrail access and pedestrian safety even while the road system is \ngrowing. The Interurban Trail was started several years ago with \nassistance from State, Federal and local resources. Approximately 5 \nmiles in length, the trail extends from Springfield to the Village of \nChatham with little to no vehicular cross traffic or intersections.\n  I have been on the trail and let me tell what I see. People on bikes, \nhikers, joggers, walkers, moms and dads with\n\n[[Page S11395]]\n\nstrollers. The community loves the trail. The Springfield Park District \nestimates tens of thousands of users each year.\n  Regional planners are building on the Interurban Trail as the \nstarting point for future development of other trails, including the \nSangamon Valley Trail.\n  And it's not just recreational. Many residents of Chatham and \nSpringfield use this trail system as an alternative to roads for \ncommuting to and from work.\n  Unfortunately, a major new construction project to extend MacArthur \nBoulevard threatens the Interurban Trail.\n  The Interurban Trail needs to be relocated because of the \nconstruction and several new high speed intersections.\n  This proposed amendment would mean the bike and walking trails in \nSpringfield either shut down or go through new, high-speed \nintersections that we know statistically are likely to result in loss \nof life.\n  This amendment would be a huge step backward for safety in \ntransportation.\n  The CDC has shown that since the mid-70s, the prevalence of \noverweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and \nchildren. Data from two CDC surveys show that among adults, the \nprevalence of obesity increased from 15 percent in 1980 to 33 percent \nin 2004.\n  A 2003 study shows that by the age of 40, a nonsmoking obese woman \nloses 7.1 years of life expectancy, and a nonsmoking obese man loses \n5.8 years.\n  And the obesity epidemic is spreading to our children at an alarming \nrate. In 2004, an estimated 9.9 million children and teens were \nconsidered overweight. They are taking in too many empty and fat-laden \ncalories and not exercising enough.\n  Moreover, physical activity need not be strenuous to be beneficial. \nFor example, CDC research shows that adults benefit tremendously from \nmoderate exercise, such as 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the \nweek.\n  Multilane roads have replaced sidewalks and bike paths. Children's \nplay spaces are far away or unsafe. Designing communities so that \nchildren have ample opportunity for physical activity is in our \ncountry's best interests.\n  These bike and trail projects promote exercise and healthy physical \nactivity like biking, walking and running. They also give people the \noption of walking or biking to get to work, school or shop.\n  Manteno, IL, is working to accomplish just that. The village of \nManteno has developed a plan to create a village-wide trail system to \nconnect existing parks, schools, and community-use buildings.\n  The project proposes 15,000 linear feet of a 10-foot-wide trail for \nwalking, for bicycles and for wheelchairs. The north section will \nconnect county Highway 9 to Lake Manteno Road and Maple Street--\ncreating access to three of the town's four public schools where none \nnow exist.\n  Having already installed nearly 3,000 feet of trails and raised \nnearly $130,000 to continue the project, the trail system will promote \nalternate forms of transportation throughout the village.\n  The village of Manteno supports this trail funding, including the \nvillage chamber of commerce, the school district, the Village \nPresident, the village trustees, and the local Parks and Recreation \nCommission.\n  Given our increasing dependence on foreign oil and increasing traffic \ncongestion, we need bike and pedestrian trails to save gas and minimize \ncongestion.\n  These bike and trail projects can spur economic development and bring \nincreased economic activity and tourism for a small investment.\n  The Grand Illinois Trail, GIT, is a great example. This Trail was \nfirst conceived of in the mid-1990s by the Illinois Department of \nNatural Resources and is overwhelmingly supported by cities and \nvillages, forest preserve and conservation districts, as well as \ncommerce and community-based organizations.\n  The Grand Illinois Trail is a loop that circles northern Illinois \nstretching from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River and back--over \n500 miles in all. It encompasses smaller trails such as the Great River \nTrail in Savanna, IL, and the GIT Carbon Cliff.\n  Approximately 90 percent of the route is in place and you can bike, \nhike, horseback ride, cross country ski, snowmobile, and canoe through \nthe scenic landscape of northern Illinois and along Chicago's \nLakefront, Illinois' beautiful rivers, historic canals and scenic \ncountry roads.\n  One goal of this loop trail is to ensure safe passage from one local \ntrail to the next. In Savanna, IL, a new trail leading to town is cut \noff from the highly popular Great River Trail by a frightening 1.4 mile \nstretch of Illinois 84--a real safety issue for bicyclists and hikers \nusing the trail.\n  The Grand Illinois Trail is supported by the Illinois Departments of \nCommerce and Community Affairs and Transportation, the Illinois \nHistoric Preservation Agency, the Illinois Chapter of the Rails-to-\nTrails Conservancy, The League of Illinois Bicyclists, the Illinois \nTrail Riders and the Illinois Association of Park Districts.\n  Trails are becoming common in residential neighborhoods. Development \nplans for homes, apartments, and townhouses often include footpaths to \nenhance recreational opportunities and property values.\n  Bike and pedestrian trails bring customers to local businesses and \nhave been used as cheap, effective ways to spur downtown redevelopment \nacross the country. A modest investment into bike-friendly design can \nbring huge economic benefits.\n  Aurora, IL, is nearing completion of the Fox River Trail in northern \nIllinois. The last gap in the region's 50+ mile Fox River Trail is in \ndowntown Aurora.\n  Elgin, a village close in size and location to Aurora, completed its \nFox River Trail gap to help spur successful downtown redevelopment. \nSimilarly, Naperville, IL, has over 100 people biking to their commuter \nrail station daily, partly due to their bike network. Aurora wants to \nrepeat these successes.\n  This amendment would take away an important economic tool and would \nbring decreased investment and economic activity to towns that need it.\n  Tailpipe emissions from automobiles and trucks account for almost \nhalf of Chicago's air pollution, contributing to asthma and other \nrespiratory problems suffered by more than 650,000 people in \nMetropolitan Chicago.\n  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has noted the benefits of \nalternative modes of transportation for reducing transportation \nemissions while also reducing traffic congestion.\n  The 2001 U.S. National Household Travel Survey tells us that in \nmetropolitan areas more than 40 percent of trips are two miles or \nless--a very manageable bike ride and more than one-quarter are just \none mile or less. Furthermore, the data shows that within the 28 \npercent of the trips that are one mile or less in urbanized areas, 66 \npercent are made by car.\n  These short trips are the most polluting and the easiest to switch to \nbicycling.\n  At a time when these communities are seeking to reduce traffic \ncongestion, improve air quality, increase the safety of their \nneighborhoods, and decrease petroleum dependence, bicycles offer a \nrelatively simple, energy-saving alternative to driving.\n  Bicycles have no carbon emissions and don't contribute to smog. If \neach of the three million households in northeastern Illinois walked or \nbiked just one mile every day, we would reduce daily vehicle emissions \nby more than 1800 kilograms.\n  Senator Coburn has called these projects pork-barrel spending. This \nflies in the face of the overwhelming local support for these modest \nprojects.\n  Bike and pedestrian projects have the most support from the \ncommunities back home, from the block associations and bike groups who \nuse the streets and know that without this Federal investment, the \nstreets will continue to not be adequate to walk, jog, or bike on.\n  Beyond community support, these trails actually connect communities. \nLook at the trail along the Calumet River in Chicago's Southland. This \nproject, referred to as the Cal-Sag Trail, is a 26-mile nonmotorized \ncorridor that is carved into racial and socio-economic chunks along the \nalignments of major transportation corridors: major streets and \nintersections, expressways, rail lines, the Calumet-Sag itself.\n\n[[Page S11396]]\n\n  These transportation facilities are also barriers when they serve as \nconvenient boundaries when planning housing, economic opportunities, \nschool affiliations, and other issues related to quality life. The Cal-\nSag Trail has the potential to help cross all of those lines, \nconnecting many types of neighborhoods that exist in the regions, \nallowing anyone, regardless of ability or background, free passage to \nresources and opportunities--it will be the first trail development in \nthe region that raises the social equity of all the communities it \nserves.\n  A majority of the public--53 percent--favors increasing Federal \nspending to build more bike paths for easier and safer bicycling, even \nif it means fewer gas-tax dollars go to building roads.\n  Half of the public--50 percent--favors requiring new road \nconstruction and maintenance projects to include bicycle paths, even if \nit would mean less room for cars and trucks.\n  And the projects that the Senator intends to cut come to us directly \nfrom the people who do not have the usual flashy, well-funded advocacy \ncampaigns we are used to here in the Congress.\n  This was very apparent during debate of the last transportation bill. \nOf the 1,912 registered lobbyists affiliated with the Transportation \nbill, only three represented bicycling.\n  They didn't need lobbyists because we all heard from the local \ncitizens and small businesses on the street about the need for us to \nmake our roads and streets safer. And we incorporated that need into \nthe last transportation bill and these projects continue that effort.\n  Besides those who bike by choice, Government agencies should have an \nobligation to make transportation safer for those who bike--or walk--\nout of necessity--often for economic--or age--reasons.\n  8.3 percent of American households do not own cars, including 26.5 \npercent of those with incomes under $20,000--2001 National Household \nTravel Survey. Transit is not the entire answer for these people--many \nof whom rely on bikes to get around.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2811\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to a vote in relation to \nCoburn amendment No. 2811.\n  The senior Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare now going to move to a Coburn amendment. We will have 2 minutes \nequally divided and a vote. We are very close to finishing this bill. \nThere are some amendments in a managers' package on which we are moving \nrapidly forward. We have a couple of Senators who may require a vote on \nan amendment and final passage. In the next vote, we are going to try \nto work out a final agreement on whether to have those votes tonight or \nthe first thing in the morning. But if we can get a final list of \namendments, we will let all Senators know, by the end of the next vote, \nwhat the path forward is, following this vote.\n  I believe the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, he yields back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield back.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Coburn \namendment.\n  Mr. COBURN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma will state his \ninquiry.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I asked for the yeas and nays.\n  The Chair asked whether there was a sufficient second. There was a \nsufficient second. And then a motion was made to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays on the amendment do not \npreclude a motion to table.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am sorry to take the time of the Senate, but this \namendment affects the State Senator Webb and I are proud to represent, \nand there are just some mistaken facts I want to clear up in the \nrecord.\n  The proponent of the amendment said that this thing would cost $16 \nmillion, a bike path, but in effect it ended up costing $1.2 million. \nThe bike path was a part of a larger project of $210 million under the \nSAFETEA-LU law, and there was no earmark that we can find. It was \nrequired by the Federal authorities to build a bike path as replacing a \nbridge. So I am sorry. I tried to help my colleague, but I just got \nthis information. I have been in a hearing all day, or most of the day, \nin the Armed Services Committee. But I will amplify this for the \nrecord. I apologize, but I felt it important that the record be \ncorrected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of the senior Senator from Virginia and express my appreciation \nto him for having caught this inaccuracy that was being spoken about on \nthe floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might add, we were both at the \nhearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee when the staffs \nfrantically contacted us to try to correct this factual error.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will shortly ask that a quorum call begin. \nWe are very close to being able to have something worked out. I have \nhad conversations with my Republican counterpart. What we will do--and \nthe staffs are working on a unanimous consent agreement--we have maybe \na Coburn amendment, we have a DeMint amendment, and we have two \nMenendez amendments. That is likely all we have to finish this bill. We \nwant the debate\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\nto be completed on all of these amendments except for we have asked--\nSenator Kennedy has asked and Senator DeMint has asked that they have \n20 minutes equally divided in the morning. That will be the only debate \nin the morning. We will debate the rest of the amendments tonight and \nwe will vote on them in the morning. I think that is in keeping with \nwhat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think would be the \nbest way to dispose of this. I think they are right.\n  So I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum, and we will see if \nwe can get the staff to bring that out to us very quickly. It should be \nwithin the next few minutes.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a short statement with respect to a \nvote we are going to take tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2814\n\n  In one of my favorite movies, a baseball field is built in the middle \nof Iowa and becomes a mecca for baseball players and fans that \nseemingly come from anywhere and everywhere to watch baseball. Today in \nBillings, MT, folks are hoping that the popular movie ``Field of \nDreams'' was right. ``If we build it, they will come.''\n  Baseball is America's game. It is part of what defines us as \nAmericans. There is something special about sitting in the bleachers on \na summer's evening, eating peanuts, and watching a good baseball game. \nFor over 60 years now, the best venue to watch a baseball game in \nMontana has been historic Cobb Field in Billings--Montana's largest \ncity.\n  Opening in 1948, Cobb Field is the longtime home of the Billings \nMustangs, a minor league baseball team. It also serves NCAA baseball as \nwell as American Legion baseball.\n  Many notable professional baseball players--Dave McNally, George \nBrett, Trevor Hoffman, Rob Dibble, Paul O'Neill, and Stormin' Gorman \nThomas, to name a few--have at one time called Cobb Field ``Home.''\n  Unfortunately, Cobb Field is an above-ground wooden structure stadium \nthat is not compliant with building codes. Despite several major \nrenovations and repairs, the stadium continues to deteriorate at an \nincreasing rate due to water damage and wood rot. Conditions are unsafe \nfor Montanans who want to watch a baseball game, particularly for \nchildren and Montanans with disabilities.\n  To solve this problem, the people of Billings have decided to build a \nnew stadium to replace Cobb Field. In March, the city broke ground on \nthis new stadium.\n  The new stadium will be a state-of-the-art venue that will meet the \nneeds and wishes of the citizens of Billings to have a facility that \ncan be a safe, multi-use venue to host baseball games, concerts, \nfestivals, and markets.\n  More importantly, the new stadium will be an economic development \ncenter located in one of Billings' oldest neighborhoods in need of a \nshot of revitalization.\n  This new stadium will spur redevelopment efforts that are so needed \nin this area of downtown Billings. Over 100,000 people attended events \nat Cobb Field last year. For a state with 900,000 people, that's a lot. \nWith the new stadium, it is estimated that there will be a 100 percent \nincrease in ticket sales.\n  Last November, voters approved a bond election authorizing the city \nof Billings to sell bonds up to $12.5 million to design a new 3,500-\nseat baseball and multi-use stadium. The people of Billings have \nstepped forward with the lion's share of the costs of the stadium. In \naddition, Montanans have donated over $2 million in private pledges to \noffset the taxpayers' costs of repaying the $12.5 million in bonds.\n  Because of the local funding that has been secured for the project, \nour Montana delegation has requested $500,000 in Federal funding to \nsupport the funds that the local community has already stepped forward \nwith.\n  I have fought hard over the years for my home State of Montana. My \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Tester, has done the same. Each year, I \nmake requests to the Appropriations Committee to provide funding for \nworthy Montana projects. I stand behind the requests I make.\n  A vote for the Coburn amendment is a vote against me and the people \nof Montana. We will remember.\n  This is such a small amount of Federal dollars compared to the \ncontribution the people of Billings are making that I believe voting \nfor Cobb Field is something Montanans prefer, but I think the people \nacross this whole country who are big baseball fans would also agree.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is the floor \nopen for debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is open for debate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator would be kind enough to \nwithhold for a moment. We just want to get Senator Bond so we can do \nthe unanimous consent agreement, and then you would be recognized first \nas soon as they finish that. Would that be OK?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I could be the first recognized after the \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing be the only amendments, other than a managers' amendment that \nhas been cleared by the managers and the leaders, remaining to H.R. \n3074; that no second-degree amendment be in order prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment: Coburn amendments 2812 and 2814 en bloc; \nDeMint amendment relating to Davis-Bacon; Menendez amendment No. 2826; \nMenendez amendment No. 2834; that there be 2 minutes for debate prior \nto each vote, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that after the first vote in the sequence, the remaining votes be \nlimited to 10 minutes; that upon disposition of the listed amendments, \nthe bill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill; that the Coburn and Menendez amendments be debated \nduring today's session; that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nthe bill on Wednesday, September 12, there be 20 minutes of debate with \nrespect to the DeMint amendment, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators DeMint and Kennedy, or their designees; and \nthat no points of order be considered waived by this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I had \ndifficulty hearing the Senator. On the DeMint amendment, did I hear \nthere was no time limit?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have not yet worked out with the minority \nour being able to go to conference on this. We feel positive we can do \nthat tomorrow. We need to do this. We are in the process of going to \nconference on the three bills we have already passed. We had meetings \nat the White House today. We believe it is most appropriate to send the \nPresident bill after bill rather than a big bunch at the same time. We \nhope that by tomorrow we can work it out so we can go to conference. I \nhave no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, with that agreement, Senators should \nunderstand that tomorrow morning we will come in, there will be 20 \nminutes of debate between Senators DeMint and Kennedy on the DeMint \namendment. We will go immediately to the four votes on amendments, with \nfinal passage to be completed in the morning. With that, there will be \nno more votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about this bill and to \nbring\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\nup an issue that I think is going to become more and more apparent as a \nproblem for our Interstate Highway System. I had hoped to offer an \namendment that would attempt to begin to solve this problem, but the \nmanagers have resisted having authorization on an appropriations bill, \nand I understand their concern. However, this is an issue that must be \ndealt with. If we cannot deal with it on an appropriations bill, \nhopefully, next year we can begin to discuss the alternative for the \nnext authorization of highway funds, and certainly, it is a universal \nissue that must come up.\n  This is the issue. There is more and more interest in putting tolls \non highways. Well, I think if a local government or State government \nwants to have a toll highway, they should go through all of the \nprocesses--a vote of the people, or a vote of the elected officials--so \nthe elected officials are accountable to do that.\n  Our Interstate Highway System was created in the Eisenhower \nadministration for the purpose of having a free highway system that \nwould connect our country all the way from the West to the East, from \nthe North to the South. It was for security purposes but also for \ncommerce.\n  The highway fund was created because the Western States were small \nand they did not have the capability to raise the funds to build their \nhighways. Many States are donor States and have built these highways--\nespecially out in the West. State leaders are now trying to take these \nFederal highways and put tolls on them and use those highway tolls for \nother purposes--in some cases, for mass transit; in some cases, it \nwould be going into other State projects.\n  I think this is a dangerous precedent. It is dangerous to start \ntaking highways built with Federal taxpayer dollars and put tolls on \nthem and, in some cases not even reimburse the Federal taxpayers. I \nstill think it would be wrong to allow the buyback of a Federal highway \nby a State and then for the State to put a toll on it. In some cases, \nwe are looking at tolls being put on an entire freeway--not just one \nlane but the entire freeway.\n  In fact, I think if you want to toll a lane on a Federal highway to \nbuild a new lane to add to the number of free lanes that are there, \nthat would be acceptable. I also think you have some avenues to use the \nright-of-way that is in place to toll and build a new freeway with that \ntoll. But to take an existing interstate highway and toll every lane, \nwhen it has already been paid for by the Federal taxpayers, is \nabsolutely wrong, and we must have a vehicle to address this issue.\n  Now, I have talked to the chairman of my State highway commission, \nand he has suggested that this might be an option that Texas wants to \ndo. I object strenuously to Texas doing that, and I am going to do \neverything I can to keep our Texas taxpayers from paying for another \nopportunity to use a road that they have already paid for. I am going \nto resist that. But the chairman of the highway commission did make a \nvery important point, and that was, just tell us what the rules are. \nThere are not rules that lay out how we can address the transportation \nissues in the States, and I think every State is probably facing this \nproblem. He was honest enough to say just give me the rules, tell me \nwhat I can do, and we will work with that.\n  Of course, a donor State such as ours is sensitive to the fact that \nwe don't get back one dollar for every dollar that is put into the \nhighway system. I think we have done a better job at a time when we \nstart looking at parity in the highway fund, and I think a fair \nconclusion would be that the Interstate Highway System has been built \nand let's make sure that every State now has the ability to use its own \ntaxpayer funds to build its own roads. I think parity should be the end \nresult, and I think we should be there now. Unfortunately, for a lot of \nhistory and a lot of nostalgia about the Interstate Highway System, \nthat is not a fight that we can have today. It is not a fight that we \nwill be able to solve tonight.\n\n  I do want to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that we \nshould not allow, on a piecemeal basis, one highway segment at a time, \nto all of a sudden wake up and find that we don't have an Interstate \nHighway System that is in place as it was created to be--a free highway \nfor the citizens of this country to be able to travel anywhere in our \ncountry on an interstate system that works. We are going to wake up to \nthis scenario if we allow what is happening right now to continue \nunabated. So I am going to do everything I can in my power to see that \nthis scenario does not occur. I am going to do everything in my power \nto see that Texans do not have tolls put on our Federal highway system. \nI think we need a policy that would be nationwide, so that every \ntaxpayer who has already paid for these roads would not be tolled again \nfor the ability to go and use those roads. We are not going to solve \nthat problem tonight, but it is going to be a major effort I will make \nin the future to solve this problem. I ask the authorizing committee, \nwhen they do reauthorize the highway program, which will have to be \nreauthorized within the next 2 years, to address this issue with an eye \ntoward equity, with an eye toward protecting our taxpayers and, most \nimportant, with an eye toward keeping the original intent and mission \nof the Interstate Highway System--to have a free Interstate Highway \nSystem that works for our country and does indeed complete the United \nStates of America both in security and commerce.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2812\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma has an amendment \npending before the body that would strike funding for the International \nPeace Garden in my State of North Dakota. This measure calls for a \nmodest amount of money--$450,000--to support the International Peace \nGarden. The International Peace Garden has been a proud monument to the \nhistory of good relations between the United States and Canada for many \nyears.\n  Canada contributes, the State of North Dakota contributes, and the \nProvince of Manitoba contributes. There has been a history of Federal \nsupport, and now the Senator from Oklahoma, for some unknown reason, \nhas picked out the International Peace Garden as something to eliminate \nfrom Federal support.\n  This is a story from October of last year in the Minot Daily News, \nsaying: ``Peace Garden Is In Need: Garden In Dire Need Of Money For \nRepairs, Operations.''\n  Why on earth the Senator from Oklahoma has picked on the \nInternational Peace Garden as something to eliminate leaves me \nscratching my head. This is a picture of the International Peace \nGarden. It is on the border between our country and Canada. It stands \nas testimony to the peaceful relations we have enjoyed on this border \nfor our history. You can see in this photo these are absolutely \nbeautiful gardens, with these memorial towers. This is the site of an \ninternational music camp that is conducted every year, which is world \nclass. It is has attracted some of the world's greatest musicians.\n  For some reason, the Senator from Oklahoma says none of this has any \nvalue. Let's just cut it all, eliminate all $450,000, which, I might \nsay, is a modest amount of money in the context of an International \nPeace Garden. This is a monument on the grounds of the garden, which \nconsists of girders from the World Trade Center. Our Governor and the \nManitoba Premier were just here today to commemorate the 9/11 \nanniversary. The Senator from Oklahoma says this has no value.\n  Sometimes things that are not a road or a bridge or a battleship have \nvalue. The International Peace Garden has value. The people of North \nDakota provide money to support it. The people of Manitoba provide \nmoney to support it. The Government of Canada provides money to support \nit. I hope this body will reject the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Why is there any validity to saying there is no justification for \nFederal support for an international peace garden? I honestly don't \nknow what argument the Senator from Oklahoma advances to say this has \nno value.\n  Let me indicate where the International Peace Garden is. It is right \nhere, almost equidistant between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic \nOcean. The International Peace Garden stands in the middle of my State \nof North Dakota in Dunseith.\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\n  This is a headline, again from last year, in the Fargo Forum, the \nbiggest newspaper in my State. It says: ``On the border of withering. \nThe International Peace Garden supporters seek measures to keep alive \niconic crossborder park.''\n  I have been at the International Peace Garden many times. It is an \ninspirational setting. It is something that I think anyone who visits \nthe more than 2300 acres of--more than 2300 acres of the most \nspectacular gardens I have ever seen in my life anywhere in the world. \nWhy the Senator from Oklahoma believes we ought to eliminate any \nFederal support for this peace garden that is dedicated to the \nextraordinary relationship we have had with our border to the North \nabsolutely eludes me.\n  For him to suggest this has no value, has he ever been there? Has he \never talked with the officials of Canada who have generously supported \nthis institution? Has he talked with the people of Manitoba or the \npeople of North Dakota? I am certain not because he would find in my \nState, which is a very conservative State, that there is very strong \nsupport for the International Peace Garden. This is a point of pride in \nour relations with our neighbors to the North.\n  More than that, it sends a signal to the world about the value the \nAmerican people put on peace. Do we have the strongest military in the \nworld? Absolutely, and we are proud of it. Do we have the greatest \neconomic strength of any country in the world? Yes, and we are proud of \nit. Do we lead in many areas in terms of human accomplishment, science, \nthe arts? Absolutely, and we are proud of it.\n  We also should send forth the signal that we are a country that \nbelieves in peace, and we strive for peace because that is part of the \nAmerican character, too. And this International Peace Garden sends that \nmessage. It certainly sends that message to the people of Canada who \nare among our closest allies, who have stood with us in every crisis. \nWho, when the tragedy of 9/11 occurred, were the first people to our \nside? It was our neighbors to the North in Canada.\n  This International Peace Garden, again more than 2300 acres of \nstunningly beautiful and inspirational gardens, stands as a memorial to \nthat extraordinary relationship between our countries. Certainly, it is \nworth the expenditure of $450,000 to reinvigorate this symbol of \nrespect.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2826\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I call up amendment No. 2826 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself and \n     Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 2826.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a study by the Government Accountability Office on \nthe efficacy of strategies used by the Federal Aviation Administration \n   and the Department of Transportation to address flight delays at \n                     airports in the United States)\n\n       On page 18, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 116. (a) Government Accountability Office Study and \n     Report on Flight Delays.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be obligated or \n     expended by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration for the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia \n     Metropolitan Airspace Redesign until the Comptroller General \n     of the United States submits the report required by \n     subsection (c).\n       (b) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a \n     study on the efficacy of strategies employed by the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the \n     Secretary of Transportation to address flight delays at \n     airports in the United States.\n       (2) Contents.--The study required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include an assessment of--\n       (A) efforts by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to induce voluntary schedule reductions by air \n     carriers at Chicago O'Hare International Airport;\n       (B) the mandatory flight reduction operations instituted by \n     the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration at \n     LaGuardia Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National \n     Airport;\n       (C) the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia Metropolitan \n     Airspace Redesign; and\n       (D) any other significant efforts by the Administrator of \n     the Federal Aviation Administration or the Secretary of \n     Transportation to reduce flight delays at airports in the \n     United States.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to Congress a report including--\n       (1) the results of the study required by subsection (b); \n     and\n       (2) recommendations regarding which of the strategies \n     described in subsection (b) reduce airport delays most \n     effectively when employed for periods of 6 months or less.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the great work the Senator \nfrom Washington, Mrs. Murray, as well as the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, have done in crafting a bill with very tough \nparameters and to do so on a whole host of issues that are critical to \nthe country's future. I look forward to being supportive of the bill \noverall.\n  I hope from our conversation with the committee that, in fact, two \namendments I will be offering, or versions thereof, will be accepted by \nthe committee.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which I offer along with my colleague \nSenator Lautenberg, is about flight delays that we have been \nexperiencing throughout the country. In my home State of New Jersey, \nNewark Liberty International Airport is one of the most delayed \nairports in the country. About half its flights were delayed this \nsummer. These delays are unacceptable. Delays often mean a vacation cut \nshort, a missed business meeting, or less time with loved ones.\n  There are environmental consequences, as very often delays take place \non the runway with the idling of engines and the emissions therefor. \nThey are a demoralizing experience, an experience punctuated by long \nwaits, little communication, and often no recourse.\n  When I speak with the FAA and the airline industry about how to solve \nthe problem, I hear two things. First, they say we need to upgrade air \ntraffic control equipment, and I am wholeheartedly supportive of that \neffort, and I believe this bill sets us on the path for an eventual \ntechnological upgrade of the entire air traffic system.\n  Second, I hear the FAA's airspace redesign in the New York/New \nJersey/Philadelphia region will also ease delays. I have a difficult \ntime, having viewed what they came out with, to believe that, in fact, \nis going to be largely accomplished by the very fact that we are \nlooking, at best, at seconds, eventually reducing delays by less than \n20 percent. It seems to me by fanning out arrivals and departures, \nthere might be a slight decline in delays, but this slight reduction in \ndelays probably will not even be noticeable. Some have calculated this \nbenefit to be as low as 25 seconds saved per flight.\n  I have been advocating with the FAA that they look at a variety of \nother issues, as well as deal with flight delays in the New York-New \nJersey region. I wrote a letter asking the FAA to examine \ncomprehensive, short-term solutions, such as whether temporary limits \non operations should be placed on all of the regions' airports. I also \nasked them to examine whether priorities should be given to larger \nplanes, particularly during periods of extreme congestion. Finally, at \nthe very least, the FAA should have a meeting with all the regions' \nairports and discuss the possibility of voluntary flight reductions.\n  It is interesting to me that the letter I sent to the Administrator \ntoday--the Administrator came out and said to the industry: You better \nseriously considering getting your schedules together and figuring out \na reduction in the amounts of scheduled flights you have because if you \ndon't do so, you may end up with a Federal response to that extent.\n  So I think the Administrator, rightfully so, is trying to get the \nindustry to do that what it needs to do I believe both for the industry \nand the flying public. These short-term solutions I propose will not \nrequire years to implement or billions of dollars in new funds. \nInstead, they require sensible planning on how to allocate the scarce \nresource of a seat on an airplane.\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\n  This has been done in other parts of the country. We have seen in the \npast FAA successfully address air delays by holding scheduled reduction \nmeetings with airlines or even capping the number of flights, as they \ndo at Reagan National and LaGuardia.\n  This amendment would largely have the GAO, an independent body, make \nsure that we have a study within a very short time, 120 days, to tell \nus how the tools that the FAA has used in other places in the country \ncan be available to conquer flight delays in the short term and not \nsimply wait for long-term, expensive solutions that only address a \nfraction of the problem. I do believe an independent study would be \nincredibly helpful.\n  In addition to airspace redesign, we look at the other critical \nissues of delay that have an economic consequence and an environmental \nconsequence and a quality-of-life consequence as well.\n  I look forward to the committee adopting a version of this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2834\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the \npending amendment aside and ask that amendment No. 2834 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. MENENDEZ] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2834.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding to the Secretary of Housing and \n Urban Development to implement guidance in connection with assisting \n persons with limited English proficiency and to provide for an offset \n                           of such increase)\n\n       On page 73, line 8, strike ``$252,010,000'' and insert \n     ``$251,630,000''.\n       On page 110, line 23, strike ``$52,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$52,380,000''.\n       On page 111, line 6, strike the period and insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the funds made \n     available under this heading, $380,000 shall be available to \n     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the \n     creation and promotion of translated materials and other \n     programs that support the assistance of persons with limited \n     english proficiency in utilizing the services provided by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development.''.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have in my hand the Federal Register \nfor the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Basically, what it \nhas done is said that under title 7 of the Civil Rights Act, they are \ngoing to have private property owners throughout the country have to \ndevise a series of documents. Instead of HUD having a uniform document, \nall of these documents will be crafted by the individual private sector \nentities across the country.\n  What that is going to do is shift an enormous financial burden on \nprivate property owners across the country and, equally as important in \nmy mind, in pursuit of title 7 of the Civil Rights Act, it is going to \nlead to huge litigation across the country because we can have a \nvariety of documents all for the same purposes being drafted in dozens, \nliterally hundreds of different ways. That, in my mind, does not make \ncommon sense as it relates to the shifting of the burden on private \nproperty owners across the country, and it certainly does not make \ncommon sense in terms of having a uniform documentation that can ensure \nthat at the end of the day, we do not see the courts flooded with \ndifferent interpretations of those documents.\n  We simply put a very modest amount, but from all the parties who are \nengaged with this we have determined $380,000 will ultimately ensure we \ndo not shift this huge burden on all the private property owners across \nthe landscape of the country and, at the same time, have uniform \ndocuments that won't lead us to a flood of lawsuits and preserve the \nvery essence of what the title 6 Executive Order the Bush \nadministration is pursuing under title 6 can be accomplished. I think \nthat makes eminent sense.\n  I look forward to the committee's acceptance of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is almost 9 p.m. on the east coast, and \nout in California, where I used to live when I was in the Navy, I guess \nit is almost 6 o'clock. For the most part, here on the east coast, \npeople have made their way home from work and school and they have \nfinished their dinners and are getting ready to call it a day. Out on \nthe west coast, they are still stuck in traffic. Between here and there \nare different variations of those two conditions.\n  I wish to start off by expressing my thanks to Senator Murray and to \nSenator Bond and members of their subcommittee for putting together \nwhat I think is a strong and a thoughtful bill. It is a challenge \nbecause we don't have unlimited resources to do that. It was a lot of \nwork. So thanks to you and your staffs for providing the leadership.\n  I wish to talk a little about the importance of investing in our \ninfrastructure. Maybe it is a bit different from what others have said \ntoday and earlier this week on this matter. I used to serve on the \nAmtrak board of directors when I was Governor, nominated by President \nClinton to serve, and I actually come from a family of railroaders. My \ngrandfather, on my father's side, was a railroader, and he took me and \nmy sister on our first train ride when we were about 5 years old in \nWest Virginia. I have been interested in trains, I suppose, ever since.\n  I think a lot of people feel that passenger rail was in its heyday in \nthe first part of the last century. I suppose, to some extent, that is \ntrue. To a lot of people, passenger rail service is something that was \nbig then and not so important now. They might be right. But I have a \nhunch that in some ways the best days for passenger rail could lie \nahead in this country.\n  Our oldest son came home a couple of weeks ago from visiting Europe \nwith some of his friends, and they had a chance to travel throughout \nEurope and the continent and to ride some terrific trains and also to \nride some that weren't so terrific. My family and I were in Italy last \nsummer, and we had a chance to ride some terrific trains, too, but also \nsome that were not so terrific. But in a place where populations are \nfairly dense, in a place where the geography is actually rather \ncompact, a lot of folks ride trains, as we know, and they invest a lot \nof their money in rail service.\n  They do so for reasons we ought to consider. They invest in passenger \nrail because they have congestion on the highways. They invest in \npassenger rail because they have congestion around their airports and \nin their airspace. They invest in passenger rail because they have \nconcerns about dependence on foreign oil. They want to reduce their \ndependence on foreign oil. They invest in passenger rail because they \nwant to reduce the emission of harmful materials or substances into and \nfoul their air.\n  When you think about it, we have similar concerns in this country \ntoo. We have congestion on our highways. We can see it all across the \ncountry tonight, from east to west, as people are heading for home \nafter work. We can see it around our airports almost anytime we try to \nfly out of an airport. Whether it is an airport in Seattle or Columbus \nor Cincinnati or Cleveland or whether it is an airport in Philadelphia, \nwhich is a suburb of Wilmington, DE, we have concerns about congestion \non our highways and in the air in America.\n  We have concerns about our enormous dependence on foreign oil. Almost \n60 percent of our oil comes from places beyond our borders and a lot is \ncontrolled by people who don't like us very much and some places that \nare fairly unstable. I am convinced every time I fill up my old \nChrysler Town and Country minivan, which now has 175,000 miles on it--\npretty dependable car--that I am putting money in the pockets of people \naround the world in some of those unstable places and who are going to \nuse our money to hurt us. That is not too smart.\n  So we have that concern that we share with folks in other places \naround\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\nthe world that invest in passenger rail. We have problems with air \nquality. We have great concerns with climate change and global warming, \nand we need to address this sooner rather than later.\n  The answer to addressing all those concerns is not just passenger \nrail, but it is part of the tool in the toolbox. It is an arrow in the \nquiver. It is something we are starting to awaken to in this country \nand say, hey, maybe this is part of the answer.\n  One of the encouraging things to me about this legislation is it \nacknowledges that passenger rail is part of the answer and it provides \na bit more money for Amtrak, certainly a good bit more money for Amtrak \nthan the administration requested, and a good bit more than was \nprovided in the current fiscal year. It allows Amtrak to continue to \nupgrade the Northeast corridor so we can take these trains that will go \n125 or even 150 miles an hour and be able to use them more effectively \nat speeds approaching 125 or 150 miles per hour, to shorten the travel \ntimes between major destinations on the east coast and, by shortening \nU.S. travel times, to get more people to ride the trains.\n  Believe it or not, more people are riding the trains these days. I \nsaw some ridership numbers the other day that I found encouraging. I \nsaw an interesting piece in the Wall Street Journal--not a big advocate \nof better passenger rail service--and they mentioned that ridership on \nAmtrak nationwide is up this year about 6 percent. Ridership on the \nAcela Express, the high-speed trains in the Northeast corridor, is up \nabout 20 percent. In places in the Midwest, the Chicago to St. Louis \nrun, ridership is up about 50 percent this year. Out on the west coast, \nwhere they invest a lot of money in passenger rail, not just Federal \nmoney but a lot of local money, State money, their ridership is up \nabout 15 percent. So people are starting to wake up to the idea that \npassenger rail might be a part of the solution.\n  I think it is terrific in this legislation that we think the Federal \nGovernment has some obligation to be a part of helping us to capture \nthat potential. One of the reasons why more people are starting to ride \ntrains is because we get tired of sitting in airports waiting to get on \nan airplane. We get tired of sitting on the airplane at the gate. We \nget tired of waiting for our airplane to take off as we sit on the \ntaxiway or the runway until we finally get released from air traffic \ncontrol.\n  Ontime performance for Amtrak nationwide is about 70 percent, about \nthe same as airlines. But ontime performance for Acela Express, the \nhigh-speed express service, is almost 90 percent. Almost 90 percent. A \nlot of those trains are being run full these days. Part of the success \nfor Amtrak, not the whole solution but part of it, is to make the \nexpress service, the Acela Express service--which is very popular, very \nmuch in demand, and is a premium service that people pay a lot of money \nto ride--to use the monies generated from that service to use as a cash \ncow to help support the other train service Amtrak provides where, \nfrankly, they don't make the kind of money or generate the kind of \nrevenues such as those generated by the Acela Express.\n\n  There is a complement to the legislation that is before us tonight in \nterms of the Amtrak investment. There is complement legislation that \nhas been offered by Senator Lautenberg, Senator Lott, myself, and \nothers that is called the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act \nof 2007. It is basically a reauthorization for Amtrak and says: Let us \nnot worry about a line or let us not stop with a line in an \nappropriations bill, however important that is--and it is important--\nbut let us look at the whole system nationwide and come up with ways we \ncan provide, on an ongoing basis, for a more cost-effective service, \nmaybe better quality service, and to provide incentives for States to \ninvest in that service as well as the Federal Government.\n  It is legislation I hope we will take up on the floor. Believe it or \nnot, we passed it about year and a half ago as an amendment to an \nappropriations bill, but it died in conference. We hope to take it up \non its own and pass it. Representative Oberstar, in the House, has \nindicated a strong interest in working with us on companion \nlegislation, and my hope is we will do that.\n  One last thing I wish to mention. For the last couple years, Senator \nVoinovich and I have spent a fair amount of time talking with one \nanother and with others, and having people talk to us, about the need \nfor investing in our infrastructure--not just passenger rail but \ninvesting in our infrastructure. And not just highways and bridges but \nwastewater treatment systems, clean water systems, flood control \nsystems, and levees--infrastructure in a broader context.\n  As a politician, I have been a State treasurer, a Congressman, a \nGovernor, and now a Senator. I know from experience that we love having \nribbon cuttings. We like to cut a ribbon on a new highway or to open a \nnew bridge. We like to have a ribbon cutting on a new runway at an \nairport or a new terminal. We like to build things that are new. We \ndon't always want to spend the money to maintain what is not new or \nwhat once was new and now has begun to degrade in its quality. Senator \nVoinovich and I have introduced legislation that has been passed \nwithout a dissenting vote in the Senate which says that even though \nmaintaining our infrastructure isn't the sexiest of issues, it is an \nissue that demands our attention.\n  What we propose is to set the stage for the next administration and \nthe next Congress in a way that will better ensure that we address our \naging infrastructure. And for a couple of reasons: One, for health and \nsafety reasons; two, for economic reasons; and, three, for competitive \nreasons, to enable us to have a more vibrant economy and be competitive \nwith the rest of the world in which we are competing and cooperating.\n  One of my colleagues tonight was talking to us about delegating our \nresponsibilities to commissions, and she expressed her dismay that we \ndid so much of that. Sometimes creating a commission is not so good an \nidea; other times, it can be a very good idea, as we saw in 1982. \nSocial Security was about to go under, and so we created a blue-ribbon \ncommission, led by Alan Greenspan, with a lot of good people on it. \nThat led to a nearly unanimous consent agreement in 1983 about what we \nneeded to do to save Social Security, literally from its demise that \nyear. So we know from experience that commissions can serve a most \npositive purpose. The Postal Reform Commission, which the President \nappointed a couple years ago, worked with us in the Congress, and we \npassed very good legislation to bring the Postal Service into the 21st \ncentury.\n  What Senator Voinovich and I came up with is an infrastructure \ncommission that would hopefully tee up for the next President and the \nnext Congress a game plan, if you will, for investing in our \ninfrastructure. Our proposal would call not just for looking at roads, \nhighways, bridges, not just rail transit, not just airports, not just \nwastewater treatment, not just levees and flood control systems, but \nreally to look at our entire infrastructure broadly and see what needs \nto be addressed 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15, 20, 25 years \nfrom now, what the priorities should be and how might we pay for that.\n\n  Our legislation calls for this Commission, eight members: two \nappointed by the President, two by the leaders of the House and Senate, \nmajority leaders in the House and Senate--Speaker of the House, \nmajority leader in the Senate--and one each by the minority leaders of \nthe House and Senate, eight in all. As it turns out, four would be \nappointed by Republican officials and four would be by Democratic \nofficials, and their charge would be to come back to us after the 2008 \nelection--really, I think, sometime into 2009--and say this is a game \nplan. By working on it for the next year and a half, trying to build \nconsensus, we would have a starting-off point in that next \nadministration, with hopefully some buy-in from the new President and \nfrom our new Congress, to get started.\n  In any event, our colleagues here in the Senate said that this idea \nhad some merit. They were good enough to give it unanimous support. It \nwas introduced in the House by a Representative from Minnesota named \nEllison, Keith Ellison. We are hopeful the House will take up the \nmeasure and we can send it to the President before this year is out.\n  I would make a mistake before concluding if I didn't also express my\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nthanks to the chair, Senator Murray, and to our ranking member on the \ncommittee for supporting some of the projects that are important to our \ncongressional delegation--Senator Biden, Congressman Castle and myself \nand others whom we are privileged to represent. A lot of people who \ndrive through my State ride up and down on I-95. Sometimes they have to \nwait for a while to get through a toll booth. There is some money in \nhere to reduce that congestion and those delays. There is money in here \nto widen I-95 a bit and enable traffic to move expeditiously through \nour little State. That is important. We have money for improving the \ntransit service in the northern part of the State where there is a lot \nof congestion and helping to move traffic up and down the coastal part \nof our State where a lot of people come in the summer and even in the \nfall months to visit places such as Rehoboth Beach and Bethany and \nDewey and Lewes.\n  We are grateful for all of those investments in Federal dollars and \nmore. They will benefit us in the State of Delaware, but because so \nmany people travel through our State--we are only about 50 miles wide \nand roughly 100 miles long, but a lot of people drive through Delaware, \ntravel through Delaware on trains and other means of transportation, \ntheir own vehicles--we want to make sure they can move through more \nquickly, have less congestion, put less bad emissions into the air, and \nsave some gas. We think this legislation will help do all of those \nthings.\n  That is pretty much what I wanted to get off my chest tonight. I \nthank you for the opportunity to do it and look forward to tomorrow \nmorning when we convene again and have an opportunity to vote on a few \nmore amendments and hopefully then, as a body, rise up and pass this \nlegislation and be prepared to go to conference with our friends from \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I filed an amendment that will reform \nthe Small Business Administration's, SBA, historically underutilized \nbusiness zone, HUBZone, program. As ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, one of my top \npriorities is to champion our Nation's small businesses and to promote \ntheir needs and concerns.\n  My amendment capitalizes on and enhances the HUBZone program, which \nhelps to bring small businesses to distressed regions across our \ncountry. The HUBZone program stimulates economic development and \ncreates jobs in urban and rural communities by providing Federal \ncontracting preferences to small businesses.\n  The SBA's most recent data shows the Federal Government met only 2.1 \npercent of its statutory 3 percent HUBZone agency-wide ``goaling'' \nrequirement. HUBZone small businesses represent only $7.2 billion of \nthe total $340 billion allocated toward small businesses in fiscal year \n2006.\n  My amendment would expand the reach of the HUBZone program. First, it \nwould include, as a HUBZone, the communities impacted by a military \nbase closed by a BRAC round. Under current law, only the military base \nitself qualifies as a HUBZone. My amendment would include surrounding \ncommunities which become economically devastated by the base closure.\n  My amendment also requires the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to complete a feasibility study, with legislative \nrecommendations, for addressing the issue of extending HUBZone status \nto rural impoverished regions that would otherwise qualify as a HUBZone \nregion but for being located in a county with a metropolitan \nstatistical area. It is imperative that we address this inequity that \nimpacts rural regions across the country, including the Penobscot \nregion in my home State of Maine.\n  The fact is small businesses are the driving force behind our \nNation's economic growth, creating nearly three-quarters of all net new \njobs and employing nearly 51 percent of the private sector workforce. \nMy amendment enhances the HUBZone program which creates more jobs and \nhelps our Nation's poorest regions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support amendment No. 2818, \noffered by colleagues, Senators Durbin, Snowe, Collins, Kerry, and \nmyself. This amendment would limit the amount of operating funds a \nsmall public housing authority will lose each year if they decide to \nopt out of asset management.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a final rule \non September 19, 2005, that outlines procedures for public housing \nauthorities to convert to asset management accounting. In the recent \npast, Congress has urged the Department to review and postpone the \nconversion process due to lack of guidance and difficulty many PHAs are \nfacing to implement the new plan. Small PHAs are having an extremely \nhard time converting to asset management due to lack of funds and \nstaff. Most of these agencies only have one or two people in the \ncentral office and their operating subsidy has been continuously \nunderfunded. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nAppropriations legislation includes language that will allow small \nagencies to opt out of asset management; however their operating fund \nsubsidy will be reduced each year they do not convert.\n  This amendment would help PHAs which operate 250 units or less and \nopt out of asset management by limiting the amount of money their \noperating subsidy can be reduced each year to 5 percent. In Wisconsin, \nnumerous agencies have expressed their support for the stop-loss \nprovision. For example, the Eau Claire Housing Authority would lose \nhalf of their subsidy by 2012, the Beloit Housing Authority would lose \nover $20,000 in operating funds in the first year and an additional \n$10,000 each year until 2012, and the Ladysmith Housing Authority, \nlocated in Rusk County, would lose over $15,000. These are just three \nexamples out of the 46 agencies in Wisconsin that would be negatively \nimpacted by HUD's rule if this amendment is not adopted.\n  It is imperative that these agencies stay operational. They serve the \nhousing needs for the low-income and elderly in rural communities \nacross the country. I urge the adoption of this important amendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of a strong \nbill, H.R. 3074, the Transportation and Housing funding bill for fiscal \nyear 2008. I congratulate Chairman Murray and Ranking Member Bond for \nproducing a bill that invests in America's critical infrastructure and \nhousing needs.\n  This bill faces a veto threat from President Bush because it exceeds \nthe funding levels he proposed back in February by about 5 percent. I \ncongratulate my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, however, \nbecause the increased funding fits within the overall budget adopted by \nthe Senate earlier this year. That budget has a smaller deficit than \nthe one proposed by the President. We have different spending \npriorities than President Bush. But I am confident that the priorities \nreflected in this bill are America's priorities. The Appropriations \nCommittee is to be congratulated for bringing us a bill that meets our \nneeds and does so in a fiscally responsible fashion.\n  The tragedy of the I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis this summer \nsent an alarm throughout the Nation. We need to embark upon a \nsignificant reinvestment in America's aging infrastructure. This bill \nmakes an initial downpayment on this reinvestment. The bill also \ncontains increases in other programs above the President's budget \nrequest. These, too, represent a much-needed investment.\n  The Hope VI Housing Program is designed to revitalize severely \ndistressed public housing. The President wanted to spend just $1 \nmillion on this program which is so important to our aging cities such \nas Baltimore. This bill, I am proud to say, increases the funding level \nfor Hope VI from $1 million to $100 million.\n  Several other housing programs get needed boosts as well. The section \n202 program for low-income seniors is $160 million above the \nPresident's request. In addition, the bill contains an innovative \nvoucher program, not requested by President Bush, which would provide \nsection 8 vouchers to homeless veterans.\n  This bill also contains a major increase in the funding level for the \ncommunity development block grant program, providing more than $1 \nbillion above the President's request. The\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nCDBG block grant program has spawned successful development and \nredevelopment in locations across the Nation. Its track record of \nsuccess is visible in the revitalized neighborhoods in both urban and \nrural communities across Maryland and America.\n  The President had zeroed out the successful Brownfields redevelopment \nprogram, but this bill provides $10 million. The brownfields programs \noperated by HUD, which is funded in this bill, and by EPA, which is \nseparately funded, have been enormously successful. All across \nBaltimore we see former manufacturing facilities returned to productive \nuse because of these programs. We have seen successful brownfields \nredevelopment projects in Hagerstown, in Prince George's County, and \nother sites across the State of Maryland. Our experience is not unique. \nThis is a wonderful program, and I am proud that this bill reverses \nPresident Bush's misguided attempt to eliminate the Brownfields \nredevelopment program in HUD.\n  Amtrak will receive nearly $1.5 billion in this bill, a $570 million \nboost over the President's request. Baltimore's Penn Station served \nmore than 900,000 passengers on Amtrak in fiscal 2006. The BWI Airport \nstation in Lithicum, MD, had more than 560,000 boardings and \ndeboardings in fiscal 2006. Amtrak plays a vital role in our national \ntransportation system, posting a record ridership of 24.3 million \npassengers last year. This bill provides Amtrak with the funding \nnecessary to continue all current services and improve railway \ninfrastructure.\n  The list of programs that are critical to America and given \nappropriate funding resources in this bill is long. The major funding \nlevels in this bill, from transportation to housing, represent a \nsensible investment in America.\n  In Maryland there are a number of specific provisions that I also \nwant to highlight. The bill contains transportation funding for \nprojects that will help Maryland cope with the major influx of workers \nand their families associated with the most recent round of Base \nRealignment and Closures, or BRAC. Harford County, MD, is home to the \nAberdeen Proving Ground. This bill contains $3 million for BRAC-related \ntransportation projects in the immediate vicinity of the Base.\n  Similarly, the bill contains $3 million for improvements on Maryland \nRoute 355 in the area of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, \nwhich will now be home to the Walter Reed Hospital operations. As many \nof my colleagues know, traffic in this area is already very \nchallenging, so this funding is especially important to help us adapt \nto the infusion of additional workers at NNMC-Bethesda.\n  Money is also included for two Transit Center operations. The Bi-\nCounty Transit Center in Langley Park will serve bus passengers in \nMontgomery and Prince George's County. The Central Maryland Transit \nOperations Facility in the middle of the State is also funded at $1 \nmillion. We must make sure that transit programs are our first option \nas we try to move increasing numbers of people in congested areas that \nsuffer from poor air quality. This bill makes that key investment in \nMaryland.\n  The bill provides $13 million for the final design of MARC commuter \nrail improvements and rolling stock. As thousands of Maryland commuters \ncan attest every day, the MARC commuter rail service is filled to \ncapacity every workday. These funds will help to meet the needs of a \ngrowing system.\n  The Transportation title also contains $500,000 to buy an unused \nrailroad bridge in Baltimore. Funding will be used to assess, acquire, \nand restore the old CSX Railroad Bridge across the Middle Branch of the \nPatapsco River. That bridge will serve as the vital connecting link for \nthe Gwynns Falls Trail, a highly valued pedestrian and bike path that \ntraverses Baltimore City.\n  The Housing and Urban Development title also includes funds for \nseveral Maryland-specific projects.\n  The east Baltimore workforce development project will receive \n$200,000 as part of a comprehensive program to bring jobs, training and \nneighborhood revitalization to a distressed east Baltimore \nneighborhood.\n  Montgomery County Long Branch pedestrian linkages project is funded \nat $400,000. This project will create pedestrian-friendly linkages from \napartment complexes to the public resources and commercial core of the \nLong Branch neighborhood in Montgomery County.\n  Colmar Manor is a small town just over the State line from the \nDistrict of Columbia in Prince George's County. The Colmar Manor \nCommunity Center, which will serve four of the port towns along the \nAnacostia River, will benefit from the $600,000 provided in the bill.\n  Mr. President, $500,000 in funding will support environmental \neducation for underserved students in the Baltimore area at the new \nIrvine Urban Outreach Center.\n  This bill addresses the needs of America and it addresses the needs \nof Maryland. I am proud to support it and encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in doing so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 3074, the Transportation, Housing \nand Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 2008.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $51.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2008, which will result in new outlays of $47.3 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $114.6 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $7 million below the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation for budget authority and is $286 million below its \nallocation for outlays. Section 218 of the reported bill exempts the \nGovernment National Mortgage Association from the requirements of the \nFederal Credit Reform Act of 1990.

Mr. President, I know that over the last 6 years every \nSenator has had to send some of their sons and daughters in their State \noff to war, but today is the first time as a Member of this body I have \nhad to see so many members of a squadron in my State deployed. So it is \nwith great pride that I rise to honor the 400 air men and women of the \nAir Force's 819th RED HORSE Squadron. About one-half of this squadron \nis deploying today for training in Wisconsin before going to Iraq later \nthis year.\n  Over the last decade, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, MT, \nhas been the home of the 819th RED HORSE Squadron. For the uninitiated, \nRED HORSE stands for rapid engineer deployable heavy operation repair \nsquadron engineer. Basically, these are the men and women who rebuild \nAir Force facilities overseas, such as runways. They also have spent \nconsiderable time in Iraq rebuilding schools and homes. These are men \nand women who do some truly wonderful work.\n  In a previous deployment to Iraq in 2005, the squadron was involved \nin 130 construction projects on 12 different bases in Iraq. The 819th \nhas served in Afghanistan and Qatar. In every place they have taken on \ncomplicated engineering projects for the U.S. Government but have also \ndone outstanding work with locals to rehabilitate housing and provide \nresidents with everything from coloring books for kids to new washing \nmachines.\n  It is a combination of accomplishment, strength, and generosity that \nrepresents the best of our Nation.\n  This afternoon, as the men and women of the 819th begin to train for\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nthe mission that will send them to Iraq, they leave behind spouses, \nchildren, and other family members. We know that piano recitals and \nfootball games will be missed this fall. There will be an empty chair \nat too many holiday meals.\n  The 819th is an Active Associate unit, meaning that it is compromised \nof both Active-Duty airmen and Air National Guardsmen. For the citizen \nsoldiers of our Air Guard, these deployments can be especially \ndifficult, and I hope all Montanans will keep these airmen and their \nfamilies in their thoughts and prayers.\n  And when they return home, we have a moral responsibility to care for \nthe folks who have worn the uniform of our country. Whether they return \nto Active Duty or reenter civilian life, the Federal Government must \nsupport them. Congress has taken numerous steps this year to provide \nmore resources for the VA and to improve the quality of life for our \ntroops. I hope we will continue to make progress in these areas so that \nwhen the 819th comes home we are able to welcome these airmen back home \nwith our deeds and not just our words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11406-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COST ESTIMATE OF S. 966\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on June 27, 2007, the Committee on Foreign \nRelations ordered reported S. 966, the Passport Backlog Reduction Act \nof 2007. On July 30, the President signed the bill into law, Public Law \n110-50.\n  At the time the committee filed its report, the cost estimate \nprepared by the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, was not available. It \nwas recently provided to the committee by CBO. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the CBO estimate be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n       Public Law 110-50--Passport Backlog Reduction Act of 2007\n\n       Public Law 110-50 (formerly S. 966) grants the Department \n     of State additional flexibility in rehiring Foreign Service \n     annuitants on a temporary basis to reduce backlogs in visa \n     and passport processing. The new authority will expire in \n     2008 for visa backlogs and in 2009 for passport backlogs. CBO \n     estimates Public Law 110-50 will cost $2 million in 2008 and \n     $3 million over the 2008-2012 period, assuming the \n     availability of appropriated funds. The law does not affect \n     direct spending or receipts.\n       Under previous law, Foreign Service retirees could work for \n     the department for up to six months, provided they didn't \n     reach a certain salary cap. According to information provided \n     by the department, about half the retirees hit the salary cap \n     before six months (at four months, on average). The \n     department is already in the process of hiring 55 retirees \n     and plans to hire an additional 250 retirees to work on visa \n     and passport backlogs. By providing a waiver for the salary \n     cap, Public Law 110-50 allows the department to retain some \n     of those retirees for an additional two months. Under this \n     law, CBO estimates that about 150 retirees will work an \n     additional two months in 2008 at a cost of $2 million, and \n     about 65 retirees will work an additional two months in 2009 \n     at a cost of $1 million.\n       Public Law 110-50 contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Sunita D'Monte. \n     This estimate was approved by Peter H. Fontaine, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11406-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Kevin Gilbertson\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of Senator Daniel Baugh Brewster. I was a great admirer of \nSenator Brewster, and I hold the Brewster seat in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Brewster was a true patriot. He was a hero at the age of 19 \nwhen he volunteered for the Marine Corps and was sent to the front \nlines of the war in the Pacific. There he served bravely--leading the \n1944 assault on Guam and the 1945 assault on Okinawa. He bore the \nwounds of war like so many of our heroic veterans. He was wounded seven \ntimes and had a permanent scar on his forehead from a bullet that \nlifted his helmet and grazed his scalp while battling for Sugar Loaf \nHill on Okinawa. For his bravery, he was awarded a Purple Heart, two \nGold Stars, and two Bronze Stars.\n  As with many World War II veterans, Senator Brewster came back a \nchanged man. He was disappointed when some of his neighbors in Green \nSpring Valley voiced outrage at him for inviting African-American \nfriends he had served with during the war to his home. This experience \nfurther fueled both his desire to run for office and his lifetime \ncommitment to civil rights.\n  Senator Brewster graduated from University of Maryland School of Law \nin 1949, and was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1950. \nAfter serving two terms, Senator Brewster ran for and was elected to \nrepresent Maryland's Second District in Congress in 1958. In 1962, Mr. \nBrewster was elected to the Senate. He was just 39 years old.\n  In the Senate, Brewster was a champion for civil rights. He \ncosponsored the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and served as the \nstand-in candidate for President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 Presidential \nprimary campaign in Maryland against segregationist candidate George \nWallace of Alabama. The contest was seen as a crucial battle in the \nfight for civil rights. Despite threats to his family, he campaigned \nvigorously and won the primary for President Johnson.\n  Senator Brewster served as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee at the time the war in Vietnam was escalating. Publicly, he \ntook a hawkish position on the war, but privately he expressed concerns \nabout the war and shared those concerns with President Johnson.\n  After leaving the Senate, Senator Brewster devoted his time to his \nfamily, farming, and volunteering. He was an original director and \nformer president of the Maryland State Fair and chaired the Governor's \nCommission on Alcoholism and the Governor's Commission on AIDS.\n  Senator Brewster's congressional legacy lives on today as two of his \nSenate interns from Maryland, Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, \nwent on to prestigious political careers of their own.\n  I offer my heartfelt condolences to Senator Brewster's family and to \nhis friends and to all those whose lives he touched. Senator Brewster's \nfamily is in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11406-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11406-S11407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in the 2 months since Hamas took control of \nGaza, 40 tons of explosives have been smuggled from Egypt into Gaza. It \nis estimated that 80 tons have been smuggled in the last 2 years. \nRafah, in southern Gaza, has long been a key conduit for smuggling \nassault rifles, pistols, ammunition, explosive materials, grenade \nlaunchers and other munitions. While smuggling has long been\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\na problem along this stretch of the border, the Israeli military has \nreported a surge in smuggling of anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank \nrockets and bomb components when Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.\n  There has also been a clear loss of progress made with regard to \ndemocracy and the rule of law in Egypt. Prominent members of parliament \nlike Ayman Nour who have criticized the regime have been jailed. Nour \nwas the leading opponent in Egypt's 2005 presidential race and was \narrested on dubious charges shortly after that election.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, ``Security forces and police \nroutinely torture and mistreat detainees, particularly during \ninterrogations. Torture in the past was used primarily against \npolitical dissidents, but in recent years it has been rife in police \nstations as well, affecting ordinary citizens.'' Cellphone videos \nposted on the Internet have shown the police sodomizing a bus driver \nwith a broomstick and hanging a woman by her knees and wrists from a \npole for questioning.\n  The United States has provided substantial help to Egypt over the \nyears. For its part, Egypt should do more to control its border with \nGaza and improve its record on democracy and the rule of law.\n  To that end, section 699 of H.R. 2764, as passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, requires the Secretary of State to certify that the \nGovernment of Egypt has taken ``concrete and measurable'' steps to stop \nthe smuggling of arms into Gaza, improve the independence of the \njudiciary, and improve criminal procedures and due process rights. It \nconditions $200 million of $1.3 billion of fiscal year 2008 foreign \nmilitary financing assistance on demonstration of that clear and \nmeasurable progress.\n  We note that between the date the House passed H.R. 2764 and final \naction by the Congress on this legislation, more than 3 months will \nhave passed. Even more time will pass if it becomes necessary for the \nSenate to take up an omnibus appropriations act this fall. \nConsequently, there is plenty of time for Egypt to show progress in \nstopping arms flows to Hamas in Gaza and to reverse recent backsliding \nin democratic reforms before the U.S. Congress finalizes this \nlegislation.\n  The amendment I offer with Senators Lieberman, Collins and Ensign, \nand which I am pleased has been accepted unanimously, puts the Senate \non the record stating unambiguously that Egypt must take clear and \nmeasurable steps to demonstrate progress on both reducing the flow of \narms into Gaza as well as to undoing damage done to the rule of law and \ndemocracy.\n  As Congress moves toward enactment of this appropriations bill, it is \nimperative that support to Egypt be based on an evaluation of the \nperformance of the Egyptian government since the initial House action. \nCongress must consider these results in determining what approach \nCongress should take regarding Egypt's foreign military financing aid \nduring fiscal year 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11407-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11407-S11408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EXPLANATION OF ``BY REQUEST'' LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the meaning of ``by \nrequest'' legislation and more specifically about my continuation of a \nlongstanding practice in the Veterans' Affairs Committee of the \nchairman introducing legislation at the request of the administration.\n  While I expect that those who deal regularly with the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, such as the established veterans service \norganizations, understand the meaning of a bill introduced ``by \nrequest,'' I have recently become aware that there are some veterans \nwho are unfamiliar with this practice and who, therefore, have \nmisinterpreted my recent introduction of certain ``by request'' \nlegislation as support for the passage of the bills into law. This is \nnot the case.\n  As our colleagues know, periodically the administration sends forward \nto the Congress legislation for consideration. Those measures that fall \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Veterans' Affairs Committee are referred \nby the Parliamentarian to our committee. In a tradition that began in \nthe earliest days of the committee, the chairman, as a courtesy to the \nadministration, introduces such bills on a ``by request'' basis. This \nis a courtesy that has generally been extended to every administration \nand by every chairman, regardless of the party affiliation of the \nadministration or chairman, and one that I am pleased to continue.\n  When I introduce legislation ``by request,'' I am taking no position \non the legislation. In fact, I introduce such legislation without \nincluding any statement or explanatory materials. I do so for the \nexpress purpose of both accommodating the administration and ensuring \nthat others are aware of the proposed legislation so that they might \nanalyze it and, if they wish, comment upon it. As chairman, I am \ncommitted to the development of the best possible policy in the area of \nveterans issues and I firmly believe that this goal is most \nsuccessfully achieved with the free exchange of ideas, not by stifling \ndifferent points of view.\n  During this Congress, in accordance with this practice, I have \nintroduced four ``by request'' bills, S. 1757, S. 2025, S. 2026, and S. \n2027. It is one of these measures, S. 2026, relating to certain Agent \nOrange issues, that has generated the most confusion among some \nveterans. I hope that my explanation of ``by request'' legislation \nhelps to clear up these misunderstandings.\n  I have taken no position on any of these four bills and simply \nintroduced them as a professional courtesy to the administration. \nIndeed, at this point, I do not know whether these bills will receive \nconsideration by the committee. For those who have views on some or all \nof these measures, I welcome your input. I ask that in providing your \nviews you recognize that my introduction of ``by request'' legislation \nshould not be interpreted as a reflection of my views on the content of \nany such bill.\n\n\n               NATIONAL PANCREATIC CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am in support of S. Res. 222, a \nresolution that recognizes November as National Pancreatic Cancer \nAwareness Month. This resolution represents a way to educate \ncommunities across the Nation about pancreatic cancer and the need for \nincreased research funding, early detection methods, and effective \ntreatments and educational programs. I am pleased to be joining my \ncolleague, Senator Clinton, as the lead sponsor of this important \nmeasure.\n  Like many Americans, I have seen the ramifications of cancer \nfirsthand. I support this resolution in honor and loving memory of the \nmillions of Americans who have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer \nand their families, and for my mother Jessica Udall Smith whom I lost \nto this killer.\n  Pancreatic cancer is hard to detect in its early stages as it doesn't \ncause symptoms right away. Also, because the pancreas is hidden behind \nother organs, health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors \nduring routine exams. Because there are no early detection methods, \npancreatic cancer often is found late and spreads quickly.\n  This year, more than 37,000 Americans will receive a diagnosis of \npancreatic cancer and for over 33,000 of them their diagnosis will \nultimately end in their death. While overall cancer death rates have \ndeclined, the number of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is \nincreasing. It is projected that this year, 440 Oregonians will die \nfrom pancreatic cancer. That represents a 17 percent increase in \npancreatic cancer deaths in Oregon over the last 3 to 4 years.\n  Pancreatic cancer has been forced into the national spotlight in \nrecent weeks. On August 18, 2007, Michael Deaver, one of former \nPresident Ronald Reagan's closest advisers, succumbed to the disease at \nage 69. Just last week, famed opera singer Luciano Pavarotti died after \na yearlong battle at age 71. Something that is striking about both of \ntheir cases is that despite their celebrity and contacts, neither man \nhad much more than a fighting chance of overcoming this disease. There \nare simply no curative treatments--experimental or FDA approved--that \ncurrently are available to fight this disease, even when price is no \nobject.\n  Individuals fighting pancreatic cancer continue to face \ndiscouragingly low odds of survival. In 1975, the 5-year survival rate \nfor pancreatic cancer was 2 percent. Twenty-five years later, the \nsurvival rate remains at an unacceptably low level of 5 percent, making \nthis cancer the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. Indeed, \npancreatic\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\ncancer is considered the deadliest cancer, of which 75 percent of \npatients diagnosed with this disease die within the first year and most \nwithin the first 3 to 6 months. Early detection tools, such as those \nthat currently are available for ovarian, colon, breast and prostate \ncancer, would make a significant impact on pancreatic cancer, but those \ntools require a new investment in basic scientific research at the \nNational Cancer Institute, NCI.\n  I support biomedical research and the great promise it holds in the \ndevelopment of new treatments and possible cures for the many types of \ncancer, including pancreatic cancer. Past investments at the NCI have \nhelped drive new discoveries that led to the decline in overall cancer \ndeaths in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Now is the time to \nexpand our efforts in the fight against pancreatic cancer, but that \nwill be impossible unless we find a way to secure more funding for the \nNCI.\n  The Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Network is a national organization \nthat is working to comprehensively address the problem of pancreatic \ncancer by providing patient support, advancing research, and creating \nhope. I support their efforts to raise awareness of this disease and \nbelieve that it is important that we recognize November as National \nPancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.\n  I ask my colleagues support this resolution, which will help increase \nresearch, education and awareness for pancreatic cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11408-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     UNITED STATES NORTHERN COMMAND\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I commemorate the fifth \nanniversary of U.S. Northern Command, located in Colorado Springs, CO. \nI take enormous pride in seeing the Colorado flag fly alongside the \nflags of the United States and Canada.\n  Officially, USNORTHCOM was established on October 1, 2002. However, \nit was the terrible events of September 11, 2001, that made the country \nrealize its need for increased homeland defense. Within 13 months of 9/\n11, USNORTHCOM stood up as the combatant command charged with defending \nthe homeland and providing military assistance to civil authorities.\n  Five years later, USNORTHCOM is proudly executing its missions of \nHomeland Defense and civil support operations to defend, protect, and \nsecure the United States and its interests.\n  Since 9/11, our Nation has been engaged in a fight against terrorism \non multiple fronts, including our homeland. As USNORTHCOM enters its \nfifth year, they are fully mission capable, prepared and ready to \nrespond to the broad spectrum of homeland defense challenges that exist \nin today's dynamic security environment. USNORTHCOM is actively \ndeterring threats from crossing our borders by closely working with \nother combatant commands, intelligence agencies and interagency \npartners to detect and defeat threats before they arrive in our \nhomeland.\n  When it comes to rendering assistance to civil authorities, U.S. \nNorthern Command is prepared to help. By anticipating threats, ranging \nfrom natural disasters to man-made, the command provides Department of \nDefense capabilities in a timely and coordinated fashion. Facilitated \nby Defense coordinating officers attached to every FEMA region, \nUSNORTHCOM works side by side with its interagency partners to support \nthe States and their emergency response teams when requested.\n  In its 5 short years of existence, USNORTHCOM has effectively \nresponded to several catastrophes. They have been absolutely essential \nto saving lives while mitigating the suffering and losses experienced.\n  USNORTHCOM understands the multi-agency approach to defending our \nhomeland and providing support to civil authorities. Therefore, it \nplaces a high priority on building and strengthening relationships with \nthe States, territories, other government and nongovernment agencies, \nas well as partnering with our border nations, Canada and Mexico.\n  USNORTHCOM is also actively engaged with the National Guard, and \nserves as the combatant command advocate to provide the Guard with the \ntools and resources necessary to accomplish their mission. A committed, \nlasting partnership between U.S. Northern Command and the National \nGuard will strengthen our national defense and defy those attempting to \nsabotage our way of life.\n  Let me also recognize the unsung heroes of this command, the men and \nwomen of U.S. Northern Command. They are synonymous with homeland \ndefense; they are a total force team of soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nmarines and Coast Guardsmen from the active and Reserve Components of \nour military. The men and women of USNORTHCOM clearly understand the \nimportance of their mission and carry out their responsibilities with a \nsense of urgency. Their pride in contributing to the defense of our \ngreat Nation is evident in every aspect of their operations.\n  To the men and women of U.S. Northern Command, I stand today to say: \nThank you for your dedication and service to the United States of \nAmerica. On the occasion of your fifth anniversary, I congratulate you \nfor a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11408-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING DR.

Chicoine as the 19th \npresident of South Dakota State University.\n  South Dakota State University has a rich history of strong leadership \ndating back to the commitment of President George Lilley, who advanced \n$500 of his own salary to finish three rooms in the first building on \ncampus. President Chicoine joins Dr. Berg and Dr. Wagner to become only \nthe third Jackrabbit to serve in this role.\n  The stage where Dr. Chicoine's inauguration will take place is \nevidence of SDSU's strong national presence, as 80 years ago this week \nSylvan Theatre and the Lincoln Memorial Library were dedicated by \nPresident Calvin Coolidge. The pioneering research completed at SDSU is \nimpacting lives around the world whether it be through improved \nagricultural practices, the ethanol in our gas tanks, the microwaves \nthat make our dinner, or the scoreboard at our favorite athletic event.\n  It is said that students come from the Sioux and Missouri, the \nCheyenne and the Jim, and the Black Hills to study at SDSU. Students \nstill come to Brookings from those places, but they also come from \npoints around the globe and with knowledge and diploma in hand they \nimpact communities in Brookings, in South Dakota, in neighboring \nstates, and truly around the world. It is said that ``You Can Go \nAnywhere from Here,'' and we celebrate that, in this case, one student \nhas made the trip full circle.\n  Congratulations and best wishes to President Chicoine on a long and \nsuccessful tenure at SDSU, and Go Jacks!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11408-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11408-S11409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING PAUL TAVARES\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \na great Rhode Islander: my good friend, Paul Tavares.\n  This weekend, Paul will be honored by the Portuguese American \nCitizens Committee as its Person of the Year, and the PACC simply could \nnot have made a better choice. This organization has contributed so \nmuch to the Portuguese community, and to our Ocean State, through its \ncivic, charitable and political work. It is fitting that this weekend, \nthe PACC will honor someone who has done the same. Paul's character, \nintegrity, and honesty have set an example, not only in his work in \npublic service, but throughout his life.\n  I have known Paul, and have been honored to call him my friend, since \nwe both ran for statewide office in 1998: he for general treasurer, and \nI for attorney general. His motto during that election was simple one: \n``No tricks, no gimmicks, just a Treasurer who'll do what's right.'' We \nboth fought hard battles and we both emerged victorious. And \nimmediately after being sworn in, we began a close and very productive \nrelationship that helped each of our offices work more efficiently. It \nhas been a lasting and a valued friendship.\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\n  Paul's record of accomplishment in the Treasurer's office is \noutstanding. One of his most notable achievements was his commitment to \nhelping Rhode Island families save for their children's college \neducation. As a result of his work, the CollegeBoundfund, Rhode \nIsland's section 529 college savings program, was recognized by MSN \nMoney in 2005 as one of the Nation's five best college savings plans in \nthe country. Columnist Liz Pulliam Weston wrote: ``It's a pity more of \nus don't live in Rhode Island if you live there, it's a mystery why \nyou'd invest anywhere else.'' With the help of the Attorney General's \noffice, he put a broken crime victims' compensation program back on its \nfeet. He led with integrity. Paul certainly carried out what he \nproposed to do, that is, to leave the Treasurer's office in a better \nState than what he inherited.\n  But Paul's story doesn't begin in the Treasurer's office. During his \nsuccessful career in the banking industry, Paul dedicated himself to a \nlife of public service, beginning his career on the East Providence \nSchool Committee, and then the East Providence City Council. In 1992, \nPaul was elected to Rhode Island's State senate, where he served until \ntaking office as general treasurer. I worked closely with Paul when I \nserved on Governor Bruce Sundlun's senior staff, and I saw up close \nwhat a good senator he was.\n  Paul's years in the Senate were full of significant accomplishments, \nespecially his efforts to create The CollegeBoundfund and his work on \nadoption; and his service as first deputy majority leader and as vice-\nchair of the Corporations Committee. Paul is remembered in the senate \nnot only for his committed service but also for his legendary ability \nto pull practical jokes on his fellow senators. One he particularly \nenjoyed was to ``borrow'' a piece of letterhead paper from one of his \nfellow senators and write a note to another senator. He would then ask \na page in the senate to deliver the letter and sit back to enjoy the \nensuing uproar. That story says so much about Paul: he never takes \nhimself too seriously; the jokes were always warm-hearted and they \nhelped break tensions in that body. Paul was good for the senate.\n  Paul has also never forgotten where he comes from. A son of \nPortuguese immigrants who migrated to the United States from the \nAzores, he has truly lived the American dream. I am sure Paul's \nparents, the late Anibal and Laurentina Tavares, are looking down on us \nproud to see how far Paul's determination and talent have carried him \nin life. And I am sure he would agree that he would not have enjoyed \nnearly as much success without the love and support of his lovely wife \nLee, his daughters Tessa, Kristen and Felicia, and his sons Nicholas \nand Andrew. Their unwavering commitment to Paul, and his unwavering \ncommitment to them, have been extraordinary.\n  Rhode Islanders who know Paul also know well his selfless service to \nhis community. Paul founded the Portuguese American Scholarship \nFoundation, is a cofounder of the East Providence Children's Portuguese \nSchool, and served on the Catholic Diocese of Providence Finance \nCouncil. His work in these organizations has not only enriched the \nOcean State's Portuguese community, but has changed lives all over \nRhode Island. And he does not just help people through organizations. \nMany Rhode Islanders know stories of people showing up on Paul's \ndoorstep, asking for his help. Each time, he listened and did what he \ncould. Paul has spent his life helping others without asking anything \nin return.\n  I am pleased to come to the floor of the Senate to join the \nPortuguese American Citizens Committee in recognizing the tremendous \naccomplishments of our friend Paul Tavares. I extend congratulations, \nheartfelt thanks for a job well done, and best wishes to Paul and his \nfamily in all their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11409-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2467.

A bill to \nrequire an assessment of the plans for the modernization and \nsustainment of the land-based, Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \nmissile strategic deterrent force, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Strategic \nDeterrent Sustainment Act of 2007, which is cosponsored by Senator \nBennett. Currently, our land-based strategic forces are in the process \nof completing a vital and important modernization program.\n  However, I am unaware of any Department of Defense plan to maintain \nour land-based strategic missile industrial base once this \nmodernization is completed in the next 2 to 3 years. Therefore, this \nlegislation would require the Secretary of Defense to prepare a report \ndetailing how our Nation will maintain an industrial base to replace \nthe Minuteman III missile with a follow-on land-based strategic \ndeterrent after 2030. 2030, is of course, the date in which the \nMinuteman III system is scheduled to be replaced. The Secretary, under \nthis legislation, will also be required to outline how our Nation will \nmaintain, modernize and sustain the Minuteman III intercontinental \nballistic missile system until at least 2030.\n  To put this in context, in 2002, the administration wisely committed \nthe U.S. to a policy of modernizing our land-based intercontinental \nballistic missile force. Under this policy, the Peacemaker ICBM has \nbeen retired and that system's warheads are being retrofitted and \nplaced into the Minuteman III fleet. In addition to the new warheads, \n500 Minuteman III systems are being completely rebuilt and thoroughly \nmodernized.\n  Unfortunately, after this work is completed, no other work on land-\nbased strategic missile systems is planned. As we all know, building an \nintercontinental ballistic missile is extremely complex and a great \nfeat of engineering. It requires engineers with years of experience and \nhighly trained and professional manufacturing specialists to \nsuccessfully and safely build a missile system. Clearly, if there are \nnot any additional systems to build, then these sought after engineers \nand specialists will merely find employment elsewhere. In addition, if \na replacement system will not be built\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nuntil 2030, it is very likely that much of our Nation's knowledge on \nhow to design and build a land-based strategic missile system will be \nlost.\n  As an example, one can point to the British who recently decided to \nmodernize their nuclear deterrent. Since the British nuclear warhead \nindustrial base all but ceased to exist years ago, that nation will now \nhave to allocate billions of additional pounds to reconstitute their \ndesign and production capability.\n  What would be the cost of our Nation to maintain our land-based \nstrategic missile industrial base? Well I understand, the propulsion \nportion of the industrial base can be maintained for the relatively \nmodest sum of under $50 million a year. In fact, such a program already \nexists for our submarine launched ballistic missile systems. Under this \nindustrial base sustainment plan, 12 Trident missiles are manufactured \neach year.\n  Should a plan to maintain our land-based strategic missile industrial \nbase closely follow our submarine launched strategic missile industrial \nplans? Well under this legislation, the Secretary of Defense will have \nthe opportunity to make that determination.\n  In conclusion, during this period of uncertainty we must keep our \nNation's defense industrial options open in order to meet the threats \nof the future. The Strategic Deterrent Sustainment Act of 2007 affords \nus that opportunity and I hope that it will receive from my colleagues \nthe support it deserves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strategic Deterrent \n     Sustainment Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The strategic forces of the United States remain a \n     cornerstone of United States national security.\n       (2) The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review states that it is the \n     current policy of the United States that intercontinental \n     ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic \n     missiles, and long-range nuclear-armed bombers play a \n     critical role in the defense capabilities of the United \n     States, its allies, and friends.\n       (3) The dispersed and alert Minuteman III intercontinental \n     ballistic missile system provides the most responsive, \n     stabilizing, and cost-effective strategic force.\n       (4) Section 139 of the John Warner National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109-364; \n     120 Stat. 2114) requires the Secretary of the Air Force to \n     modernize Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles \n     in the United States inventory so as to maintain a sufficient \n     supply of launch test assets and spares to sustain the \n     deployed force of such missiles through 2030.\n       (5) The modernization program for the Minuteman III \n     intercontinental ballistic missile is nearing completion. \n     Once that program is complete, there will be no program to \n     sustain the capability of the United States industrial base \n     to modernize or replace the intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles that constitute the sole land-based strategic \n     deterrent system of the United States.\n       (6) As an example, motor production for the Minuteman III \n     Propulsion Replacement Program (PRP) is currently scheduled \n     to end in fiscal year 2009. Once the PRP program ends, the \n     capacity of the United States industrial base to respond to \n     matters arising from the aging and obsolescence of Minuteman \n     III intercontinental ballistic missiles will be extremely \n     diminished, decades-worth of critical program knowledge may \n     be lost, and the current design of the Minuteman III \n     intercontinental ballistic missile is likely to no longer be \n     reproducible.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT ON CAPABILITIES FOR SUSTAINMENT OF THE \n                   MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC \n                   MISSILE.\n\n       (a) Report Required.--Not later than March 1, 2008, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report on the capability of the United \n     States industrial base to achieve each of the following:\n       (1) To maintain, modernize, and sustain the Minuteman III \n     intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system until at \n     least 2030.\n       (2) To replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \n     missile with a follow-on land-based strategic deterrent \n     system after 2030.\n       (b) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of any current plans for extending the \n     Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system after \n     the period from 2020 to 2030, including plans for testing \n     sufficient to account for any aging and obsolescence found in \n     the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile during \n     the remaining life of the system, and an assessment of the \n     risks associated with such plans after the shutdown of \n     associated production lines.\n       (2) A description of any current plans to maintain the \n     Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system after \n     2030, including an assessment of any risks associated with \n     such plans after the shutdown of associated production lines.\n       (3) An explanation why the Minuteman III intercontinental \n     ballistic missile system, the only United States land-based \n     strategic deterrent system, is no longer considered to be of \n     the highest national defense urgency, as indicated by \n     inclusion of the system on the so-called ``DX-Rated Program \n     List'' while the sea-based strategic deterrent system, the \n     Trident II D5 missile system, is still on the so-called ``DX-\n     list''.\n       (4) An analysis of existing commonalities between the \n     service life extension program for the Trident II D5 missile \n     system and any equivalent planned service life extension \n     program for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \n     missile system, including an analysis of the impact on \n     materials, the supplier base, production facilities, and the \n     production workforce of extending all or part of the service \n     life extension program for the Trident II D5 missile system \n     to a service life extension program for the Minuteman III \n     intercontinental ballistic missile system.\n       (5) An assessment of the adequacy of current and \n     anticipated programs, such as missile defense, space launch, \n     and prompt global strike programs, to support the industrial \n     base for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile \n     system, including an analysis of the impact on materials, the \n     supplier base, production facilities, and the production \n     workforce of extending all or part of any such program to the \n     program for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \n     missile system.\n       (c) Comptroller General Review.--Not later than 60 days \n     after submittal under subsection (a) of the report required \n     by that subsection, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit to the congressional defense committees a \n     report setting forth the Comptroller General's assessment of \n     the matters contained in the report under subsection (a), \n     including an assessment of the consistency of the budget of \n     the President for fiscal year 2009, as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, \n     with the matters contained in the report under subsection \n     (a).\n       (d) Congressional Defense Committees Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``congressional defense committees'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Brown, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Byrd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Feingold, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        Mr. Sanders, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Tester, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Salazar):\n  S.J. Res. 18. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services relating to a cost limit for \nproviders operated by units of government and other provisions under \nthe Medicaid program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Rockefeller, \nObama, Brown, Kerry, Byrd, Feinstein, Bill Nelson, Feingold, Murray, \nBayh, Lincoln, Pryor, Whitehouse, Sanders, Cantwell, Tester, Clinton, \nLandrieu, and Salazar to offer a Joint Resolution that provides for \nCongressional disapproval of the rule submitted by the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, relating to a cost limit for \nproviders operated by units of government and other provisions under \nthe Medicaid program, 72 Fed. Reg. 29748, May 29, 2007.\n  This rule is a very blunt and sweeping instrument. It is purportedly \nintended to stamp out certain categories of Medicaid fraud, which by \nCMS's own admission may only be an issue in 3 States. As a result of \nthe sweeping nature of this rule, many States like New Mexico will lose \nhundreds of millions of dollars in Federal Medicaid dollars. This would \noccur despite that fact that New Mexico and other States have worked \nhard to ensure the integrity of their Medicaid programs and have \nconsistently received approval from CMS for the design and operation of \ntheir programs.\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\n  Congress has reacted strongly to the proposed regulation with 65 \nSenators and 263 House Members publicly criticizing the rule. \nUltimately, Congress temporarily prevented CMS from implementing the \nregulation. A 1-year moratorium of the rule was adopted in the recent \nsupplemental appropriations bill, P.L. 110-28, Section 7002. This \nmoratorium blocks CMS from implementing the Medicaid regulation before \nMay 25, 2008.\n  In spite of clear Congressional disapproval, CMS published a final \nrule in the Federal Register the very day the President signed the 1-\nyear moratorium provision into law. The final regulation retains the \nmost damaging components of the proposed regulation, including limiting \nMedicaid payments to safety-net hospitals. In addition, we have been \ncontacted by State Medicaid agencies that have been asked to certify in \nState Plan Amendments being considered this year that they will be in \ncompliance with rule as soon as the moratorium is lifted in 2008.\n  Major Medicaid reforms require a Congressional role; by rushing to \npublish a final regulation, CMS has disregarded Congressional \nopposition and attempted to usurp our role. CMS's action requires \nStates to prepare for implementation of the regulation and expend \nadministrative resources to do so, all of this before Congress has the \nopportunity to address the key policy issues contained in the \nregulation.\n  This Resolution of Disapproval will permanently halt the damaging CMS \nregulation. At this time, it is the appropriate response given CMS's \nissuance of the final Medicaid rule and its devastating effect on State \nMedicaid programs, safety-net providers, and, ultimately, the ability \nof low-income Americans to receive the life-saving medical care to \nwhich they are entitled under Federal law.\n  Therefore, I rise today to offer joint resolution with my colleagues \nand urge others to join in cosponsoring this important resolution. \nTogether we can work to ensure its passage before the devastating \nMedicaid rule takes effect and jeopardizes our States' Medicaid \nprograms.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of joint resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 18\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services relating to a cost limit for providers operated by \n     units of government and other provisions under the Medicaid \n     program (published at 72 Fed. Reg. 29748 (May 29, 2007)), and \n     such rule shall have no force or effect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11418-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 315--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT GENERAL \n   DAVID H.

Sense of the Senate.\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Millions of American families are at risk of losing \n     their homes in foreclosure as their adjustable-rate subprime \n     loans have reset or will reset in the near future.\n       (2) Based on recent housing data, the current foreclosure \n     crisis is likely just the tip of the iceberg, as nearly \n     2,000,000 adjustable-rate subprime mortgages are scheduled to \n     reset by the end of 2008.\n       (3) Rising foreclosures in a weak housing market could \n     cause an accelerating decline in home values as more houses \n     come on the market for resale (either from their owners or as \n     the result of foreclosures), and if such a situation \n     develops, the United States may see additional declines in \n     home prices and negative effects on the Nation's economy.\n       (4) Foreclosures have a significant negative impact, not \n     only on the borrower and lender, but also on neighboring \n     homeowners and the surrounding community because of lower \n     property values, decreased property tax revenues, and higher \n     municipal maintenance costs.\n       (5) A cost-effective way of preventing foreclosures is to \n     engage experienced nonprofit organizations in the \n     negotiations between borrowers and lenders for loan \n     modifications and refinancings.\n       (6) Many of these nonprofits are already overwhelmed by \n     requests for assistance, with some having received as many \n     requests for assistance in the first 6 months of this year as \n     they did in all of last year.\n       (7) It is essential that the capacity of these qualified \n     housing counselors be increased with additional funding, \n     especially in light of increasing evidence that some \n     homeowners are falling victim to fraudulent mortgage \n     foreclosure avoidance schemes.\n       (8) The Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban \n     Development, and Related Agencies of the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate has recognized the need for \n     increased funding for foreclosure-avoidance nonprofits by \n     providing in this Act $100,000,000 for these efforts.\n       (9) The Federal Government cannot solve this problem by \n     itself, and the efforts of others, particularly those banks \n     and mortgage servicers that have the ability, through loan \n     modifications and refinancings, to help homeowners avoid \n     foreclosures, are essential to addressing this problem.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the subprime crisis poses a danger to the housing market \n     and the economy as a whole, and efforts and resources at all \n     levels of government and in the private sector should be \n     devoted to alleviating this ongoing problem that threatens \n     millions of American families and their homes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2834.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In a recent report, the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) cited the lead analysis of Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics survey data suggesting that in the fourth quarter \n     of 2006 over 20,000 workers suffered job losses occurring \n     because of business relocations within the United States, the \n     majority of which crossed State lines.\n       (2) That State and local governments could be spending from \n     $20,000,000,000 to $50,000,000,000 annually on business \n     incentives.\n       (3) That States and local governments may be using tens of \n     billions of dollars of Federal funds on economic development \n     and business incentives.\n       (4) GAO identified 17 large Federal economic development \n     programs that State and local governments use to attract and \n     retain jobs.\n       (5) Nine of these Federal economic development programs \n     prohibit using program funds to relocate a business if such \n     move would cause a loss of jobs in the original location of \n     the business.\n       (6) Unfortunately, GAO found that several Federal agencies, \n     including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n     operate 6 Federal economic development programs, including \n     the Community Development Block Grant entitlement and State \n     programs, that contain no formal written monitoring guidance \n     specific to the employer relocation restriction.\n       (7) GAO suggests that without structured guidance and \n     procedures in place to monitor compliance with such \n     restriction, Federal agencies have limited assurance that \n     grant recipients and others are complying with the statutory \n     and regulatory requirements, and are spending funds on \n     allowable activities.\n       (8) GAO recommends, among other things, that the Secretary \n     of Housing and Urban Development develop and implement formal \n     and structured guidance for the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development to follow when monitoring for compliance \n     with the nonrelocation provisions in the Community \n     Development Block Grant entitlement and State programs.\n       (9) American taxpayers ought to know that their Federal tax \n     dollars are being used by State and local governments \n     appropriately and that relocation restrictions are being \n     followed to ensure that Federal financial assistance does not \n     benefit one community at the expense of another.\n       (b) Development, Implementation, and Submission of Plan.--\n     Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall--\n       (1) develop a formal, structured, and written plan that the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development shall use when \n     monitoring for compliance with the specific relocation \n     restrictions in--\n       (A) the Community Development Block Grant entitlement \n     program; and\n       (B) the Community Development Block Grant State program \n     that receives economic development funds from the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development; and\n       (2) submit such plan to the Committee on Appropriations of \n     both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2848.

(a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Fighting in Gaza during the summer of 2007 demonstrated \n     that the terrorist organization Hamas, which unlawfully \n     seized control over Gaza in June 2007, has been able to \n     achieve a dramatic increase in the quantity and \n     sophistication of arms at its disposal.\n       (2) Without these arms, the terrorist organization would \n     not have been able to seize control over the Gaza territory.\n       (3) There is substantial evidence that a significant \n     proportion of these arms were smuggled across the border \n     between Gaza and Egypt.\n       (4) The Egyptian military is a capable force, made possible \n     in substantial part by a close relationship with the United \n     States.\n       (5) Concurrent with the escalation of dangerous arms \n     smuggling across the border between Egypt and Gaza has been a \n     retrogression in the rule of law in Egypt.\n       (6) This loss of hard-earned ground has been characterized \n     by reports of harsh reaction by the Government of Egypt to \n     dissent, including the jailing of political opponents.\n       (7) The United States has provided aid to Egypt in excess \n     of $28,000,000,000 over the past three decades.\n       (b) The Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its long-standing friendship with the people \n     of Egypt;\n       (2) believes that our friendship with Egypt requires the \n     Senate to address such vital policy concerns;\n       (3) urges the Government of Egypt to make concrete and \n     measurable progress on restoring the rule of law, including \n     improving the independence of the judiciary and improving \n     criminal procedures and due process rights and halting the \n     cross-border flow of arms to Gaza;\n       (4) believes it is the best interest of Egypt, the region, \n     and the United States that Egypt takes prompt action to \n     demonstrate progress on these matters; and\n       (5) urges the Department of State to work vigorously and \n     expeditiously with the Government of Egypt and the Government \n     of Israel to bring the border between Egypt and Gaza border \n     under effective control.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of State, Foreign \n     Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2008''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11459-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11459-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 954) to designate the facility of the United \n     States Postal Service located at 365 West 125th Street in New \n     York, New York, as the ``Percy Sutton Post Office Building.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 954, a bill to designate the post office located at 365 West 125th \nStreet in Harlem as the Percy Sutton Post Office Building. Percy Sutton \nis a giant of the New York community. He is a patriot, a veteran \nTuskegee Airman, and a pioneering leader in multiple fields--\npolitician, civil rights activist, lawyer and entrepreneur. And, \nthrough a lifetime of extraordinary work in the public and\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\nprivate sectors, he has been the driving force behind the exemplary \nrenaissance of Harlem.\n  Simply put, Percy Sutton is a commendable American, who never stopped \nbelieving in the promise of our Nation, that all men are created equal \nand endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, even when \nlegally sanctioned discrimination held him down. By dint of his talent, \nhard work, optimism and faith in the possibility of America, he became \nthe perfect embodiment of the transformation of America from a separate \nand unequal place to a more perfect union.\n  Percy is an intellectual of the first order who worked at a New York \npost office to put himself through law school. Therefore, naming the \npost office in his honor, in his beloved Harlem--a community he has \ndone so much for--is a perfect tribute to this prominent American.\n  The youngest of 15 children, Percy Sutton was born on November 24, \n1920, in San Antonio, TX. His parents were both educators, and his \nfather went on to become one of the first African American principals \nin the Nation. All of his siblings graduated from college, and his \nbrothers include the first black elected official in San Antonio and a \njudge on the New York Supreme Court.\n  Percy Sutton attended Prairie View A University, Tuskegee \nInstitute, and the Hampton Institute. His public service career began \nwhen Sutton served with the now legendary Tuskegee Airmen in World War \nII, winning combat stars as an intelligence officer. Despite being \nbarred from flying fighter planes for the Army Air Corps because of his \nrace, he remained committed to serving his country. After an honorable \ndischarge from the Army, he enrolled in Brooklyn Law School. During \nthis time, he worked for the U.S. Post Office in New York as a clerk \nduring the evening shift and later as a conductor in the New York City \nsubway system to put himself through school.\n  Motivated to fight racial discrimination, upon finishing law school \nSutton become an important civil rights advocate. His commitment to \nfight for justice and equality lead him to become a well-known \nattorney, representing Malcolm X and other activists during the civil \nrights era. Sutton also served as president of the New York chapter of \nthe NAACP.\n  Percy has also been a pillar in Harlem and New York politics. A \nleader of the Harlem political scene, he worked with Mayor David \nDinkins, Congressman Charles Rangel, and former New York Secretary of \nState Basil Paterson to create a lasting force for effective community \nrepresentation at the local, State and national levels. In 1964, Sutton \nwas elected to the New York State Assembly, where he served for 2 years \nbefore becoming the president for the Borough of Manhattan for 10 \nyears, when that office was at the center of gravity of New York City's \npolicymaking apparatus.\n  His strong ties to Harlem can be further seen in the historic Apollo \nTheatre, which he purchased and completely revitalized in 1980. Sutton \nalso produced ``It's Showtime at the Apollo.'' Today, as Harlem \nthrives, the Apollo Theatre remains a cornerstone of the community. \nSutton also started the Inner City Broadcasting Company, home of the \nfirst African American owned radio station in New York. Through it all, \nPercy was a trail blazer in the extraordinary transformation of Harlem. \nWhile victory has many fathers and mothers, no one person has done \nmore, for more time, or more effectively to realize this vision, than \nPercy Sutton.\n  Percy Sutton's impact on his community and his country is \nimmeasurable. Renaming the post office building in Harlem, the \nneighborhood for which he has done so much, the Percy Sutton Post \nOffice is a perfect tribute to this special man.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 954) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/11/senate-section/article/S11460-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2007\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.
